I'm no shoot 'em up nutter - or "shmutter", as I understand they prefer to be called - but some of the first games I remember playing are shmups. Games like Maelstrom, Ambrosia's Macintosh clone of Asteroids, and the proto-shmup <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/497510/Crystal_Quest_Classic/">Crystal Quest</a> from Patrick Buckland, who would go onto make Carmageddon. Little did I know that the humble premise of a small 2D spacecraft shooting baddies on a wrap-around screen would reach the glittering heights of Nova Drift. Had you shown me this game back in 1995, I dare say I'd have shmupped myself.

That "glittering heights" line is a touch premature, admittedly, not to say wildly unprofessional. I haven't yet played Nova Drift - it popped up on my radar when it left early access just yesterday. But it does look very good, and the launch Steam reviewer verdicts are highly favourable. The broad premise is that it combines the immediacy of a shmup with the build-crafting aspect of an ARPG, and a touch of roguelite progression. You command "an endlessly evolving bio-mechanical ship", with hundreds of modules and upgrades to choose from as you "ride the wake of a dying star across the void".</p>
<p>Evidently sensing the panic of players for whom the likes of Path Of Exile are a life-shattering commitment, the developers - that's designer Jeffrey Nielson of Chimeric, with Miles Tilmann of publisher Pixeljam Games on music and sound - emphasise that the upgrade and experimentation loop is quick. "Unlike many action-RPGs which can absorb hundreds of hours of time, Nova Drift allows you to take a ship build from inception to execution in a single game session," they explain.
</p>
<p>
In one run, you might turn your vessel into a battering ram with shields that explode when overloaded, and a burning aura that scales with your velocity. In another run, you might layer up grenade and shrapnel mods to form a fearsome piece of astral artillery, peeling off rounds that detonate into scores of homing projectiles. Individual ship pieces and powers listed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/858210/Nova_Drift/">the Steam page</a> include Leviathan, which turns your ship into an "ever-growing serpent", and Sanctuary, which converts your shields into a free-roaming bubble that buffs you while you're inside it. There are carrier ship hulls that let you spawn drone allies, and anti-matter bullets that chew through enemy fire.
</p>
<p>
It's saying something about a game's selection of verbs when the ability to teleport strikes you as pedestrian. Pff, why would I do anything as homely as travelling instantaneously from one place to another, when I could be an "ever-growing serpent"? Again, though, these are my impressions going in. I'm not in the habit of recommending stuff I haven't played, but I'm going to gamble on this being decent enough to retrospectively justify all this fulsome praise. You can also find Nova Drift on <a href="https://pixeljam.itch.io/nova-drift">Itch.io</a>, if you'd rather not truck with Valve's gargantuan Content emporium. For those who've been playing already, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/858210/view/4335363098093354939">here are the 1.0 release notes</a>.

                <p>The Borderlands movie has been a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-movie-is-a-huge-flop-over-first-weekend/1100-6525706/">commercial and critical disappointment</a> since it launched last week, but as a possible side-effect, there has been a spike in interest in the video games. Possibly driven by cinemagoers looking to experience the source material, Borderlands 3 has seen a moderate increase in users and has reached its highest concurrent Steam player count since February 2023. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/397540/charts/#1y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to SteamDB</a>, the game recently peaked at 12,379 players, which is a big increase compared to previous months.</p><p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/49520/charts/#1y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Borderlands 2</a> also fared better--7,938 peak Steam players recently--and while they're nowhere near as high, the original <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/8980/charts/#1y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/261640/charts/#1y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Borderlands: The </a><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/261640/charts/#1y" rel="nofollow ">Pre-Sequel </a>games have also seen increased activity. As mentioned above, this is only for the Steam version of the Borderlands games, so the final results are likely even higher when you factor in users from the Epic Games Store, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, and PS4.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Lore of Borderlands Explained</p>
      </div>
<p>Interestingly, Gearbox added a new feature to Borderlands 3 that allows you to skip the entire main campaign with a new character, provided that you have a max-level character and have beaten the campaign once.</p><p>This allows you to jump straight into the Borderlands 3 endgame with a new max-level character, and is a welcome quality-of-life update considering that it can take dozens of hours to max out a single Vault Hunter in the game. If you'd been wanting to try out other characters but were put off by the thought of repeating the polarizing campaign--which probably looks much better in comparison to the film's story--this is a nice option to help you jump back into action.</p><p>At GameSpot, our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-movie-review-generic-and-disposable/1900-6418265/">Borderlands movie review</a> scored it a 2/10, calling it an "unremarkable" and "disposable" experience. Other critics have been much harsher, as some of them have described Borderlands as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-movie-reviews-call-it-miserable-failure-fun-and-generic/1100-6525625/">a "miserable failure" and "generic."</a></p>

We will go through the techniques we used to implement hand tracking and go over the challenges that we faced with the shader and audio systems. By sharing our experience, we hope to see more great fully immersive titles come to the visionOS platform.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="30hz hand tracking in a 90hz game">30hz hand tracking in a 90hz game</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Arguably the biggest challenge we faced during the entire production of this port was compensating for hand tracking updating at 30hz. Both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Job Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vacation Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are deeply interactive experiences. Updating hand poses only once every three frames had a few consequences when we initially began work on these ports. Grabbing and throwing objects was almost impossible. Hand velocity would be over-exaggerated, causing destructible objects such as plates to break in our hands. We'd also routinely lose tracking when looking away from the hands. Our titles were unplayable, and it was unclear when there would be an update, so our team set out to solve our hand tracking issues with what was available then.</span></p><p>Images via Owlchemy Labs.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Senior gameplay engineer Greg Tamargo reflects on smoothing out hand tracking with extrapolation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Due to hand tracking updating at 30hz while the rest of the game updated at 90hz, for every frame containing hand pose data, there would be at least two frames with no updated data at all. Because of this, we had to modify the Unity XR VisionOS package to tell us whether or not data was "fresh" or "stale" and compensate accordingly. We found that simply covering up "stale" frames by blending between the most recent "fresh" hand poses was too slow and felt unresponsive, so we opted to use extrapolation to predict where the hands were going to be while estimating where the next "fresh" hand pose would be before it happened. Anyone who has experience with programming online multiplayer games might be familiar with this technique. By keeping track of at least two recent fresh hand poses, we can calculate a velocity and angular velocity and use those to infer what the pose might be, given how much time has passed from the most recent frame of fresh data. Implementing this created a massive improvement to the functionality and feel of the game. It's also worth noting that by keeping track of additional frames of fresh hand data, we can create more complex extrapolations to predict where the next hand pose data will be, but when we implemented this, it wasn't immediately obvious whether this actually improved the game feel any further. Regardless, simply implementing this pose extrapolation on the hand's wrist poses made a massive improvement. When we attempted to continue this approach with the rest of the hand data to smooth out the movement of each individual finger, the results were much less promising. So, we decided to try something else to smooth out the poses of all the finger joints.</span></p><p>Images via Owlchemy Labs.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Expert system engineer and handtracking specialist, Marc Huet, gives some insight in the decisions we made regarding poses.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the hand poses themselves, we wanted to avoid the possibility of creating unnatural poses, so we tried to work with real pose data from the device as much as possible instead of generating our own.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To address the low frequency of updates, we introduced a delay so we could interpolate joint rotations between the two most recent poses while we waited for the next one. To make sure this delay didn't negatively affect gameplay, we only use the most recently received pose when detecting actions like "grab" and "release," while the smoothed pose is reserved for presentation through the hand model.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also took a conservative approach to filling in gaps when individual joints lose tracking. Instead of attempting to create new data for the missing joint with IK, we copy the missing parent-child relationships from the previous pose while leaving all parent-child relationships down the chain intact (see graphic).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both of these techniques were made significantly easier by storing and working with joint orientations relative to the parent joint instead of relative to the wrist or world origin.</span></p><p>Images via Owlchemy Labs.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Apple has since announced that they will be supporting 90hz hands in the VisionOS 2.0 update, and we will be sure to update our content when that update goes live.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Building shaders and jokes">Building shaders and jokes</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity compiles and caches shaders the first time they are displayed. This compilation causes brief framerate hitches, which is unacceptable on spatial platforms since it causes motion sickness. Due to the spatial nature of the VisionOS, there are some restrictions that require us to rethink how and when we can build shaders. VisionOS requires its applications to draw a frame every two seconds or else the app will be terminated; this makes sense in a spatial environment where users may have multiple applications running, but in a game, it is common to hide shader builds during loading sequences. With the two-second restriction, we were unable to use the standard shader building procedure, so we had to develop a new method from scratch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our principal graphics engineer, Ben Hopkins, led the way on our solution. To correctly build shaders, we needed to have every unique vertex layout and shader variant that would then be rendered once at a time, off-screen, during the boot-up sequence. In order to do this, we developed a simple tool that would collect and log vertex layouts from every mesh in the game. These logs would be fed into our warm-up system, where players would encounter one big shader warm-up the first time they ran </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vacation Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The sequence would dynamically create a quad for each vertex layout and cycle our shader variants through each one of them. It is admittedly a painful three to four minutes before it completes, so we tried to soften the experience a bit with the very best jokes the port team could write in one hour to keep the player occupied. Once the shaders are built the game will subsequently boot up instantaneously.</span></p><p>Images via Owlchemy Labs.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Spatialization">Spatialization</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Daniel Perry, audio director for Owlchemy Labs, explains how we were able to solve the audio issues for our visionOS ports.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The biggest challenge we needed to solve in audio is that Fully Immersive mode did not have access to the Apple Spatializer in Unity, and spatialized audio is crucial for our experiences to be able to bring out the environment and create a vivid and responsive soundfield. We needed to find a solution that would be compatible with the architecture of both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Job Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vacation Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Apple has PHASE (Physical Audio Spatialization Engine) that works with Unity, but using it would require significant changes to our audio flow, including routing, processing, and file loading features.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Currently, the market is still low on spatializer solutions for Unity, and most of the existing ones don't support the VisionOS.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Resonance Audio spatializer is open source and multi-platform but it had low maintenance for some time, and had not been compiled for VisionOS. Fortunately, because the source is available, we were able to modify it so that it could be built for the VisionOS.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because of Resonance's limited routing approach, we had to create a custom solution for Reverb. For performance reasons on mobile platforms, we always used a minimal amount of simple reverb algorithms with presets for the different rooms and environments, and different audio mixer groups to sum effects in the game. While we couldn't replicate all effects in the chain of the audio mixer groups, it was crucial to maintain the general atmosphere and feel of the world, and so we created our own solution of a pre-spatialized send/receive system that sends audio from all audiosources to summed streaming audio sources that then are sent to a non-spatialized reverb AudioMixer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While it is not the ideal order of processing, it allowed us to use Resonance and still get some similar abilities for groups post-processing, and maintain a general similarity to our game in other platforms, while maintaining optimized audio processing performance. Resonance ended up being a bit more compatible with how our audio system is structured.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we began porting to the Apple Vision Pro, we had no idea if the issues preventing us from launching would be solved in one month or one year, but we knew that we wanted to be there as early as possible. Apple shares our passion for hand tracking-only experiences, as we feel that they are more approachable for a mainstream audience. Due to our ability to create our own tools to address some of our issues, our titles were able to launch on Apple Vision Pro months before the VisionOS 2.0 update. We are proud of the work we've done bringing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Job Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vacation Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to VisionOS and are excited for new players to experience our award-winning titles.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-reaches-one-million-steam-wishlists/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Delta Force: Hawk Ops has hit a huge milestone and has officially reached one million wishlists on Steam. Currently, there is an exclusive Alpha test in which players can participate if they are chosen in the selection. They will have to register their interest to get in and experience the game, but we daresay that the alpha testing contributes to the number of wishlists.</p>
<p>Delta Force has been a long-standing game franchise, with the first release being in 1998. It has been in the hands of plenty of developers and is now more recently in the hands of Team Jade and TiMi Studios. This is the first game that they have ever developed for PC. It's high stakes for them, as the franchise is beloved by many, with many fans also watching hesitantly to see if Delta Force: Hawk Ops will be up to scratch. TiMi Studios has worked on Call of Duty: Mobile, which will give them some leverage when developing this title.</p>
<p>In a<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/were-not-focused-on-revenue-how-team-jade-is-making-delta-force-hawk-ops-a-player-first-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> previous interview</a> with Jordan Middler from VGC, Publishing Director Jessica Zhang said that what comes first is "player satisfaction." Delta Force: Hawk Ops will be a free-to-play tactical shooter featuring large-scale multiplayer modes and a jam-packed single-player or co-op campaign, depending on how you want to play it.</p>
<p>"We're not super focused on revenue; it's not a factor we take into consideration. We feel that if we establish a good rapport with the community, we feel the player will be the best judge of that."</p>
<p>Compared to some of the previous games in the franchise, Delta Force: Hawk Ops is shaping up to be rather ambitious. For example, players will experience a 32vs32 game mode titled Havoc Warfare. Those who have their hands on the Alpha test experience this as they play through the game.</p>

<p>Many of the development team's members, including Tencent seniors, have mentioned fond memories of playing this game in internet cafes, which may help bolster their morale as they develop the game. Compared to Asia, Delta Force: Hawk Ops wasn't as successful in the Western world, but it holds a lot of sentiment and nostalgia for players over in Asia, as this was one of the more widely available games to play.</p>
<p>The Alpha test is available for Delta Force: Hawk Ops for a couple more days, where by the end of it, opinions are bound to be formed, and we may see the game hit even more milestones, reaching over a million wishlists in the future.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/owlcat-publishing-rpgs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pathfinder-and-warhammer-rpg-developer-owlcat-enters-publishing.951981/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/owlcat-publishing-rpgs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader&nbsp;</em>developer Owlcat Games has officially entered the publishing space, and it's already signed deals with two up-and-coming RPG developers.</p>
<p>Per a press release, Owlcat's first two projects as a publisher will be Emotion Spark Studio's&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>and Another Angle Games'&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, both of which are fairly traditional-looking RPGs coming at the genre from different angles.</p>
<p><em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>looks like it takes some pretty heavy cues from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disco-elysium"><em>Disco Elysium</em></a>; it's a narrative-heavy RPG in which a man dealing with psychological challenges becomes trapped in a mysterious time loop. What are the chances it's all in his head?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rue-valley-owlcat-publishing.jpg?itok=RfZWq977 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rue-valley-owlcat-publishing.jpg?itok=Bn1-wjHS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of Owlcat's first two publishing projects is&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>-style narrative RPG&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>will allow you to shape your character's personality as you play, and you'll unlock "intentions and mindsets" as you progress through the game. That&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>influence really is shining through, eh?</p>
<p>If you're looking for a more traditional combat-centric RPG, then&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road&nbsp;</em>is probably where you'll want to apply. The Japan-set RPG melds tactical battling with a steampunk-infused interpretation of feudal Japan that also happens to be overrun with magical yokai.</p>
<p>You'll face off against "implacable samurai", "bizarre yokai", and "relentless steampunk mercenaries" in&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, and you'll also be able to decide whether you want to play as a noble ronin or a traitorous warrior.</p>
<p>Owlcat says that both of these games are currently "in the early stages of development", but that we'll learn more about both of them later this month at Gamescom. Exciting stuff!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-of-the-road-owlcat-publishing.jpg?itok=Zlps4p-p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-of-the-road-owlcat-publishing.jpg?itok=liE3jpNj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shadow of the Road&nbsp;</em>looks to be a decidedly more combat-heavy experience than&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as entering publishing, Owlcat has also announced that it's gained control of publishing label META Publishing, which was partly responsible for publishing&nbsp;<em>Wrath of the Righteous&nbsp;</em>on both PC and consoles. We'll get to find out more about what META (not to be confused with Mark Zuckerberg's Meta) later this month too.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Owlcat.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nba-2k25-mynba-and-mygm-features-revealed.951972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k25-mynba-and-mygm-features-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>2K Sports held its <a href="https://nba.2k.com/2k25/courtside-report/mynba/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest deep dive</a> for NBA 2K25 on Tuesday, going into details on the game’s MyNBA and MyGM mode. This year’s game doesn’t feature the massive changes as some years have featured, but it does include a few updates to talk about.</p>



<h2 id="h-mynba">MyNBA</h2>



<p>New to NBA 2K25 MyNBA is a new era called the “Curry Era” that has you start from the 2016-2017 season. They’ve also revamped the expansion and contraction system in the game. Now players are able to go into any era and have anywhere from 12-36 teams, allowing them to build the NBA in their image.</p>



<p>Regarding The NBA Cup, there is more integration into the league this year after its debut for the 2023-24 season. The NBA Cup will also support the number of teams you have in your league no matter how many or few you have.</p>



<p>For those that enjoyed the Ranked mode from prior games, it’s been moved to MyGM.</p>



<p>“If you get fired by your Governor, it’s game over,” 2K Sports said.</p>



<p>Lastly, with how news is delivered, it will change throughout the different eras no matter where you start. It’s not much, but a small touch to add to the feeling of the era you are currently in. </p>



<h2 id="h-mygm">MyGM</h2>



<p>With MyGM, the developers at 2K Sports are going all in on the RPG elements within the mode. From starting with picking your backstory for your MyGM to choosing your perks that help build up your GM’s skills, there is more control than ever before within the mode.</p>



<p>Speaking of GM perks, there are six categories that perks fall into that will help you on your career. For example, you could have a perk called Hot Streak that increases your players’ attributes by 3 when you are on a 3-game winning streak. Another perk under the Analytics tree called Data Analyst could give you more information after each scouting trip.</p>



<p>Overall, there are 55 perks to unlock at launch. More will be added throughout the year.</p>



<p>One new feature that may not get the best reaction to players is the ability to walk around your offices as GM. This will allow you to walk around to have conversations with people within your organization as opposed to them being fed to you via a menu. </p>



<p>This new MyGM Building is “a free-roaming space where you take control of your MyGM to carry out responsibilities as the brains of the team.”</p>



<p>Regarding how you handle your staff, NBA 2K25 has “streamlined” how you manage and hire your staff. In fact, NBA 2K25 reduces the number of positions you can hire and manage. Now you just have to hire Governor, GM, Assistant GM, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Head Coach, Head Scout and Team Doctor. That’s just seven compared to the 17.</p>



<p>Replacing the rest of the staff management is the new “Bonus Staff”. </p>



<p>“Bonus Staff are an easy way to boost the performance of a department without having to micromanage hiring and firing the extra staff,” 2K Sports said. “Want to make a big push in the playoffs? Move the bonus staff to the Head Coach. Trying to cash in on a ton of draft picks? Move the bonus staff to the Head Scout.”</p>

		<p>You just can’t keep a zombie game down, can you? Much like the undead that have invaded the land of the living, it feels almost inevitable that zombie games will spawn sequels, no matter how long and arduous the development becomes, receive lavish remakes and reimaginings, or at the very least end up firmly lodged in the games industry discourse for several years.</p>
<p>Launching on the 18th anniversary of the Willamette Incident, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> is the latest in a slew of zombie games that are clawing themselves back into the public eye. We’re absolutely here for it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster – Director’s Report" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mP5jIX87-lA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Capcom has shown a mastery of classic game remakes over the past half decade, through the excellent reimagining of earlier parts of the Resident Evil series. Resi 2 and 3 were given a complete makeover with modern third-person gameplay at their core, and while Resi 4 was closer to the original in that it already featured third-person camera, there was still plenty of space for modernising the controls and feel of the game.</p>
<p>You could argue that Dead Rising, by contrast, doesn’t need anywhere near as much work to feel like a contemporary game. Coming out in the first year of the Xbox 360’s life, the sandbox setting and gameplay, the number of zombies being shown on screen, the menagerie of silly and playful ways to kill them, and the generally tongue-in-cheek tone all play well close to two decades later. Perhaps that’s why so much of this has been kept intact for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, though I’d still argue that branding this as a remaster, deluxe or otherwise, is a huge misnomer.</p>

<p>For one thing, this is just as much of a remake as Resi 4 was. The game has been reconstructed within RE Engine, all of the character models have been remade, the shopping mall has been given a major spruce up and large parts of the environment redesigned, and there’s plenty of other tweaks and changes throughout. The core gameplay might be practically the same, but this is a remake through and through.</p>

<p>With this being a remake, Capcom has been able to go through and make several quality-of-life improvements throughout. The 72-hour in-game time limit and constantly ticking clock for missions remain, but if you find yourself stuck for things to do – let’s say you just want to race through the story and ignore rescuing survivors – then you can skip time back at base. Saving is similar, in that manual saves will still need you to nip to the loos dotted around the mall, but an autosave system will trigger as you go between areas and at key story moments, so you don’t have to retrace your steps anywhere near as much if you die. Oh, and radio calls and dialogue won’t be interrupted when being attacked or performing certain actions anymore, and all the dialogue is now voiced, so even Otis has a voice! Then there’s durability indicators in the UI to show the state of your weapons, and plenty more besides.</p>
<p>They’re all honestly great improvements to see, just rounding off the edges of the zombie-bashing original. This was my very first time playing the first Dead Rising – I had a fun time with the PC release of Dead Rising 3 –&nbsp;and the autosave in particular let me just barrel straight into the mess of zombies with barely a care in the world, wholeheartedly embracing the silliness of the zombie-bashing action.</p>

<p>You’re clued in on some of the game’s irreverent tone from the helicopter-based opening, as Frank gets a ride into town and snaps photos of what’s supposedly local rioting from the air. The camera is a constant companion through the game – Frank’s running animations always have him clutching the camera to his chest to keep it safe – and you can always switch to the viewfinder and snap a quick photo, while this remake is bringing new photo filters to add more creativity. Each photo, though, is immediately rated to judge the number of subjects in view, highlight any particular moments of action, like a zombie head exploding, judge the theme, like the comedic value of zombies with bear costume heads slapped on them, and then spit out a score.</p>
<p>Inevitably, I would keep forgetting to try and take photos, instead focussing on the opening day of the game’s 72-hour story, and just messing with the throngs of zombies that shamble around the shopping centre. There’s a simple joy to discovering what’s possible, quickly nipping into a shop to grab things off shelves to use as weapons, some of which are pleasant surprises. It took a moment for me to realise that the golf club isn’t just a melee weapon, but can line up a drive to power a golf ball into a zombie’s noggin, while throwing a pie at a zombie is just wonderfully satisfying for the cream that splatters across their head and blinds them, or you can ride a skateboard through the throngs of enemies. Oh, and I mustn’t forget about the lawnmower, or even just Frank’s eventual ability to decapitate zombies with a backflip kick!</p>

<p>It’s even goofier if you do all this in costume. Naturally, you can still pick up some new kicks and clothes off the racks of clothing stores, but there’s a bunch of new costumes, such as the oversized bee mascot, with antennae that will happily clip through scenery during cutscenes. The Deluxe Remaster’s digital deluxe edition – as if the game name wasn’t deluxe enough – will also bundle in some extras with the obligatory RPD uniform, the bizarre horror of a blood-splattered bunny, the long-tongued licker, and more.</p>
<p>On the surface level, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster just gives the 18-year-old game a fresh lick of paint, but as I’ve said plenty times already, there’s a fair bit more going on here than that. We’re just over a month away from the full release and, since I never played the original, I’m looking forward to diving in for more of the mid-2000s zombie-bashing shenanigans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mother-machine-preview-chaos-gremlins-reign-supreme<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Maschien-Mensch has announced their new multiplayer roguelite platformer hybrid, <em><a href="https://maschinen-mensch.com/">Mother Machine</a></em>. This indie developer from Berlin will be most known to fans for their previous titles<em> Curious Expedition</em> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8eb1ab91-9e37-45c6-9c56-1ac5757fb54e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/curious-expedition-2"><em>Curious Expedition 2</em></a>, <em>Mother Machine</em> takes their development journey in an entirely new direction.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago TechRaptor was invited to join the team for a behind-closed-doors reveal of their game including an extended live gameplay session run by members of the Maschien-Mensch team.</p>
<p><em>Mother Machine</em> takes place in a distant future on an alien planet. Humans abandoned the titular AI supercomputer, Mother Machine, but existence alone is driving her insane. As a solution to this problem, <em>Mother Machine</em> creates life in the form of Chaos Gremlins and sets them to explore the world.</p>

<p><em>Mother Machine</em> is a multiplayer roguelite where players take on the role of a Chaos Gremlin, created by the titular <em>Mother Machine</em>. As a Chaos Gremlin you and up to three of your friends get to explore a procedurally-generated tunnel system.</p>
<p>Each Gremlin has the base ability to run, jump, mine crystals, and climb so that they can make their way through each of the game's levels. Along the way, the aim is to collect the crystals and bring them back to their base or spend them throughout the level for a variety of upgrades.</p>
<p>With these crystals, you can mutate your Chaos Gremlin. In our time watching the game in action, we saw that some Gremlins were able to create projectiles out of burps or secrete a substance to make climbing easier.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mother-machine-climbing.jpg?itok=5ixiMjmb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mother-machine-climbing.jpg?itok=MqXSh2yq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We got to see how each of these mutations would facilitate a different kind of playstyle. If you didn't want enemies to bother you as much then making sure you were an offensive style Gremlin could mean you would need to worry less if enemies appeared, alternatively, if you want to make sure no rock goes unturned making sure you can climb anywhere can mean you might be able to come back to base with even more crystals.</p>
<p>The ability to specialize your Gremlins differently was also a key aspect of why playing this game is meant to be more fun with other players. With two or even three Gremlins suddenly roles begin to form with offensive Gremlins taking the lead while others explore for crystals when the coast is clear.</p>
<p>Watching the devs from Maschinen-Mensch play the game there were requests for assistance from one another for additional support in a variety of different activities. It was fun to see this kind of collaborative discussion, and also just how that collaboration paid off as the pack was able to move together.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mother-machine-enemies.jpg?itok=7hs751Gx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mother-machine-enemies.jpg?itok=nawwCyWb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The real star of what little we saw of the game was the alien landscape that the game is set in. The Gremlins alone are strange and alien but once you start to look at all of the different flora and fauna that appear during escalation you begin to understand just how weird this world is.</p>
<p>There were some moments where animations performed strangely at angles, and the spread of fluids like those from the projectiles spread onto the environments in a strange way but we were informed that with the release date still in 2025 there was still plenty of time to polish the game further.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mother-machine-world-view.jpg?itok=ZLQsvA0K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mother-machine-world-view.jpg?itok=jG36z7Bs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Mother Machine</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>What the team at Maschinen-Mensch is working on was a lot of fun to see for the short time we were able to see it. While it's definitely a large departure in gameplay from their previous titles it looks like they've been able to take a lot about what they've learned in the realm of roguelite and procedurally generated gameplay and apply the formula here.</p>
<p>From the gameplay, we saw there's definitely some rough around the edges going on, but the core gameplay loop seemed appealing especially as part of a group of friends.</p>
<p>Some elements that we didn't get to learn much about were the underlying story and what Mother Machine's true intentions are, or just how crazy you can get with the mutations on your Chaos Gremlins.</p>
<p>This will be a title to keep an eye on as we head into 2025.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/archiact_archiacts-journey-is-coming-to-a-close-activity-7228922392360722434-ILGR/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on its official LinkedIn page</a>, Archiact said that it informed its staff of the studio's closure yesterday. The company will officially close its doors in two weeks, according to the post.</p>
<p>Archiact goes on to trace an outline of its journey from inception to closure. The studio was started in 2013 and was involved with publishing more than 35 games, as well as developing VR and mixed reality titles itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/archiact-shutting-down-journey-to-foundation.jpg?itok=lp7ZDRAV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/archiact-shutting-down-journey-to-foundation.jpg?itok=Hs7fXwJb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Archiact worked on games like&nbsp;<em>Journey to Foundation</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Doom 3</em>'s VR port and&nbsp;<em>Journey to Foundation</em>, other VR games Archiact worked on include "augmented reality experience"&nbsp;<em>Marvel Dimension of Heroes</em>, VR diving game&nbsp;<em>Freediver: Triton Down</em>, and "sci-fi bullet-hell shooter"&nbsp;<em>Evasion</em>.</p>
<p>Sadly, this isn't the first we've heard of Archiact experiencing some problems. Back in January, Archiact <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-and-archiact-hit-by-layoffs">laid off an undisclosed number of staff</a>, a decision the studio said was not taken lightly.</p>
<p>Archiact's closure is part of a wider trend in the industry right now, one that involves a lot of layoffs and studio closures across both the triple-A and indie spaces. It seems that no studio, however successful, is safe from the swinging scythe of this wave of layoffs.</p>
<p>Other smaller indie studios hit by layoffs or closures include&nbsp;<em>I Am Bread&nbsp;</em>developer Bossa,&nbsp;<em>Palia&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-developer-singularity-6-layoffs">Singularity 6</a>&nbsp;(which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-singularity-6-daybreak-acquisition">recently acquired by MMO giant Daybreak</a>), and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs"><em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developer ZA/UM</a>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-layoffs-archiact.jpg?itok=lRdBrdre 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-layoffs-archiact.jpg?itok=9mlw8qb9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Archiact is far from the only studio to have been hit by layoffs or closures recently.</figcaption></figure><p>On the industry's AAA side, studios hit by layoffs and closures recently include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees"><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie</a>, its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">parent company Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-layoffs-share-buyback">EA</a>, again among many others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reasons for these layoffs are far-reaching; some studios can't get funding for in-development projects, while others are being mismanaged or are dealing with overhiring as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>One thing's for sure, though; we haven't heard the last of this wave of industry layoffs and studio closures yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>As long-time readers will know, I'm a piteous mark for weird little game guys. I’m currently trying to puzzle out what the titular <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mother-machine">Mother Machine</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-curious-expedition">The Curious Expedition</a> studio Maschinen-Mensch’s upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> refers to. But, if it’s a reference to forming a parental bond with what the game has saw-me-comingishly named “chaos gremlins”, I'm way ahead of you.</p>
<p>Ah, the press release speaketh! Probably should have read some more before I began exclaiming “Chaos Gremlins!” over and over. Have an announcement trailer.</p>

<p>And here's the deep gremlin lore: </p>
<blockquote><p>Set thousands of years in the future, Mother Machine takes place on a distant planet once colonised by humans but since abandoned. Left behind by her creators, an Artificial Intelligence faced a problem: without a purpose, she needed to find a way to protect her digital mind from breaking under the burden of being forever alone. Her solution was to create a creature that she could take care of. True rascals, with an affinity for mischief and chaos, these little gremlins were bioengineered by their mother to withstand and survive a harsh alien environment. 3D-printed from organic filament by their godlike Mother Machine, these creatures are tasked to collect and explore a vast cave network of a mysterious alien planet, brimming with biodiversity and peculiar life-forms — but the further the gremlins venture, the more they find out about the dark secrets of the planet’s history, and the true ambitions of their mechanical mother.</p></blockquote>
<p>They are literally, canonically, emotional support Chaos Gremlins. Brilliant. Mother Machine lets you enlist up to three mates in drop-in co-op to aid you. The more gremlins, the higher the levels of “both chaos and competition.” It also sounds like they’ll be a dynamic difficulty system: “balanced co-op mechanics allow expert players to join together with novices.” Platforming looks to be front-and-centre, but Maschinen-Mensch also refer to Mother Machine an an action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. Sounds like this manifests in mutation skill trees, which let you alter and improve your gremlin’s abilities.</p>
<p>The game also boasts “endlessly replayable generative levels,” although what this means in context, I’m not sure. For all the fun in the trailer, I am left uncertain of how Mother Machine will be structured, or even what goals your troupe of disaster lizards are out to accomplish. The trailer above shows one gremlin farting on another. I’d inquire about the practical applications of such an ability, but I think that might be missing the point. It does look good though. Similar appeal to co-op physics sandboxes, I think, just with a good deal more intention and sinew holding it together - enough so that I'd likely still be interested in playing it solo. It's out sometime in 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Developer Maschinen-Mensch has revealed Mother Machine, a co-op action-platformer with RPG elements.

The studio also says it has been influenced by several games while developing Mother Machine, like Spelunky, the Oddworld series, and Helldivers 2.</p><p>While your gremlin's base set of skills will allow them run, climb, and leap through these replayable levels, you can also experiment with a vast range of mutations that are geared toward specific playstyles. Players can use swipe-attacks, healing farts, and weaponized burps to knock out any enemies they come across.</p><p>Together, players will be able to discover more resources and secrets the deeper they venture into the strange planet. And if they meet an untimely end? Mother can always 3D print a fresh batch mischievous science experiments to carry on the mission and achieve its dark ambition.</p><p>Mother Machine is scheduled to launch in 2025 for PC.</p>

I doubt it, but I’ll never stop trying.</p><p>I love stealth games: their thoughtful pace, their attention to their environment, all those key codes and alternate routes being loudly shouted by NPCs in public places. The holy grail of stealth game runs, to me, is getting in and out as if you were never there. Many modern stealth games push you toward these kinds of runs: For <em>Dishonored </em>and <em>Dishonored 2</em>, there are the “Ghost” and “Clean Hands” achievements for never being detected and never killing anyone. <em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em> has “Pacifist” for not killing anyone, and “Foxiest of the Hounds” for never setting off any alarms. And then there’s the gold standard of any <em>Hitman</em> run: the “Suit Only/Silent Assassin,” or SASO, run, for only killing targets, hiding all bodies, and never getting spotted, all without donning a disguise.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m midway through this kind of run in every game I mentioned above. As I type this, my Corvo Attano is perched on a lamppost on his way to kidnap Anton Sokolov, and my Emily Kaldwin is just outside the Clockwork Mansion, gearing up to evade all those automatons. Lord knows where I left Adam Jensen– probably in a vent. I’ve SASOed <em>Hitman</em>’s Paris and Sapienza with ease, but I’ve never done it in other missions. I’ve played all these games for dozens of hours (Steam tells me I have 125 hours in <em>DX:HR</em>, and that’s not including the Director’s Cut that makes the boss fights more possible with a stealth build), and many of those hours have been spent painstakingly save-scumming my way through a level.</p><p>There’s a pleasure in games like <em>Dishonored</em> and <em>Hitman</em> in blowing your cover and just going full chaos (<a href="https://aftermath.site/hitman-freelancer-the-best-kind-of-hitman-is-more-hitman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hitman Freelancer</em></a> lends itself especially well to this, since you only get one shot anyway), but you can’t do that in a perfect stealth run. Instead, you have to move slowly and methodically and stressfully. In <em>Dishonored 2</em>, a game I hadn’t spent much time in before attempting a perfect stealth run, it took me hours to complete the first mission. I’d dart from a corner to behind a box, save, then dart to a light fixture and save again. I remember one hallway in the Addermire Institute where I kept getting spotted by two guards, the familiar zinging strings of the alerted sound playing over and over as I reloaded. I had to eschew many of the fun side objectives and exploration in pursuit of a single-minded goal, one that doesn’t matter at all but that I <em>want</em> so badly.</p><p>Some of these games add the complication that characters you pacify can be discovered or die after you’ve left an area. I’ve thought I’ve aced a level, only for <em>Dishonored</em>’s ending stat screen to make me realize a hastily-hidden body got eaten by rats, or someone woke up a <em>Hitman</em> character I’d left in a hallway I thought no one came down. The stress of the perfect run never ends until you know, 100%, that you’re in the clear. And then you have to do it all over again in <em>another</em> level, and <em>another</em>, until you’ve turned a 10-hour game into a 30-hour one.&nbsp;</p><p>All told, it’s not actually a very <em>fun</em> way to play. But still! It feels so good to work so hard at a level, to learn its layout so intimately, to make little encounters so much more convoluted or complicated when you can’t use many of the tools a game offers you. I get to see a new side of all the craft that goes into every piece of a stealth game’s level design, exploring exactly how NPCs or objects are placed. I remember that cursed hallway in <em>Dishonored 2</em>’s Addermire Institute much better than I remember the level’s actual target, because it was a site of such drama, one that was personal to me and my playthrough. Who can be disappointed in <em>Deus Ex</em>’s boss fights when I have my own boss fight in the form of a guy who won’t walk away from an elevator? <a href="https://kotaku.com/getting-out-alive-is-the-coolest-part-of-hitman-1765069321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leaving a level </a>in my <em>Hitman</em> suit becomes a whole new game when I can’t just beeline for the exit. These full stealth runs might be stealth games at their worst–the save-scumming, the long stretches of sitting still–but they’re also stealth games at their best, full of tension and creativity.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe I’ll get you one day, achievements, but more likely I’ll just keep sighing at your descriptions on my screen, imagining who I could be if I were a little more patient, or had slightly better reflexes, or didn’t entirely forget how to play a video game if I put it down for more than a week. The perfect stealth dream lives, even if I will never live it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new take on Pokemon could be coming soon. According to <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1823123300756914568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DanielRPK</a>, a Pokemon live action series is in development at Netflix.</p>



<p>Details on the rumored series are scarce, however, there is some information on the main premise. The report claims that the show won’t feature Ash Ketchum or a new character as the game’s main protagonist. Instead, the main character of the show will be firs trainer from the history of the series, “Red”.</p>



<p>Whether it’s based on the original game’s story or a completely fresh take remains to be seen.</p>



<p>This obviously wouldn’t be the first live action Pokemon production after Detective Pikachu released in 2019. This would, though, be the first series in a live action environment.</p>
