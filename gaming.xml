Its colorful visuals, myriad gaming references, and excellent platforming have already made it one of 2024's best games. But there’s something else I love about <em>Astro Bot:</em> It only has one release date. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196805" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Hate This FF7 Rebirth Character’s Whole Vibe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="93" data-playlist="196805,195905,196646" data-current="196805"><div><p>I Hate This FF7 Rebirth Character’s Whole Vibe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196805/196805_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22362.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Yesterday, I bought Astro Bot on my PS5 so that I could download it and play it over the weekend. I was relieved to find that while there are two versions of the game, both options have the same release date of September 6. When later that day someone asked me when does<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span><em> </em>come out, I could answer simply: Tomorrow. That’s become less and less common as more and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357">more publishers lock their games behind early access taxes</a></span>. </p><p>In 2024, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675">at least 20 different video games</a></span>—including <em>Space Marine 2, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, </em>and <em>Madden 25</em>—have or will launch with different release dates depending on how much money you are willing to spend. Buying a video game was already a complicated mess, with pre-order bonuses, various editions, and timed exclusivity windows. Now, when talking about new games, I also have to think “Wait, is this out for everyone or just people who pre-ordered some fancy $100 edition?” </p><p>At least one game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-gold-edition/9PD4PSZW2Q9Z/0010/B1GM6CW2358Z&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-gold-edition/9PD4PSZW2Q9Z/0010/B1GM6CW2358Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown</em></a></span>, has even made things more frustrating by offering two different early access options. Pay a bit more and you can play the game two days ahead of launch. Pay even more and you can play 7 days before launch. If you’re quiet, you can literally hear a greedy publisher somewhere counting money, looking at <em>Solar Crown</em>’s nonsense, and thinking “Maybe we can offer <em>three </em>tiers of early access!” </p><p>So that all makes me want to declare just how happy I am that <em>Astro Bot </em>has one release date. It’s weird that in 2024 having a single release date is something worthy of praise, yet here we are. The video game industry has become so addicted to “number go up” and endless growth that a single release date (you know how things have worked for <em>decade</em>) is becoming a rarity and something worth celebrating</p><p>And look, in six months, none of this will matter. The games will all be playable and their early access periods will be a distant memory. (Another reason to not pay extra for this shit.) But it does mean that for most games, the first week or so after launch has become a weird dance online as people try to talk about something that might not be out for everyone.<br></p><p><em>Astro Bot </em>will get to sidestep all of this by not being forcing gamers to pay a ransom fee to play a finished game a few days before others. How nice and just one more reason to love Sony’s new PS5 platformer. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The arms dealer always has a selection of Exotic arms and armor, as well as several Legendary-class pieces in case you're looking for material to make your Guardian look more fashionable in combat. Here's where Xur is this week, and what he has for sale.</p><p>This week, Xur is offering the Exotic weapon catalysts for <strong>Acrius </strong>and <strong>SUROS Regime</strong>, and for Exotic armor, Hunters can pick up <b>Ophidia Spathe</b>; Titans can grab <strong>Mask of the Quiet One</strong>; and Warlocks can buy <strong>Promethium Spur</strong>.

Continue down the stairs, follow the corridor, and once you hit the Bazaar, turn right down the nearby alleyway. You'll find Xur here in his dedicated alcove, ready to sell you his latest wares if you have enough Strange Coins in your pocket.

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

                <p>Resident Evil director Shinji Mikami founded Tango Gameworks in 2010 before leaving the company last year. Around the time of Mikami's departure, Tango Gameworks' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hi-fi-rush-review-good-vibes-only/1900-6418023/" data-ref-id="1900-6418023">Hi-Fi Rush</a> became a critically acclaimed hit. Now, Mikami has revealed that he thought Hi-Fi Rush had secured Tango Gameworks' future before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">Microsoft shut down the studio</a> earlier this year.</p><p>"I had thought the studio would be safe as long as they continued to make Hi-Fi Rush games," explained Mikami during an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shinji-mikami-and-goichi-interview-tango-gameworks-shadows-of-the-damned" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "That's one of the reasons I left Tango Gameworks. So I was surprised when the studio was closed down."</p><p>The good news is that Tango Gameworks' demise was short-lived. A few months after Microsoft made its decision, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-saved-by-pubg-publisher-krafton-hi-fi-rush-rights-also-acquired/1100-6525702/" data-ref-id="1100-6525702">Tango Gameworks was purchased by Krafton</a>, which retained the rights for Hi-Fi Rush and any future games in the franchise. Krafton also retained at least half of Tango Gameworks' employees who hadn't already secured other jobs. That gave Mikami a greater sense of hope for his former company.</p><p>"Now Krafton has taken over the business, so I feel like it worked out well in the end," said Mikami. "I was reminded that if you make a good game, someone will pick it up. The hard work of the Hi-Fi Rush development team led to a new chapter for the company."</p><p>There's currently no word about when a Hi-Fi Rush sequel or follow-up may arrive, but Limited Run Games has previously confirmed that the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-is-still-getting-a-physical-edition-by-limited-run/1100-6523334/" data-ref-id="1100-6523334">Hi-Fi Rush will still get a physical release</a>. There's just no timetable for that at the moment.</p>

			<p>Today, Bethesda Game Studios celebrates the one-year anniversary since the release of Starfield, its first new intellectual property in 25 years, as well as its first-ever sci-fi franchise. On Twitter/X, the team thanked all the millions of players (14, last we <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> in June) that made this first year 'incredible' for Bethesda. At the same time, they said there's much more on the way, starting with the Shattered Space expansion set for a debut on September 30.</p>
<p>They then took the opportunity to share a few new tidbits about what will be in Starfield Shattered Space:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>🪐 Over 50 new locations to discover and explore across Va'ruun'kai.</em></li>
<li><em>🔥 New grenades to craft that stem from organic material you gather (and it's gross).</em></li>
<li><em>👾 Formidable new enemies - be on your guard for Redeemed and Vortex Horrors...</em></li>
<li><em>⚔️ You haven't seen the last of Zealots, Spacers, or the Crimson Fleet... As you explore the planet, be on the lookout for those taking advantage of the situation.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-adds-new-gameplay-mechanics-has-a-lot-of-densely-packed-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> from Bethesda that Shattered Space is adding new zero-gravity combat scenarios that reportedly change how players approach fights, adding a new layer of strategy. The developers also introduced new ship customization options, allowing players to really tailor their vessels to their play style, and on the exploration front, some new tools and gadgets will help players interact with the environment in deeper, more meaningful ways.</p>
<p>Overall, Shattered Space returns to the old style of Bethesda exploration simply because most of the expansion will be set on a single planet. It will feature densely packed content like hidden quests and unique encounters, as fans have been used to with Elder Scrolls and Fallout.</p>
<p>It won't be long before we check it out for ourselves and discover whether it will be better received by the community than the base Starfield game. Stay tuned!</p>

            <p>I'll admit it, I downloaded the free prologue for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game Baby Blues Nightmares mostly because I couldn't stop giggling at the offer to "utilize the unique abilities of a toddler", encompassing "stealth gameplay", "survival elements" and "upgradeable abilities". It's as though a toddler were actually an undersung class of special operator from a Tom Clancy shooter, rather than a wailing, hyperactive ball of tears and poop. Then again, I imagine Sam Fisher was a toddler once. Perhaps this is how he got started: escaping a smashed-up house full of roaming demon toys.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the game doesn't lean into the stealth-survival premise as much as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2836820/Baby_Blues_Nightmares__Toddler_Horror_Game/">the Steam page</a> suggests. When it talks about "upgradeable abilities" it means tricking out your toy tricycle, which you can use to ferry smaller, non-demonic toys around the house. When it talks about "survival elements", it's talking about soothing yourself with collectible chocolate bars, so you don't burst into tears and alert the monsters (there are also apples, which restore health but don't make you stop crying - what a judgement upon modern Western lifestyles, eh). And when it talks about "the unique abilities of a toddler", it's mostly referring to your size, which transforms the dowdy setting into a grotesque, ogreish playground, with tables to crawl under and playstools to yank around for platforming purposes.</p>
<p>Baby Blue Nightmares isn't the first game to do this - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/among-the-sleep-review-horror-pc">Among The Sleep</a> sent us tottering among gargantuan domestic fixtures back in 2014, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> does the same from a side-on perspective. But Baby Blue Nightmares does have some nice ideas of its own, not least letting you draw on walls using crayons. This is nifty partly because the game is "semi-open world" - you might want to mark up doors and the like to help you navigate and solve puzzles. But it's also cool because I have been waiting for a game that lets me live the swiftly curtailed life of a horror game NPC and cover every available surface with ranty graffiti and unexpectedly practical advice. Here's one of my contributions from the prologue. Sorry about the low brightness - I had the gamma turned up on the other monitor.</p>

<p>There's a lot of this playfulness in Baby Blue Nightmares. You can fanny around with the toys you find, bouncing rubber balls off the playroom TV, even as it blares Ominous Backstory at you, and stamping on the squeaky toys, even as they give away your position. You can drag and drop scissor-toothed, Blumhousey teddy bears to form a scissor-toothed, Blumhousey teddy bear's tea party. I'm hoping this element of whimsy will take priority over the stealth stuff, which feels quite routine, and possibly grating - you run away from things and hide under other things until the first things move on. The experience of inhabiting a small, pudgy body with zero dodge-roll capability obviously creates some suspense, but the monster designs are familiar from any number of Dead Silence clones, and so far, the game seems to hurl them at you in a familiar way.</p>
<p>The toddler is possibly the biggest monster of all. As you learn in the opening cinematic, he favours scary dolls over non-scary ones, and look, I just don't trust a two-year-old who knows how to accessorise a tricycle - it goes against Nature. There don't appear to be any grown-ups tangibly present in the world, which seems a shame, because as everybody knows, one of the most important functions of children in horror stories is traumatising their parents.</p>
<p>If mum and dad were still about in Baby Blue Nightmares, we could scare the hell out of them by handing over ghastly doodles of, oh, let's say Sam Fisher again. Mr Splinter doesn't like it when you laugh, Mommy! He gets <em>awful mad</em>, and when Mr Splinter gets mad, he does the splits over the kitchen door with his friend, Mrs Karambits.</p>
<p>The full version of Baby Blue Nightmares is out on 16th September - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2836820/Baby_Blues_Nightmares__Toddler_Horror_Game/">download the prologue here</a>.

But choosing not to find all of these extra collectibles will stop you from revealing all of the secret levels and mean you miss out on a bunch of extra content.</p><p>If you want to collect everything in <em>Astro Bot</em> and complete its fun trophy list, you’ll be looking at closer to <strong>12 to 15 hours</strong>, depending on how much trouble you have with its most challenging levels.</p><h2 id="h4454"><a id=""></a><strong>How many levels are there in Astro Bot?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="146b20ae45bbd221fb20f04204ca871f" data-recommend-id="image://146b20ae45bbd221fb20f04204ca871f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro stands on a chimney above some houses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro stands on a chimney above some houses." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="146b20ae45bbd221fb20f04204ca871f" data-recommend-id="image://146b20ae45bbd221fb20f04204ca871f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro stands on a chimney above some houses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are a whopping <strong>80 levels</strong> in <em>Astro Bot</em> across six galaxies. However, it’s important to note that they’re not all full-blown levels in the traditional sense—various smaller challenge levels breaking up the larger, more sizable planets. But despite their size, the challenge levels live up to that description, providing some of the game’s most difficult gauntlets and combat encounters. There’s something here for even the most seasoned platformer fans.</p><h2 id="h4455"><a id=""></a><strong>Can you customize Astro?</strong></h2><p><strong>Yes, you can customize how Astro looks!</strong> After collecting enough puzzle pieces, you’ll unlock a place in the game’s hub where you can change your outfit to look like various PlayStation icons.

You’ll also need to complete a variety of random tasks in the game’s hub, usually requiring you to interact with specific characters (such as Kratos or Crash Bandicoot) in humorous ways. It’s all very fun and whimsical, making for an enjoyable path to its lovely Platinum trophy.</p><hr><p>So take your time! This isn’t a race, it’s a whimsical place of exploration and surprises. There’s a bunch of secrets to find, secret exits hidden all over, and puzzle pieces to hunt that unlock extras. Have fun!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Bethesda has put out more details about Starfield's first story expansion: Shattered Space. The frightful DLC  will add a new world, new craftable grenades, and new enemies to fight alongside a new set of story missions.</p><p>The DLC will take place on one new planet, Va'ruun'kai, but there will be over 50 new locations to explore there. The DLC appears to have a distinct cosmic horror flavor. As such, you'll encounter new horrific enemies called Redeemed/Vortex horrors. You'll be able to craft new "organic" grenades from material you find on Va'runn'kai. Other factions, such as Zealots, Spacers, and the Crimson Fleet, will also appear on the planet.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1832055921758867842" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Thank you to the millions of players who have made the Settled Systems their home and helped make this an incredible first year for <a href="https://twitter.com/StarfieldGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@StarfieldGame</a>.</p><p>We have much more coming, beginning with our first story expansion, Shattered Space, releasing September 30.

Before Shattered Space, the location of the cult's homeworld was unknown. In the base game, you got only flickers of what House Va'runn was up to, though Constellation member Andreja was a former cultist.</p><p>More news about the Shattered Space DLC will be arriving ahead of its September 30 release date. You can pre-order it now for $30 and it is included in the Starfield Premium Edition and the Premium Edition upgrade. In August, a free update added a moon-buggy-like vehicle: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-adds-vehicles-tonight-shattered-space-dlc-launches-in-september/1100-6525991/" data-ref-id="1100-6525991">the Rev-8</a>. The game simultaneously got performance upgrades like 60fps support on Xbox Series S. Back in May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-massive-may-update-is-finally-here-check-out-the-patch-notes/1100-6523488/" data-ref-id="1100-6523488">the game got its biggest update to date</a>, adding more robust difficult settings, fixing a multitude of bugs and revamping the planet maps.</p>

		<p><em>The writing seemed to be on the wall for Concord the moment it launched, but it took just about everyone by surprise when Sony announced earlier this week that it would be formally shutting down the game just weeks after it launched. Furthermore, it wouldn't even be selling the game anymore, and started issuing refunds. We just haven't seen a flop and about-face at this scale...maybe ever?</em></p><p><em>But trying who to "blame" for Concord is tough. Game companies are in hot pursuit of establishing their own forever game, like Fortnite. It's a near impossible task, but the reward is fountain of money. Did Concord developer Firewalk simply make the video game Sony asked them to, as part of a misguided live service initiative? Or did Firewalk pitch Sony on their ability to make an inventive one of these types of games and missed the mark? It's probably some version of both, the truth of which we won't know until Jason Schreier tells us.</em></p><p><em>It's given us a lot to think about, though. We talked in-depth about Concord's implosion on this week's episode of Remap Radio, but Patrick and Rob found they still had more to work through about how all this happened and what's next.</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Overwatch was not the first popular team-based game, but it did set a template many companies have chased since. Credit: Blizzard</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>When we were talking last week about <em>Concord </em>and how swiftly a live-service game can be labeled “dead on arrival”, I sure didn’t think Sony <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/447033/concord-ps5-pc-pulled-refunds-sony-firewalk?ref=remapradio.com"><u>would be turning out the lights</u></a> in just a few days. So that is a hero shooter that arrived August 23, and then by September 3rd it’s studio announced it was desliting the game, now by the sixth it is going offline entirely.</p><p>Now it’s premature to say that this is the end for <em>Concord</em>. The studio released <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the usual statement</u></a> about how they’re evaluating options and deciding on the best path forward, and I hope they manage to come up with a rework and a model for this game that enjoys some success. However, it’s also remarkable the speed at which this launch unraveled and how thoroughly Sony is not just halting it, but throwing the entire thing in reverse.</p><p>We spoke at length about how much harder the “live service” model is than major publishers thought. But I also wonder if the entire way these projects are conceived, developed, and brought to market is increasing the odds of a game launching straight into a death-spiral. After all, when we were talking about <em>Concord </em>we were arguing that once a game misses the mark this badly, players will avoid investing in it because they <em>know </em>it’s going to be abandoned and shut down as quickly as humanly possible. We didn’t imagine it would be anything like this fast, and I suppose Sony gets some credit for issuing refunds rather than slinking away from it in a year, but it also serves to demonstrate the core point: players know that publishers and developers are not going to stand behind these games.</p><p>Now maybe <em>Concord </em>is a unique case where the initial reaction was <em>so </em>indifferent that it was clear that nothing was going to save the game from having an unsustainably small player base that would never generate enough positive word-of-mouth to turn the game into being a small cult success. Sometimes a bomb is just a bomb.</p><p>But I also wonder to what degree live service games supported by major publishers can’t be affordably supported unless they come out of the gate as something approaching a hit. I don’t know what the budget for <em>Concord </em>was, nor do I know what amount of monthly spending is required to maintain Firewalk Studios staff and infrastructure (the “burn” rate of the studio). Just judging from how quickly <em>Concord </em>has been abandoned, it suggests that there’s no way for a publisher to wait out the long process of building the community and identity of a multiplayer game.</p><p>The thing is… how many games like this don’t need an exceedingly long runway? You could point to <em>Overwatch </em>and say that was an instant hit, but you could just as easily argue that it was capitalizing on the Blizzard brand (built over decades) and then occupying a genre space that people had come to understand thanks to, again, decades of <em>Team Fortress 2</em> and MOBAs. <em>Fortnite </em>had to be retooled to become a battle royale. <em>Apex Legends </em>might be an exception but even there… I’m not sure you can pretend it would have emerged fully formed had two <em>Titanfall </em>games not come and gone.</p><p>It takes a long time to get people on board with a new multiplayer-focused game. Way longer than the development cycle of a game. If it has truly new and distinctive ideas, it will take a while for people to warm up to those ideas and for them to be refined and made accessible and appealing to a broader audience. And if it’s an exercise on a genre that’s already popular, well, that just means not many people have a reason to play a new one.</p><p>Something that concerns me about this trend toward “grand opening, grand closing” live service launches is the way they suggest the people who hold the purse strings at studios fundamentally do not grasp this reality. Almost every major success they are pursuing is built on years of foundational work done in modding communities, or as part of a major ongoing franchise that predates the live-service era.</p><p>I suspect a lot of publishers dream of owning the next <em>Warframe </em>but let me tell you, I think every single major publisher would have abandoned <em>Warframe </em>in its infancy, or forced Digital Extremes to undergo debilitating cuts that would have made it impossible to grow and sustain the game.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Some of gaming's live service success stories come from the least likely places, like Warframe. Credit: Digital Extremes</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:<em> </em></strong>I know that Digital Extremes is largely known for <em>Warframe </em>these days, but in my mind, they’re actually the studio that helped Epic Games build <em>Unreal</em>. Seriously! They were co-developers on Unreal, Unreal Tournament—they were even co-developers on <em>Unreal Tournament 2004</em>, one of the GOATs. It’s also funny you break up <em>Warframe</em>, because <em>Warframe </em>itself was a free-to-play desperation play by Digital Extremes in the wake of the studio struggling to sign projects, which leveraged its messy 2008 action game <em>Dark Sector</em>. Digital Extremes was a shooter-focused company that’d been in the genre since 1993. Is it any wonder someone like Digital Extremes was able to, at some point, strike gold with that expertise?</p><p>What’s interesting about the <em>Concord </em>case is that it’s shocking to the world we’re most intimately familiar with, but absolutely standard practice in mobile games. In mobile, it’s called a “soft launch,” where a game is released in a select number of countries and nowhere else. If things go well, the game might launch elsewhere, country by country, until it’s “properly” released. But it’s also common for a game’s “soft launch” to be the only light of day a game sees before deletion. The modern free-to-play movement was born out of mobile, where competition is vicious, cruel, and unyielding. Those lessons haven’t been learned in AAA, or else I doubt Sony would’ve actually spent money on expensive motion capture for a game like Concord.</p><p>Supercell, one of the most popular mobile creators, <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2024/03/14/all-games-killed-by-supercell-everdale-hay-day-pop-clash-mini?ref=remapradio.com"><u>has canceled dozens of games that it’s “launched.”</u></a>&nbsp;</p><p>Is that <em>good</em>? Is that <em>sustainable</em>? I can’t speak to the specifics of mobile economics, but it’s likely only possible because the ecosystem of budgeting and staffing is built around aggressively accepting failure.</p>

If you’re at all a fan of RPGs, you’ll find something to love in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. The game, which takes place within the iconic <em>D&amp;D</em> setting that is the Forgotten Realms, is full of compelling characters, incredible writing, deep systems, and an unrivaled sense of player freedom. Seriously, if you even think you can do something, the game will likely give you a way to execute it. It’s also a worthwhile investment for how much time you’ll spend playing it, as just the main story will take you nearly 100 hours to complete, which doesn’t account for multiple playthroughs and all the wacky hijinks you can get up to between major narrative beats.</p><figure id="" data-id="8032a79b341a1cf73e1b7f2a2b8666a0" data-recommend-id="image://8032a79b341a1cf73e1b7f2a2b8666a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A party of adventurers stand outside a small cottage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A party of adventurers stand outside a small cottage" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Larian Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8032a79b341a1cf73e1b7f2a2b8666a0" data-recommend-id="image://8032a79b341a1cf73e1b7f2a2b8666a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A party of adventurers stand outside a small cottage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And even if you do already own <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, there are other great Larian games on sale as well. Before <em>BG3</em>, the studio already had a reputation for creating wonderful RPG worlds with loads of deep, highly reactive systems.

Many will call <em>BG3 </em>Larian’s masterpiece but for my money, <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> represents the studio at their most inventive.<br></p><p>At first glance there isn’t much differentiating the two: they both have complex companion characters, expansive epic narratives, and interactive TTRPG-inspired systems. However, <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> has the advantage of not being based on the existing <em>D&amp;D</em> world and rule set, which allowed Larian to create a more compelling world of their own, both in terms of narrative and combat rules. Much like a TTRPG player may tell you <em>D&amp;D</em> isn’t the be-all, end-all of the medium, and in fact has a number of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/baldurs-gate-3-rpg-dungeons-dragons-5e-flaws&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/baldurs-gate-3-rpg-dungeons-dragons-5e-flaws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-running issues</a></span>, I’m here to argue that <em>BG3 </em>falls short in some ways, and that <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> outshines it<em> </em>because it lacks the drawbacks inherent to <em>D&amp;D</em>. If you want to see what Larian can do in a sandbox of its own, grab <em>Divinity: Original Sin II.</em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/undisputed-final-preview-calling-all-fight-night-fans.974178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/undisputed-final-preview-calling-all-fight-night-fans<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The Fight Night series may be about to get KO'd by a new challenger to the boxing genre. </h2></div><section><p>While boxing has never been my favorite sport, I can't tell you how many hours I put into the Fight Night series back in the 2000s. The combination of realism and focus on presentation lived up to EA Sports' motto of making you feel like you're in the game. Despite my nostalgia for that franchise, it only took an hour-long preview of Undisputed at PAX West to realize that the boxing video game genre has a new contender on the horizon. </p><p>I jumped right into my Undisputed preview by challenging Steel City Interactive CEO and Co-Founder Ash Habib to a sparring match. In reality, it was more of a tutorial, as he ran through all the basics of the mechanics while explaining how and why they were put into the game. It only took until the character selection screen for me to get my first rush of excitement with Undisputed. It’s sporting a huge roster of notable boxing stars past and present, including Mike Tyson, Katie Taylor, and Eddie Hall. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Undisputed - September 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You read that right; you can even play as one of the World's Strongest Men. Naturally, I had to go with Hall as soon as I saw him, even if it was a slight mismatch against Habib's choice of Muhammad Ali. Despite the disadvantage, I was confident that my history with Fight Night would serve me well. Ali might be the greatest of all time, but Hall is an absolute monster of a man. It didn't take long into the fight to show how wrong I was. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every detail matters in Undisputed, from how characters move to their size and attributes.</p></div><p>At first, the gameplay felt very similar to what I was used to, thanks to my previous experience with boxing games. It wasn't long before I felt comfortable dodging, jabbing, and throwing power punches in rhythm with my opponent's movements. As the fight continued, I began to see small gameplay features that emphasized how important it was to the development team to make matches feel as true to life as possible. Every detail matters in Undisputed, from how characters move to their size and attributes, with each giving way to a certain strategy that changes how you can approach each fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Alongside the 60 different punches and different defensive tools in the game, footwork and positioning also play a huge part in controlling the flow of matches. Thanks to a combination of speed and agility, characters like Muhammad Ali can back themselves into a corner, then use the bob and weave mechanic to turn the tables and unleash a flurry of body blows that can deal heavy damage to both health and stamina. </p><p>Just like in real life, there are tactics to recover stamina if you want to play the long game. Refrain from throwing punches, get your opponent into a clinch, or even take a strategic knee, and you'll be rewarded at the end of the round with increased health and stamina. These tactics aren’t guaranteed to always work, as all it takes is one power punch to send even the strongest fighters to the mat. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Once down, Undisputed uses a disorientation system where you must simultaneously try to line both triggers into a green area, mimicking what it is like for a boxer to try and get up after a knockdown in real life. While this may sound easy, each side's green area moves differently, so it felt like I was trying to rub my belly and head simultaneously in different directions. Not too long into round two, Eddie Hall suffered a hard-fought loss to Muhammad Ali, signaling the end of my first fight in Undisputed. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The decisions made outside the ring are just as important as inside in Career Mode.</p></div><p>After the exhibition, I looked at the in-depth career mode and was shocked by the level of detail that had gone into it. In it, the decisions made outside the ring are just as important as inside, and many factors determine your path. Stick with the same manager throughout your career, and you'll get to see their attributes grow alongside you. The downside to dedication is that you'll only have three attribute slots for them instead of the maximum of five, which more notable valets boast. While going the heartless route and replacing your equivalent to Mickey Goldmill with Don King may have some unique benefits, there are also downsides. Any time you get a new manager or even a cutman, you'll have to start from scratch whenever you hire new people for your team. This means some of the unlocked skills that work as buffs to your attributes need to be unlocked again by completing new challenges. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Other cause-and-effect decisions like fighting above your skill level, growing your fame instead of training, or refusing to rest have consequences that could lead to an early retirement. Even though I only saw about 10 minutes of career mode, I was genuinely impressed with how much effort went into trying to make it as realistic as the gameplay I'd already seen from Undisputed. </p><p>Even with my limited experience with the sport, I can already tell Undisputed is crafted by people who understand and love boxing. While it's been over a decade since a proper game in the genre has been released outside of VR, this one may prove to have been worth the wait. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’ll be sharing more about what’s to come in the weeks after Weekend 2 concludes.”</p><p>Highlights include an overall increase to weapon swap speeds, small adjustments to baseline movement speeds on all weapon classes, various weapon balance changes, and adjusted spawn logic across several maps with the goal of reducing a high frequency of spawn flipping. There's a welcome increase to weapon XP gain, too, which will decrease the amount of time needed to gain weapon levels.</p><h2>Check out the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Weekend 2 patch notes in full below:</h2><h2>MULTIPLAYER</h2><h3>WEAPONS</h3><u>WEAPON SWAP SPEEDS</u><p>We’ve seen the feedback about weapon swap speeds, and we agree. We’ll be reducing weapon drop times across the board for an overall increase to swap speeds. Players looking for an even quicker swap speed can try out the Fast Hands Strategist Perk in Week 2 of the Beta. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Assault Rifle, SMG, Shotgun, LMG, Marksman Rifle, Pistol, and Launcher drop times reduced by 50ms </li><li>Sniper drop times reduced by 100ms</li></ul><u>MOVEMENT SPEEDS</u><p>We are making small adjustments to baseline movement speeds on all weapon classes to make sure they are sitting in a good spot relative to one another. We have mostly focused on Move Speeds and ADS Move Speeds, which come into play during combat engagements.</p><p>Overall we are happy with the weapon class usage and performance we’ve seen in Beta Weekend 1, as well as the upper end of movement pacing offered by SMGs, so these adjustments keep SMGs the same and generally improve other classes.

We want players to feel incentivized to pull out their Dedicated Melee weapon as a means of map traversal.

This is the cornerstone of building the spawn system and does not change regardless of map size or game mode. We use this metric (among others) to track bad spawn rates for Black Ops 6, meaning that if you dealt or received damage within 3 seconds in Weekend 1 of the Beta, we saw it.</em></p><p><em>As an example, our Core Moshpit entry with the highest bad spawn rate in Week 1 was Domination on Skyline with a 4.2% rate, which means 4.2 out of every 100 spawns saw someone give or receive damage within that 3 second window. While we are generally happy with our averages, we know that an average also consists of worst cases, and we'll continue to assess throughout the lifetime of this game.</em></p><p><em>We also recognize that we each have our own definition of what a good spawn or a bad spawn is, and that’s not always just about combat situations. For example, did I spawn out too far on Hardpoint? Or why am I spawning on the same side of the map as the enemy team? The overarching spawn system and the placement of spawns in a map are critical to the flow of the match. It is our goal with Black Ops 6, as it has been with every prior Black Ops game, to have a predictable spawn system that results in head-on engagements with your opponents while providing ample time from respawn for decision making. This includes accounting for time before getting into an engagement before you’re ready for it.</em></p><p><em>For Weekend 2 of our Open Beta, we’ve adjusted general spawn logic and have targeted multiple maps with additional tuning changes with the goal of improving predictability and time to engagement. We know we have some work to do and will continue to process our data, evaluate your feedback, and play the game with you all to draw our own conclusions on how to continue making positive progress.</em></p><h3>SCORESTREAKS</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>RC-XD</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improved handling and general usability.    </li></ul></li><li><strong>Watchdog Helo</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased base health.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hellstorm</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased Cluster Bomb damage radius.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>EQUIPMENT</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Lethal Equiptment<ul data-cy="list"><li>Thermo Grenade<ul data-cy="list"><li>    Reduced explosive ignition delay.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>MOVEMENT</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Slight increase to the time to enter prone or supine during a slide. </li><li>Slight increase to all mantle speeds. </li><li>Slight decrease to time before movement is allowed after landing from a Dive to Prone. </li><li>Slight increase to Dive to Prone landing friction.</li></ul><h3>PROGRESSION</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Weapon XP </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased awarded Weapon XP, which will decrease the amount of time needed to gain Weapon Levels.

            <p>
This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss the most dramatic few days for PlayStation in recent times.
</p>
<p>Sony's stunning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">decision to kill off live-service shooter flop Concord after less than two weeks</a> sent shockwaves around the industry, setting a new precedent for how swiftly a troubled title from a major publisher could be given the axe. After eight years of work, the game has already disappeared from sale, and will soon vanish from people's game libraries, with refunds automatically given. It's a remarkable move - even if Concord does somehow get a second lease of life - and another nail in the coffin for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-confirms-delay-to-half-its-planned-live-service-games">Sony's overly-ambitious live-service plans</a> that have already seen other projects <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">shelved</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">delayed</a>.</p>
<p>And yet Sony has still ended this week on something of a high - riding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review">a wave of love for Astro Bot</a>, the company's platforming platform mascot and star of an excellent new game, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-playstation-5-pro-design-seemingly-confirmed-by-sonys-official-30th-anniversary-art">subtly-teasing one of the worst-kept secrets in video games right now</a>: the imminent announcement of its souped-up PlayStation 5 Pro. Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Vikki Blake, as we dissect the week, discuss what might be next for Concord, and where PlayStation goes from here.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Street Fighter 6 Sales Reach Four Million Globally]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-sales-reach-four-million-globally/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/street-fighter-6-sales-reach-four-million-globally.974145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-sales-reach-four-million-globally/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Capcom has announced that Street Fighter 6 has hit a brand-new milestone, just 15 months after the game was first released. <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1831814865297489924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As announced on X</a>, Street Fighter 6 has officially reached over four million sales globally. This now puts it on a level playing field with Mortal Kombat, which surpassed that number 11 months after launch. Despite that, at least in the fighting game community, it seems that Street Fighter 6 is the more popular of the two. However, Tekken 8 did significantly better than these combined, reaching two million sales in a month.</p>
<p>With this information, Capcom firmly believes that Street Fighter 6 is on the right path to surpass the sales of Street Fighter 5, which reached over 7.6 million sales in its lifetime. Street Fighter 6 still has a lot of life left in it, with Capcom hoping that the sales will surpass 10 million sales during its lifetime. Currently, there is still a lot of content planned for Street Fighter 6, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-terry-gamescom-hands-on-ready-for-domination/">Terry being the latest fighter</a> to join the roster, being officially released on September 24, 2024.</p>
<p>For context, Street Fighter 5 was first released in 2016, and most players continued to play it until the release of Street Fighter 6. The Champion Edition of the game, which included all DLC characters, was released in 2020.</p>
<p>As it stands, Street Fighter 6 is currently in the middle of season 2, with the DLC characters Terry and Mai, fighters from Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters, respectively, joining the game this year. Looking further into the future, Elena is due to return to Street Fighter 6 after her debut in Street Fighter 3 sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>So far, Street Fighter 6 has seen a lot of content added to the game, including DLC fighters such as Rashid, Ed, Akuma, A.K.I, and M.Bison, the most recent fighter to join the roster. Compared to previous iterations in the franchise, Street Fighter 6 is the most accessible, with the option of using Modern Controls, similar to the new feature added to Tekken 8. For those who struggle to do complex button inputs, Modern Controls allows you to use a smaller amount of buttons to execute the same combo. However, it doesn't come without consequences. Using Modern Controls reduces the damage output of Special moves and Supers.</p>
<p>Overall, Street Fighter 6 is on a great path, and with more DLC characters in the future, there is plenty of room for the game to grow and surpass the 4 million sales it has currently reached. Although it isn't stated in the post, it's safe to assume that this number comes from sales across all platforms, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-strike-policies-negotiations</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/greedfall-2-developer-spiders-secures-better-pay-and-policies-after-strike.974142/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-strike-policies-negotiations<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Steelrising&nbsp;</em>developer Spiders has scored a win for itself by securing better pay and working conditions following a strike that took place earlier this week.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/spiders-employees-secure-boosted-wages-better-remote-work-policies" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement provided to Game Developer</a>, studio management says it's negotiated raises and improved working policies with employees, although the statement does also contain some pointed remarks regarding allegations made by the union to which said employees belong.</p>
<p>Spiders bosses say that statements made by the SJTV union in an <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/08/open-letter-from-spiders-workers-to-their-employer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open letter to managers last week</a> were "false and defamatory", so even though the managerial side of the studio has agreed to better conditions for employees, it sounds like they didn't do so without some pushback.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spiders-strike-negotiations-greedfall-2.jpg?itok=y5rvSH9B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spiders-strike-negotiations-greedfall-2.jpg?itok=subQOyw4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Spiders is currently working on&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Game Developer, Spiders managers have agreed to raise the studio's minimum base salary by 11%, starting from this month (and retroactive to April 1st of this year).</p>
<p>Although that sounds like a pretty big jump, Game Developer does also say that the average Spiders employee will only see a salary increase of around 3% as a result of this move. Still, it's progress, right?</p>

<p>Spiders managers aren't just out for SJTV, either; they're also seemingly upset with the media. In the statement given to Game Developer, studio management says that the "portrayal" of the studio's working conditions in the media is an "attempt to destabilize the company".</p>

For your primary weapon, you’ll want to select the Heavy Bolt Rifle. It excels at close and mid-range fights, and you’ll want to ensure that you’re hitting anything that’s fairly close to you.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is the only gun that you can swap out in this class, so you won’t have much freedom with alternative builds in your arsenal.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b0ba7f4d228e8558d50f95fa5ea7faa8" data-recommend-id="image://b0ba7f4d228e8558d50f95fa5ea7faa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Assault Class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Assault Class" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b0ba7f4d228e8558d50f95fa5ea7faa8" data-recommend-id="image://b0ba7f4d228e8558d50f95fa5ea7faa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Assault Class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Assault class is meant for those looking to fight up close and personal. We recommend that you lean far into this. Since this class is unable to have a primary weapon, we suggest using the Heavy Bolt Pistol as your secondary because this can double as a ranged weapon, and it packs a serious punch.</p><p>As for your melee weapon, we highly recommend the Thunder Hammer. One, because it’s a giant hammer that allows you to live out your Thor power fantasy, and two, because it’s the strongest weapon of the bunch. Even though it does have the slowest swing out of the three, we are mainly looking for it to dish out maximum damage more than anything else.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3ff0a94d2edd960e64f1cd880a99c7eb" data-recommend-id="image://3ff0a94d2edd960e64f1cd880a99c7eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vanguard Class." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vanguard Class." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3ff0a94d2edd960e64f1cd880a99c7eb" data-recommend-id="image://3ff0a94d2edd960e64f1cd880a99c7eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vanguard Class." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Vanguard class is meant to be played zippy. For this, you’ll want to have the Instigator Bolt Carbine as your primary weapon. When compared to the Metal and Oculus, it’s the better fit for Vanguard because it has a three-round burst that allows you to place your shots in a single target. This ensures you inflict as much damage as possible.</p><p>For a melee weapon, you’ll want to stick with the Combat Knife, because when playing Vanguard you’re not looking to jump into a horde. Instead, you’re mainly focusing on one target at a time, and this setup will help when going toe-to-toe with enemies.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="40bd4443ea80a5b893d5c7ec101b8791" data-recommend-id="image://40bd4443ea80a5b893d5c7ec101b8791" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bulwark class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bulwark class" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="40bd4443ea80a5b893d5c7ec101b8791" data-recommend-id="image://40bd4443ea80a5b893d5c7ec101b8791" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bulwark class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Even though the Bulwark class is meant to be played in melee combat, you’ll want to make sure you have a proper secondary to help you in unavoidable ranged fights, especially as you don’t have access to a primary. With that in mind, we recommend using the Plasma Pistol for a couple of reasons: The first is that you won’t have to worry about reloading it, letting you keep firing without stopping in your tracks. The second is that you can charge it up to ensure you inflict as much damage as possible.</p><p>When selecting your melee weapon, we suggest using the Power Sword. Out of all three, it’s the most balanced, so it’ll allow you to play with more versatility, and keep you from staying in one play-style. Plus, it has a super cool lighting effect that triggers whenever you swing it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="17910da3b0fe0932ff72d5fb6f818e19" data-recommend-id="image://17910da3b0fe0932ff72d5fb6f818e19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sniper Class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sniper Class" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17910da3b0fe0932ff72d5fb6f818e19" data-recommend-id="image://17910da3b0fe0932ff72d5fb6f818e19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sniper Class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When using the Sniper class, we recommend staying away from the Stalker Bolt Rifle and the Bolt Carbine. The weapon we best suggest you use is the Las Fusil Sniper Rifle because it has the highest firepower out of all of them. This class is meant to be played at a distance, and Las Fusil is the perfect gun for picking off enemies from afar.</p><p>This is another class that doesn’t have a lot of freedom when it comes to having a diverse loadout. You won’t be able to switch out your melee or secondary weapon, so make sure you’re comfortable with the Bolt Pistol and Combat Knife. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f15550fe9e1a48346fcf691fa84d9823" data-recommend-id="image://f15550fe9e1a48346fcf691fa84d9823" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="heavy class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="heavy class" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f15550fe9e1a48346fcf691fa84d9823" data-recommend-id="image://f15550fe9e1a48346fcf691fa84d9823" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="heavy class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Heavy Class is the only option that doesn’t allow you to have a melee weapon. The best way to counter that is by equipping the Multi-Melta. This gun is basically a shotgun flamethrower that’ll melt anything it shoots. The only downside is that you have to be close to your targets, but that shouldn’t be an issue when playing the Heavy.</p><p>As for secondaries, we suggest the Plasma Pistol. This gun has a fairly decent range and can be used in mid-ranged fights when attempting to close the gap for your Melta.</p><hr><p>These are the best loadouts we recommend using while hunting the Emperor enemies in <em>Space Marine 2</em>. As you level up in the game, you can upgrade these weapons and customize them to your liking, which will only help you in combat. Go out there and slay some heretics!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The bundle consists of, in narrative chronological order, <em>Yakuza 0</em>, <em>Kiwami</em>, <em>Kiwami 2</em>, <em>3 Remastered</em>, <em>4 Remastered</em>, <em>5 Remastered</em>, and <em>6: The Song of Life</em>.

Not only am I 60 hours in and about 11 chapters deep, but I don’t see an immediate end anywhere in sight. These games are traditionally massive crime epics stuffed to the brim with characters and activities to do. At the moment, I’m in the middle of a cabaret mini-game that is its own management sim within <em>Yakuza 0</em>, which is a brawler, and features its own storyline about my character trying to reclaim the neighborhood from the clutches of cartoonishly evil business owners. That’s on top of all the other irreverent substories that are typically featured in a <em>Yakuza </em>game.</p><p>But these games are just as technically and artistically impressive as they are massive. Real-world settings, like Kabukichō, are the inspiration for the nearly 1:1 era-specific recreations that are rendered across the <em>Yakuza</em> games, which take you to pockets of Tokyo, as well as Osaka, Yokohama, and Hiroshima. I once recognized the exact place a friend had posted on their Instagram story because they happened to be in Dōtonbori, which is the real-world equivalent of the Sotenbori setting that regularly features in the games, especially <em>Yakuza 0.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The <em>Yakuza </em>games are deep in more senses than just sheer content. I sometimes bristle against brawlers, which often feel too button-mashy for my taste, but I’m finding a surprising amount of depth in <em>Yakuza 0</em>’s mechanics. There are completely different styles of fighting that should be used in the right scenarios/boss fights, but there are huge skill trees attached to each of them, and even a storyline centered around the people training you. Six fighting styles split evenly across two protagonists on entirely different maps means that <em>Yakuza 0 </em>has felt tremendous in scope, but it also hasn’t been overwhelming. Chapters do a great job of giving either character ample time to breathe, and I’ve thus far been encouraged to go at my own pace and set my own priorities as far as goals, skills, and completion.</p><p>Extrapolate that formula across about six other titles that consistently grow in scale, and you’re in for a hell of an undertaking with <em>Yakuza Complete Series</em>.

Yes, <em>that’s </em>why the newest <em>Like A Dragon </em>games have been turn-based RPGs. Have I sold you on this phenomenally bonkers series yet?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">The second and final week of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> beta goes live later today, and a new game update has arrived ahead of time. The patch notes reveal several major adjustments, including changes to weapon movement speed and a nerf to last weekend's overpowered Jackal PDW submachine gun.</p><p dir="ltr">This second weekend raises the level cap from 20 to 30, so players will have access to more of Black Ops 6's weapons, scorestreaks, perks, and equipment. This includes popular perks, such as Ninja, Cold-Blooded, and Fast Hands.</p><p dir="ltr">A change is coming to the swap speeds for all weapons. The weapon-drop time was reduced for sniper rifles by 100ms, while weapons in all other classes were reduced by 50ms. Treyarch says players looking for an even quicker weapon swap should try out the Fast Hands strategist perk.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4363189-cod-bo6-needtoknowbeta-025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363189" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4363189-cod-bo6-needtoknowbeta-025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363189"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 beta rewards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4363189-cod-bo6-needtoknowbeta-025.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The movement speeds of weapon classes are also adjusted for week two. The developer explains that these are small adjustments to baseline movement speeds on all weapon classes to "make sure they are sitting in a good spot relative to one another." These movement adjustments include move speeds and ADS move speeds, which come into play during combat engagements.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Treyarch says it's being mindful of speeding the game up too much and will continue to monitor and assess game data and player feedback.</p><p dir="ltr">Another movement change comes from an adjustment to speed up the melee sprint speeds. The developer says it wants players to feel incentivized to pull out their dedicated melee weapon as a means of map traversal and ensure that melee users can catch up to other players who are sprinting with ranged weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">The first weekend of the beta was dominated by the Jackal PDW submachine gun, but Treyarch confirmed it was overperforming at medium ranges. The nerf includes an increase to the damage falloff, a reduced damage range, and a slight increase to recoil. Additionally, week two gives players access to the new Tanto .22 submachine gun, so players will have another option for submachine guns to try out.</p><p dir="ltr">Spawns are also adjusted based on the feedback from week one. Treyarch has adjusted the game's general spawn logic to enable additional valid spawns, and also changed the spawn logic across several maps with the goal of reducing a high frequency of spawn flipping.</p><p>The full patch notes can be seen below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-open-beta-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Activision</a>.</p><p>Here are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-settings/1100-6526279/" data-ref-id="1100-6526279">some recommended Black Ops 6 settings</a> to try for the beta.

We’ll be reducing weapon drop times across the board for an overall increase to swap speeds. Players looking for an even quicker swap speed can try out the Fast Hands Strategist Perk in Week 2 of the Beta.</p><ul><li>Assault Rifle, SMG, Shotgun, LMG, Marksman Rifle, Pistol, and Launcher drop times reduced by 50ms</li><li>Sniper drop times reduced by 100ms</li></ul><h4><u>MOVEMENT SPEEDS</u></h4><p>We are making small adjustments to baseline movement speeds on all weapon classes to make sure they are sitting in a good spot relative to one another. We have mostly focused on Move Speeds and ADS Move Speeds, which come into play during combat engagements.</p><p>Overall we are happy with the weapon class usage and performance we’ve seen in Beta Weekend 1, as well as the upper end of movement pacing offered by SMGs, so these adjustments keep SMGs the same and generally improve other classes. We are mindful of speeding the game up too much and will continue to monitor and assess game data and your feedback.</p><p>The other notable change here is to Melee Sprint Speeds. We want players to feel incentivized to pull out their Dedicated Melee weapon as a means of map traversal. We also want to ensure that Melee users can catch up to other players who are sprinting with ranged weapons for those sneaky Body Shields and Finishing Moves.</p><h4>Movement Speed Adjustments</h4><p>Weapon Category Adjustments</p><h4>Assault Rifles</h4><ul><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.75m/s -&gt; 1.88m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.14m/s -&gt; 4.29m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 3.07m/s -&gt; 3.23m/s</li></ul><h4>SMGs</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed increased from 2.31m/s -&gt; 2.77m/s</li></ul><h4>Shotguns</h4><ul><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.63m/s -&gt; 1.75m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.14m/s -&gt; 4.29m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 3.07m/s -&gt; 3.23m/s</li></ul><h4>LMGs</h4><ul><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.14m/s -&gt; 1.3m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 3.71m/s -&gt; 3.86m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 2.31m/s -&gt; 2.46m/s</li></ul><h4>Marksman Rifles</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed increased from 2.41m/s -&gt; 2.49m/s</li><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.37m/s -&gt; 1.55m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 3.76m/s -&gt; 3.99m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 2.9m/s -&gt; 3m/s</li></ul><h4>Sniper Rifles</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed decreased from 2.41m/s -&gt; 2.31m/s</li></ul><h4>Pistols</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed decreased from 2.9m/s -&gt; 2.84m/s</li><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.88m/s -&gt; 2.24m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.47m/s -&gt; 4.52m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed decreased from 3.94m/s -&gt; 3.81m/s</li></ul><h4>Launchers</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed decreased from 2.44m/s -&gt; 2.18m/s</li></ul><h4>Melee</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed increased from 2.9m/s -&gt; 2.95m/s</li><li>Jog Speed increased from 5.16m/s -&gt; 5.31m/s</li><li>Sprint Speed increased from 6.93m/s -&gt; 7.16m/s</li><li>Super Sprint Speed increased from 8.41m/s -&gt; 8.66m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.47m/s -&gt; 4.62</li></ul><h4><b><u>Weapon Adjustments</u></b></h4><h4>SMG Adjustments</h4><p>Weapon Adjustments</p><h3>Jackal PDW</h3><ul><li>Decreased Maximum Damage from 29 -&gt; 26  <ul><li>Decreased Maximum Damage range from 15.24m -&gt; 14.61m</li></ul></li><li>Decreased Near-Medium Damage from 23 -&gt; 22  <ul><li>Decreased Near-Medium Damage range from 22.86m -&gt; 17.78m</li></ul></li><li>Decreased Medium Damage from 22 -&gt; 18  <ul><li>Decreased Medium Damage range from 29.21m -&gt; 26.04m</li></ul></li><li>Decreased Minimum Damage from 19 -&gt; 15</li><li>Small increase to view kick strength and view kick deviation.</li><li><b>CHF Barrel</b><ul><li>Headshot multiplier improved from 1.2 -&gt; 1.4</li></ul></li></ul><p>The Jackal PDW ‘s intended strength is best in class handling and decent mobility, balanced by a slower rate of fire compared to many of the other automatic weapons in the game. It was overperforming at medium ranges, so we’ve increased the damage falloff and pulled the ranges closer along with a slight increase to recoil. Maximum damage and CHF Barrel headshot multiplier have been adjusted to maintain the same hit to kill numbers while using the attachment.</p><h3><b>C9</b></h3><ul><li>Increased medium damage range from 25.4m -&gt; 27.31m</li></ul><p>We feel that the C9 is in a good spot as a well-rounded Submachine Gun with a solid rate of fire. It has higher horizontal recoil compared to other Submachine Guns, so we’ve given a boost to its medium damage falloff range.</p><h4>Marksman Rifles Adjustments</h4><p>Weapon Adjustment</p><h3>SWAT 5.56</h3><ul><li>Disabled burst fire queuing, which was queuing an additional burst if the fire input was activated at any time during the previous burst or the burst cooldown.</li></ul><p>This is a minor change to improve control with the Swat 5.56 (and any future burst weapons).</p><h4><u>ATTACHMENTS</u></h4><ul><li>The Rapid Fire attachment now correctly displays its recoil penalty con. The attachment description has also been updated to indicate the tradeoff.</li></ul><h3>MAPS</h3><h4>General</h4><ul><li>Adjusted general spawn logic to enable additional valid spawns under certain scenarios.</li><li>Adjusted spawn logic across several maps with the goal of reducing a high frequency of spawn flipping.</li></ul><p>Our longstanding definition of a “bad spawn” is any time a player deals or receives damage within 3 seconds of spawning. This is the cornerstone of building the spawn system and does not change regardless of map size or game mode. We use this metric (among others) to track bad spawn rates for Black Ops 6, meaning that if you dealt or received damage within 3 seconds in Weekend 1 of the Beta, we saw it.</p><p>As an example, our Core Moshpit entry with the highest bad spawn rate in Week 1 was Domination on Skyline with a 4.2% rate, which means 4.2 out of every 100 spawns saw someone give or receive damage within that 3 second window. While we are generally happy with our averages, we know that an average also consists of worst cases, and we'll continue to assess throughout the lifetime of this game.</p><p>We also recognize that we each have our own definition of what a good spawn or a bad spawn is, and that’s not always just about combat situations. For example, did I spawn out too far on Hardpoint? Or why am I spawning on the same side of the map as the enemy team? The overarching spawn system and the placement of spawns in a map are critical to the flow of the match. It is our goal with Black Ops 6, as it has been with every prior Black Ops game, to have a predictable spawn system that results in head-on engagements with your opponents while providing ample time from respawn for decision making. This includes accounting for time before getting into an engagement before you’re ready for it.</p><p>For Weekend 2 of our Open Beta, we’ve adjusted general spawn logic and have targeted multiple maps with additional tuning changes with the goal of improving predictability and time to engagement. We know we have some work to do and will continue to process our data, evaluate your feedback, and play the game with you all to draw our own conclusions on how to continue making positive progress.</p><h3>SCORESTREAKS</h3><ul><li><b>RC-XD</b><ul><li>Improved handling and general usability.</li></ul></li><li><b>Watchdog Helo</b><ul><li>Increased base health.</li></ul></li><li><b>Hellstorm</b><ul><li>Increased Cluster Bomb damage radius.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>EQUIPMENT</h3><ul><li>Lethal Equiptment  <ul><li>Thermo Grenade  <ul><li>Reduced explosive ignition delay.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>MOVEMENT</h3><ul><li>Slight increase to the time to enter prone or supine during a slide.</li><li>Slight increase to all mantle speeds.</li><li>Slight decrease to time before movement is allowed after landing from a Dive to Prone.</li><li>Slight increase to Dive to Prone landing friction.</li></ul><h3>PROGRESSION</h3><ul><li><b>Weapon XP </b><ul><li>Increased awarded Weapon XP, which will decrease the amount of time needed to gain Weapon Levels.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> has detailed the first batch of balance changes and improvements it's bringing to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> later this month as part of the 60-day improvement plan it recently announced amid a significant player backlash to the sci-fi shooter's latest major update.
</p>
<p>
Arrowhead committed to improvements back in August following the launch of Helldivers 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-announced-with-higher-difficulty-new-bugs-and-more">Escalation of Freedom update</a>. Despite some welcome headline additions - including new mission objectives and enemies - the update drew significant ire among fans for its controversial balance changes and nerfs. Helldivers 2's reviews are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/#app_reviews_hash">currently "mostly negative" on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
With player frustration continuing to grow, Arrowhead released a statement acknowledging its update "didn't hit [its] target", and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-studio-reveals-60-day-plan-of-action-following-recent-patch-outcry">committing to a 60-day plan of action</a> that would see it addressing "some things we just didn't get right" and "other more fundamental inconsistencies in our approach to game balance and game direction." And now, the studio has announced the first batch of changes it's making as part of its promise to improve the experience.

<p>
"It's been a couple of weeks since we committed to our 60-day plan," Arrowhead wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4613462911400573371?l=english">statement shared on Steam</a>, "and our team has been hard at work refining the gameplay experience, addressing your concerns by doing in-depth reviews and adjustment of various systems, from weapon balancing and enemy behavior to the overall game mechanics. We are fully committed to ensuring Helldivers 2 meets the high standards we all expect. We see the steam reviews and we hear you loud and clear."
</p>
<p>
The developer's initial changes are said to be aimed at "refining and improving [player] experience", beginning with a balance rework to Armour Penetration, Anti-Tank weapons, enemy armour, and health values which will initially impact 30 weapons and stratagems.
</p>
<p>
Next up is an overhaul for a number of enemies - intended to make killing them "more rewarding... when you use the proper tools", while also aiming to ensure they still feel formidable. Enemy bots, for instance, will see a reduction in armour, while the Devastator and Gunship will only be able to fire a limited number of rockets. Additionally, "particularly tough" bugs - including the Charger, Impaler, and Bile Titan - will also see their armour reduced.
</p>
<p>
And as a final set of changes for Helldivers 2's next patch, weapons including the Autocannon, Heavy Machine Gun, and Anti-Material Rifle will get a buff in order to increase their effectiveness and provide "greater load out versatility". Arrowhead also says it's "working toward" flamethrower improvements, and will be considering "new player fantasies and design goals for these weapons and stratagems" based on player trends and the feedback it's received.
</p>
<p>
All the above "and more" will be introduced to Helldivers 2 in a patch currently scheduled to go live on 17th September. Arrowhead has also reaffirmed its plans for an opt-in beta test environment, noting it's been conducting closed beta tests for the last two weekends and will be expanding it in the future once the appropriate infrastructure is in place. "The intent," it explains, "is that these tests will find issues and missteps before we release them to the player base at large, providing a better experience for all players."
</p>
<p>
Will this month's update also be the one that finally introduces Helldivers 2's long-anticipated third faction after some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-long-awaited-third-enemy-faction-briefly-appears-on-in-game-map">mysterious in-game sightings</a> earlier this week? We'll find out soon.
