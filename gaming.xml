            <p>"Move over Hollow Knight," declared Katharine (RPS in peace) in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown review</a>, summarising this freshly-honed hunk of POP art as "a deep and challenging Metroid-like with some of the best platforming this side of Moon's Ori games." Sadly, for all the plaudits, the game doesn't seem to have earned sufficient megabucks to justify keeping its development team together. Earlier this week, French journalist Gautoz reported that Ubisoft had disbanded The Lost Crown's core dev team after turning down proposals for a sequel and further expansions. Speaking to RPS this morning, Ubisoft have confirmed that "most" of the Lost Crown's dev team have moved onto other projects, while noting that there have been no layoffs as a result.</p><!--more-->
<p>Find the Gautoz report on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HgkIyq0emY">Youtube</a>, which is based on conversations with anonymous developers. Beware that it's in French. And here's Ubisoft's statement in full from the game's senior producer, Abdelhak Elguess.</p>
<blockquote><p>I'm extremely proud of our team's work and passion at Ubisoft Montpellier to create a game that resonated with players and critics alike, and I am confident in its long-term success. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is now at the end of its Post-Launch roadmap with three free content updates and one DLC that released in September. We are now focusing on making the game available to more players: it was recently launched on Steam, and will be available on Mac by this winter. Most of the team members who worked on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown have shifted to other projects that will benefit from their expertise.</p>
<p>We know players have a love for this brand and Ubisoft is excited to bring more Prince of Persia experiences in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft are in a prickly place at the moment. Back in September, one investor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">threatened to organise a rebellion</a> and depose the founding Guillemot brothers in response to disappointing returns on blockbuster games, not least Star Wars Outlaws. Ubisoft subsequently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">kicked back the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows to 2025</a> to avoid another Outlaws-style spongy landing. It's also reported that the Guillemots and Tencent, who are currently minority shareholders, are considering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">buying the company out</a>. All this occurs against the backdrop of labour action, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/700-ubisoft-staff-in-france-hold-strikes-in-response-to-worldwide-return-to-office-mandate-from-assassins-creed-publisher">700 staff in France striking in response to a return to the office mandate</a>.</p><p>Taking a longer view, Ubisoft are one among many larger publishers who are struggling to justify smaller, more eccentric projects such as The Lost Crown, which don't aim for the whopping revenues currently expected of the triple-As. As Graham has just lamented to me in our Slack, Ubisoft once had more of a track record for oddball B-listers and smaller artisanal curios - games like Driver, the musically minded Rayman reboots, Mario + Rabbids, and Child Of Light. Nowadays, projects of that scope with relatively modest commercial ambitions don't seem to cut the mustard. </p>
<p>As our guides writer Jeremy added in the same Slack chat, Ubisoft have also really muddled the waters with Prince Of Persia in particular. The Lost Crown has had to compete for attention with another POP side-scroller created by a third-party, Evil Empire's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-a-new-roguelite-that-combines-wall-running-with-arkham-style-agile-combat">The Rogue Prince Of Persia</a>. Like Star Wars Outlaws, it was also exclusive to Ubisoft's own storefront for the first few months of release, reducing the impact of its eventual release on Steam, the largest PC marketplace. Finally, The Lost Crown has had to weather lingering uncertainty about the long-promised, much-delayed Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time remake, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-resurfaces-after-years-of-silence-to-tease-a-release-in-2026">now slated to launch in 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/four-years-after-ps5s-launch-minecraft-finally-gets-a-native-version<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
PlayStation 5 will celebrate its fourth birthday in just a few days, and finally there's a native version of Minecraft available for it.
</p>
<p>
The PS5 native version of Minecraft is available now, and comes as a free upgrade from the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/212779">PlayStation Store</a> if you own the game's PS4 version already. As with all other Bedrock versions of the game, this is the cross-platform edition, which lets you play alongside those on PC, mobile, Switch and Xbox.
</p>
<p>
What's new? Well, specifically in the PS5 version, not much. Minecraft fans will be able to take advantage of graphical improvements already found on Xbox Series X, such as 4K visuals and 60fps gameplay.

<p>
Across the Minecraft Bedrock edition generally, today does bring two new features, however. Firstly, a Hardcore mode which limits you to just one life (after which you can only visit your world as a ghost). Second, the ability to bundle different items together in your inventory to save space (in effect, Minecraft has added folders).
</p>
<p>
Minecraft is, of course, owned by Microsoft - which is slowly publishing more of its games on PlayStation consoles. Next up is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">which arrives for PS5 next year</a>.
</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and Pentiment all also made the move across to additional platforms. On its PlayStation debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">Sea of Thieves went onto top the PS5's download charts</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-wolf-among-us-2-isn%E2%80%99t-canceled-confirms-telltale-games.1017036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-isnt-canceled-confirms-telltale-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, a rumor that The Wolf Among Us 2 had been canceled started spreading on the Web. However, a spokesperson for Telltale Games has since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wolf-among-us-2-not-cancelled-telltale-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to Eurogamer that it's not actually true.</p>
<p><em>As a rule, we don't comment on rumors and unsubstantiated Reddit threads. But development on The Wolf Among Us 2 continues and we're excited to share more about the game with Telltale fans and our community when the time is right.</em></p>
<p>Fans had every right to be worried, though. A follow-up to that beloved first season of episodes was first announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2017. However, in September 2018, Telltale<a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-closing-walking-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> shut down</a> and its projects, including this one, were canceled.</p>
<p>It wasn't long until fans' hopes were rekindled, with the announcement of <a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-revived/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telltale's resurrection</a> coming in August 2019 and the subsequent confirmation that development on The Wolf Among Us 2 would <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-development-reboot-unreal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restart from scratch</a>. The game originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-delayed-beyond-2023-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted</a> a 2023 launch, but Telltale delayed it around a year and a half ago to avoid putting too much pressure on its employees with crunch practices. Contextually, we learned that the studio had decided to switch the game to Epic's Unreal Engine 5. The last we heard about The Wolf Among Us 2 was in April when the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-gets-first-ue5-screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the first Unreal Engine 5 screenshots.</p>
<p>We don't know a whole lot about the story except for some tidbits that were <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-is-set-six-months-after-the-original-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> nearly two years ago. The Wolf Among Us 2 takes place six months after the original season, just after Snow White takes over as deputy mayor of Fabletown. Bigby is still struggling to transition from a typical fairytale villain to sheriff and protector. This new season explores more nuances and difficulties of hiding in plain sight, dealing with mostly new moles, and taking place all over New York, with the city said to play a bigger role.</p>
<p>Telltale also said that it's going to be even more about the human experience of a fable that strips away the fantasy and leaves players with many uncomfortable and messy choices to make.</p>

            <p>I feel this one largely speaks for itself, honestly. I could theorise on the fictional conceit of bringing packaged creatures to life using a microwave and also, sometimes, a blender, but to do so would be to stare into a gift horse’s abyssal oat hole so intently that…</p>
<p>…I was going to finish that with something about its molars staring back, but I had to quickly Google “do horses have molars?” only to misspell it. “Yes, horses can have a strong sense of right and wrong, and what is fair,” went the AI overview. “Some say that horses can teach people to live in the present and to be authentic.”</p>
<p>Thanks for that.</p>

<p>Anyway, Creature Packets is a short, name-your-own-price game by kenforest. You can find it on <a href="https://kenforest.itch.io/creature-packets">Itch here</a>. It is not exactly a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game, but the room in which you select creatures from a vending machine then cook them <em>does </em>feel like the sort of place in which a small slice of horror game could occur. It’s almost like a very elaborate Resident Evil puzzle spun out into its own thing.</p><p>There’s also a bit of an Overcooked vibe, without the time pressure. You’re given orders through a monitor, and you’ll need to read yellowing, crumpled recipes on notepad pages, haphazardly pinned about the room. These three bugs make a snail, these creatures make a frog - horrible chimeric procedures of that nature. I think my favourite thing about it is the vending machine. You can stick me in the most unnatural situation imaginable, and as long as the vending machine is in working order, I’ve at least got some sense of normality. I’ll ignore the fact that the vending machine appears to stock itself.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has responded to a report published yesterday that claimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>'s team had been disbanded.
</p>
<p>
In a statement to Eurogamer, the Assassin's Creed publisher largely confirmed what had been reported - though made clear that the game's team were still present and busy at development studio Ubisoft Montpellier, albeit now on "other projects that will benefit from their expertise".
</p>
<p>
Yesterday's report by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HgkIyq0emY">Origami</a> was not fully clear on the status of the team behind The Lost Crown - which received a positive critical response upon its launch this year, though failed to set tills ringing.

<p>
The report also suggested The Lost Crown would not receieve a sequel as a result of its commercial performance - something Ubisoft does not contradict today - with ideas for a follow-up reportedly merged into plans for the game's DLC.
</p><p>
"I'm extremely proud of our team's work and passion at Ubisoft Montpellier to create a game that resonated with players and critics alike, and I am confident in its long-term success," Abdelhak Elguess, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown senior producer said in a statement to Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>
"Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is now at the end of its Post-Launch roadmap with three free content updates and one DLC that released in September. We are now focusing on making the game available to more players: it was recently launched on Steam, and will be available on Mac by this winter. 
</p>
<p>
"Most of the team members who worked on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown have shifted to other projects that will benefit from their expertise.
</p>
<p>
"We know players have a love for this brand and Ubisoft is excited to bring more Prince of Persia experiences in the future."
</p>
<p>One of these is, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-now-targeting-2026-gets-briefest-of-trailers">Ubisoft's long-awaited Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake</a>, which currently sits with a 2026 release window - some six years after it was initially revealed. </p>
<p>It's unclear which projects at Ubisoft Montpellier the team behind The Lost Crown have joined, though the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-vapourware-it-seems">still toiling on Ubisoft's even-longer awaited Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Ubisoft ditches its normal formula and finds the ideal way to bring gaming's original Prince back to life," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-fabulous-exploration-and-combat">Eurogamer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/killzone-certainly-sounds-far-from-guerrillas-thoughts-the-themes-of-horizon-are-relatable-for-everyone/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/killzone-certainly-sounds-far-from-guerrilla%E2%80%99s-thoughts-%E2%80%93-%E2%80%98the-themes-of-horizon-are-relatable-for-everyone%E2%80%99.1017012/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/killzone-certainly-sounds-far-from-guerrillas-thoughts-the-themes-of-horizon-are-relatable-for-everyone/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been almost eleven years since the last Killzone game was released, and it doesn't look like that will change any time soon. Art Director Roy Postma, a Guerrilla veteran who has worked at the Dutch studio since its foundation, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/21/lego-horizon-adventures-is-all-ages-crossover-sonys-dreams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told The Washington Post</a> in no uncertain terms that the developer believes Horizon's themes are much more interesting for a bigger audience.</p>
<p><em>We were done with it as a team. As a studio, we needed to refresh the palette. It was, by choice, the opposite of ‘Killzone.’ I think the themes that this story and the characters represent are relatable for all ages and people, like having a found family of friends and finding your place in the world.</em></p>
<p>While there is truth to the assessment, and Horizon has certainly brought much greater success to Guerrilla, Killzone earned its own share of fans, too, over the four mainline installments and two spin-offs developed for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita. Its unique 'sci-fi Nazi' setting could have warranted a much greater narrative development than what we've actually seen in the games.</p>
<p>Sony has been very active in remastering its previous games, and it would be interesting to see how many players would get a Killzone: Shadow Fall remaster for PlayStation 5 and PC. The game certainly still looks good to this day and would shine even brighter on the new hardware.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, though, Guerrilla is wholly focused on Horizon. They are about to launch LEGO Horizon Adventures, a spin-off action/adventure game targeted at a younger audience. This title, co-developed with Studio Gobo, will be launched right away on PC and Nintendo Switch in addition to PlayStation 5, and there's also cooperative multiplayer for the first time in the franchise (while Guerrilla's bulk is working on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-is-guerrillas-next-big-game-with-horizon-3-a-ways-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-fledged Horizon multiplayer game</a>).</p>
<p>Next week, Nixxes will also release the controversial <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launching-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, Call of Duty fans were wrestling with the revelation that they could <strong>pay real-world money in Black Ops 6 </strong>for more effective audio. It was a topic of immediate interest that sent some players into a frenzy, with claims of ‘pay-to-hear’ surfacing across social media.</p>



<p>It’s a little simpler than that, though. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-you-pay-for-better-audio-in-black-ops-6">Can You Pay For Better Audio in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Okay, yes – you <strong>can </strong>pay for better audio in Black Ops 6, but it’s not as scandalous as it might seem at first blush.</p>



<p>Enter Embody, a ‘personalised spatial audio’ company with a mission to provide you with the best and most accurate ‘3D sound’ possible in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Recently, the company announced a premium offering that would align gamers with a ‘personalised profile’ to the tune of $19.99.</p>



<p>And that’s where the pay-to-hear concept comes from.</p>



<p>Every player accessing Black Ops 6 can access <a href="https://embody.co/pages/cod?currency=GBP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a universal profile build by Embody</a> and leaning on the ‘Immerse Spatial Audio’ system <strong>for free</strong>. It’s as simple as navigating to the sound settings menu in-game and selecting ‘Enhanced Headphone Mode’.</p>



<p>If you’d rather go above and beyond and secure a personalised profile that’s mapped to your physiology, you can pay $19.99 and grab the ‘Immerse Gamepack’. For that transaction, you’ll secure access to Embody’s system for a whopping five years. At $4 a year, that’s not a bad deal, but it’s enough to rub some players the wrong way.</p>



<p>This arrangement is available on Xbox Series XS, PlayStation, and PC (Steam, Battlenet, and Microsoft Store). It’s easier to access on PC platforms, but if you’re on a console, you just need to purchase the add-on in-game.</p>



<p>If it wasn’t already obvious, this is only useful for those playing Black Ops 6 with a headset on.</p>



<p>One of the most talked-about aspects of Black Ops 6 is the reactive, dynamic, and spatial audio. It has been boosted monumentally to allow sounds to adjust based on your local environment, and Embody has been kind enough to give everyone a nice, new profile for free.</p>



<p>It’s up to you if you want to pay $19.99 to get a better experience, of course.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-wants-to-grow-throne-and-liberty-into-a-respected-global-ip-but-cancels-two-games-amid-restructuring/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NCSOFT has announced a significant internal restructuring of its studios. The Korean publisher has created four wholly-owned subsidiaries: three independent game studios and a team dedicated to AI development. The three independent game studios are Studio X (the former Throne and Liberty team), Studio Y (which is making <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-shows-stunning-trailers-for-the-division-like-shooter-mmo-and-interactive-narrative-game-at-g-star-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project LLL</a>, an open world MMO shooter reminiscent of The Division), and Studio Z (developer of TACTAN, a strategy game).</p>
<p>NCSOFT mentioned that Throne and Liberty has demonstrated its competitiveness in the global market (it <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-already-had-3-million-players-in-its-debut-week-says-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> three million users in its first week when it launched earlier this month) and will grow into a respected global IP with the help of Studio X. Both Project LLL and TACTAN are also believed to have great potential in the global market.</p>
<p>As for the last off-shoot, NC Research is also being spun off into NC AI. This company will specialize in advancing NCSOFT's proprietary AI technologies, including VARCO LLM, and applying these innovations to game development as well as exploring new business opportunities.</p>
<p>It wasn't all good news in the announcement, though. Two games have been canceled: BATTLE CRUSH, a multiplayer action brawler that launched earlier this year on early access for PC, mobile, and Switch, and the interactive narrative game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-announces-project-m-an-interactive-narrative-game-developed-in-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project M</a>, which was highly reminiscent of Quantic Dream's games.&nbsp; As a result, some members of those teams will be reassigned to the remaining studios, while others are expected to leave the company with the newly established voluntary retirement program. NCSOFT has struggled with profitability for a few quarters, partly due to the weak Korean launch of Throne and Liberty; in the last quarter, sales were down 16.1% year-on-year, while operating profit crumbled by 75%. Following this restructuring, the publisher believes efficiency will be improved going forward.</p>
<p>By the way, the four new entities mentioned above will be officially established starting February 1, 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/batman-arkham-shadow-review.1016994/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-review-meta-quest-3<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">I know what you’re wondering: does the VR Batman game make me <em>feel</em> like Batman? Well, the answer is no. Never once in Batman: Arkham Shadow’s long playtime did I feel like I had a billion dollars, and without that the simulation will never be complete. That said, it did do a remarkably good job of making me feel like I was playing an actual Arkham game by including all of the signature elements of Rocksteady’s legendary series: literally punchy combat, intricate metroidvania-style level design that unlocks more and more as you gain new abilities, and some genuinely tricky optional puzzles. It’s a little clumsy and buggy at times, but enough of it translates well to VR that it’s more like a real game than a gimmick – and the mystery story pays off well without retreading too many of the Arkham series’ plots. And sure, while grabbing at your sides and raising your arms to glide around on your cape may look absolutely absurd to anyone who happens to be in the room with you as you play, I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t pretty fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sequel to a prequel is wedged into the space between <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-review">Arkham Origins</a> (and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-blackgate-review">Arkham Origins: Blackgate</a>) and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/11/batman-arkham-asylum-review">Arkham Asylum</a> – a time period where a younger Batman is bluntly but capably voiced by Roger Craig Smith rather than the late, great <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kevin-conroy-voice-of-batman-in-animated-series-and-arkham-games-dies-aged-66">Kevin Conroy</a>. After a brief intro sequence in Gotham’s sewers and rubbing elbows with Jim Gordon and a young, one-faced Harvey Dent, we go undercover into Blackgate Prison, where Batman first encounters the likes of Doctors Harlene Quinzel and Jonathan Crane, Arnold Wesker (The Ventriloquist), Barbra Gordon, and a few more. Naturally the developers at Camouflaj can’t help retread things we’ve seen done to death: It wouldn’t really be an Arkham game without a Scarecrow hallucination sequence, for instance – and, of course, we’re treated to yet another reenactment of Crime Alley. However, the new mystery villain known as The Rat King and his populist cult, paired with the over-the-top sadist prison warden Bolton, give Arkham Shadow enough of its own material to work with that it doesn’t feel too derivative.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another novel approach is to have Bruce Wayne visit his makeshift Batcave under Blackgate (like the one under Arkham Asylum) to swap between two costumes. He wears his full Batman regalia by night, but when the Batsuit’s back on the rack he slaps on a Mission: Impossible mask of a two-bit thug named Matches Malone, who’s been thrown in with Gotham’s worst for petty arson. There’s some gadget-less prison yard brawling to be done as Malone, but these sections are much more about ingratiating yourself to incarcerated mob boss Carmine Falcone and the other prisoners, and getting the lay of the maze-like prison yard as the days tick down to The Rat King’s grand plan. I won’t say I wasn’t eager to put the cape and cowl back on by the end of each session as Matches, but the change of pace and perspective isn’t unwelcome considering that there’s only so much variety one can find within the walls and absurdly high-tech doors of a prison, and the dark caverns below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On that note, despite this running on a tiny machine that’s strapped to your face, Arkham Shadow is easily on par with Arkham Asylum as it looked on the Xbox 360 in terms of its character models and textures (and obviously running at a much higher resolution and frame rate), if not quite up to that level of art direction or the scale of its open areas. Of course, that’s an extremely high bar, to be fair. It’s certainly the best-looking Quest-exclusive game I’ve played, likely because it’s exclusive to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3/3S</a> and doesn’t have to compromise for compatibility with older models. Glimpsing my bat-eared shadow as I walked down a hall or glided around with a light behind me was always a treat. Those heavy doors do often take a while to open, though, since they’re masking a lot of loading of the new area you’re traveling to. And be ready to recharge your Quest 3 four or five times to get through Arkham Shadow’s story, which can run 10 hours if you’re not stopping to smell the many Rat puzzles along the way. (It’s probably good to come up for air after a couple of hours in VR, anyway.) </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The fact that you’re usually being circled by several other thugs means you have to work fast to put an enemy down.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Brawling works surprisingly well and, after things ramped up a bit to introduce enemies with armor, stun batons, shields, knives, and guns, most requiring different takedown moves, I was working up a sweat throwing physical punches that do more damage if you swing like you mean it. Here it’s less about timing punches and more about pausing for a split second after the first smack – which can send you lunging about 10 feet toward a target – to see which sequence randomly opens up: sometimes you’ll do a right, a left, or a gut-punch, others you’ll have three spots to jab at, or sometimes you’ll grab a leg and be prompted to snap it like a twig. It occasionally interprets a swing from the side as a straight-on punch or vice versa, but otherwise it’s pretty satisfying. That’s enough to keep it from being mindless flailing, but the fact that you’re usually being circled by several other thugs means you have to work fast to put an enemy down before you see an incoming attack icon in your peripheral vision and have to detour to block it with a Michael Keaton-esque no-look punch to the side, which pulls you to a different target, so the pressure is on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Certain enemies need to be staggered before you can beat on them, so you’ll have to use abilities like confusing them with a cape swing, or flipping over them with a forward flick of the right stick and punching them from behind. It’s easy enough to do this in the most straightforward way possible, but the opportunity to run up the score with unbroken combos and mixing in multiple gadgets like batarangs and explosive charges brings in a very stylish element of challenge beyond simply staying alive. You also have to dodge unblockable attacks with the thumbsticks and physically duck under knife attacks. There’s certainly plenty going on – with more regularly opening up as you unlock new gadgets by progressing the story – to keep these fights and the optional standalone challenges interesting (and repeatable!).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Predator battles work almost identically to the way they do in traditional Arkham games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The stealthy Predator battles, on the other hand, work almost identically to the way they do in traditional Arkham games in that you’re staying hidden as you take down gun-toting enemies who can quickly kill you if they spot you, but they’re a little more frustrating because the controls lack the precision needed to consistently avoid detection. The number of times I snuck up behind an enemy, and reached out to grab and silently choke him out, but accidentally punched him in the head and alerted his friends instead was, to be frank, too high by a lot. I eventually learned to do this extremely carefully – with emergency escape smoke bombs at the ready – to avoid taking a lead shower, but that felt like working around a problem rather than learning a system. Even so, it’s never anything less than gleeful to drop down from a gargoyle perch, grab a thug, and leave him helplessly dangling like a pinata for his friends to find.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also get a handful of boss fights – mostly against the obvious opponents – and although these are a nice change of pace while they last, only one late-game one is all that memorable and none of them are especially interesting on a mechanical level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without the Riddler around to stash question marks everywhere, the Rat cultists have picked up puzzle duty in Blackgate, and their work ranges from trivially easy to respectably tricky and rewarding to solve. Reaching smashable rat statues and radios spreading the King’s propaganda is often a matter of turning left where the obvious path goes right, but frequently involves unlocking doors, crawling through vents, climbing pipes, and more to get the right angle – or deciphering patterns to work out codes to door locks by switching in and out of Detective mode by tapping your temple. Most of Detective mode is pretty straightforward, though – there’s none of the more ambitious crime scene reconstruction stuff from Arkham Knight. Most of it, especially the crime-scene investigation sequences, is basically just doling out plot information one piece at a time. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are plenty of Easter eggs to find around Blackgate.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration is, of course, a big part of any Arkham game, and there are plenty of Easter eggs to find around Blackgate. Much of it comes in the form of phone numbers that can be dialed at the prison pay phone to hear recorded messages from various characters. References to Batman lore in chatter from other prisoners and scattered around the environment didn’t appear quite as thick as they are in Rocksteady’s games – which is honestly another off-the-charts standard to hold any game to, especially when the best material has already been thoroughly mined – but it’s not in short supply.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Dan's Arkham Ranking</h3><p>From most Arkham-est to least Arkham-est.

No, I never played Arkham Origins: Blackgate but I read the plot summary on Wikipedia.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that’s a little too easy to find at this point, though, are bugs. I’m told there’s a patch in the works to address at least some of this, but even after launch this review was delayed by about a day because I wasn’t able to complete the story thanks to a repeated crash while trying to disarm a bomb, due to the fact I’d done things in an order other than what was precisely intended. That was after multiple crashes before that point, and I also had to reload saves because I fell through the world multiple times and got stuck on level geometry. I had plenty of audio stuttering, saw long load times when returning from the map screen, lost the ability to use my batarang during a boss fight that required it, and had a couple of puzzles made much more difficult than they should’ve been because key items didn’t highlight in Detective mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn’t as smooth a ride as I’d have liked, but I did see the ending and was pleased with it. I won’t say much about how it turned out other than that, while I did see one big reveal coming a mile away, there was more to it that caught me off guard in a way that made me smile. I don’t think it’s much of a spoiler to say that the Rat King does <em>not</em> turn out to be The Joker, and in fact Camouflaj is admirably restrained in its use of Batman’s nemesis. After the big, eye-rolling reveal of Arkham Origins, and the enormous posthumous role he played in Arkham Knight, leaning on that crutch once again would’ve annoyed me to no end; I breathed a sigh of relief when other characters got some time in the spotlight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the whole it’s a very well done Batman story, and the dialogue is generally strong except for a few <em>very</em> on-the-nose lines where Batman bluntly declares “I <em>will</em> find the Rat King; I <em>will</em> stop his night of wrath!” or when Barbara Gordon acts like an annoying tween fangirl. There's also a <em>very</em> conspicuous loose end left dangling at the end of the story that concerned me until I was told it's intentional, so we'll just have to see where that goes.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Batman: Arkham Shadow does an admirable job of adapting almost everything I love about the Arkham series to work in a full-fledged VR game, and it’s impressive looking for a game that’s exclusive to the standalone Meta Quest 3 headset. There are a few hitches and aggravating bugs that mean some parts don’t work quite as well as others, but its vigorous brawling, exploration, tricky puzzle solving, and stealth are all in full effect as you sneak and punch your way through Blackgate prison in a twisting undercover pursuit of a mysterious cult leader where just about everybody’s a suspect. It’s certainly smaller in scale than any full game since Arkham Asylum, but it’s far larger and more built-out than you might expect after Batman: Arkham VR, and a return to an enclosed prison setting makes it feel dense and intricate. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Note that unlike the Play &amp; Charge Kit which has a USB-C port, this pack uses a Micro USB port. We would have liked to see this pack equipped with a USB-C port as well, but at this price we're not complaining. Besides, a Micro USB cable is included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">6amLifestyle states that each battery pack can last up to 40 hours of continuous playtime and can charge from empty to full in about four hours. That's pretty similar to the Play &amp; Charge Kit's claim of 30 hours of playtime and four-hour charge time, which makes sense since both packs have the same 1,400mAh capacity. There's also a little LED indicator that changes from red to green when it's fully recharged. Having two batteries also means you can immediately swap over to another pack when the first one is depleted, thus minimizing your downtime. At this price, you can't go wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more Xbox deals?

            <p>
Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 has only been out a couple of months, but already a sequel's on the horizon - albeit not in the way you might immediately assume. Games Workshop has confirmed Warhammer 40K's appearance in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">Amazon's upcoming Secret Level series</a> will take the form of an animated Space Marine 2 sequel.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level, if you're unfamiliar, is a new 15-episode animated anthology series from the creators of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s Love, Death &amp; Robots, with each episode featuring "original stories set within the worlds of some of the most beloved video games". Those games include Armored Core, Concord, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, Pac-Man, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>, a variety of PlayStation Studios games, and, of course,  Warhammer 40K.
</p>
<p>
All that we already knew, but in a <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/2iuskcvl/secret-level-warhammer-animation-news-out-of-new-york-comic-con/">post</a> on the Warhammer Community website (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-40000-secret-level-animation-is-a-sequel-to-space-marine-2">IGN</a>), Games Workshop now shared more on the franchise's upcoming Secret Level episode. For starters, it'll be directed by Tim Miller, with Dave Wilson (responsible for Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War's iconic intro movie) serving as executive producer and supervising director.

<p>
As for specifics, Games Workshop has confirmed - as some sharp-eyed fans had already speculated after the release of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLihxsmI_OU">Secret Level's teaser trailer</a> - that the episode is indeed a sequel to this year's acclaimed Warhammer 40K shooter Space Marine 2, and follows the conclusion of the game "like a... secret level". Additionally, Clive Standen is onboard, once again voicing Space Marine protagonist Captain Demetrian Titus.
</p><p>
And that's about all we know so far. However, Games Workshop notes a new trailer for the Secret Level series - presumably showing off a bit more of that Space Marine 2 sequel action - is on the way after its recent New York Comic Con reveal, and that fans "won't have to wait too long to see it". As for the series itself, it's set to air on Prime Video from 10th December.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wayfinder-launches-out-of-early-access-with-new-features-and-character/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Wayfinder is a 3-player Co-Op ARPG from the game studio <a href="https://www.airshipsyndicate.com/wayfinder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airship Syndicate</a>, the creators of the iconic and beloved <a href="https://wccftech.com/darksiders-art-darksiders-4/">Darksiders</a> franchise. Today, the game launched out of Early Access and brought with it a ton of new content for players to explore. The 1.0 release includes new massive open-world areas such as The Crucible, as well as a new Wayfinder to play named Lora, who is the third Arcanist to join the roster. Additionally, there are over 5 new dungeons to explore, and the progression and loot system has been revamped to make for a more fun experience for the players.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are eight heroes in total, including Lora, each having their own abilities and playstyles, providing something for everyone. If you are intrigued by the game but don't like to play in co-op, this game is entirely playable in single-player, and you can work your way through the campaign, which will take you through Lost Zones.</p>
<p>In total, there are 13 different Lost Zone dungeons, with the dungeons being different each time you explore them. There are over 3,000 weapons, armor pieces, housing items, and other collectibles that can ensure you have a unique experience in the game, allowing players to customize their Wayfinders to their liking.</p>
<p>This includes crafting your own unique build, which can be done by using the talent trees and Wayfinder Ranks in the game. Additionally, the Echoes system has been revamped. The game has randomized loot and armor, meaning no two builds you do will ever be the same. The Wayfinders need to be unlocked, but this can be done early in the game, so you don't have to grind to unlock new characters. Below is a trailer to celebrate the launch of Wayfinder 1.0, giving players a glimpse into what they can expect in the new vibrant update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wayfinder 1.0 Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FdQcr1GYJhY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lora is known as The Vessel, and is a vessel of a primal spirit that is so terrifying it scares her allies. Lora has the ability to harness the power of the Avatar, with her abilities having alternate versions due to her passive, which is called "Channeling."</p>
<p>For those who are eager to get stuck in the game, Wayfinder is currently available on Steam and PlayStation 5, with the game set to join Xbox at a later date in the month. The game costs $24.99 and has no micro transactions to worry about.</p>
<p>With the full release of the game, Wayfinder now supports cross-play across all platforms, meaning you'll be able to team up with your friends, even if they're on PC and you're on PlayStation, for example. Additionally, you will be able to continue your adventure on any platform, regardless of whether you're playing solo or co-op. To make the game more accessible, there have been performance optimizations for low-end machines, and the game is playable on the Steam Deck, allowing you to cozy up on the couch or in bed playing Wayfinder.</p>

                <p>We've seen Ghost Face in a number of video games already, namely <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-by-daylight/" data-ref-id="5000-452548">Dead By Daylight</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/among-us/" data-ref-id="5000-488791">Among Us</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>. Now, the iconic killer first seen in Wes Craven's 1996 genre-defying film, Scream, is coming to a new game. On October 24, you can find Ghost Face in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hunt-showdown/" data-ref-id="5000-283965">Hunt: Showdown</a> as the western-horror extraction shooter gets its debut licensed character skin.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4388986-unnamed%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388986" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4388986-unnamed%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4388986"></a><figcaption>He'd ask what your favorite scary movie is, but they haven't been invented yet in the Hunt universe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4388986-unnamed%289%29.jpg"></figure><p>The Ghost Face Rampage DLC includes the character skin, two weapons, and a tool--a knife, fittingly. The weapons included in the bundle are Hush (a Frontier 73C Silencer) and Whisper (a Bornheim No. 3 Silencer). The stealthy toolset is well-imagined for the sneaky star of the Scream franchise. If only Hunt: Showdown had some sort of telephone analog so Ghost Face could call and harass other players exploring the map each round.</p><p>Like in Dead By Daylight, the character has been given a makeover to suit the world, including a 19th-century-style hat and duster jacket. The iconic mask is now made of wood rather than rubber, too. Though Hunt hasn't previously done licensed crossovers, we arguably should've seen this coming, given its ongoing Halloween event is called Harvest of Ghosts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/adidas-ultraboost-history-1-0<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been collecting sneakers for around 25 years now. In that time I've seen everything from the emergence of Dunks to...<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/comments/1bgefl6/the_nike_dunk_hype_is_finally_over_almost_every/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the return of the Dunk</a>, and everything in between. I've also owned and worn a lot of shoes in that time, but today, I want to tell you about my favourite. The story of the greatest sneaker ever made.</p><p>It is the early 2010's. Adidas, one of the world's largest sportswear companies, is in the dumps. Nike, their main competitor, has been eating their lunch for years and the company, once synonymous with everything from football to streetwear, is falling short on all fronts. An over-reliance on Adidas' heritage (and the celebrity endorsements that went along with it), coupled with the emergence of new rivals like Under Armor, had left the three stripes in a pretty bad way. </p><p>Adversity can breed innovation, though, and it was during these doldrums that AIT (Adidas Innovation Team) linked up with, of all companies, BASF. While maybe best known to consumers as the VHS Guys, BASF are actually a German chemicals company who in the late 2000's had developed a material known as Infinergy, which was notable for three things: it was soft, it could return energy if compressed, and it could withstand all kinds of conditions and temperatures.</p><p>Both companies quickly saw potential in this (<a href="https://www.sneakerfreaker.com/news/adidas-tried-stop-puma-using-boost-tech-got-shut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as did Puma, whose part in this is a whole other story</a>), with BASF eventually selling the Infinergy technology to Adidas, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190716234616/https://www.adidas.com/us/blog/373504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where it was renamed "Boost"</a>. Produced as small thermoplastic polyurethane pellets--not too different in appearance from the foam balls you fill a beanbag with--Adidas' plan for Boost involved heating these pellets to form larger masses of the material, which AIT believed could be a modern and radical replacement for stuff like EVA foam as the midsole of choice for running shoes.</p><p>The technology made its debut in 2013 on a sneaker known as the Energy Boost. BASF's quaint corporate video from the time gives a scientific breakdown of how the shoe, and Boost, worked:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="New BASF foam Infinergy revolutionizes adidas running shoe" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dH2aKoby1zg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>From a technological standpoint, this was <em>revolutionary</em>. Footwear had never seen anything like this, and just a year later, wearing the second shoe to feature Boost--the adizero Adios Boost--Dennis Kimetto ran what was then the fastest marathon of <em>all time</em>. All of which was great for people making corporate videos and writing Adidas' press releases, but for all its scientific potential, Boost--which was being exclusively targeted at performance runners--wasn't quite taking off in terms of sales. </p><p>Then magic happened. In early 2015 Adidas released a third Boost shoe known then as simply the UltraBoost. Again targeted at serious runners, it featured a full Boost midsole (previous shoes hadn't quite allowed the material to run all the way along the sole) along with a second innovation: an upper that was made of not leather or mesh but Primeknit, Adidas' soft, almost sweater-like knit that felt more like a sock than a shoe.</p><figure><figcaption>Say what you will about Kanye West today, in 2015 those Triple White UltraBoost 1.0s were incredible.</figcaption></figure><p>While <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2015/01/22/adidas-ultra-boost-trainer-revolutionise-running-knitted-upper-energy-return-midsole/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed for and marketed at performance athletes</a>, this is not where the shoe's legacy would lie. Because in May 2015, back when he was actually a bonafide global superstar, Kanye West wore a pair of all-white UltraBoosts onstage at the Billboard Music Awards, and suddenly the shoe started picking up interest from a whole other demographic: sneakerheads.</p><p>The state of the serious end of the sneaker market in 2015 was much the same as it is now: people were exhausted by endless rereleases and rehashes of "classics". Into this malaise, the futuristic UltraBoost--and Adidas' NMD, released at the same time and featuring much of the same technology, only designed specifically for casual use--were something <em>new</em>. That made them <em>exciting</em>, and coupled with scarcity (Boost was expensive and Adidas hadn't been ready for sneakerheads to start blowing up demand for it, so only a single factory on the entire planet could produce the sneakers) and a prize piece of celebrity endorsement, the UltraBoost, a shoe originally designed for runners, was about to become one of the most hyped and sought-after sneakers of the decade.</p><figure><figcaption>One of the earliest colourways of the 1.0, and still one of the most revered, are the "Creams". You could wear these <em>anywhere</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>From 2015 to around 2018, the UltraBoost felt unstoppable. It was particularly triumphant in 2016, though, as Adidas was able to successfully pivot away from designing colourways for runners and start retooling the shoe to speak to sneakerheads instead. <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2020/5/adidas-ultraboost-history-impact-5th-anniversary-retrospective" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This 2020 retrospective on Hypebeast</a> details just how explosive demand for the UltraBoost got during 2015-16:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s pretty hard to overstate how big UltraBOOSTs were in those early days of StockX, and most were in-line, simple colorways,” says Jesse Einhorn, senior economist at StockX. “[In 2015] the aftermarket was dominated and monopolized by Jordan Brand. There just wasn’t the same kind of brand diversity and competition you see now, and the UltraBOOST really opened the door more than any other sneaker for the modern-day resell market, where you have a variety of different power players and focal points all competing for people’s attention and money.”</p><p>The proof is in the numbers. “<a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/campless" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Campless</a>&nbsp;[a secondary market tracking platform created by StockX founder&nbsp;<a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/josh-luber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Josh Luber</a>] data from 2014-2015 showed that adidas’ entire aftermarket share in 2014 was less than one percent. By 2015, when the UltraBOOST launched it was at 20%, and when StockX launched in 2016, over half of the secondary sneaker market was adidas” says Einhorn. “Ten of StockX’s top 100 best-selling sneakers in 2016 were UltraBOOSTS. More than 90 percent of all UltraBOOSTS on StockX sold for more than retail. There were more UltraBOOSTS than&nbsp;<a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/air-jordan-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Air Jordan 1</a>s on the list in 2016.”</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>To give a more personal example of just how red-hot demand for the sneaker was, between 2015-17 I essentially had a second job as an UltraBoost reseller, buying second-hand shoes from runners who had been early adopters, repairing and restoring them, then reselling them to sneakerheads for $100-200 profit at a time.</p><figure><figcaption>An example of a restoration job I did on a pair of "OG" UltraBoosts, the very first colourway to release in 2015. I bought them for $40 from someone local who had used them as runners and they were beat to shit. After repainting the midsole, stripping the plastic heelcup and cage to remove scratches and blemishes, deep-cleaning the knit and repainting the UltraBoost logo on the heel, I sold them for $150.</figcaption></figure><p>I love everything about this shoe. I love the idea behind it; that it's something based on innovative technology, a shoe pushing boundaries, trying to do something new in an industry that in so many ways is shackled to the past or copying the innovations of others. I love how they look; the arrowhead knit pattern on the toebox, bubbly midsole and angular cage (the plastic on the side that the laces tied into) made them look like something from a space program, a shoe made for Mars, not Earth. It also helped that, despite their original athletic intent, more subdued colourways proved to be extremely versatile shoes, looking just as good paired with some pants at the pub as they did some shorts at the beach.</p><p>The thing that blew most people away at the time, though, was the comfort. To frame it in video game terms, wearing Boost for the first time in 2015 after decades spent walking on foam felt like the leap from <em>Super Mario World</em> to <em>Mario 64</em>. Nobody had ever walked in a shoe that comfortable before and, thanks to the diminishing returns of sneaker technology since, may never again. To wear UltraBoosts felt like walking on clouds, the midsole able to absorb even the heaviest step, so not only did they look great, but you could also wear them all day.</p><figure><figcaption>One of the more interesting early pairs was this collaboration with Danish brand Wood Wood, which led to a women's shoe with a wrapped cage (left) and a men's shoe that had alternating red and blue features on the left and right sneaker. </figcaption></figure><p>A lot is made of Kanye's involvement in the shoe's popularity in a lot of retrospectives, but I think that's a little overblown. He may have sparked sneakerheads' initial interest in the UltraBoost, but it was Adidas' subsequent laser-sharp marketing of it that <em>really</em> led to the sneaker's success. Sneakers trying to tap into to the streetwear scene normally rely on endorsements from athletes and megacelebs, big licenses and brands (see Nike's recent reliance on Travis Scott and Drake), but the UltraBoost's most sought after releases in its early days were collaborations with boutique fashion outlets, streetwear companies and even menswear websites. Shoes made with/for SNS, Hypebeast, Wood Wood, Highsnobiety, Kolor and Kith really spoke to the scene from the ground level, and made it seem like the UltraBoost was being made <em>just</em> for sneakerheads.</p><p>It helped that these insider collabs resulted in some of the UltraBoost's best designs and colourways. Most were understated, simple, dare I say it even tasteful, but there was still room for further innovation as well: a couple of the collabs had taken note that some experimental fans had started cutting the shoe's plastic cage off, so they simply shipped with their cage already gone. Other early standouts included a pair made of merino wool--procured around 40 mins from my house!--and a line based on college sports programs, with Miami's in particularly being some of the most sought after. I ended up owning a ton of UltraBoosts from this time period, ranging from OGs (the first UltraBoost colourway ever released) to Creams, Kolors (more on those in a minute) to a red pair so bright they were called "Solar Red".</p><figure><figcaption>One of the few 1.0s to elude my grasp are the Solebox collab, which shipped with the sneaker's plastic cage already removed (something the Hypebeast version also managed)</figcaption></figure><p>As incredible as the UltraBoost's run in 2015-16 had been, though, in the world of fashion nothing lasts forever. As the UltraBoost moved into the late 2010's, and Kanye's own Yeezy line of Adidas sneakers increasingly captured a lot of the public's imagination, Adidas started getting sloppy. Rather than continue to refine and release new colourways of the original UltraBoost--now known as the UltraBoost 1.0--in 2016 they had dropped the UltraBoost 2.0, UltraBoost 3 <em>and </em>UltraBoost Uncaged in quick succession, new models that retained the overall shape of the shoe but messed with its visual consistency by switching up the knit pattern. And after getting its collabs so right early on, a shift to corny tie-ins like <em>Game of Thrones</em> sapped the line of some of that hard-earned cred.</p><p>These final days of the UltraBoost's golden age still produced some good efforts from time to time--A Kind of Guise and Engineered Garments' collabs are particular faves of mine--but by 2018, with Adidas having flooded the market with derivative, less appealing UltraBoost models (they'd followed the disappointing UltraBoost 3.0 with...the even uglier UltraBoost 4.0), the writing was on the wall. The original UltraBoost had blown up in part because it was futuristic and interesting, sure, but they were also hard to find, and sneakerheads love nothing more than a shoe that's hard to find. </p><p>I remember when I finally got hold of a pair of Kolors--my all-time favourite colourway, with only a handful of pairs released worldwide--and on a trip to Sydney being repeatedly stopped in the street, and in sneaker stores, by people wanting to talk about them. Once you could just walk into a store and buy a pair of UltraBoosts, pairs that had been produced in their tens of thousands instead of hundreds, for many they became just another pair of general release shoes among countless others options.</p><figure><figcaption>My all-time favourite UB colourway, this is a collaboration with Japanese fashion label Kolor</figcaption></figure><p>Desperate to keep some kind of momentum going, in 2018 Adidas even tried re-releasing two of the most popular early colourways, the OG and Creams, but nothing could be done. <a href="https://proofculture.com/blogs/blog/adidas-ultra-boost-in-memoriam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The circle of hype had run its course, and by 2019 the UltraBoost's golden age was over</a>, with that year's complete redesign--dubbed the UltraBoost 19, and sharing no parts or designs with previous iterations--<a href="https://news.adidas.com/running/adidas-running-unveils-the-new-ultraboost-19--the-most-responsive-ultraboost-ever/s/839ffad4-69b8-4627-b902-027ced52727b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reverting the shoe to its original athletic purpose</a>. Subsequent models have only continued this trend; as they've become less interesting for collectors they've become better and better athletic shoes, culminating in the recently-released UltraBoost 5, <a href="https://believeintherun.com/shoe-reviews/adidas-ultraboost-5x-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is getting the kind of reception among runners the original UltraBoost was supposed to receive</a>.</p><p>While Adidas' shift of focus for the line has taken the UltraBoost 1.0 out of the spotlight, it's not like the shoe is <em>dead</em>. Far from it; a testament to its success is that it's been elevated (as perhaps the most contemporary member) to the ranks of an all-time shoe, a sneaker that will live forever, in a pantheon alongside other eternals like the AJ1 and Superstar. To this day Adidas still releases new 1.0 colourways, still does collabs and given the company's appetite for selling the same shoes forever (Sambas!), will probably do so for as long as there's an Adidas.</p><figure><figcaption>Another classic collab was 2016's Highsnobiety (disclaimer: I have written for the site) x UltraBoost</figcaption></figure><p>I don't want you to think this shoe's story is <em>just </em>about hype, how fickle it can be and how commoditised sneakerheads have become. I mean, it's partly about that, but there's more to it. Loads of shoes are "hyped" and are of zero interest to me, and when the UltraBoost 1.0's light faded I didn't suddenly lose interest in the shoe, like Andy dropping Woody in the trash, nor did the sneaker entirely disappear from the face of the planet. If anything its decline has been great news for me, because as their value has plummeted on the resale market I've been able to get hold of pairs that used to be out of reach for me for relative pocket change!</p><p>The UltraBoost 1.0 isn't just another shoe, and there was more to it than a few years spent as the darling of the sneaker world. The engineering behind it is fascinating. It's an accidental superstar, emerging as a fashion staple when it was supposed to be a performance running shoe. It's a rare example of a huge company--at first, anyway--dealing directly with fans in a way that felt complimentary to a culture, not exploitative of it. Then it's demise is as sad as it was predictable, when that same company inevitably couldn't help itself and squeezed something beautiful to death.</p><p>Like most products, especially ones that end up having "fans", the UltraBoost 1.0 can be admired strictly as an object, sure. But its origins and place in the market at a point in time are just as important to its story as the materials that went into it. And the UltraBoost's story was, for a shoe, one hell of a story.</p><figure><figcaption>Just some of the 1.0s I've owned over the years</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Could&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>&nbsp;be one such example? Here’s everything you need to know.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196394" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="196394,195755,196424" data-current="196394"><div><p>The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21942.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Early word suggests that like <em>Half Life: Alyx</em> before it, <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> could be a stellar showing for the VR world, that grants full control of the world’s greatest detective as he solves a new mystery in Gotham City—and beats down a bunch of bad guys in the process, obviously. If you’ve been curious about <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> let’s see if we can answer your questions.</p><h2 id="h50331"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> a direct sequel?</strong></h2><p>It’s been a long while since we’ve received a game in the <em>Arkham</em> series, so you might be delighted to hear that <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> is set within that same universe.</p><p>Taking place between the events of <em>Batman: Arkham Origins</em> and <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em>, it casts you as the Caped Crusader once again, as he seeks to protect Gotham City from a fresh threat known as the Rat King. This new villain has abducted a variety of officials from the city, with plans for their execution, giving Batman only a week to rescue them and enact justice once more.</p><p>Despite being part of the grander <em>Arkham</em> universe, though, you shouldn’t feel the need to have played the other games in the series. While there are plenty of references and plot points that franchise fans will no doubt pick up on, <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> remains a perfectly enjoyable standalone Gotham adventure.</p><h2 id="h50332"><a id=""></a><strong>Who developed <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>?</strong></h2><p><em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> was developed by Meta-owned developer Camouflaj, the team behind 2020's fairly well-received PSVR exclusive, <em>Iron Man VR</em>. Before getting bought by Meta to work in-house on VR games, Camouflaj also made episodic stealth game, <em>République</em>.</p><h2 id="h50333"><a id=""></a><strong>What platforms is <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> available for?</strong></h2><p><em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> is exclusively available for the Meta Quest 3 VR headset. As of this writing, Camouflaj has not revealed any plans to bring the game to competing headsets like PlayStation VR2, although given they’re owned by Meta, that seems very unlikely. It’s Meta Quest 3 or nothing if you’re interested in playing it anytime soon.</p><p>The good news is that anyone who buys a Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S before April 25, 2025 will receive <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> included with the purchase of the headset. If you’ve been VR-curious but haven’t taken the plunge yet, I’d say that’s a pretty good incentive!</p><p>That being said, the Meta Quest 3 can feel a bit pricey at $499. If you don’t mind the slight (though admittedly noticeable) downgrade in pixel count and resolution, the Meta Quest 3S retains a lot of the same technology for $299.</p><h2 id="h50334"><a id=""></a><strong>Who voices Batman in <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="8f6d68257895a65b2a630fe27c8c473b" data-recommend-id="image://8f6d68257895a65b2a630fe27c8c473b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A very VR screenshot of hands extending toward a blue enemy who appears to have giant birthday cake candles on his back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A very VR screenshot of hands extending toward a blue enemy who appears to have giant birthday cake candles on his back." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Oculus Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8f6d68257895a65b2a630fe27c8c473b" data-recommend-id="image://8f6d68257895a65b2a630fe27c8c473b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A very VR screenshot of hands extending toward a blue enemy who appears to have giant birthday cake candles on his back." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Fans will be thrilled to hear that <em>Arkham Origins’</em> Roger Craig Smith returns once again to voice The Dark Knight himself. Smith, also known for voicing popular video game characters like Ezio from Assassin’s Creed and Chris Redfield from Resident Evil, is often rated as one of the best actors to bring life to Bruce Wayne and his ass-kicking detective alter ego, since the sad death of Kevin Conroy in 2022.</p><p>Other notable stars in the game include Elijah Wood as Scarecrow, Tara Strong as Harley Quinn, Troy Baker as Harvey Dent, and The Walking Dead’s Khary Payton as The Ratcatcher (not to be confused with the Rat King). All in all, it’s clearly a star-studded cast.<br></p><h2 id="h50335"><a id=""></a><strong>How long is <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>?</strong></h2><p>Many VR games are on the shorter side, so you may be surprised to hear that <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> can take quite a while to complete. As a matter of fact, clearing the game without any side content can take <strong>8 to 10 hours</strong>. If you want to see and do everything in this VR recreation of Gotham City, you can spend up to <strong>15 hours</strong> tracking down various types of collectibles and completing unique challenges.<br></p><hr><p><em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> is available now on Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S for $49.99.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's been a couple of month since Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-announced-via-playstation-listing">revealed</a> its beloved dark fantasy action-adventures Legacy of Kain: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> 1 &amp; 2 were poised to get the remaster treatment. And now, with the two-game bundle's December release looming, remaster developer Aspyr has detailed a few of the enhancements the spruce-ups will bring.
</p>
<p>
All this comes via a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/22/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-first-look-at-bosses-new-map-details/">post on the PlayStation Blog</a> that's mostly concerned with showing off the games' bosses, so you might want to stay clear - and clear of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsaUOvp6to">trailer</a> below - if you're new to the series or have forgotten everything in the 25-ish years since Soul Reaver 1 launched.
</p>
<p>
What we also get, though, is confirmation of remodelling, retexturing, and, in at least one case, re-sliming to enhance the original boss roster's looks, and that's on top of a "completely redesigned" model for antagonist Kain - necessary to "mitigate textural issues".

<p>
"With the increased polygon count we felt it was important to bring his look a lot closer to the Kain we got to see in the original FMVs, which was a lot more detailed and showed more-or-less what the original intent was for the character," Aspyr notes. "The original model in SR1 was especially limited so now both games have a Kain that looks consistent between the two titles."
</p><p>
Those refreshed looks were at least partly expected, of course, thanks to Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2  Remastered's announcement trailer, but Aspyr has also now confirmed a number of other new features. Both games now include a map and compass, for instance, that Aspr says "blends modern gameplay conveniences with the preservation of the explorative experience the original titles were known for."
</p>
<p>The compass "gently nudges the player in the right direction without giving away specific details of where to go", while the map is described as "more of a reference tool than a guide". Additionally, there's a collection tracker, showing whether players have found all collectibles in each area. But for long-time fans looking to get a slightly more traditional Legacy of Kain experience, Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2's remastered visuals can be switched out for those of the original, and the compass can be turned off in the settings menu.
</p>

Crystal Dynamics first hinted it was considering a Legacy of Kain revival back in 2022, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-wants-your-thoughts-on-legacy-of-kain">surveyed fans</a> asking if they'd be interested in seeing the series return. And now, some two years after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-hears-legacy-of-kain-fans-loudly-and-clearly-following-huge-survey-response">100,000 people responded positively</a>, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered is set to launch for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Series X/S, Switch, and PC on 10th December.

		<p>A couple of weeks ago, Sports Interactive announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/football-manager-25-has-now-been-delayed-to-march-2025/">Football Manager 25 had been delayed to March 2025</a>, pushed right back from its November release date and towards the end of the 2024/25 season. This prompted some calls from the community to update Football Manager 24 with the data from the 2024/25 football season. Sports Interactive has now responded to this request, and has had to rule out such an update.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sports Interactive said,<em> “Following the announcement of the delay of FM25, many of you have called for an official FM24 update with season 2024/25 data. This is something we have been exploring since the initial internal conversation about postponing the game’s release. Having now scoped the work that would be required, and despite a good initial response from many of our licensors, we cannot lift assets that we are using in FM25 and make them work in FM24 without recreating them in full. The same applies to many competition rules, translations, and database changes that cannot be back ported. The updated assets and data would both be required to obtain licensor approval-they cannot be separated.&nbsp;</em></p>


<p><em>This is a substantial undertaking which would take critical resources away from delivering FM25 to the highest quality, which we simply cannot compromise on. If you have pre-purchased FM25 and wish to seek a refund please contact your retailer. We sincerely thank you for your patience. We are passionately committed to delivering the best game possible when we release in March 2025.”</em></p>
<p>It is still not clear what impact this will have on the release schedule of future Football Manager games, as it is unlikely that Football Manager 26 will be ready by the end of 2025, unless that is database update only. The switch to a new engine and fundamental changes to the gameplay has already seen features stripped from Football Manager 25 including, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">international management</a>, which should return in future games, touchline shouts, create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. Football Manager 25 will have the official Premier League license and women’s football for the first time in its history.</p>

The Naughty Dog hit and other blockbusters are now starting to reveal just exactly what modes will become available to players who decide to spend $700 on Sony’s newest console. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,195410,196358" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>The Last of Us Part I</em>’s PS5 Pro enhancements were outlined this week in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://feedback.naughtydog.com/hc/en-us/articles/31374641280276-The-Last-of-Us-Part-I-Patch-2-00&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://feedback.naughtydog.com/hc/en-us/articles/31374641280276-The-Last-of-Us-Part-I-Patch-2-00" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2.0 patch notes list</a></span> over on the studio’s website. The remaster’s existing Performance and Fidelity modes will still be options, and each will run better due to the PS5 Pro’s beefier specs. But a new “Pro” mode will also appear in the settings that runs the game at a native 1440p upscaled to 4K using PSSR while “maintaining” a target framerate of 60fps. </p><p>This is the PS5 Pro experience as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-specs-release-date-sony-preorder-1851644442&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-specs-release-date-sony-preorder-1851644442">architect Mark Cerny described</a></span> in the original reveal. Instead of sacrificing visual quality for smoother framerates, the new hardware can deliver the best of both worlds without compromises. But when it comes to developers actually delivering updates to their games to take advantage of the Pro, there won’t be a one-size-fits-all approach and many games could still end up forcing players to choose between fidelity and framerate, just with fewer trade-offs. </p><p>Remedy Entertainment <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://If you have a high-end PC with the right graphics card, ray tracing on Alan Wake 2 looks great, and we are happy that we can now bring ray tracing to the Pro thanks to its upgraded hardware.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://If you have a high-end PC with the right graphics card, ray tracing on Alan Wake 2 looks great, and we are happy that we can now bring ray tracing to the Pro thanks to its upgraded hardware." target="_blank">also recently revealed</a></span> the PS5 Pro modes for <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, which arrives in a physical form this month, one year after release. The horror thriller is taking a different approach than <em>The Last of Us</em>, with two modes for players to choose from on the new hardware. PS5 Pro Quality will run at 30fps with ray-traced reflections and a render resolution of 2176 x 1224 scaled up to 4K. A PS5 Pro Performance mode, on the other hand, will output at 60fps with the image quality of the base PS5 quality mode scaled up to 4K and no ray tracing.</p><p>“If you have a high-end PC with the right graphics card, ray tracing on <em>Alan Wake 2</em> looks great, and we are happy that we can now bring ray tracing to the Pro thanks to its upgraded hardware,” the studio wrote in a blog post. Thanks to PSSR AI upscaling, the team said they decided to focus more on the “signal” quality of the image rendering, rather than just adding more data. The post continued, “These upgraded settings provide the Pro version of<em> Alan Wake 2</em> with a fast response rate combined with a sharper and better-quality image than was previously possible.”</p><p><em>Lies of P</em> is also taking a two-pronged approach to the PS5 Pro update. Its enhanced Quality mode will get a “30 percent” boost to framerate,  director Jiwon Choi <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-developer-details-playstation-5-pro-enhancements&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-developer-details-playstation-5-pro-enhancements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a></span> today. The enhanced Performance mode, meanwhile, will now support “full native 4K resolution.” Instead of getting a single “best” mode, last year’s critically acclaimed <em>Dark Souls</em>-inspired game will basically just boost the performance of its existing ones. </p><p>“We believe that frame rate truly matters the most in a premium action RPG,” Choi said. “The precision and fluidity required for this genre are critical to the combat experience. Thanks to the PS5 Pro’s outstanding performance, we’re able to maintain an optimal frame rate at 4K, ensuring the gameplay feels as smooth and responsive as it should.”</p><p>Dozens more games, like <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth </em>and <em>Diablo IV</em>, also have PS5 Pro enhancement updates on the way. According to some recent hands-on dispatches from Digital Foundry, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitalfoundry.net/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-4k-60fps-gameplay-on-ps5-pro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-4k-60fps-gameplay-on-ps5-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tech is more impressive</a></span> than it may have originally seemed over livestream. But the proof will still be in the final product once it’s actually in people’s hands and running the games they actually want to play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-unlimited-tcgs-twilight-of-the-republic-decks-spotlight-ahsoka-and-general-grievous<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We checked out the newest addition to the Star Wars trading card game.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The upcoming Star Wars Unlimited TCG set, Twilight of the Republic, is almost here with the release slated for November 8. This is the third installment since the game premiered back in March. It’s still quite young, but there are already so many different types of decks that one can make. In fact, a two-player starter comes with every new set for anyone interested in jumping into SWU for the first time. The Twilight of the Republic starter includes a deck themed around the aggressive and heroic Ahsoka Tano and the Republic’s Clone Trooper army, as well as a deck led by the cunning and villainous General Grievous alongside the Separatist Droid army. With both decks in one package, it’s an easy way to kickstart a player’s venture into a new card game like Star Wars Unlimited with a friend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When a card game is based on an existing series, we usually see game designers attempt to match what’s on the card with how the character or object is portrayed in their respective medium. It guides the playstyle and creation of other cards in the set, and we see some of that in both SWU starter decks. For instance, the Ahsoka Tano deck includes characters from the 501st Legion that she’s a part of, like General Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex. The Jedi alongside the Clone army are known for skilled and organized combat, which brings us to one of the new mechanics in this set, Coordinate. This keyword or ability activates when a player controls three or more units on their side of the field. When its requirement is fulfilled, the player can then reap the reward of the newly activated action associated with the card’s Coordinate ability. In Ahsoka Tano’s case, she can command a unit to attack with a +1 power buff as long as her side of the field has at least three units. So if you’re playing with the Ahsoka deck, part of your goal is going wide on the board with units so you can always have more than enough to fulfill the Coordinate ability across all your cards that have that special keyword. That means your opponent will try to dwindle your numbers to prevent that from happening. Thankfully, the deck does include supporting cards to reflect the need to bolster an army like Batch Brothers or Jedi Master Shaak Ti, which can create clone trooper tokens to add to the unit count.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Star Wars Unlimited: Twilight of the Republic Two-Player Starter</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the villainous side of this starter pack, we have General Grievou,s who leads the Separatist droid armies in their quest for dominance. Similar to the Ahsoka deck, the General Grievous deck has options to bolster the unit count as well with the help of Battle Droid tokens. Instead of the Coordinate ability, though, the Separatists rely on another new mechanic to the Star Wars card game: Exploit. Unlike Coordinate, Exploit does not buff or support the units already in battle. Instead, this new ability sacrifices units to play more powerful cards for a cheaper cost. For instance, if someone wants to play the Admiral Trench card, that player can defeat up to 1 unit they already control on the field to reduce his cost. Usually, this isn’t such a great trade, since you’re losing one of your units in the process, but cards like the Confederate Courier or Battle Droid Escort have a benefit from being defeated. If you combo the right cards, General Grievous can easily be joined by heavy hitters like the Separatist Super Tank or Hailfire Tank without losing too many units in the process. Of course, using the Exploit ability to its full effect means having units to sacrifice, so in a similar fashion, the General Grievous deck tries to go wide with units just like Ahsoka, but for a different purpose. Meanwhile, cards like Poggle the Lesser and Droid Deployment are a couple of notable options that can help the Separatist army stay in the fight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, both decks do a pretty good job of representing the two main factions of the hotly contested Clone Wars. Both rely on large armies, and you can see how different each deck plays with the lore in mind. For a dual starter deck package, it really showcases the new mechanics well, and they both seem pretty balanced right out of the box. In the end, these are starter decks and ultimately they are a jumping-off point to making unique and stronger decks with other cards in the new set, Twilight of the Republic.
