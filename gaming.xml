		<p>Guilty Gear Strive’s season 4 has been announced and released today, adding four characters, two stages, and two new colour packs, with one being a seasonal pass bonus. It has been priced at £22.99. One of the characters takes the honour of being the first every crossover character in a Guilty Gear game, and that character is Lucy from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the anime based on Cyberpunk 2077. In addition, from Friday 26th July an open beta for a new mode called Team of 3 will be launched.</p>
<p><iframe title="GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- Season Pass 4 Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G2_pb6LiRmY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Of the four characters coming as part of Guilty Gear Strive Season 4, Dizzy will be the first to arrive, and the only one of the four releasing in 2024. <strong>Venom </strong>will be the second character to be added, and will be coming in 2025, followed by Unika&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers&nbsp;anime, and finally Lucy&nbsp;from&nbsp;Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.</p>
<p>The Team of 3 mode, as you may have guessed, pits two teams of 3 players against each other in online matches, with each player assigned the role of either Main or Assist. Assist players support the Main with different skills and strategies. The role of Main can be assigned to any player at any time. The beta of this mode will only last until July 29th. This is an open beta so anyone can play, even if they do not have a copy of Guilty Gear Strive.</p>

<p>In our Guilty Gear Strive review, Miguel wrote, “<em>Guilty Gear -Strive- excels in all the areas you’d expect it to – the music is sick, the characters look crazy, the fighting is fun, and May players deserve nothing. It’s an old dog that’s been taught new tricks, and all of those tricks are rad as hell. At the same time, it feels like it can be so much more. The story mode is clunky and the Online Mode can use some work, but I’m sure as post-launch support ramps up we’ll see stellar improvements to both those fronts.”</em></p>

        <p>The Xbox butt controllers keep coming!</p>

            <p>
The internet was all in a flap last week after Microsoft promised to place <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-unveils-deadpool-bum-controller-as-competition-prize-for-one-lucky-recipient">Deadpool's pert posterior</a> into the hands of a lucky few by way of a new limited edition controller. But if red spandex doesn't do it for you, there's now a <em>second</em> superhero butt in town, courtesy of a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/22/deadpool-wolverine-xbox-controller-wolverine-design/">bright yellow, Wolverine-themed</a> Xbox Wireless Controller.
</p>
<p>
Both controllers (as you've probably already guessed) have been created to promote Marvel's upcoming Deadpool &amp; Wolverine movie, which arrives in cinemas across the world later this week. And to coincide with its release, there's a global sweepstake going on at the moment via Twitter/X for anyone wanting to get their hands on those superbuns.
</p>
<p>
Full <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/promotions/deadpool-and-wolverine-sweepstakes">rules</a> can be found on Microsoft's website, but the gist is you'll need to follow the <a href="https://x.com/Xbox">official Xbox account</a> then repost one of its designated promotional posts containing the hashtag #xboxcheekycontrollersweepstakes before the competition closes on 11th August.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Double_Controller_WV_16x9-372d7db385e6875b79af.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Unfortunately, Microsoft is being pretty tight with its butts, and only one winner will walk away with Deadpool and Wolverine's plastic posteriors when the competition ends. On the plus side, that same winner also gets a (regrettably bum-free) Xbox Series X console inspired by Deadpool and Wolverine, plus a matching custom Xbox Series X stand.
</p>
<p>
Still, early word from one Deadpool controller recipient <a href="https://x.com/jacobkleinman/status/1814351005439402133">suggests</a> the butt, much like a real butt, is held on with magnets and has a tendency to drop off in moments of vigour - so entrants probably won't be missing out too much if they don't win.

In other bum-related Xbox news, Microsoft's Halo TV show has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramounts-divisive-halo-tv-series-cancelled-after-two-seasons">cancelled after two season</a> by Paramount+, despite giving everyone a look at Pablo Schreiber's Master Cheeks back in its first year. If only it had got its own promotional butt controller, eh?

It featured gritty action set in a dirty and dangerous NYC. The game captured these vibes perfectly, even bringing back some original actors to voice their characters. Sadly, the Xbox 360 was released a few weeks later and overshadowed the already niche game from Rockstar. But over the last 20 years, the game has developed a cult following and is seen by many as one of Rockstar’s best creations. And according to a new report, we almost got a GBA port of this underappreciated brawler. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/rockstar-came-extremely-close-to-releasing-the-warriors-on-gba&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/rockstar-came-extremely-close-to-releasing-the-warriors-on-gba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recently,<em> Time Extension</em> reported</a></span> that while talking to a former Rockstar Games developer, they learned about the existence of a <em>Warriors</em> GBA port, something that was previously undocumented. <em>The Warriors</em> did receive a PSP port, but sources told the outlet that Rockstar was originally planning to port the game to Nintendo’s popular handheld device using the same engine the company used for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/wLcHnDXTUSM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/wLcHnDXTUSM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its well-received <em>Max Payne</em> GBA port</a></span>. </p><p>“We were going for four-player co-op using the link cable and stuff.

            <title><![CDATA[Death Stranding Is Now A True Delivery Boy Sim Thanks To One Mod]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-mod-delivery-sim/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-mod-delivery-sim/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Death Stranding both confused and amazed gamers worldwide when it was released exclusively on PlayStation 4 in 2019. It puts players in control of Sam Bridges, a delivery specialist in a bizarre, post-apocalyptic world haunted by ethereal, otherworldly beings. It’s enough to say it comes from the stunning mind of Hideo Kojima – that tells you all you need to know about the ambition and innovation of the story.</p>



<p>When it was released, many joked that Death Stranding was little more than a spooky walking sim, or more accurately, a delivery boy simulator. Well, thanks to a new mod that hit Nexus yesterday, you <strong>can finally </strong>play Death Stranding without many of the game’s threats, delivering your piles of packages without being plagued by BTs.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-remove-the-threat-remove-the-point">Remove The Threat, Remove The Point</h2>



<p>Death Stranding is nothing short of bizarre. The player uses a baby in a chamber that can sense BTs (‘Beached Things’) and other threats to avoid impending doom, and ‘Timefall’ regularly scours the land, causing things to age dramatically fast, eradicating the player’s constructs and eroding their cargo. </p>



<p>In this new mod that was released yesterday on Nexus – ‘Live Stranding’ – players can manipulate the game and remove almost every trace of Timefall and the BTs that come along with it. This means that gamers are left to explore a vast open world relatively undisturbed by enemy forces or troublesome weather. It removes much of the point of the game, but it’s great if you <strong>are </strong>looking for a delivery boy simulator.</p>



<p>Sadly, the mod that’s hosted <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/deathstranding/mods/51" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Nexus Mods</a> isn’t a cakewalk when it comes to installation. There are a few things you’ll need to do as prerequisites to installing the mod itself, and as it’s <strong>brand new</strong>, it’s bound to be buggy. </p>

<p><em>“Each companion in&nbsp;Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;brings a unique personality and backstory, with some of the most compelling individual storylines in franchise history,”</em> said Ashley Barlow, Creative Performance Director at BioWare. <em>“The talent contributing to this next game in the series is tremendous – translating stellar writing from the BioWare team into performances fans will find worthy of the drama, fantasy and romance they come to expect from&nbsp;Dragon Age.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/22/24200536/windows-xp-ipad-pc-emulation-utm-se<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24198015/apple-utm-se-pc-os-emulator-for-ios">approved a new emulator app called UTM SE</a> that enables your iPhone or iPad (or Vision Pro!) to masquerade as PC hardware and run honest-to-goodness computer desktop operating systems. Some of you asked in the comments section of my last story how it runs — a fair question that I couldn’t answer at the time. But now that I’ve tried it a little, I have answers, and I can say this much: it’s better than I expected, but I wouldn’t count on it for too much.</p><p>That’s because it doesn’t use a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which translates software into code that your device understands before it’s executed. JIT compilers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137369/dolphinios-emulator-apple-app-store-jit">go against Apple’s software guidelines</a> for the App Store, so you’d have to jailbreak your phone to install a <a href="https://getutm.app/">version of UTM</a> that uses the technique. </p><p>UTM SE will be generally slow on an iPad for anything besides running old OSes on old hardware, but XP runs surprisingly well — and UTM offers <a href="https://docs.getutm.app/settings-qemu/settings-qemu/">plenty of documentation</a> for getting started.</p><p>I tried it out on my M1 iPad Pro, a device I’ve always <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/27/23847743/ipad-pro-oled-m3-13-inch-magic-keyboard-bigger-trackpad">wished could do more than it does</a>. Making a virtual machine on which to run Windows is especially easy if you use one of UTM’s <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/">pre-built machines</a>, which you can download and tweak. <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/windows-xp">I grabbed this one</a> and gave it more RAM and storage but otherwise used it the way it came. Then, I pointed it at a Windows XP .iso file from the IDE Drives option in that machine’s settings and booted it up. And waited. For so long.</p><p>It took two and a half hours for my iPad to crawl through installation. But at the end of it all, I was treated to the old “bliss” desktop background and the Windows XP startup sound (which I didn’t realize I’m nostalgic for). Things were slow after everything finished loading; new windows took a few seconds to open; nested Start menu items did, too. None of it was outrageous, though, and I genuinely think it’s faster than the Compaq machine we had when I was a teen. (Those old spinning disk hard drives really took a toll.)</p><div><figcaption><em>I should be able to make all operating systems look this bad.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Windows XP / UTM SE</cite></p></div><p>Putting aside performance and nostalgia, using Windows XP on an iPad really highlights how much farther iPadOS has to go when it comes to multitasking. And despite some improvements to homescreen customization in iPadOS 18, it’s still far behind Windows XP when it comes to personalizing things. XP doesn’t mind at all if I want my title bar pink and the text inside neon green or different fonts for every button, menu, or window. The world is my terrible oyster! I miss ruining my computer; that was the dream. </p><p>Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122341/apple-app-store-game-emulators-super-apps">allowing emulators on iPhones and iPads</a> has made a big difference for my iPad Pro. I’ve always liked using my iPad but rarely <em>wanted</em> to; now, I don’t think I’ve ever picked it up more. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
BioWare has revealed the voice cast for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, which will feature four voice options for protagonist Rook.
</p>
<p>
Alex Jordan, perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-narrators-outtakes-are-gloriously-unhinged">best known for making the sex noises in Baldur's Gate 3</a>, is one of your Rook options. (He's also Mr Hands in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.)
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can pick from Bryony Corrigan (as seen in Good Omens and The Goes Wrong Show), Erika Ishii (Valkyrie in Apex Legends, Ana Bray in Destiny 2) or Jeff Berg (Battlefield 1). BioWare notes that these actors provide "two options from US/North American personalities and two from the United Kingdom/EU".

<p>
Newcomers to the franchise voicing the game's companions include Ike Amadi (Mass Effect 3's Javik) as Grey Warden Davrin, Jee Young Han as Veil Jumpeer Bellara, True Blood's Jessica Clark as private detective Neve, Star Trek Picard's Jin Maley as dragon hunter Taash, Zach Mendez as assassin Lucanis, Nick Boraine as necromancer Emmrich and Critical Role star Matthew Mercer as his skeletal assistant Manfred. 
</p>
<p>
Returning cast members include Ali Hillis as Scout Harding, Gareth David-Lloyd as Solas, and Brian Bloom as Varric - though these were all pretty obvious from the game's recent trailers. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking of Varric, we're all a little worried for our favourite dwarven storyteller after the most recent Dragon Age: The Veilguard trailer. And as Bertie discovered, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-dragon-age-veilguard-does-kill-varric-it-will-be-long-overdue">BioWare has considered killing off Varric multiple times in the past</a>...

			<p>The new and returning companions for Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been revealed. Not only have the voices of some of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-about-finding-a-family-and-saving-the-world-with-them-says-bioware/">new&nbsp;and returning characters</a> been revealed, but those attending San Diego Comic-Con will also have the chance to go to multiple panels where they speak about the development process. Those who attend can also get a free pin if you prove you are on the Discord server while stocks last. There are two signing events: one where you can meet the dev team and the other where you can meet the voice-over cast.</p>
<p>To keep players on their toes and ensure that the gameplay is as fresh and customizable as possible, <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/voices-of-the-veilguard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rook is returning to the game</a> with four voice options. Two of these voices are from North America, and the other two are from the UK. These voices include Bryony Corrigan, Alex Jordan, Erika Ishii, and Jeff Berg.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard has seven companions, with only one appearing in the previous games. The cast of voices for the new companions is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ali Hillis as Harding</li>
<li>Ike Amadi as Davrin</li>
<li>Jee Young Han as Bellara</li>
<li>Jessica Clark as Neve</li>
<li>Jim Maley as Taash</li>
<li>Nick Boraine as Emmrich</li>
<li>Matthew Mercer as Manfred, Emmrich's assistant</li>
<li>Zach Mendez as Lucanis</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the companions for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the voice actors for Solas and Varric were revealed.</p>
<p>Gareth David-Lloyd is reprising his role as Solas in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and Brian Bloom is reprising his role as Varric.</p>
<p>For those who aren't available to attend SDCC to learn all of Dragon Age's new and exciting news, the panel will be uploaded at a later date so that everyone has the equal opportunity to hear the same news and commentary from the voice panel. The panel features Ali Hillis, Jessica Clark, Zach Mendez, and Nick Boraine, all of whom are prepared to answer questions and talk about their experiences in the voice-over booth.</p>
<p>The dev team assured people in a blog post that more character reveals will come, and fans will see familiar faces return to Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Still, they are not quite prepared to reveal those characters as they want to avoid releasing story spoilers.</p>
<p>Luckily, players won't have long to wait until the full release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which is estimated to be in Fall 2024.</p>

<p>College Football 25 had its global release on Friday, and EA Sports has posted a long list of notes of what the team is working on for updates and patches to the game. </p>



<p>These future notes include general audio, Dynasty Mode, Team Builder, and more.  General gameplay notes, Road to Glory, etc. weren’t mentioned. However, it could be expected that those will also see changes when the first title update to College Football 25 drops.</p>



<p>Aside from the future update notes, the developers also clarified some things surrounding Dynasty Mode itself. Specifically, they detailed how various factories can impact how your Dynasty plays out compared to someone elses.</p>



<p>“There are many factors at play in Dynasty that can create ripple effects: Injuries, players going pro early, transfers, strong or weak recruiting classes, upsets, and more!” the said. “The beauty of the mode is that two different users can begin playing Dynasty as the same school, but over multiple years, their College Football 25 worlds can develop notable differences. </p>



<p>“Dynasty is intentionally designed in a way where the backend systems will create organic and dynamic situations that lead to branching stories. We didn’t want to have a rigid system that leads to all users experiencing the same situations and stories 5, 10, or 15 years in…”</p>

<h3 id="h-audio">Audio</h3>



<ul>
<li>Incorrect commentary when playing as the first game of the season in Dynasty at Utah</li>



<li>Florida State’s War Chant and Tennessee’s “Rocky Top” are not audible when playing only on Xbox Series S</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-logos">Logos</h3>



<ul>
<li>The following teams/conferences have incorrect logos: Stanford, UMass, Western Michigan, Jacksonville State, FIU, New Mexico, SEC, Conference USA, and the Sun Belt</li>



<li>UTEP and Wyoming display incorrect athletic branding on their equipment in Dynasty</li>



<li>Visual issue with conference patches when changing a small subset of teams Conference in Dynasty&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-dynasty">Dynasty</h3>



<ul>
<li>Super Sim Logic Tuning: The team is looking into tuning of the Super Sim Logic, including FCS schools upsetting too many Power 5 schools
<ul>
<li>Note: As we continue internal testing on the tuning of Super Sim Logic, Top 25 Polls &amp; the College Football Playoff seedings will also see an improvement.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Issue when adding additional teams to the PAC-12 conference when using custom conferences does not generate a new conference schedule as intended.
<ul>
<li>Workaround: After adding teams to the PAC-12, open the Conference Rules and set Divisions to ON. Users will see they can now set the number of conference games by toggling back and forth. Users can then disable divisions and edit other settings as desired.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Issue with modified conference rules not saving
<ul>
<li>Workaround: Users can re-enter the Conference Rules screen to ensure their settings were saved and are valid. If they did not save, then the rules are not valid with their current setup.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Occasionally, when a recruit reaches their Top 5 stage, it will not display the recruit is “Ready for a Visit” despite meeting the requirements.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Recruiting Tuning: The team has planned additional tuning to recruiting logic.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Small chance of a freeze when simulating individual plays quickly after exiting “Super Sim”
<ul>
<li>Workaround: Wait a couple seconds in between simulating the individual plays before exiting Super Sim.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Issue with the Practice Tile not initially appearing in the “Team” tab
<ul>
<li>Workaround: Exit the mode and then re-enter.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Current maximum cap of 20 created coaches instead of the intended 32 created coaches
<ul>
<li>Note: The team is targeting Tuesday for an issue fix that limits Dynasty’s to 20 created coaches. A current work around is using existing coaches in the remaining spots to reach 32.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Player jersey numbers and/or OVRs changing when editing certain players gear.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-team-builder">Team Builder</h3>



<ul>
<li>When using a Team Builder team in Play Now, cleats are defaulted to Adidas regardless of selected brand apparel.
<ul>
<li>Note: This does not impact Team Builder teams used in Dynasty</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Second custom image layer not appearing on the field
<ul>
<li>Workaround: Add a second layer, then select a generic image, and then re-select your custom image.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals - 'Rivals’ First Stand' | Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 id="Marvel_Rivals_beta_platforms"><strong>Marvel Rivals beta platforms</strong></h2><p>The Marvel Rivals beta test is being held on Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. There is cross-platform matchmaking, but in the competitive mode, cross-play between console and PC is blocked. Additionally, NetEase said because the Xbox Series S console has "memory limitations," features like Past Lives, MVP animations, and Highlights are disabled to prevent memory-related issues. NetEase said it continues to optimize for Xbox Series S, and that for the full launch, these features will be live.</p><h2 id="Marvel_Rivals_beta_test_times">Marvel Rivals beta test times</h2><p>The Marvel Rivals beta test begins July 23 and ends August 5. Here are the specific times:</p><p><strong>Begins: </strong></p><ul><li>July 23: 3 PM PT / 6 PM ET</li></ul><p><strong>Ends:</strong></p><ul><li>August 5: 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET</li></ul><h2 id="How_to_get_into_the_Marvel_Rivals_beta_test"><strong>How to get into the Marvel Rivals beta test</strong></h2><p>PC players can visit the Marvel Rivals Steam page and select "Request Access" under "Join Marvel Rivals Playtest" to sign up for a chance to get in.</p><p>On console, you'll need to have signed up through a questionnaire. However, the sign-up period on console has ended. Those who were accepted into the beta will receive an email to get started.</p><p>Another way to get into the Marvel Rivals beta test is to have friends. Anyone in the beta will get extra activation codes they can share upon completion of certain in-game milestones. Users can also get in <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/marvel-rivals" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by securing a Twitch Drop</a>. These will be available between July 25-July 28. Beyond these means, you can follow the Marvel Rivals accounts on social media to look for a chance to grab a code.</p><p>Anyone who reached level 10 during the previous Marvel Rivals alpha test, meanwhile, gets in to the beta test automatically on Steam. The game client will simply receive an update taking it from alpha to beta. This program is not available on console.</p><p>NetEase also clarified that, although this is a closed test, participants are free to share videos of their gameplay and discuss their experience with the game on social media.</p><h2 id="Marvel_Rivals_beta_characters__maps__and_modes"><strong>Marvel Rivals beta characters, maps, and modes</strong></h2><p>The Marvel Rivals beta test includes access to a range of characters, maps, and modes--you can see all of the beta content below.</p><p><strong>Characters: </strong></p><ul><li>Adam Warlock</li><li>Black Panther</li><li>Doctor Strange</li><li>Groot</li><li>Hela</li><li>Hulk</li><li>Iron Man</li><li>Loki</li><li>Luna Snow</li><li>Magik</li><li>Magneto</li><li>Mantis</li><li>Namor</li><li>Peni Parker</li><li>Punisher</li><li>Rocket Raccoon</li><li>Star-Lord</li><li>Storm</li><li>Scarlet Witch</li><li>Spider-Man</li><li>Venom</li></ul><p><strong>Maps</strong></p><ul><li>Yggsgard</li><li>Yggdrasill Path</li><li>Yggsgard: Royal Palace</li><li>Tokyo 2099: Shin-Shibuya</li><li>Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands</li></ul><p><strong>Modes: </strong></p><ul><li>Convoy</li><li>Domination</li><li>Convergence</li></ul><p>This is what NetEase is calling a "data deletion test," and that means progress from the beta will not carry forward to the full game when it releases. Additionally, NetEase said it will erase all account information after the test period.</p><h2 id="Marvel_Rivals_beta_tournaments">Marvel Rivals beta tournaments</h2><p>As part of the Marvel Rivals beta, there will be four tournaments for players to test their mettle. These are called "War of The Realms." Registration runs July 25-30, while the tournaments themselves will be held July 30-August 4. There are region-specific tournaments on PC for North America, Europe, and Asia. Players can join whatever region they want, but NetEase warned that users who join a region not close to where they actually live may see "high-latency matches." There is also a console tournament open to everyone across the world.</p><h2 id="Marvel_Rivals_PC_specs"><strong>Marvel Rivals PC specs</strong></h2><p>NetEase has published the minimum and recommended PC specs for the beta, which you can see below. Note that NetEase will continue to optimize ahead of launch, so the beta requirements may not match up with the final requirements when the game is ready. The game supports controllers on PC during the beta, while console users can only use controller--keyboard and mouse on console is not supported.</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDED</strong></p><ul><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li><li>Memory: 16 GB</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (Super) or AMD RX 5700-XT</li><li>DirectX: Version 12</li><li>Network: Broadband Internet connection</li><li>Storage: 70 GB available space</li></ul><p><strong>MINIMUM:</strong></p><ul><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-6600K or AMD Ryzen 5 1600X</li><li>Memory: 12 GB</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or AMD RX 580</li><li>DirectX: Version 12</li><li>Network: Broadband Internet connection</li><li>Storage: 70 GB available space</li></ul><p>For more on the Marvel Rivals beta, you can <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/news/official/20240719/40185_1168280.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">consult the FAQ.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-creator-no-paid-dlc-ever<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>creator Eric Barone, otherwise known as ConcernedApe, has made a very strong pledge regarding the inclusion of paid updates or DLC in his games.</p>
<p>Speaking on X (formerly Twitter) earlier today, Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1815272546130161821" rel="noopener" target="_blank">provided an update</a> regarding the work he's doing on&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>, promising that "the ports and next PC update are still in progress" and that he'll announce when "there is any meaningful news".</p>
<p>A user <a href="https://x.com/Hikuzu56/status/1815276225474285830" rel="noopener" target="_blank">responded to Barone</a> by saying that as long as everything added to the game is "completely free", people won't complain about waiting, which is when Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1815278461269000401" rel="noopener" target="_blank">made his solemn pledge</a>: that he will "never charge money for a DLC or update for as long as I live".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stardew-valley-dlc-never-paid-farm.jpg?itok=n5I2IhI- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stardew-valley-dlc-never-paid-farm.jpg?itok=K_CjnEsG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll never pay a cent for&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>DLC, on ConcernedApe's "family name".</figcaption></figure><p>Barone says he swears "on the honor of [his] family name" that he'll never make players pay for an update or a DLC pack, and he doesn't specify that he means&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>alone, so that presumably applies to all of his games.</p>
<p>He says that fellow X users should "screencap this and shame [him]" if he ever goes back on his word, so feel free to do that, although I'm sure that Barone is sincere, so you probably won't need to use it as leverage.</p>
<p>This does mean, however, that when (or perhaps that should be "if")&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/haunted-chocolatier-is-next-game-from-stardew-valley-developer-concernedape">Haunted Chocolatier</a>&nbsp;</em>ever sees the light of day, you won't have to pay anything for its DLC either. Chalk that up as a win for indie development, eh?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/haunted-chocolatier-concernedape.jpg?itok=Dh-FHofz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/haunted-chocolatier-concernedape.jpg?itok=bwukYe8V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Haunted Chocolatier&nbsp;</em>is still in the works, or at least I assume so.</figcaption></figure><p>For now, though, it looks like Barone is focused on bringing the&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-16-update-released-with-intimidatingly-large-patch-notes-breaking">1.6 update</a> to consoles and mobile devices. Porting the update to these platforms requires "extra work" over and above what the PC version needs, according to Barone.</p>
<p>We may be a ways away from&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, but for now, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>on...well, <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pretty much everything</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

This resource is necessary for many unique items and workbenches, but like many other aspects of the game, gathering Carbon Fiber in <em>Palworld</em> could use some clarification..</p><h2 id="h78"><a id=""></a>How to farm Carbon Fiber</h2><p>The primary way to acquire Carbon Fiber in <em>Palworld </em>isn’t to farm Pals for drops. Though it’s possible to do so, Pals who drop Carbon Fiber prove relatively rare, which makes farming a moot point. Instead, <strong>you’ll have better results by crafting Carbon Fiber.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="79e46eb5ef75a523494e1d3d6a396eda" data-recommend-id="image://79e46eb5ef75a523494e1d3d6a396eda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows different resources for the player to craft." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows different resources for the player to craft." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pocketpair / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="79e46eb5ef75a523494e1d3d6a396eda" data-recommend-id="image://79e46eb5ef75a523494e1d3d6a396eda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows different resources for the player to craft." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>First and foremost, you must <strong>unlock Carbon Fiber in the technology tree at level 35 for two Technology Points</strong>.

You’ll need either two or five coals. You can craft charcoal in any furnace, but coal only comes from coal rocks commonly found in desert regions.</p><h2 id="h79"><a id="drop"></a>Which Pals drop Carbon Fiber?</h2><p>Currently, only two Pals in the game drop Carbon Fiber as monster loot: Jetragon and Shadowbeak.

First up is cartoon legend, Samurai Jack, who will join the roster when season 2 launches on July 23.

The reveal trailer really played up the return, even flashing through the character’s history throughout the series. I’m sure confused fans will be eager to learn what explanation the game has for this miraculous return. Heihachi will release as part of the first season pass for <em>Tekken 8</em>, alongside other returning fighters Lidia Sobieska and Eddy Gordo. There is currently no release date for the first season.</p></div><div><p>The <em>League of Legends</em> developer’s fighting game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/project-l-2xko-league-of-legends-riot-games-1851278882&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/project-l-2xko-league-of-legends-riot-games-1851278882"><em>2XKO</em></a></span>, had a substantial presence at this year’s Evo.

From this we learned that the launch version of <em>2XKO</em> will be pretty lean, with more game modes being added post-launch. Monetization will be a big part of the free-to-play title, but the team says all characters on the roster will be possible to acquire without spending money.

<p>SAG-AFTRA has granted permission to call for an immediate strike against game studios and publishers over protections against AI-generated content.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-national-board-meets-videoconference-national-board-unanimously-gives-chief-negotiator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">union’s official website on Saturday</a>, the union’s Chief Negotiator and National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland now has the power to call for a strike at any point should studios not work with them on the aforementioned protections.</p>



<p>This news comes nearly a year after a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sag-aftra-gaming-industry-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strike was first authorized</a> over these concerns.</p>



<p>“If called, the strike shall be over all covered services under the Interactive Media Agreement and all SAG-AFTRA members will cease rendering all services and performing all work covered by the IMA,” the union said.</p>



<p>They continued by saying that parties remain in negotiations. However, they are still “far apart” on conditions covering AI protections.</p>



<p>“Our resolve is unwavering and should not be tested,” Crabtree-Ireland said. “Our membership voted more than 98% yes to authorize a strike of this contract should the employers not come to the table with a deal that includes our critical provisions — especially in A.I. </p>



<p>“We are steadfast in our commitment to our membership who work this contract and whose extraordinary performances are the heart and soul of the world’s most popular video games. Time is running out for the companies to make a deal.”</p>



<p>As far as dealing with the rise of AI in video game creation, Crabtree-Ireland said that the union remains determined to work with “ethical AI companies”. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/digital-extremes-answers-all-of-our-soulframe-questions-including-warframe-tie-ins-and-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/soulframe-is-the-next-game-from-warframes-digital-extremes-and-its-inspired-by-princess-mononoke"><u>Soulframe</u></a>, an over-the-shoulder fantasy MMO, is the latest game from Warframe developer Digital Extremes. With slick action, otherworldly customization options, and thick lore, Soulframe is undeniably a Warframe sister project, but it's also something completely different. Where the 2013 sci-fi game leans into industrial settings and breakneck action, Soulframe takes a more methodical approach with an emphasis on nature, ancestry, and slower combat.</p><p>IGN attended a press presentation ahead of TennoCon and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/soulframe-reappears-with-story-gameplay-plans-to-come-to-more-players-this-fall"><u>the inaugural Soulframe dev stream</u></a> to get a better look at the studio’s plans. During an open Q&amp;A session, the team explained that Soulframe’s starting island is about twice as big as Warframe’s first open-world area, The Plains of Eidolon. The studio also promised that Soulframe will feature a Mastery Rank system not unlike Warframe’s, adding that it shares some similarities with the Operator Focus School system. While <a href="https://www.warframe.com/tennocon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TennoCon 2024</u></a> offered a peak behind the Soulframe curtain, we had to know more.</p><p>We caught up with Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair, Creative Director Geoff Crookes, and Community Manager Sarah Asselin to learn more about how Soulframe will evolve over the coming years. Our chat revealed more information about potential Warframe crossover content, how Digital Extremes plans to maintain its community-driven approach to game development, and so much more. There's a lot of work to do, but the team is ready to prove that it's making something a lot more than just Warframe with a palette swap.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN: Tell me about your work on Soulframe and how the idea for the game started.</strong></p><p><strong>Steve Sinclair:</strong> We wanted to make a very confusing game, so we called it Soulsframe. Then we realized it should be Eldenframe, which would be less confusing.</p><p><strong>Dark Eldenframe Souls.</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Dark Eldenframe of the Wild [laughs]. This idea had been brewing for a while. We had, I don't know, two or three people working on it for, like, a year in the shadows. Maybe more than that?</p><p><strong>Geoff Crookes:</strong> Yeah, about a year. It was tough because Steve and I still very much loved Warframe and working on it. This absolutely didn't come about from attrition. There was still a lot of excitement we had for where Warframe was going. Maybe we're even all jealous of where it's going now, but you know, the studio was at a point where we have great retention at the company, it's a great studio to work for, and we had a lot of senior people, and it just seemed like a good opportunity to try this. To try to grow the company with another game. That being said, Steve and I are very cautious people, and we're still very insecure in a lot of ways too. I think, Steve, you might have been cooking the fantasy twist first. I think you presented that.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I had to convince you.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> You did.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Because it's a very full genre. It's kind of one of the fullest ever, right? So, trying to squeeze out a little space in there, my pitch was like, 'I don't think there's a lot happening in the way Warframe evolves and changes and updates and is community-focused as much in the RPG space.' Obviously, MMOs are a huge angle of that, but the action RPG stuff tends to be in the domain of Path of Exile or Diablo, and that different perspective. I was a Dragon's Dogma fan, and I was like, 'I wonder what a Warframe, co-op-y approach to that world would look like.' I think blending in the Miyazaki stuff was where you wanted to go, Geoff, and the themes of nature and restoration, and the importance of ancestral connections, and the value of the elderly in societies that we don't have in modernity. So, once I started cooking better themes to present to Geoff, then he was like, 'Oh, OK, I do like this.'</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> With how we worked on Warframe, we try to find hooks that excite us. That's what I was looking for when we started talking about this. I think it was when we hit that idea of ancestry and even just how that could form into a multiplayer cooperative game, and how ancestry can be important to players you meet, and how that can affect the game and have some kind of influence, things started to get exciting for us there. Thematically, like we were saying, we were talking about the same things. I know we might not look like it, but we're around the same age, Steve and I, so we share a lot of inspirations from when we were younger. We started talking about the retro influences we have, and I hope you see a bit of that in how the world is presented. You know, some of those old '80s fantasy movies and whatnot. The more we talked about that the more bought-in we got, the more excited we got, and then we worked with longtime collaborator Keith Thompson. We quick call pitched him this idea, he whipped up some drawings, and then we were sold. He sent us some ideas of the Envoy and established the conflict we were talking about in the world and we were like, 'Let's do this,' and we committed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Soulframe Official Cinematic Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><strong>Warframe celebrated its 10-year anniversary last year. After so much time spent in building that game with the help of its community, what lessons that the team learned from that approach, and how is that knowledge being applied to Soulframe?</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Everything. Steve, feel free to jump in too, but I would say how we started was a big impact. I think a lot of studios would have just doubled the studio scope and gone silent for two to three years to make something. I think it is a factor of our insecurity, where we're like, 'Warframe's development worked for us.' That progressive formation of this identity that we grew with the community. We learned how important that community involvement was to the identity of the game as it grew. So, I think the question we asked each other was, 'Can you still do that in this day and age? We don't know, but we think so, so let's try.' It's what we know. I think that's how we started it, right, Steve?</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> And we kind of stumbled, didn't we?</p><p><strong>Crookes: </strong>[Laughs] We sure did. We couldn't break our current habits of Warframe. You're right.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> We stumbled because we started taking longer between releases, and going dark for longer. Then we just kind of woke up and were like, 'OK, holy shit. We gotta release something every month and act on what people are enjoying and give them more of that and less of the things that aren't working.' Speed is a big part of it. I'm not sure what you would say, Sarah, about how the community stuff is working.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Of course, it all begins with our community. That is why it's possible.</p></div><p><strong>Sarah Asselin:</strong> Of course, it all begins with our community. That is why it's possible. It's our community that, I feel, is giving us the chance to build something new, and with Soulframe Preludes, which is what people are currently playing in, it's a chance to build that beside them. It's been really cool seeing everyone's feedback on these really early days, and being like, 'OK, a lot of people miss Tuvalkane,' which I heard they still are. So after TennoCon, that's my priority number one.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I guess some of the things that we would do differently... We're sharing technology, we're sharing the back-end servers, we're trying to make it so that, the way the game is built, generally, you could move between the two teams within DE, and that's been happening. So that's been good. That's like a Dobis business nonsense answer, but when we started and took it seriously, Geoff, I remember we drew a line and we wrote Warframe on this side, and we said 'Fast, industrial, bleak, apocalyptic, sci-fi, glow-y, cynical,' right? And then on [the other side], we just kind of wrote the opposites of those: slower, natural, romantic, optimistic, no celebration of gore, and stuff like that. I mean, we did add a little bit more gore last month, but that's more about the game design and not about chasing the nastiness. So yeah, we did have a mirror and did a reflection of Warframe so that we wouldn't be just repeating ourselves. We still seem to make mistakes or forget those lessons. On my side, I contributed a lot to the early design of Warframe, and some of those regrets kind of surrounding complexity, and things like that. So, trying to make a simpler kind of game. Sure, it's gonna have upgrades and all that stuff, but can we boil it down to its most simple essence? I love the modding in Warframe – I made it. I mean, other people have obviously run with it, but some of those things we're just trying to do differently and just keep ourselves on our toes.</p><p><strong>Soulframe has been described as a sister project that will exist alongside Warframe. Like you said, there's a lot different between the two, but is there any potential for crossover content or stories? Is that something that the team has discussed or is open to?</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Yes. Nothing we can commit to yet, but we've definitely talked about fun ways to see if there are ways to tie these worlds together. See if we can plant seeds that, people who are fans of DE and played DE games, would notice and call out.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Like this company does [points to shirt featuring Disney’s Monsters, Inc.].</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> [Laughs] Like that company does. Yeah, exactly.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> There was a two-week window, where it was like, 'Is this Tau?' If you know Warframe lore, it's like, 'Is this the alternate world that the players have never been to?'</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> It won't be. We talked about it.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> We did talk about it. Some of those decisions, I think, are about avoiding strong coupling dependencies so that the Warframe team can cook and we can cook, vice versa.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> We do take our world-building very seriously. We try to create rules that we really stick to. I think that's the thing: if we ever do talk about that and get to the point, we want to make sure it's something that can fit within those rules we establish.</p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> If you know that Ignis Wraith in Warframe, we recently put something in called Ignus Wroth [laughs]. It's these little, silly ways, sometimes. Maybe it’s a little cheesy, but I think it’s great.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Warframe for a lot of people, myself included, has a pretty steep learning curve. Is that something that the team is considering while developing Soulframe? Is it going to be, maybe, easier to get into, or is it more for people who have played Warframe and know that there's a lot of these systems that they're going to have to learn and manage?</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> At least the first few – knock on wood – years of Soulframe, we will be trying to go simpler. I mean, even Warframe was simple. It was like a Dead Space mod system in the ancient days. Of course, we had to change it because you had a fixed number of permutations, and that's great for a single-player game, but for a game that someone is going to sink 500 hours into, going, 'I'm done,' is just not engaging over the long term. So, we talk a big game about making Soulframe simpler [laughs], and I think we're just trying to keep a lid on it, but it's boiling and we're like, 'Come on, don't make it more complex than it needs to be!' But we are making a slower game. A game that, I think, is less twitchy if you want it to be. If you're into the melee combat, there's parry windows, and there are dodge i-frames, but it is not a Soulsbourne type of game. It's more in the spectrum of something like Ghost of Tsushima or Breath of the Wild. It's not quite that far. We do love action, and we do love combat, but as we develop the game, we're going to also be creating a larger space for people that don't have those great timing skills and can't beat the Godskin Duo without help. There's gonna be that kind of spectrum of a casting type, you know, bow mains that might want to sit back and be using support abilities. I think it's sort of going after a slightly different audience there.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> There is a power fantasy in Warframe. We want to still keep a taste of that in Soulframe.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Yeah, where you can sort of grind and overcome anything if you've got to crank it up. Warframe has that, of course, in spades. We were talking about this yesterday after looking at our two demos. It's like, Warframe enemies live for, like, a few seconds. Maybe not. We call it popcorn, right? In Soulframe, our biggest challenge on the design and presentations side, which has been a massive uphill battle for us, is how long a single enemy lives on screen. How to make that look good. There's new pressure on animation, on where their head is turned, because you have all this time to soak it in. Things that, you know, Nintendo and Fromsoft or Sucker Punch know well, but for us, it's like, OK, usually, those guys are on the other end of a machine gun. Now, we're dueling and slowly waiting, and he's tiring out. So, that's been our biggest challenge, but I think that affords, maybe, a little slice of a different audience, I hope.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Soulframe Warsong Prologue Fable Screenshots / Concept Art - TennoCon 2024</h3></div></output><p><strong>With that in mind, how does co-op work, then? These enemies are on screen longer, but in Warframe, you throw another player in there, and the enemies are just melted quicker. So, how does co-op factor into Soulframe's gameplay experience? Is it drop in, drop out?</strong></p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> You can invite people into your party in a very similar way right now. Something we're working on, design-wise, is how they are going to function together as a team. So, perhaps, in the future, some Pacts will feel more supportive, whereas other ones can be like a sneaky Pact.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> It's borrowed stuff from Warframe, and it's kind of like grouping up in Cetus a bit, but we hope to make this a lot more seamless. My dream is, when you go into that soul mode, and you can see the energy stuff and you can see the ancestors, that you would see a radius of other players who might be open for grouping up, and that you could kind of just jump into their instance and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> We have ambitions, too. I kind of spoke about the ancestry stuff where, we're gonna have an ancestor tree in our Nightfold that might keep a record of players you've met, people you've played with, and you can look back and almost make a family tree in the game, to see where you came from. Maybe there might be some perks associated with that, depending on how you line up. So, things that we're trying for that can reinforce the themes.</p><p><strong>The Nightfold reminds me of Warframe's Orbiter, so then is it a space that we can customize like that?</strong></p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> Yes. Someone you're gonna meet at Tennocon is Verminia, who is our rat queen fashionista. She's gonna be where you can customize things, and at the end of what we're demoing, you will see a little bit of that. I know fashionframe is a really big part of our community in Warframe that's very well-loved. Even really just the lore of Soulframe, there's so much that could go into that which would make sense.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Our goal is to put more wandering ancestors in the world, and these people can hang out in your Nightfold. We have ambitions to let ancestors that we have in there now walk about a little bit, and then yes, like different ways that you can kind of decorate and set up that personal space of yours.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/21/soulframe-screenshots-verminiaancestor-2-1721598135659.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Digital Extremes says the Fashionframe community was "top of mind" when Soulframe was coming together.</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>Is the fashionframe community something the team considered when creating Soulframe?</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Top of mind, for sure. It's even a personal investment, myself. I make sure to critique everyone who plays our games, like on the dev team, I'm just like, 'What are you doing? Put some clothes on.' It's like any game. You give the option to wear underwear? I don't know, I don't understand it [laughs].</p><p><strong>Sinclair: </strong>There's something hilarious about fighting a giant monster stag in your underwear.</p><p><strong>One thing that's kept me coming back to Warframe is its monetization model. It's something that most Warframe players who stick around adore about the game. How will Soulframe compare to its sister project in that regard? I'm curious if there will be something like Platinum or if Platinum itself will return, and if in-game markets will be available for players to trade items between one another.</strong></p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> Stay tuned for more!</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> We suffered our bruises in 2012 as we were launching the game, and I made a whole bunch of mistakes, like charging people to uncap their max level and stuff like that. The community, rightfully, gave me a huge earful. I always remember the story of reading a very angry forum post about this feature. It's called Supercharge, I think. Of course, I looked up the player's account, and they had spent a ton of money in the game and supported it. They weren't advocating for themselves, they were advocating for the other people they wanted to play with. They were more than happy to throw money at the screen, at the cool stuff that we were offering, but they did not like the fact that it created a two-class system have 'I paid so my max level is 30, and yours is 15.' Then, we ripped it out. So, we've learned those painful lessons, and we have scars to remind us.</p><p><strong>Pivoting back to customization, I love how nature in the environment is incorporated. It's such a pivotal, important part of Soulframe. We've seen our mount and the bird. Can these creatures be customized in any way?</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Oh, we're definitely having hats for the bird. For sure. I've already been talking to Rosa [Lee], who's our art director. We're going to be making little outfits for the bird, the wolf has the necklace and the earrings that we can swap out, we have our paint patterns. Yes. 100%, yes. We want to reinforce that in any way we can for sure.</p><p><strong>Is the mount usable in Preludes yet?</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> [shakes head no] It's functional. We're purposely holding it back because we're slowly growing the world of Preludes, and we don't want to step on the function of exploration too early. It's not quite big enough yet. I know players that are in Preludes are so excited to get it. I don't know, maybe we just need to make a track room in the Nightfold where you can run on a treadmill with your mount. I love it to death. It's just... we need the world to support the faster mobility that it can offer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>I was also curious, then, if there's any desire to create other traversal options. Obviously Warframe has a list of ways to get around. Is that something that Soulframe will offer?</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> The wacky thing about Warframe, if you recall, Geoff, we had coptering.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> But the levels had been built for a third-person shooter with no coptering. It was a button hack to project yourself forward at a crazy fast moment. Zoren coptering, it was called, and we didn't love it, so we redid it. That's where the aim gliding and the bullet jumping and all that stuff came in, but the poor level designers, they built so much of the game without that movement system and without those movement hacks in mind. They sometimes still have to deal with the consequences of it. I just saw a video yesterday of the [Warframe 1999] stuff with wall-running problems. I think we are probably going to be a little bit more reserved. That's the beautiful flow of Warframe, and I think we're going to try to do something different that. Going back to that line we drew, there's more methodical stuff. We're going to try to respect the level a little bit more. I think that's one part that's absolutely stunning from FromSoft games, is the level design just matters so much. The topology and the puzzle of it, and 'How do I get there?' We want to try to explore that a little bit more than just 'I’ll just jump and bullet jump down there and just glide for a bit.’ So, I think we are kind of going a little bit different. That said, there's still cool Garron moments and other kind of short-term things, right?</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> And I am sure we're going to explore animal Pacts. We have some designs on paper right now, even, but I'm positive we're gonna have some animal Pacts that will give a taste of this as well.</p><p><strong>Still looking at level design then, you hesitated to talk about the term open world during our presentation yesterday. I'm curious why that is, and if it's not an open-world game, then what is it?</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Steve, what is it? You said it. [laughs]</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> It's an overworld game!</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> We do have a big map, a big island, let's call it for now, that is traversable, but we're trying to figure out our progression system and locking and scaling and how you grow your access to the world. I think we're hesitant to call it open world because unlike Zelda, you can't just walk out of the cave and go to the other side of the map. We want to put in barriers, we want to put in gates that you have to earn access to, and within each of those, we have our procedural levels. I think we call them dungeons right now, but we have our forest proc and our under-city proc, and we're building a few others that are pretty expansive and then I think eventually also will be conduits from one part of the world to another part that you can only get through there. So, we don't want to undercut that effect by being able to just go over top and get to it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I think I'm hesitant to say open world because we're putting a lot of effort into the understory of that island. I don't want to paint a picture in someone's mind of like, Far Cry.</p></div><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I think I'm hesitant to say open world because we're putting a lot of effort into the understory of that island. I don't want to paint a picture in someone's mind of like, Far Cry. You know what I mean? It's more like, there's exploration and that's a big emphasis in the game, but there's also a lot of Diablo or Warframe-esque procedural dungeon content, about as much. So, I guess that's maybe why I'm avoiding that term. Plus, it's kind of an abused term, isn't it? I've seen I've seen games called open world, and it's just like, tunnels. There's a tree so it's open world, I guess? One of my favorite parts of the game right now, that we just added, is you have these encounter systems, tasks that are popping up as you play Preludes. So, once you clear the quest, it's gonna be like, 'Oh, there's a, there's a big VIP, or there's like a hunting party nearby. My favorite thing to do in the game is fire it up and just run through the overworld, waiting for these things to crop up, how the night falls, it gets more spooky. That's the type of player I am in MMOs as well, which is, ‘Leave me alone. I'm just gonna go for a run by myself for this whole session.’ So yeah, it does have those elements, but I think we're just being stubborn and trying to be like Starbucks about it. It's not large, it's Grande. I can't help myself.</p><p><strong>I totally get that. It definitely feels like Warframe in that regard, and it didn't really hit me until I was deep in a dungeon. I was like, 'Oh, it's like I went on a mission, but I took myself there.’</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair: </strong>Yeah, and I think one of the cool things we did in the latest Preludes release is in [earlier versions] you go into a dungeon and we generate the layout kind of like Warframe and you get to the end you teleport out. Now, they're connected back into the overworld in interesting places, so when this went in I was so surprised because I went down into the dungeon, did my stuff, opened all my chest, came out, and I was right inside this fort, and it was just crawling with enemies. I was, like, behind the bookshelf, like some sneaky Lannister character. It's such a simple change but such a great feeling that it made it feel -- it was sort of an illusion -- like it was all connected like that. It felt a little bit different than Warframe, which is a session. You play the mission, back to the Orbiter. Play mission, back to the Orbiter. So yeah, I was pretty proud of that. I didn't do anything for it, but I was proud.</p><p><strong>So, if we can start from one entrance and then exit from another side, is it possible for players to go the reverse way through the dungeon?</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> We're circling back.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Curse you for asking that.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Yeah [laughs].</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> No comment.</p><p><strong>That's totally fair.</strong></p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> You made it sound so cool, Steve.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> The problem is the bookshelf only opens from the other side. Haven't you guys watched the movie Clue? There's no switch on the other side or fireplace. Yeah, right now, those are one way. We'll work on that. Maybe the next release will have something like that.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> That bookshelf you're talking about, I've seen some updates [laughs].</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Oh, OK. So there's a lever on the outside, now?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/08/26/soulframe30minutesgameplay-ign-blogroll1-1693084476609.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Digital Extremes wants players to feel connected to Soulframe's world.</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>Again, I really love how important nature, animals, the environment, all of that is. What are some of the other ways we can interact with the environment? Whether that be our settings and surroundings or creatures, that kind of thing.</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Yeah, we are scratching the surface right now.</p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> I was just thinking of the encounters, the Ode Polluters, which are now called Ode'n Moaners, which I think is so funny. You can destroy the Ode'n Moaners, and it stops the Ode'n corruption going into the rivers. There's so much to play around with. I'm sure it will only continue to have aspects of this that connect to the environment.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> We gave you a taste of our prologue that we're working on, with the bird flying to the mother. That's a big task we're working on this year, where you'll get some insight into the antagonists in the story, and what they're bringing to the game and the kind of what's causing the pollution. Then hopefully, from there, we'll be kind of broadening what those missions and those adversaries are. We have another faction in the works that represents what happens to this corruption when it goes too far. Which, there's some hint at the art that we kind of showed in the demo for where they're coming in. So, we're going to be leaning heavily into that. I think Steve and I are still scratching our heads about how to give the player meaningful change, being a force of change in this world, and having it persist in a multiplayer world. That's something we're really trying to figure out that we have ambitions for, for sure.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Does anyone remember Okami? The game where you have to draw? Oh, my god. So, you're playing, you play, you play for hours, and then you get that open part that's not really open world, you fight the thing and you draw stuff and then suddenly, the grass just goes green. It's just so wicked.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> You just reminded me, we're working on our next omen beast quest, which is the bear. I'm not sure if you've seen the bear, we showed it PAX, a little footage of it, but it's going to have a big role. A big theme of it is what you've healed and what you restore back to the world after that quest.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Lotus is a really important character in Warframe. She’s a character you spend so much time talking to and hearing. Does Soulframe have a Lotus equivalent, and will they be voiced by Rebecca Ford?</strong></p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> She wishes! [laughs]</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> She's mad at us. She claimed ownership of our rat queen, and we went around her. We cast someone. So, yes and no. Our grandfather, who you might have heard some narration by, he's going to be a bit of that figure, but we're probably not going to lean into someone so individualistic like we did in Warframe. I think, again, just to reinforce the themes of ancestry, you're absolutely going to have people that play that role, but we're spreading out the function of it. That's why in last year's quest we had Orlick guiding us through what we need to do to heal Garron. With Verminia, who is the rat witch, she's giving us some insight into Bromius, our corrupted bear. So yeah, we want to reinforce the relationships we have with the ancestors and helping them as a progression path for the player as well. It's important to tie those two together.</p><p><strong>This is a bit of a goofy question, but it's called TennoCon. Will there ever be an EnvoyCon? Or will TennoCon serve as a hub for everything Digital Extremes is doing?</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I think that it's gonna be the latter.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> We talk about QuakeCon, as an example. We've had this conversation internally, like, 'What happens?' TennoCon was kind of earned.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> There will be a thunderclap from how hard I unclench if we ever get to the point that we would need an EnvoyCon. Again, obviously our dream is to get to that point.</p><p><strong>Crookes: </strong>It's weird. Why did we do this to ourselves? I've never felt as much pressure as I have since, probably, 12 years ago, right?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We're so thankful for Warframe, and to see it even growing, it's just like... whoa.</p></div><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> It's because you've exposed yourself to failure again, and you forget what that 2012, do or die felt like. Then you look at the game industry in the last two years, and you go, 'no one's safe,' you know? We're so thankful for Warframe, and to see it even growing, it's just like... whoa. Even after all this brutality and blood. So yeah, we're hoping that we get to that, that we would have a debate with Rebecca. Because right now, we get an hour, and they get the whole day.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Which they've earned.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Quite so.</p><p><strong>Is the plan to offer the same amount of weapon variety in Soulframe as Warframe? Or will Soulframe stick to, maybe, a shorter list of weapons that can be fleshed out?</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I don't want to speak for you and Geoff... actually, I'll just say something you said: there's not enough depth in the current weapons. Which I think speaks to a little bit less and maybe a little bit deeper.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Right now, we have weapons that represent factions in our game like the starting weapons actually represent the enemies. We have some that you get from ancestors, and there's definitely space for us to lean into representing, through function, those factions a bit more and how you play with them.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> But then, we'll just shit out the game with like, 1000 armor pieces you have to mix and match, right? That'd be amazing.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> Or different kinds of underwear [laughs].</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>What does the team's ideal vision for Soulframe look like in 10 years?</strong></p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I'll clearly be dead.</p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> I'll be running the show.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> Sarah will be the CEO, and I'll be dead, so maybe Sarah should answer the question.</p><p><strong>Crookes:</strong> I remember when we launched Warframe, and I think a month into it, we opened it up, and people were playing it, and it was growing. I remember Steve, you going, 'You know, Geoff, if we're lucky, we might be able to get 10 years out of this.' I couldn't comprehend...</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I didn't say that, right?</p><p><strong>Crookes: </strong>You 100% did. It might have been within that first year, seeing where it goes and if we did it right. You weren't bragging at all.</p><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> I was probably warning you. Like, get off before it's too late [laughs].</p><p><strong>Crookes: </strong>I still have that naivete about it, I guess. We are very passionate about it, and we're just hoping we make something that connects with people, and we have the chance to grow. If you had asked me 10 years ago, 'Would Warframe have a boyband in it 12 years later?' That's kind of the joy of it. So many of the things we put in Warframe on the way, we would never have roadmapped that out. So, I really hope we get the opportunity to play in the same sandbox that we got to with Warframe with Soulframe.</p><p><strong>Asselin:</strong> I think we've been really grateful for the amount of people in our community already who have been so interested in playing. I know we're just focused on these foundational aspects and one thing at a time. That'd be amazing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"But, you know, the beautiful thing about how the company currently works and how it worked through Warframe, is it’s a whole bunch of passionate, creative people get to try weird stuff.</p></div><p><strong>Sinclair:</strong> You can see how we think, which is like... I think maybe a lot of other people in the gaming audience were exhausted by hype, were exhausted by oversell. So, we tend to under, under, undersell, right? The worst thing that could happen to me is someone sees that trailer and goes, 'Holy shit, this is going to be the game I've been waiting my entire life for. I was born and bottle-fed just for this game.' You see that create expectations. Cyberpunk was rad, but holy shit those expectations, right? Obviously, we would kill for that kind of marketing, but you know, sometimes I feel a little shy when Sarah's like sharing messages, like, 'I just want in! Give me a key!' It's like, OK, just relax. There's just a few ancestors in there right now. But, you know, the beautiful thing about how the company currently works and how it worked through Warframe, is it’s a whole bunch of passionate, creative people get to try weird stuff. They get to make mistakes. They get up to have wins. It's pretty safe for them to do that, and then they're blessed with a great connection to their audience. They see the feedback immediately when they work. It's not waiting three years and it's too late to change it. That's the joy of the live-service game. The un-joy is the speed and the relentlessness of it, but I think I could probably survive maybe four or five more years of that.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p>Stardew Valley is nearly a decade old at this point, but developer Eric Barone says he's still hard at work on the game's next PC update, as well as porting its existing content to its console versions. He also vowed to never charge money for a "DLC or update for as long as I live."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1815278461269000401" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I swear on the honor of my family name, i will never charge money for a DLC or update for as long as I live.

That’s according to modder ThatBomberBoi (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-ps5-pro-upgrade-details-revealed-through-datamine/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-ps5-pro-upgrade-details-revealed-through-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a></span>), who recently shared a glimpse of what appears to be the default graphics settings for No Man’s Sky on the upcoming hardware.</p><p>There’s not a whole lot to take away from a comparison with the existing graphics defaults for the game on PS5. The clearest changes based on the datamine are that dynamic resolution scaling will go from 0.6 to 0.8 and graphical detail will go from high to ultra. It’s impossible to know from any of this just how much better a game like <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, originally released on PS4, will look on a PS5 Pro, but it certainly doesn’t seem like the new hardware will be a major jump. </p><p>That was already the take away <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-leaks-specs-enhanced-trinity-60fps-1851413329&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-leaks-specs-enhanced-trinity-60fps-1851413329">from the reported specs</a></span>, which point to a slightly better CPU and a much beefier GPU. An early analysis <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-is-gta6-at-60fps-really-out-of-the-question-for-ps5-pro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-is-gta6-at-60fps-really-out-of-the-question-for-ps5-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by <em>Digital Foundry</em></a></span> speculated that for simulation-heavy games like <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, a PS5 Pro would certainly improve performance but not get close to managing 60fps in 4K. In that regard, the new hardware keeps sounding more and more like a PS4 Pro, which offered enhancements but didn’t feel like a must-have upgrade. </p><p>But the other big question around the PS5 Pro is when it will actually launch. With the base model reaching its 4-year anniversary this fall, the timing is perfect for a refresh, maybe to be revealed at or around a potential September showcase. That’s basically what Sony did with the PS5 Slim last year, announcing it just a month before it went on sale. <em>The No Man’s Sky </em>datamine suggests developers are already preparing for its arrival.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Several more than I even thought you could reasonably stack up in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/elden-ring&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a></span><em> </em>if I’m being entirely honest. As a Soulslike player who often employs the blade and nothing else, magic seems <em>wild </em>in these games. I still won’t use it, but good for you all on evidently cracking this game wide open.<br></p><p>I sincerely <em>do not </em>understand the amount of things that Ainrun uses prior to the fight and their various effects. I get the Physick, obviously, but he goes on to use several more consumables, including a stone that appears to frenzy him—a tactic that’s being used to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-gideon-boss-1851576225&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-gideon-boss-1851576225">obliterate other bosses</a></span> with powerful techniques as well—which stirs his character from a sleep that they fall into due to something else Ainrun does prior to the video starting. He also uses Ash of War techniques, which are abilities often tied to specific weapons that use FP (<em>Elden Ring</em>’s mana), like a flag standard that buffs Ainrun and a literal act of seppuku.<br></p><p>By the end of the exhaustive list, Ainrun is rocking something like a dozen buffs at once. With all the various items and techniques rattled off, including a weapon change, he enters Radahn’s arena, uses one more Ash of War skill, and then launches a charged heavy attack as the boss rushes to close the distance between them. You can barely make it out due to Twitter’s video compression, but that single attack does 93,000 points of damage to Radahn, completely nuking his health bar.<br></p><p>It’s a move so potent, it triggers Radahn’s second-phase cutscene and also <em>skips </em>the entirety of the actual phase. As it ends, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-lore-disappointed-fans-ending-1851588208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-lore-disappointed-fans-ending-1851588208">Radahn (and Miquella, I guess</a></span>) fall limp, having barely gotten off a single attack. Radahn’s move <em>does </em>connect and manages to kill Ainrun, but with the boss defeated, only Ainrun will return and be able to claim victory.<br></p><p>As busted as Radahn’s fight at the end of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>is—and for the record, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346">it’s <em>really</em> broken and not in your favor</a></span>—it’s almost been worth it to see how players like Ainrun craft builds to meet the challenge. There are obviously much simpler ways to buff yourself, like using just a modicum of the skills Ainrun deployed here rather than the full gamut. You can top up on Scadutree blessings to meet Radahn’s immense strength via <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s independent leveling system, but it’s especially satisfying watching folks go off the deep end and develop wildly cracked builds instead. Hats off to FromSoftware for allowing players to break the game in their own favor, and to the community that has risen to the occasion and shown Radahn what’s what.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Concord is in the midst of holding its open Beta on Steam, and the numbers, to be honest, haven’t been good.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3011460/charts/#1w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the beta for Concord has a peak player count of just 2,388 players, which happened on Thursday, July 18. Since then, the numbers have continued to drop from an already disappointing level. July 19th saw a max of just 1,654 players; July 20th, 1447; and July 21st, 1,117 players.</p>



<p>Again, this was a completely free and open beta over a weekend for a game that PlayStation has been targeting as its big hero shooter. If the numbers were that low when anyone could play, it’s hard to imagine what they’ll be when the game fully launches at its $40 base price.</p>



<p>Immediately after the full reveal of the game back in June, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-hit-with-overly-negative-response-after-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players seemed turned off by the game</a> for a number of reasons. One of the big reasons being the seemingly bait and switch of a CGI trailer that showed an adventure only to be shown 5v5 FPS gameplay. </p>



<p>Based on the Beta numbers, it seems like the  negative sentiment hasn’t change over the last month or so.</p>



<p>We don’t have the numbers publicly available for how the game has performed on PlayStation. Neither Sony nor developer Firewalk have responded to requests for comment on the state of the game based on the early Beta returns.</p>



<p>Concord is currently scheduled to release August 23 for PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
