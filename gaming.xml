            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/hyperkin-competitor-dualsense-for-xbox-compatibility/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Hyperkin has revealed a new Competitor wired gamepad for Xbox, and you’d be forgiven for thinking it looks rather familiar. In fact, it’s basically a PlayStation 5 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/06/dualsense-review-feeling-the-future-of-gaming/">DualSense</a> controller remade for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox</a>.</p>
<p>Hyperkin absolutely plays up to this, with the announcement blurb saying, “If you prefer PS5’s DualSense controller but want to play something on Xbox or PC, then this is probably going to be the controller for you.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyperkin's Redesigned Competitor Xbox Controller Teaser (DualSense-Style Gamepad for Xbox)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6rko8BbWgw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Competitor comes with the striking two-tone white and black design of the DualSense controller or in an all-black version, but absent the rectangular touchpad, has a bit more of an X-Men vibe as the white panels continue in to meet a white and black Xbox button. Everything else looks very DualSense as well, from the D-pad design (which we really hope nails the feel and muted sound of the PlayStation D-pad), to the analogue stick placement, and the shoulder buttons and triggers.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a pro controller, so there are back buttons, and on the whole, the controller does look a bit chunkier than the DualSense – perhaps just from the flattened bottom below the sticks, which Sony has more moulded.</p>

<p>At this time there’s no details on pricing or availability, but if you’re a PlayStation fan suffering in the land of Xbox, this could be for you. The symmetrical analogue sticks will do a huge amount of the heavy lifting on that front, though it’s a shame that this is a wired controller and not wireless.</p>
<p>Hyperkin has made a lot of headlines over the years for their recreations of historic Xbox controllers, updating them for modern machines. That started with a recreation of the ‘<a href="https://hyperkin.com/hyperkin-duke-wired-controller-for-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-20th-anniversary-limited-edition-black-officially-licensed-by-xbox.html">Duke</a>‘ controller from the original Xbox, continued on with a ‘<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/23/hyperkin-is-remaking-the-xbox-360-controller/">Xenon</a>‘ recreation of the Xbox 360 gamepad, and most recently they revived the smaller ‘<a href="https://shop.hyperkinstore.com/products/hyperkin-duchess-wired-controller-white-officially-licensed-by-xbox">Duchess</a>‘ controller that Microsoft made to cater to smaller hands.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-coming-to-lg-smart-tvs.1075092/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-cloud-gaming-lg-smart-tvs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>LG and Xbox have announced that they're teaming up in order to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to LG smart TVs via an all-new Xbox app integration.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2025/01/lg-and-xbox-partner-to-expand-cloud-gaming-experience-on-lg-smart-tvs/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement on its official website</a>, LG says you'll soon be able to access the Xbox app via its new Gaming Portal, although it also notes that said Gaming Portal's availability "can vary per TV model", so you'll probably have to pick up a newer smart TV to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>If you are lucky enough to own one of the LG TVs that supports the Gaming Portal, you can look forward to accessing "hundreds of games" via Xbox Cloud Gaming, though you'll need an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to take advantage of that feature as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-cloud-gaming-lg-smart-tvs-app.jpg?itok=92ELIiOv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-cloud-gaming-lg-smart-tvs-app.jpg?itok=WgxzCLmH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>LG and Xbox are teaming up to bring the latter's Cloud Gaming service to LG smart TVs.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll also be able to access a select few games that aren't included with Game Pass but that you can stream via the cloud nonetheless, including the likes of&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</p>

<p>The app will be powered by LG's webOS, and it sounds like it might be just one of several cloud gaming apps available via the Gaming Portal; LG says the service provides a "comprehensive overview with an app list that includes cloud gaming apps, webOS app games", and more.</p>

<p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is, of course, already available on Xbox consoles and web browsers, as well as in several other places, including Samsung's own smart TV line.</p>

<p>It's the cornerstone of Xbox's "This Is an Xbox" <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">campaign</a>, which seeks to paint any device capable of running Cloud Gaming via a browser or the desktop Xbox app as an Xbox device.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lg-smart-tvs-xbox-cloud-gaming-this-is-an-xbox.jpg?itok=qEn7xTy8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lg-smart-tvs-xbox-cloud-gaming-this-is-an-xbox.jpg?itok=wV8p4zoJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you say so, guys.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere in Xbox news, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-android-app-games" rel="nofollow">recently announced</a> it would allow players to purchase games directly from its Android app after a court ruling found in Epic's favor against Google.</p>

<p>Xbox boss Phil Spencer also confirmed that an Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-handheld-confirmed-but-years-away" rel="nofollow">handheld device</a> is currently being prototyped, although it's likely years away.</p>

<p>It's also unlikely you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>on that device if its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s" rel="nofollow">producer's comments</a> are anything to go by, although hey, maybe you'll be able to stream it via the cloud by then.</p>

<p>The Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls update is more star-studded than an all-star Avengers movie line-up, and we’ve got everything you need to know about the free-to-play shooter’s first major content injection.</p>



<p>Season 0 is coming to an end, sparking the beginning of a new chapter. Marvel Rivals has got off to a start so sharp even Blade would cower—joking, he would never do this. Rivals is the new kid on the block looking to stay and make its presence known until it matures into a wise Doctor Strange-esque figure. The first few weeks firmly established the hero shooter’s impressive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">player count</a>, but Season 1 is the first real test.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls isn’t make or break, but it could shape the F2P title’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-release-date">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fantastic. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>January 10 is the start date for Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls</strong>, neatly coinciding with the end of Season 0.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals X</a> social media channel posted a <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1876297704340385803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message</a> on January 6 saying, “Season 1: Eternal Night Falls begins on Jan 10, 2025.”</p>



<p>If you’re familiar with any live-service shooter—Call of Duty, Fortnite, and Overwatch are common contemporaries—you’ll recognize the Battle Pass formula stays the same. Each pass has a counter showing you how many days are left. The final day allows the title to execute a seamless transition to the new season.</p>



<p>Some downtime or maintenance might happen, but otherwise, in this circumstance, we expect Marvel Rivals Season 0 to end with its timer on January 10, and Season 1 to get underway.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-start-time">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Start Time</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-arrives-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1’s Eternal Night Falls</a> commences at <strong>1 AM PST / 3 AM CT / 4 AM ET / 9 AM GMT</strong>.</p>



<p>Again, the verification comes straight from the same X status cited above. Check out the start time specific to you, make sure everything is updated and ready to go, grab some chips, and be heroic.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-heroes-in-marvel-rivals-eternal-night-falls">New Heroes in Marvel Rivals Eternal Night Falls</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-is-dropping-a-fantastic-4-trailer-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantastic Four</a> featuring <strong>Mr Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, and The Thing</strong> are the confirmed names making a spectacular entrance in Season 1. Also, <strong>Dracula</strong> has been outed as another potential character to use in the shooter.</p>



<p>We know this for definite as the Season 1: Eternal Night Falls Official Trailer&nbsp;showed off the fab foursome. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-when-doctor-doom-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Doom</a> teased for weeks now, you feel it’s all coming to a head in Eternal Night Falls. The reveal also strongly insinuates Dracula as a villain: “The Fantastic Four join forces with iconic Marvel heroes, standing together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science. <strong>Ignite the battle against Dracula with the Fantastic Four in Marvel Rivals!</strong>“</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if it’s just the Fantastic Four, or if Doctor Doom and Dracula are out for blood too.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-leaks">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Leaks</h2>



<p>Popular leaks suggest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leaks-reveals-details-about-ultron-and-the-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultron</a> is another character set to join the fray, and a host of <strong>buffs &amp; nerfs</strong> to key heroes are coming.</p>



<h3 id="h-ultron">Ultron</h3>



<p>A bunch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-leaked-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals leaked character rumors</a> are in the wild, but Ultron could be sooner rather than later. Renowned leaker <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals – Leaks &amp; Info</a> thinks “Ultron releases Season 1 and he’s a Strategist.” Additionally, their <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1869869444455117276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1869869444455117276%7Ctwgr%5E1bb1dd9231dc5324b962d40043263ee880ea27c0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fmarvel-rivals%2Fmarvel-rivals-season-1-update-3022179%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leak</a> also has a full look at <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1869868212927524964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ultron’s abilities and difficulty rating</a> of <strong>Two Stars</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-buffs-amp-leaks">Buffs &amp; Leaks</h3>



<p>The Marvel Rivals – Leaks &amp; Info X page has also <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1875777797676736764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">outed a ton of buffs and nerfs</a> which could impact Rivals’s meta.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at the characters expected to be reworked in Season 1—for better or worse.</p>



<h4 id="h-buffs">Buffs</h4>



<ul>
<li>Captain America</li>



<li>Cloak &amp; Dagger</li>



<li>Storm</li>



<li>Venom</li>

</ul>



<h4 id="h-nerfs">Nerfs</h4>



<ul>
<li>Hawkeye</li>

<p>Everything in this section is considered a leak until we hear more, so take the information with a pinch of salt for now.</p>

          <p>Last month, we asked readers to donate to a couple of good causes in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/win-hardware-collectibles-and-more-in-the-2024-ars-technica-charity-drive/">our 2024 Charity Drive sweepstakes</a>. And boy, did you deliver. With the drive now complete and the donations all tallied, we can report that Ars Technica readers <strong>gave an incredible $39,047.66</strong>&nbsp;to <a href="https://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a> and the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> in this year's drive. That doesn't set a new record, but it nearly matches last year's total and raises our lifetime Ars Charity Drive donation haul since 2007 to <strong>over</strong>&nbsp;<strong>$540,000</strong>. Well done, Arsians!</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 T239 could be an 8nm chip, and while this could make good performance and battery life a challenge, there's a good chance this process node won't significantly impact the system.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the leaked system's motherboard, focusing on the T239 SoC, as most of the other components found on it aren't particularly interesting. While it is currently difficult to pinpoint the exact size of the chip due to the angled picture, Digital Foundry's experts think that the Samsung 8nm process node was more likely used for the chip over other rumored process nodes for a few reasons.</p>
<p>For starters, the chip is somewhat of an offshoot of the T234 chip, which uses the Samsung 8nm process node. Additionally, NVIDIA Ampere architecture was designed for this process node, and porting it to a different process node like 4nm would be a waste of time, as it would have made more sense simply to go with the Lovelace architecture, which was built with 4nm in mind. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/">A Samsung 5nm process node</a> could still be possible, but it would still require porting Ampere over to a different process node. Also, the Samsung 8nm process node is quite cheap, as it has never been extremely popular, and Samsung likely doesn't have that many customers for it right now, so its low cost would definitely fit Nintendo's approach.</p>
<p>Even if the Nintendo Switch 2 is powered by a Samsung 8nm chip, the process node may end up not being as big an issue as many are speculating. While 8nm is not particularly power-efficient, and achieving good performance and battery life on it may be a challenge, all the current power measurements are likely way off the mark, as they are based on the T234 chip, which is much bigger than the T239 and requires a certain amount of power even with reduced clock speeds. Additionally, the T239 chip may have begun development as some sort of offshoot of the much bigger and more power-hungry T234 chip, but the two chips have been designed by different teams, have different CPUs, and the Nintendo Switch 2 chip has some additional features, such as a file decompression block required for fast loading and asset management, so it's not a cut-down version of the chip used in the automotive segment. Having likely been designed from scratch on the 8nm process node with certain power-efficiency goals in mind, which are suggested by the small battery cavity seen in the leaked motherboard, there's a very good chance that the chip's process node is not going to impact the system in any significant way.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 motherboard leak was only the first one to surface online in the first few days of 2025. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-high-quality-pictures-joy-con/">Yesterday</a>, pictures showcasing the new Joy-Con controller emerged online, and some of the additions from the original controller suggest that the controller could be used as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumor-mill-joycons-as-pc-mice-no-mans-sky-on-the-way/">PC mouse</a>. Will this be the new gimmick of the system? Hopefully, it won't take much longer to get the answer to this question and every other that fans have been asking themselves for a few months.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-hyperkin-controller-revealed-ps5-style-for-xbox-named-the-competitor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-hyperkin-controller-revealed-ps5-style-for-xbox-named-the-competitor.1075050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-hyperkin-controller-revealed-ps5-style-for-xbox-named-the-competitor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over the years, there have been a variety of PS5-style Xbox controllers, none of them causing quite as much of a stir as the Hyperkin controller. During the<a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-nvidia-ces-2025-ceo-jensen-huang-keynote-live-here/"> CES 2025</a>, Hyperkin announced a brand-new Xbox controller, which is called "The Competitor" and seems very similar to that of the PlayStation 5 DualSense. Much like the DualSense, the thumbstick on the left has now been moved down to be parallel to the right thumbstick, and the D-pad is moved above to replicate the design of the DualSense. While it has an Xbox-style design in terms of pattern, the colors are that of the DualSense, in a classic white and black design.</p>
<p>Hyperkin is well known for making controllers and other accessories that have a retro vibe, with many of the controllers they created being similar to the original Xbox controllers. <a href="https://hyperkin.com/full-product-list.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Their website</a> is a safe haven for those who want a hit of nostalgia, as they have items that pertain to every type of popular console on the market. This ranges from the PlayStation One to the PS Vita and even a Nintendo DS, for example.</p>
<p>Compared to other controllers on the market, the brand-new Hyperkin controller is a wired controller that can be used on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. While PC gamers commonly use Xbox controllers over DualSense controllers, this new Hyperkin controller contains something that is incredibly beneficial to the longevity of a controller. That is the Hall Effect sticks. For those just hearing about these for the first time, Hall Effect Sticks use non-contact magnetic sensors to detect movement, which should prove to be beneficial in making sure that the thumbstick lasts longer than that of a typical Xbox controller.</p>
<p>At the moment, there aren't many details about this new Hyperkin Controller other than the name of it and a trailer that was released on the IGN YouTube channel. Here, you can see the aesthetic they went for with the controller and the sleekness of the design. By the looks of the trailer, it seems you can either get the controller in black and white, or just fully black, depending on your preference in aesthetic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyperkin's Redesigned Competitor Xbox Controller Teaser (DualSense-Style Gamepad for Xbox)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6rko8BbWgw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The video is only short and doesn't provide any details about the Competitor, but it's very obvious that they have taken heavy inspiration from the DualSense, even in the styling of the D-Pad and the buttons.</p>
<p>Those who have seen the controller now wish it had the option to be wireless, but that is proprietary tech belonging to Microsoft, and thus, it's not possible for Hyperkin to do so without getting permission from the company. While some are delighted with this new option, there is also an outcry from those who dislike using symmetrical thumbsticks, with some even saying that it will cause issues in the hands later on down the line.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no sign of how much this Hyperkin controller will cost, but we will keep you updated when the information arrives.</p>
<p>Will you be getting The Competitor controller by Hyperkin?</p>

<p>As promised, Marvel Rivals released their Season 1 trailer today, January 6. We now know that Eternal Night Falls and the Fantastic 4 will arrive on January 10, 2025, at 1 AM PST.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1876297704340385803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> is, unfortunately, a cinematic one, so we do not get to see gameplay for the Fantastic 4. However, we do learn about the overarching plot. With the arrival of Season 1, darkness will cover New York, with Doctor Strange trapped in an Entangled Astral Plane. Dracula and Doctor Doom are making their moves, disrupting the moon’s orbit and releasing an army of vampires.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as things start looking grim for the heroes, we see the new additions to the Marvel Rivals roster take charge and protect the work against the evil forces of Dracula. On January 10, we will see the likes of Mr Fantastic, Invisible Woman, The Human Torch, and The Thing join the battle in Marvel Rivals Season 1. If luck is on our side, we might receive a gameplay trailer showcasing these characters in action before they arrive later this week.</p>



<p>In other news, recent leaks have claimed that characters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-claims-deadpool-and-more-are-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool, Emma Frost and Modok</a> are coming to the game. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-reveals-data-about-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details about loot boxes</a> have leaked online.

                <p>CES 2025 has kicked off, and amidst all of the new tech reveals, Hyperkin has unveiled a new Xbox and PC controller that appears to borrow heavily from the design of the PlayStation DualSense controller. Dubbed the Competitor, this is a wired controller that features some premium hardware inside of it, like Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers. Official pricing and a release date have yet to be revealed, but we'll update this post with preorder links as soon as Hyperkin makes those details public.</p><p>Like the DualSense, the Competitor features a similar layout of face buttons, symmetrical analog sticks, and a familiar placement of face buttons (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ces-2025-hyperkin-unveils-dualsense-style-xbox-controller-called-the-competitor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>). The D-pad is also heavily influenced by the DualSense with its transparent buttons and placement, and for extras, two additional inputs on the gamepad's rear can be found. There'll be two variants available for purchase when it launches: a regular black Competitor controller and one with white face-plates to create a two-color tone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6rko8BbWgw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k6rko8BbWgw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While the Competitor looks like a DualSense controller, it remains to be seen if it'll <em>feel</em> like one. The overall ergonomics look almost identical to its primary inspiration, but the DualSense does feature nuanced haptic feedback features that aren't present in an Xbox controller.</p><p>While it can be used on a PC as well, so can a DualSense controller. The caveat here is that accessing DualSense features in a PlayStation game ported to a PC typically requires the controller to be tethered to your PC via USB-C, whereas on a PS5 console, you can still experience these features wirelessly. Anyone looking for something with more of a retro flair can also check out a previous collaboration between Hyperkin and Xbox, as the peripherals manufacturer revived the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Controller-Windows-Anniversary-Limited-x/dp/B09FYJF6XY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iconic Duke controller for modern Xbox systems</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, NetEase Games teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-teases-four-new-heroes-coming-to-the-game/1100-6528615/" data-ref-id="1100-6528615">the debut of the Fantastic Four</a>, the first post-launch heroes for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-coming-to-consoles-ps5-beta-and-exclusive-spidey-costume-confirmed/1100-6523816/" data-ref-id="1100-6523816">Marvel Rivals</a>. Now, the trailer for Marvel Rivals Season 1 has arrived, and it reveals that Marvel's first family of superheroes are facing an unexpected battle with the Lord of the Vampires, Count Dracula. It also appears that the FF may be among the few heroes left who can oppose him.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg2ea9O95bA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xg2ea9O95bA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As seen in the trailer, Dracula has personally taken Dr. Strange out of the picture. More alarmingly, Avengers Tower has fallen, and the familiar A logo on the side of the building has been turned into a V. Each member of the Fantastic Four is also showcased as they push back against Dracula's influence, but the FF won't have to hold back the darkness alone.</p><p>The story seems similar to Marvel's recently concluded Blood Hunt crossover, which also left the world enshrouded by darkness as vampires attempted to take over. In the game, Dracula and Doctor Doom achieved this result by disrupting the moon's orbit. New York City has already fallen, and the remaining heroes will stand "together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science."</p><p>Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls will begin on January 10. And while Dracula doesn't appear to be playable, the FF will be added to the Marvel Rivals roster with more characters coming in the future.</p><p>Before the launch of Season 1, NetEase is giving away a free in-game chibi Galactica <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-celebrating-another-milestone-with-a-free-limited-time-reward/1100-6528532/" data-ref-id="1100-6528532">to celebrate hitting 20 million players</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tejo-valorants-newest-agent-has-been-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Riot Games and VALORANT released information regarding the latest agent to be joining the <a href="https://wccftech.com/valorant-lands-on-consoles-soon-no-pc-crossplay-but-theres-cross-progression/">incredibly popular title</a>. Their name is Tejo, and he is a veteran intelligence consultant from Colombia who has a variety of abilities revolving around ballistics. If you want to see Tejo in action, make sure to check out the gameplay trailer below where you can see everything he has to offer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tejo Official Gameplay Reveal // VALORANT" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRuRID5JoQY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So far, the commentary regarding the latest agent for VALORANT seems to be pretty positive, with many saying that he feels like he is a mix of pre-existing agents rolled into one as a powerful killer.</p>
<p>Like every other agent, he has four abilities which includes his Ultimate. These abilities are all showcased in the trailer above. However, we're going to run you through the abilities and what they do, so you can get confirmation on their functionality.</p>
<p>First up is Special Delivery, where you can equip a sticky grenade and fire it at your desired position. The grenade will then stick to the surface and explode after a short time, where any targets caught in the blast will become concussed. You can also alt fire the grenade so that it launches with a single bounce, rather than sticking in place.</p>
<p>Next is the Stealth Drone. You can equip and fire the drone to throw it forward, where you can then take control of its movement. Firing again allows you to trigger a pulse from the drone that Suppresses and Reveals any enemies that were hit by the pulse.</p>
<p>After that is the Guided Salvo, which allows Tejo to equip an AR targeting system. Firing allows you to select two locations on the map, with alt fire launching missiles on the target locations, and detonating as soon as they get to the planned spot.</p>
<p>Finally, Tejo's ultimate. He can utilize a tactical strike targeting map, where he can choose the origin point of the strike and then fire to unleash a heavy wave of explosions in his chosen destination.</p>
<p>However, Tejo is not the only thing coming to VALORANT, as a brand-new content type is being added to the game. This content is called Flex, where players can begin collecting handheld objects to show off their flair in battle. This is similar to the Spray Wheel, and can be equipped via Collections. As Flex is new <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the game</a>, players will receive a free Flex, with a second one becoming available in the upcoming Act I Battlepass.</p>

<p>The first new VALORANT agent of 2025 is <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1876282811667112298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">veteran ballistics expert Tejo</a>, who becomes the 26th agent to join the Riot shooter’s roster. Tejo is also the seventh agent under the initiator role, equipped with an explosive kit that overwhelms the opponent with ordinance. </p>



<p>Billed as a “veteran intelligence consultant from Colombia,” Riot says that the newest VALORANT agent Tejo is designed to “[pressure] the enemy to relinquish their ground – or their lives.”</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-tejo-s-abilities">What are Tejo’s abilities?</h2>



<p>The themes of Tejo’s ability kit are suppression and explosiveness. Like Fade and Sova, he doesn’t have a flash ability. But while those two are geared toward maximum information gathering, Tejo is a disruptive force who can wreak havoc on enemy setups.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Guide Salvo in action. Image credit: Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here’s how each of his abilities work:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Guided Salvo: </strong>Equip a tactical map, and like you’re placing Brimstone smokes, select two spots on the map. Activating the ability will send a self-guided missile to each of the two spots, detonating on arrival with a three-pulse explosion. Great for flushing enemies out of corners and hiding spots, and great for post-plants.</li>



<li><strong>Stealth Drone</strong>: Deploy a drone that you control for a limited time. The Drone controls like one of Skye’s Trailblazer tigers, and you can manually detonate it near an enemy to both suppress and reveal them.</li>



<li><strong>Special Delivery</strong>: Equip a sticky grenade that sticks to the surface and explodes, concussing enemies caught in the vicinity. You can normal fire the grenade to stick to the first surface it hits, or you can alt-fire with right-click to make it bounce once first.</li>



<li><strong>Armageddon</strong>: Tejo’s ultimate ability effectively calls in a super destructive airstrike that travels along a long corridor. Players bring up a tactical map, select a starting area, then use the mouse to choose the direction that Armageddon travels.</li>
</ul>



<p>Tejo will officially arrive in VALORANT on Tuesday, Jan. 7. Riot is also debuting a new cosmetic type called FLEX, which are unique handheld objects that players can interact with. There will be two available starting Jan. 7: one for free, and one in the paid track of the next battle pass. The next VALORANT act will start on Jan. 8.</p>

<p>Images of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons have allegedly leaked online, providing new details about the successor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/523194/article/rumor-leaked-joy-con-2-pics-confirmed-via-serial-number-and-it-fits-nexthandhelds-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hu3rte/new_joycon_photos_from_chinese_sns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NintendoSwitch2</a> subreddit features a post that has leaked images of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons from the Chinese online forum, Baidu Teiba. At first glance, players can spot several obvious changes, such as the larger SL and SR bumpers and new connectors. It seems the successor to the Switch will be ditching the rails for a new connector that will allow players to pop their Joy-Cons in instead of sliding them in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if you look closer, you will find a new addition to the Switch 2 Joy-Cons. The latest addition looks like some kind of sensor next to the new connector. Many players on the r/NintendoSwitch2 subreddit have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1huvbt9/the_mouse_theory_doesnt_seem_so_unreasonable_to_me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">theorised</a> that this might be a sensor that will allow players to turn their Joy-Con into a mouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, the overall Joy-Con is much bigger, with larger joysticks and triggers. Regarding the colour, the Joy-Con is covered with a matte-black casing and has a patch of blue near the connectors. The new images of the Joy-Con also match the Christmas Leak by <a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NextHandhled</a>, where the alleged Switch 2 console also had connectors instead of rails.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Nintendo Switch has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-passes-ps2-in-total-us-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed PlayStation 2 in total US sales</a>. Also, check out the Switch 2 design <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/did-dbrand-give-players-another-look-at-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that was leaked earlier by Dbrand</a>.

As noted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wwe-2k24-now-the-only-game-in-the-series-with-online-functionality-as-2k23-servers-go-dark" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a>, WWE 2K23 goes dark today, January 6, 2025, when the servers are discontinued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This includes all online functions, such as online matches and Community Creations. Players will no longer be able to access any online game mode after this point. However if you already own the game you will be able to continue to play offline modes. The game itself and all VC (Virtual Currency), as well as DLC/Add-Ons, were pulled from sale in November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This also means WWE 2K23's PS5 and PS4 Platinum Trophy is unobtainable, the latest to fizzle out of existence with a server shutdown. Gamers have long called on the platform holders to mandate achievement and trophy changes upon a server shutdown so customers can still complete those challenges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k23-review">WWE 2K23 review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Though the Showcase mode isn’t as super as its subject, John Cena, the sharp focus on refinement instead of reinvention helps keep WWE 2K23 as the gold standard of wrestling sims."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">WWE 2K23’s server shutdown leaves last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wwe-2k24">WWE 2K24</a> as the only game in the series with online functionality. The expectation is WWE 2K25 launches around March this year, but some fans are now debating the value in investing time in these games if they fail to last even a couple of years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher 2K has form when it comes to shutting down its sports games in the immediate years after release. 2022's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k23-next-gen-version">NBA 2K23</a>, for example, shut down in December 2024. Rival sports video game maker EA tends to keep the online portion of its games running longer than 2K, with FIFA and Madden servers often up and running years after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>"Darkness engulfs New York as the Timestream Entanglement leaves Doctor Strange trapped in the Entangled Astral Plane, scattering the Darkhold pages.

<p>"NetEase's spin on the hero battler is complex and moreish, but rarely much actual fun," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-review">Eurogamer's Marvel Rivals review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-claims-2025-as-the-year-of-eevee<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
2025 will be the Year of Eevee, according to the Pokémon Company. 
</p>
<p>
Branding showing <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/year-of-eevee">Pokémon's Year of Eevee</a> is now live on the franchise's Pokémon Center site, alongside an array of merchandise featuring the cute creature and its many evolutions including plushies and action figures. 
</p>
<p>
The gimmick follows Nintendo previously declaring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/miyamoto-nintendos-year-of-luigi-continues-until-18th-march">2014 to be the Year of Luigi</a>, and Sega last year dubbing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-declares-2024-the-year-of-shadow-the-hedgehog">2024 to be the Year of Shadow the Hedgehog</a>.
</p>
<p>
On the surface, the Year of Eevee seems to be just a merchandise range, but the Pokémon Center often taps into themes for the coming year with merchandise that ties into the wider franchise.

</figure>
<p>
So, what's in store for Pokémon fans this Year of Eevee? So far, all we know of 2025 is that it will see the launch of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the next mainline Pokémon game that will return to Kalos, the region based on Paris first seen in Pokémon X and Y. (And hey, that's where <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> Fest is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fest-2025-to-be-held-in-paris">being held this year</a>! How's that for brand synergy?)

Could the Year of Eevee finally see a new Eevee evolution announced, perhaps set to debut in Pokémon Legends: Z-A? It's now been 12 years since Eevee's eighth evolution option - the Fairy-type Sylveon - was announced, and fans have long hoped for more. A Dragon-type Eeveelution, perhaps? Or how about a Ghost-type?
</p>
<p>And what else could be on the way? C'mon, Pokémon - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-film-franchise-surpasses-1bn-in-global-box-office-revenue">Sega gave Shadow a movie</a>!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/open-thread-how-was-your-break<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to 2025, which is starting in earnest with good things–<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games Done Quick</a>!--and less good things–<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/06/nx-s1-5217818/january-6-electoral-count-reform-act" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the US certifying election results</a>, ushering in whatever the next four years of our lives are going to be. Let’s drag our heels a little longer by reflecting on the glory of the timeless sprawl of winter break.</p><p>My break was pretty OK– I went to visit my parents in Florida for the first time since they moved there many years ago. For <a href="https://www.aclufl.org/en/know-your-rights/know-your-rights-floridas-public-restroom-changing-facility-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obvious reasons</a> I wasn’t that psyched to go, but the trip was mostly good. They live in a weird golfing complex, which makes my dad happy and gave me the opportunity to spy on golfers and remember how much I don’t like golf. My sister took me and my youngest niece and nephew to the Everglades, where we saw so many terrifying alligators and also some cool birds. My parents have a giant TV that is positively cursed with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sor5qTTsOOQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion smoothing</a>; I smugly said “Oh, I can fix this for you,” only for them to not be able to find the remote that would allow me to do so. I have failed in my duty as an ostensibly tech-savvy kid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I also spent some time with my sister’s family in South Carolina, where she lives on a farm full of horses, who let me pet them, and also goats, who for some inexplicable reason I want to pick up and cradle like babies but who mostly ran away to mockingly have goat fun where I couldn’t get to them.</p><p>Because I was away, I didn’t get to play as many games as I meant to, though I did start a new run in my favorite game, <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Long Dark</em></a>, instead of doing the more professionally responsible thing of playing more <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a>. But I did read a lot of books on my travels: a book about <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/671288/dont-call-it-a-cult-by-sarah--berman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NXIVM</a>, an academic book about <a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479881062/heavens-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heaven’s Gate</a>, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/670541/the-rich-people-have-gone-away-by-regina-porter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Rich People Have Gone Away</em></a> (wasn’t as into it as I was hoping to be from reviews), and half of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/665335/come-and-get-it-a-gma-book-club-pick-by-kiley-reid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Come and Get It</em></a>, which I’m digging.</p><p>And now we’re all back to work and ready (or not) for whatever a new year will bring. What did you get up to? How’s your 2025 feeling so far? &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The last time I wrote about Sonic fangame, I innocently and absent-mindedly described it as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dr-robotniks-ring-racers-is-a-gorgeous-free-snes-style-arcade-racer-built-using-doom-legacy">"SNES-style"</a>. This led to <a href="https://x.com/rockpapershot/status/1783557395202834708">a social media dog-pile</a> of an intensity typically reserved for major international banks accidentally tweeting rule34, <a href="https://x.com/rockpapershot/status/1783557395202834708/quotes">a howl of derision</a> that washed over me again and again while I rolled around on the floor beneath my desk, caterwauling at Graham to please please delete the whole internet, I want to start all over again. </p>
<p>Let's see if we fare better this time round: Sonic Galactic is an absurdly accomplished Sonic fangame from Starteam that, broadly, imagines how the Mega Drive and Genesis platformers might have looked and felt had they been made for the Sega Saturn. There's a new demo, if you fancy trying it for yourself. <a href="https://sonicgalactic.github.io/index.html">Please find it here on Itch.io</a>. Perhaps if I'd put the download link higher up the page in the other article, people would have got distracted and refrained from dunking on me so awfully.</p><!--more-->

<p>The base marker for judgement of any post-Mega-Drive Sonic game is: which sidekicks have they kept in? Because after all, the addition of sidekicks has gone hand-in-hand with Sonic's dilution from iconic platform game into puddle of franchising goop. Expand beyond the core trinity of Sonic, Tails and Knuckles, and you are adding a range of, at best, gimmicky, at worst, actively poisonous condiments to an exquisite layer cake. But there are circumstances under which a dollop of Amy Rose, a smattering of Shadow can bring piquancy and zestiness.</p><p>Sonic Galactic seems to have the right idea. Aside from Sonic, Tails and Knuckles, it adds Fang the Sniper (a jerboa) from Sonic The Hedgehog Triple Trouble, and a new character, Tunnel the Mole (a mole). Each character has their own moves with which to modulate the classic Sonic thrill of pinballing through beautiful, "hand-pixelled" arrangements of ring-bedecked loops and ramps, only to collide with some spikes when you're 10 rings away from a 1-Up. </p>
<p>I've played a bit of the demo, which terrifies me slightly for having a tutorial level, with quite wordy text instructions that clatter into view while you're platforming. The game otherwise fits my memories of the Mega Drive games like a glove. It very much feels like the game Sonic Team might have made if they'd been asked to iterate upon the visual and ability design of Sonic 3 - it has the same roster of elemental TV power-ups, but adds a wall-kick for Sonic and various nifty techniques for when running on water. So far, Galactic seems to play things straighter than the obvious comparison, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-mania">Sonic Mania</a>, which I think is showier in its remixing of elements from the older Sonic games. </p>
<p>The 3D special stages are where you most see the "power of Saturn", a very good console that is now mostly remembered for getting its arse kicked by PlayStation 1. The chiptune soundtrack, meanwhile, has that pacey wistfulness I associate with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-i8HYi1QH0">the series at its best</a>.</p>
<p>Sonic Galactic was announced back in 2020, and doesn't have a release date yet. Go on, take the demo out for a spin-attack.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Today is a big day for the WWE, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwes-monday-night-raw-is-moving-to-netflix-in-2025/1100-6520526/" data-ref-id="1100-6520526">Raw officially moves to Netflix</a> with tonight's show from Los Angeles. It also marks an end of an era for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k23-review-head-of-the-table/1900-6418048/" data-ref-id="1900-6418048">WWE 2K23</a>. As of now, 2K Games has taken down the game's servers permanently.</p><p>2K Games said it was giving WWE 2K23 its "final takedown" <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/33035089436307--WWE-2K23-SERVER-SUNSET" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">last September</a>. The game and its DLC was removed from PlayStation and Xbox's digital storefronts at the beginning of November. Now that the servers are also down, WWE 2K23 will no longer have any online functions, including player-to-player matches or even the Community Creations that allowed fan-made characters to be downloaded.</p><p>However, WWE 2K23 will still be available to play offline for anyone who purchased it prior to its removal. This game's fate foreshadows what will eventually befall its successor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k24-review-long-term-booking/1900-6418191/" data-ref-id="1900-6418191">WWE 2K24</a>. That game reintroduced the special referee mode and featured <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k24-cover-stars-new-match-types-and-release-date-revealed/1100-6520486/" data-ref-id="1100-6520486">40 Years of WrestleMania</a>, which allowed players to recreate several famous matches from "the showcase of the immortals."</p><p>2K Games hasn't officially unveiled WWE 2K25 yet, but if the game holds to the previous titles' release window, it should arrive sometime early this year. WWE superstars have also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cods-new-wwe-finishers-have-a-small-touch-wrestling-fans-will-appreciate/1100-6525270/" data-ref-id="1100-6525270">crossed over with Call of Duty</a> and Fortnite in the past, so the next WWE 2K game may not be the only place to find your favorite wrestlers in 2025.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Season 23 Mid-Season Loba Changes</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Loba's tactical ability (Burglar's Best Friend) is getting a second charge by default and the toss and recovery time are both increasing.</li><li dir="ltr">Loba's ultimate ability (Black Market Boutique) will be available immediately, will deploy faster, will be able to be remotely packed up, and can pick up small meds and ally banners for free.</li><li dir="ltr">Black Market Boutique will be able to steal from Explosive Holds and Vaults once again, and stealing from Vaults won't destroy the Black Market Boutique (alarms still go off)</li><li dir="ltr">Loba will be able to pick the locks on Vaults as an interaction</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In addition to these changes, Loba's in-match upgrade paths have been overhauled with one now focused on stealing more items for teammates while the other amplifies her Burglar's Best Friend tactical ability so that she behaves a bit more like a Skirmisher with escape options (akin to Wraith or Alter).</p><p dir="ltr">Mirage is also getting an update but it's not quite as major as the adjustments that Loba is getting. Mirage's passive ability, Now You See Me..., is being improved so that now the holographic trickster will always cloak while he's healing, and while cloaked after a successful revive, Mirage will get a temporary speed boost to aid in repositioning. He's also getting an interesting addition to the second stage of his in-match upgrade track, gaining a choice to access all class-based consoles, bins, beacons, and package scans to become the only character in the game that can transform into an all-rounder.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422592-s0_wraithmirage2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422592" data-ratio="0.50966936993138" data-width="1603" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422592-s0_wraithmirage2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422592"></a><figcaption>Mirage is transforming into Apex Legends' first jack-of-all-trades character.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422592-s0_wraithmirage2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">When I spoke to the Apex Legends dev team about why these changes to Loba and Mirage are coming so late in Season 23--as opposed to being included in the initial seasonal patch--lead legend designer Devin McGuire told me there are "a couple different reasons."</p><p dir="ltr">"Generally we wanted to not throw all our eggs in one basket because support characters will naturally just compete for each other's spaces and some will hit the limelight and others won't. So by splitting it up, we ensure that everyone gets their time and gets to focus in on what the new hotness is. And then by the time the mid-season comes in, we can tip that up and there's something new to look forward to, there's new angles to play off of this support meta once it's been learned. The [legends] that we chose [to get updates] at the start [of Season 23] are simpler to understand legends.</p><p dir="ltr">"And then [Loba and Mirage] are the more nuanced support legends. [Loba] plays off of teleporting and looting up, which are a different way of supporting than just shielding and healing. And then Mirage, who is a very strange one, plays off of cloaking and deception in order to get off more supportive angles and options."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422594-s5_loba3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422594" data-ratio="0.54414784394251" data-width="1461" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422594-s5_loba3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422594"></a><figcaption>Loba is getting huge buffs in the mid-season update, making her a substantially better thief.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422594-s5_loba3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In response to how dominant Gibraltar, Newcastle, and Lifeline have become in Apex Legends' meta in response to the Season 23 changes--all three can keep their allies up and fighting extremely easy if they're carrying a gold knockdown shield--the mid-season update is nerfing that combination a bit to give opposing legends a fighting chance.</p><p dir="ltr">"Both Lifeline and Newcastle ballooned out to a pretty crazy extreme," McGuire said. "We expected them to do that. Lifeline was already at the top of the pick rate and a revival of her amidst already being that strong is not going to bring her down by any means. So I think that these [mid-season] changes will settle them a little bit, just the way that when we made the gold knockdown change early on, it brought both of those characters a little bit closer in line. I don't think we'll see a major shift from them being super high in the meta until we tamper down on the season of support as a whole."</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the playable legends, weapons are getting several adjustments as well. The scariest adjustment is the return of the Select Fire weapon attachment, meaning the fully automatic Prowler submachine gun is once again a threat in Ranked play. The attachment is also, surprisingly, now being allowed on the Charge Rifle as well, the game's second-slowest-firing sniper rifle. With this attachment, the Charge Rifle can now go automatic, firing continuous piercing lasers at an increased fire rate (thankfully, in this mode, at 60% of normal damage).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422595-s7_horizon.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422595" data-ratio="0.56263121063681" data-width="1429" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422595-s7_horizon.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422595"></a><figcaption>The mid-season update is making minor adjustments to both the Mastiff and Peacekeeper shotguns as well.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422595-s7_horizon.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lead battle royale designer Eric Canavese told me that the devs have wanted to add an automatic sniper rifle to Apex Legends for a while now but repeated attempts resulted in something akin to a marksmen rifle. With the Select Fire attachment returning to the loot pool, the team decided to--instead of making a new gun--try using the attachment to give an old gun the option of a faster fire rate.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's still methodical," lead battle royale designer Eric Canavese Canavese clarified when I asked how an automatic sniper rifle could possibly be fair in terms of power. "You still have some time to calibrate and think between shots. Because it represents so much power, we still needed to have a fair amount of recoil--because with snipers you really want them to be able to settle back down before you fire again. So that meant we needed to keep it a bit slower in the fire rate. It's not the same fire rate as the Rampage [light machine gun], but it's like how you would look at the relationship between a Spitfire and a Rampage. This is a slow but automatic version of a sniper."</p><p dir="ltr">The Charge Rifle's projectile size and range are also increasing (the range is going from 200m to 300) while the effects of gravity on projectiles and the recoil while firing are both decreasing, which should make it significantly easier to land shots with what's been a powerful but unwieldy weapon for several seasons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422596-s0_lifeline5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422596" data-ratio="0.58733624454148" data-width="1374" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422596-s0_lifeline5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422596"></a><figcaption>Lifeline has enjoyed a severe spike in pick rate since the start of Season 23, as developer Respawn intended.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422596-s0_lifeline5.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Alongside the return of the Select Fire, a new Ultimate Accelerator attachment is being added to the game that automatically comes equipped with the Nemesis assault rifle, G7 Scout marksmen rifle, and C.A.R. submachine gun. This new attachment increases the rate by which you charge your shield and ultimate ability while dealing damage or knocking targets with these weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">"So it's basically accelerating your gameplay--you're leveling up a bit faster if you're using these weapons," Canavese said. "[The Ultimate Accelerator] is all about pushing that high-octane gameplay, putting it on faster weapons to sort of align with that fast style of gameplay. It's got some cool stuff where if you have an accelerated weapon in your load-out and you get a knock, we actually reward you with a chunk of ultimate charge. It's really good if you're running one of these weapons, it's much easier to reset your ultimates after fights to get ready for the next fight."</p><p dir="ltr">Both the C.A.R. and the Nemesis have never supported hop-up attachments before, making this their first. "We're always looking to flesh out the roster in that way," Canavese said. "For the most part, the C.A.R. is sort of underperforming in the SMG category, so this is an opportunity for us to see if we can boost a weapon's relevancy by giving it utility versus just giving it raw damage. And we think that that's a really fun experiment to be trying."</p><p dir="ltr">Apex Legends Season 23 has shown considerable attention to the support class, so it remains to be seen if this mid-season update is the last major adjustment to the meta we'll see ahead of Season 24 and the next major patch. Season 24 will also mark the six-year anniversary of Apex Legends, kicking off in mid-February.</p>

                <p>A newly unsurfaced and translated interview reveals more information about how the Mario franchise's iconic pipes came to be, and there is a pretty simple explanation for it.</p><p>Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto told Game Maestro in 2000, and translated more recently by <a href="https://shmuplations.com/miyamoto2000/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shmuplations</a>, that although the first Mario Bros. game established Mario as a plumber, the idea for pipes didn't come until later. Miyamoto said he was walking down the street in Kyoto one day and "saw a plastic pipe sticking out of a wall." This helped Miyamoto solve a design challenge, and thus the iconic warp pipe was born.</p><p>"Due to the way the screens worked, enemies that went to the bottom had to re-appear at the top of the screen. So that got us thinking, OK, we need a path or some way for them to get back up there. Then one day I happened to be walking through the streets of Kyoto, and I saw a plastic pipe sticking out of a wall," he said (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/marios-iconic-pipes-only-exist-because-shigeru-miyamoto-happened-to-see-a-plastic-pipe-sticking-out-of-a-wall-while-wandering-the-streets-of-kyoto/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_content=gamesradar&amp;utm_medium=social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar</a>).</p><p>Miyamoto also discussed how a logical setting for the original Mario games was an underground tunnel, in part because it's where turtles, crabs, and flies--enemies in the game--tend to live. He envisioned a place like New York with its extensive underground tunnel system, though Miyamoto hadn't ever been to New York at the time.</p><p>"I guess we should say Mario Bros. takes place in a New York-ish kind of place, really," he said.</p><p>This wasn't the last time Miyamoto discussed the origins of Mario's iconic pipes. In 2009, he said in an <a href="https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/wii/nsmb/0/2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Iwata Asks interview</a> that he was walking through a residential area on the way home from his office when he said an area that had "a number of drainage pipes coming out of it."</p><p>"I thought: 'I can use those!' (laughs) It's well established that something will emerge from a pipe and then go back into it," he said.</p><p>But why make the pipes green? Miyamoto said he couldn't recall the exact reason, but explained that video games at the time couldn't support all that many different colors.</p><p>"Blue was very bright and beautiful. Green was also very nice when you used two different tones. Those were the things we considered when designing the look of the game," he said.</p><p>Nintendo doesn't have any new Mario games that have been announced, but that could change soon, as Nintendo is likely to bring a new Mario game to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>. The console will be announced in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-announcement-is-still-five-months-away-at-most/1100-6527576/" data-ref-id="1100-6527576">next few months</a>, at which point some games should be revealed for it.</p>
