You’ll first encounter locked chests in the underground caverns beneath the prison, and then in nearly every dungeon thereafter. It’s a core component of the game. It’s also one of the most cumbersome to some players. But mastering the mini-game and leveling up essential skills will quickly turn your fortunes around. Eventually you’ll be putting the Gray Fox himself to shame.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,196470,196848" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h129889"><a id=""></a>Skills that affect lockpicking</h2><figure id="" data-id="653b719c7126f42340e5b3a015901a9d" data-recommend-id="image://653b719c7126f42340e5b3a015901a9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Security skill in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Security skill in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="653b719c7126f42340e5b3a015901a9d" data-recommend-id="image://653b719c7126f42340e5b3a015901a9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Security skill in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you think you’ll spend a lot of time lockpicking as a stealthy character, like one of the many members of the Thieves’ Guild, then <strong>you’ll want to increase your Security</strong>.</p><p>Like all other skills in the game, there are five levels to Security:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Novice (0)</strong>: Up to four tumblers will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li><li><strong>Apprentice (25)</strong>: Up to three tumblers will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li><li><strong>Journeyman (50)</strong>: Up to two tumblers will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li><li><strong>Expert (75)</strong>: Only one tumbler will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li><li><strong>Master (100)</strong>: No tumblers will fall when you fail and break a lockpick.</li></ul><p>You can level the skill by attempting lockpicks and speaking with the occasional thief or beggar to train your abilities higher in exchange for gold.</p><h2 id="h129890"><a id=""></a>How to lockpick successfully</h2><figure id="" data-id="21645820e555d8b5d125ad5525bbc2e9" data-recommend-id="image://21645820e555d8b5d125ad5525bbc2e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="he lockpicking minigame HUD in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="he lockpicking minigame HUD in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="21645820e555d8b5d125ad5525bbc2e9" data-recommend-id="image://21645820e555d8b5d125ad5525bbc2e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="he lockpicking minigame HUD in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Before you attempt to break into a treasure chest filled with junk that you’ll likely toss aside to satisfy your weight limit, you must have lockpicks in your inventory.

                <p dir="ltr">In an industry overflowing with news regarding layoffs, closures, and reduction, any example of a company withstanding the tests of time is worthy of celebration. Gameloft is one such company, and right now it's in celebration mode as it commemorates its 25th anniversary.</p><p dir="ltr">What started as a small mobile gaming outfit has grown into a firm that employs over 2,900 people across 10 studios. With a mix of popular original IP and licensed games in its portfolio, Gameloft is poised to stick around for the foreseeable future.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot sat down with Gameloft CEO Alexandre de Rochefort to reflect on the past 25 years of Gameloft's history. He speaks about the main reasons Gameloft has been able to persist, four essential turning points in the history of the company, and the challenges of overcoming the perceived stigmas of the mobile gaming scene.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482831-asphalt-9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482831" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482831-asphalt-9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482831"></a><figcaption>Asphalt 9: Legends</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482831-asphalt-9.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">"Agility" is key</h2><p dir="ltr">If there's a single word de Rochefort would use to describe Gameloft's persistence in the gaming industry--and he would know, as he's been with the company for its entire existence--it's "agility." In his view, the company has always shown the ability to adapt when needed, especially at the dawning of the mobile gaming boom.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every six months, it seems, we've been faced with critical changes, either within Gameloft or within the industry," de Rochefort says. "The number one reason I'm still here in the company is that I'm still having fun, because every six months there's something radically new happening." Laying out the timeline of Gameloft's history, de Rochefort points to four key moments that, according to him, played a major role in the direction Gameloft would take.</p><p dir="ltr">The first date the Gameloft CEO mentions is January 2003, when the Java programming language was added to Nokia and Siemens mobile phones. This, as de Rochefort explains, was the spark needed to turn the mobile gaming industry into what it is today.</p><p dir="ltr">"2000 through 2002 were extremely harsh years, both for Gameloft and for the few competitors that we had at the time, because nothing was happening in our space," de Rochefort explains. "We were right in our vision, but we were too early; thank God the Java technology was introduced.</p><p dir="ltr">The second core date in Gameloft's history is also a universal change: July 2008, which marked the introduction of the Apple App Store for the iPhone. This was a "game-changer," as de Rochefort describes, not only for Gameloft but for the entire industry, as it "kickstarted the growth of the industry" via smartphone and tablet gaming.</p><p dir="ltr">Next on de Rochefort's list of key moments is more nebulous than the previous two, but its effects are no less important: de Rochefort credits the rise of free-to-play gaming from 2010-2012 as essential to Gameloft's future, as it marked a second boom in the mobile gaming sphere--as well as gaming as whole. "For me, [free-to-play] goes well beyond mobile; it's a defining moment for the video game industry," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">The final milestone on the list of important dates, unlike the previous two, is specific to Gameloft: In January 2019, the company decided to branch out from phones and tablets to home consoles and PC, and doing so allowed them to grow the business not just in revenue, but in partnerships with other companies.</p><p dir="ltr">"At the time, Apple and Google were our biggest partners--and for a time, our only partners," de Rochefort said. "Now, when I look at the charts, we have seven, eight, nine different partners, and Apple and Google are now somewhere in the middle." Who, then, has taken their place at the top of Gameloft's partnership ranks? According to de Rochefort, it's Nintendo.</p><p dir="ltr">De Rochefort says that while moving away from mobile exclusivity has some drawbacks, it ultimately allows the company to be more agile in the long run. "By transitioning these teams to PC and console, we do release less games than we used to per year," he explains, "but the ambition that we have on those games is way more significant. Now, the majority of our games are meant to be cross platform between PC, console, and mobile."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482835-ddv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482835" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482835-ddv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482835"></a><figcaption>Disney Dreamlight Valley</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482835-ddv.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Defeating the stereotypes</h2><p dir="ltr">For some, the term "mobile game" comes with a set of stereotypes rooted in the predatory "gacha"-style tactics designed to separate a player from their money. de Rochefort is very aware of this, and he prides himself on Gameloft's games creating a barrier between those methods and the studio's games.</p><p dir="ltr">Having lived through the entire history of mobile gaming, de Rochefort feels the company is uniquely qualified to avoid such pitfalls. "We've been in the mobile space forever, and this was not how mobile gaming used to be," he says.</p><p dir="ltr">"With our Java games from 2003-2008, and then from 2008-2012, we were selling super high-quality mobile games for a premium price of $5 to $10," de Rochefort says. At the time, things were fair, straightforward, and easy to understand--and then free-to-play arrived."</p><p dir="ltr">There's a clear divide, in de Rochefort's opinion, when it comes to the overall reaction to free-to-play games. Some players, particularly younger players or those living in countries where mobile gaming is the most ubiquitous, are used to the free-to-play model and can identify when a game is particularly aggressive. Other players, those who grew up with console and PC gaming before mobile phones became a viable platform, are the ones who look down on the practice as predatory.</p><p dir="ltr">For his part, de Rochefort recognizes that "some games have been super aggressive and hurt the industry badly," but he has worked to ensure that Gameloft treats their players as fairly as possible. "I think free-to-play is fine, but it's important for the companies in this industry to make sure that we stay within the boundaries of what is fair to the user, and we really try to do that," he says. "I really don't think we're one of the greedy companies."</p><p dir="ltr">de Rochefort cites Disney Dreamlight Valley as an example: DDV is a premium game with an upfront cost, and it does include extra items and cosmetics purchased with in-game currency. However, as de Rochefort describes, "you can finish and can play every part of the main game without ever having to spend any extra money, and we try to avoid the traps of being too aggressive with things like paywalls and the like."</p><p dir="ltr">He also mentions in-game advertising as an example; free-to-play games feature many in-game ads, but "less than 10 percent of [Gameloft's] revenue" comes from advertising. "We've always wanted to make sure we make real gaming experiences," de Rochefort says. "That's why we didn't go hypercasual; it's simply not in our DNA."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482836-oregon-trail.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482836" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482836-oregon-trail.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482836"></a><figcaption>The Oregon Trail (2019)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4482836-oregon-trail.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Positioning for the future</h2><p dir="ltr">Just before the interview, Gameloft announced a 25th-anniversary celebration which would give players across its portfolio free in-game currency. 21 different games are included in the promotion, and maintaining 21 different games is no small feat. de Rochefort, however, says the company is well-equipped to handle them thanks to its 2900 employees across 10 studios.</p><p dir="ltr">The company was not immune to the recent wave of layoffs, however, with Gameloft Toronto seeing 49 employees laid off in 2024. de Rochefort is hopeful the worst is in the past, both for Gameloft and the industry at large, as long as companies are realistic in their goals.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think the industry is arriving at a more mature state after three difficult years for the video game industry," de Rochefort says. "We are optimistic, because we simply accept the fact that the industry is not going to grow double digits like it had in the 10 years prior to 2021. I don't see the growth engine that could allow the industry to grow like that coming in the next four or five years."</p><p dir="ltr">For Gameloft's part, staying afloat means a healthy mix of original IP and licensed games, and there are a lot of plans in the pipeline. Internal IP like Asphalt, Gangstar, and Dungeon Hunter are balanced with the aforementioned Disney Dreamlight Valley, an upcoming Dungeon and Dragons game in partnership with Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast, and a few other "unannounced titles" on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">The "agility" that's so important to de Rochefort's vision can also be seen in how many platform Gameloft games can be found on: along with PC, consoles, and traditional mobile marketplaces like the App Store, the company has focused on newer subscription services like Apple Arcade and Netflix Games to show off their games.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think we're the biggest supplier of games to Apple Arcade; we've launched eight games with them already, and we have more to come," de Rochefort says. "Same thing with Netflix, we've released four games there, and hopefully we'll have more games coming in the future."</p><p dir="ltr">As far as what future Gameloft titles may look like, however, the company knows there's no specific blueprint to follow. "There's no miracle recipe for a blockbuster, as you know, because if there were, we would all be doing the same games," de Rochefort says.</p><p dir="ltr">He does, however, make one prediction: The days of Gameloft developing games exclusively for mobile devices are likely over. "We will try and maximize our odds by being super clear on what kind of games we want to do, and we want to do cross-platform," de Rochefort explains. "We will probably not do mobile-only games anymore; if anything, we'll do a PC and console game, and we'll make the effort of porting the game to mobile."</p>

      </div>
<p>Requisitions are sets of items that include weapons, equipment, and cosmetics. Players can obtain items in Requisitions using "Lost Assets," the in-game currency earned by completing Jobs. "Play the game, unlock stuff. Simple," the developer post succinctly reads.</p><p>Unlike other modern online games, which feature timed battle passes and stores with rotating items, FBC: Firebreak will offer its Requisitions permanently. Players will be able to choose which items to unlock in any order they please, and they can make progress in earning items from multiple Requisitions at once.</p><p>Meanwhile, Classified Requisitions are "premium" cosmetic item sets that cost real money and include armor sets, sprays, and weapon skins. Remedy did not clarify in the post how much these item sets will cost, but the studio promises that they will have "no impact on gameplay."</p><p>The Deluxe Edition of FBC: Firebreak, which goes for an extra $10 (the base game is modestly priced at $40), comes with the "Firestarter" Classified Requisition, which contains 36 unlockable cosmetic items.</p><p>This Requisitions structure resembles the Helldivers 2 Warbonds system, letting players earn rewards at their own pace and not be vulnerable to potential FOMO. As GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedys-fbc-firebreak-is-more-left-4-dead-than-live-service-and-thats-the-beauty-of-it/1100-6530228/" data-ref-id="1100-6530228">FBC: Firebreak preview</a> points out, the game "doesn't punish you for not playing on its schedule."</p><p>When FBC: Firebreak launches on June 17, it'll be on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-will-feature-cross-play-multiplayer/1100-6530895/" data-ref-id="1100-6530895">full cross-play support</a>. Subscribers of Game Pass Ultimate and PS Plus (Extra and Premium) can hop on the game on day one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/656169/wd-black-c50-xbox-storage-card-m4-macbook-air-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Maybe, like me, you bought the Xbox Series S with 512GB of storage and realized, after installing <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6,</em> that you don’t have much (or any) space left for any other games. And maybe, like me, you had to hunt for another drive so you could install other games to play.</p><p>If you’re still in that boat, you might want to consider Western Digital’s 2TB WD_Black NVMe solid state drive. It’s currently on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DK74LG91/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon for an all-time low of $179.99</a> ($50 off), or about 22 percent off the standard price, and will provide you with plenty of additional storage to work with. To put the price in perspective, it’s only $30 more than the 1TB version, which isn’t on sale. WD is also one of two manufacturers I’m aware of that make these easy plug-in cards — the other is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/5/23712516/xbox-expansion-cards-seagate-price-cut-deal-sale">Seagate</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->180</span></p><div><p>Western Digital’s storage expansion cards for Xbox Series X / S consoles are speedy, plug-and-play cards that match the performance of the consoles’ onboard SSDs. They offer a slightly lower-cost alternative to Seagate’s expansion cards, which were the only game in town for years.</p></div></div><p>There’s no fiddling around with screws or anything to get it to work, either. Just pop it into the back of your Xbox Series S / X, and bam, you’re good to go. Plug and play at its finest, baby.</p><p>But let’s pivot to another good deal real quick.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZD9S5GC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1883962-REG%2Fapple_mw123ll_a_13_macbook_air_m4.html%2FkZa17940ZSRrfIj%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw5azABhD1ARIsAA0WFUGYcUxik6ZHlmds-QlwCWAQgyNHflK_dp8WpOc1Xjs6EEW8YhjAkFcaArdXEALw_wcB" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a> are also selling Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review">brand-new M4 MacBook Air</a>, which just launched in March, starting at $899 (its best price to date). That’s $100 off Apple’s starting price of $999, which itself is already $100 cheaper than the entry-level price of the M3 model last year.</p><p>And, with the M4, you get 256GB of starting storage instead of 128GB, which is probably fine for most folks who don’t need a lot of local storage. Like me, for example. I’m using an M2 MacBook Air for work, and I only have 82GB used.</p><p>The latest M4 model also has a better 12-megapixel Center Stage camera that will follow your face around while you’re on camera (better said: it’ll keep you in frame) and 16GB of RAM. The design is unchanged from last year, which means you’re still getting just a MagSafe charger and two USB-C ports. But the update to M4 allows you to add two external monitors while also leaving the display open, for a total of three running screens. Good for multitasking.</p><p>It’s a MacBook Air. It’s the best MacBook for most people. You really can’t go wrong here.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Because of that success, many assumed a DLC expansion would be coming for the megahit RPG, but that doesn't seem to be the case--and in Larian CEO Swen Vincke's opinion, that's because the studio finds making DLC "boring."</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with GameSpot, Vincke mentioned that Larian is "not in the DLC business," pointing to Baldur's Gate 3's massive patches and updates as the way Larian prefers to update its games. When asked to expand further, Vincke called making DLC "boring" and said there's "no passion" in doing that at the studio.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="737228107" data-promo-id="0"

                <p dir="ltr">Machine-learning and artificial intelligence systems are some of the most-talked-about technologies in gaming--and across a variety of other industries. Some fear advancements to such systems might lead to negative consequences, while others predict a rosier future. Still others, like Larian Studios boss Swen Vincke, are trying to thoughtfully implement new technologies to help empower developers, not replace them. We caught up with Vincke recently, who discussed a range of subjects, including machine learning and AI. Watch the full interview below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy9P2HPF9ss" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gy9P2HPF9ss" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tasks "Nobody Wants To Do"</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Vincke said Larian currently uses machine learning systems to help automate game-development tasks that "nobody wants to do."</p><p dir="ltr">"It's the obvious things, like a motion capture cleaning or voice editing or, something very specific. Retargeting. So that is basically if you play with different species, you want to be able to reuse an animation on a different species that are in different size, and then they're doing certain interactions with others," Vincke explained.</p><p dir="ltr">For these purposes, machine learning "works really well," Vincke said. Larian is also embracing the technology for what's called "white boxing," which is the term for how a studio like Larian iterates on ideas rapidly. "White boxing is essentially the stage before you actually do the real implementation," he said, noting that using machine learning can help speed up the process.</p><div tabindex="0"

traditional development circumstances, this might take "some time" before a developer can create something that's actually playable, but white boxing with machine learning helps "accelerate that."</p><p dir="ltr">But for Vincke's money, the most exciting implementation of machine learning is when it can be used for new gameplay elements. However, it's still early days, and Larian is "not there yet," or even close. But it's an area that Vincke is excited about because it could help the studio implement new RPG ideas faster.</p><p dir="ltr">"For an RPG developer, what you really want is something that helps with reactivity to agency," he said. "So, permutations that you did not foresee, reactions to things that the player has done, in the world, they will certainly augment the gameplay experience."</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke mentioned how in a game like FIFA (now called EA Sports FC), the under-the-hood procedural generation happens in real time, and that's what he's referring to in regards to how machine learning can impact gameplay.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Red Flags</strong></h2><p>For all of this hope and optimism about using new technologies like machine learning to help speed up and improve game development, Vincke said he understands there are "red flags" to consider. Some people have legitimate fears of machine learning and AI systems stealing their work or taking their jobs. However, Vincke said Larian is hiring more people, not fewer, thanks to new technologies. This is what others,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969"> like EA CEO Andrew Wilson and Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick</a>, have predicted.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's always going to be the people that are going to make a difference," Vincke said. "And so for us, it's super clear that we're investing heavily into the team and the human touch that's being added to that."</p><p dir="ltr">With more automation, human workers are freed up to create more, which in turn leads to the possibility of making "more complex things," Vincke said.</p><p dir="ltr">"When complexity goes up, things start getting really interesting. So it's fair to say that the games that are being made today are arguably more complex than they were in the past," he said. "The faster you can iterate, the faster you will get to a certain result. And then and the tightening of those pipelines should allow you, in theory, to make your games in a more efficient manner."</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>More Time To Be Creative</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Automation with machine learning AI is a "huge thing," Vincke said. People may not be aware of how much time an animator may spend on "stuff they don't want to work on." As such, thanks to automation, "It adds a lot to the time that they have to work on the creative stuff," Vincke said.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke said it's "the wrong attitude" to assume that automation will replace various people and departments. Because automation should, in theory, allow people to do "more of what really matters and less of the stuff that they don't want to do."</p><p dir="ltr">"That's not necessarily cost reduction," he added. "But it's going to be an increase of ability, which is a good thing."</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What's Next For Larian</strong></h2><p>Following the huge success of Baludr's Gate 3 in 2024, everyone is wondering what Larian is going to make next. We know it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">won't be Baldur's Gate 4</a>, but instead a project codenamed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">Excalibur.</a></p><p>Beyond Larian's next game, Vincke is thinking even further out and has grand plans to create a "very big RPG" that will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-is-working-toward-an-rpg-that-dwarfs-it/1100-6522051/" data-ref-id="1100-6522051">"dwarf"</a> any of Larian's previous releases. "It's an inspirational goal. That's it. I cannot say more, because it needs to stay in that dream-reality," he said.</p><p>While Larian will not make Baldur's Gate 4, Hasbro has said it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">keen to expand the Baldur's Gate series with other teams. </a>"We're going to take our time and find the right partner, the right approach, and the right product," Hasbro previously said about the future of Baldur's Gate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-open-world-rpg-now-set-for-may-23-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Polish independent developer Questline has announced the full release date of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-open-world-rpg-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon</a>.</p>
<p>Questline previously launched <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1199030/Tainted_Grail_Conquest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tainted Grail: Conquest</a>, a hybrid game mixing deck-building roguelike elements with RPG, in 2021 to positive reviews.&nbsp;This one is much more ambitious, though. It's a first-person open world roleplaying game available on Steam Early Access for two years, now set to debut version 1.0 for PC and consoles (<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-demo/9nql6tbgt1gc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>) on May 23.</p>
<p>The developers are promising a meaty experience that can take between 50 and 70 hours to be completed. Players will find the following content:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three massive zones to explore:</strong>&nbsp;Horns of the South, Cuanacht, and Forlorn Swords.</li>
<li><strong>250 unique NPCs</strong>, fully voice-acted, adding depth and a personal touch to the world.</li>
<li><strong>Over 200 side quests</strong>, ensuring countless hours of engaging gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>More than 60 unique enemies</strong>, each presenting distinct challenges.</li>
<li><strong>70+ dungeons</strong>&nbsp;filled with secrets and dangers.</li>
<li><strong>A branching main quest</strong>&nbsp;with dozens of possible endings, offering deep replayability.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/utDgF27366E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Setting-wise, Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon is a dark fantasy reimagining of Arthurian legends. Players will journey into the heart of Avalon, a land shaped by 600 years of Camelot’s rule, to witness the epic conclusion of this era. With their choices, they will decide the legacy of King Arthur's reign.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 will introduce the community-requested third-person view. Questline has prefaced that it won't be perfect yet, but they're adding it in anyway since many users have problems with the first-person view (such as motion sickness). At this stage, it's more of an accessibility fix. Of course, there will also be brand new Achievements to mark the players' journey throughout Avalon.</p>
<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg, as the developers of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon hinted that version 1.0 includes so much content that it's 'crazy' and they would have 'laughed hard' if they were told the game would end up this big. However, the full patch notes aren't available yet.</p>
<p>As a side note, the team also shared a 'golden horse armor DLC' joke as a joke reference to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oblivion Remastered</a>, then added in a Steam post:</p>
<p><em>On a serious note, it is so good to see Oblivion coming back with such a style! It is one of the games that shaped us when we were kids/teens, and continues to be a huge source of inspiration. BIG congratulations to the team responsible for the remaster! We can’t wait to get back to Cyrodiil ourselves, but for now… well, we have a game to finish first! And we are honestly doing our best to deliver something unique that we hope you will remember for quite a long time.</em></p>

Loudness EQ levels out the game's high and low audio, minimizing loud and unnecessary sounds while boosting quieter ones like enemy footsteps.</p><p dir="ltr">As a PlayStation 5 player, I always assume my PC opponents can hear me from a mile away. I decided to try the new Audio Focus setting to remove some of their advantage with the sound in Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Admittedly, I was skeptical at first because this is a new setting and it doesn't offer as much control over the sound as PC's Loudness EQ. However, this definitely helped boost the footstep audio in Warzone, and I was able to catch enemies sneaking up on me from much greater distances. There were a few instances where I probably got reported as a cheater, because I could hear my opponent from such great distances and was instantly ready with my gun up.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few presets to choose from, but the one specifically for amplifying footsteps is the Boost High Pitch setting, which amplifies "high-frequency sounds like footsteps and metallic noises." Once you select it, you can then choose weak, medium, or strong.</p><p dir="ltr">Audio Focus definitely gives a competitive edge for PS5 players, but I wouldn't recommend using this Boost High Pitch on the strong setting, though, as it amplifies more than just the footsteps. Some of the metallic sounds it amplifies, such as the creaky metal from the planes in Boneyard, can really be painful on the ears.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the day, this is still an accessibility feature designed more for players with actual hearing loss. So, if you're not someone who needs the setting, it's best to try on the weak or medium strength. It's not worth ruining your hearing just to get a better jump on a Warzone opponent.</p><p dir="ltr">This Audio Focus setting also works in Black Ops 6 and should work for other competitive games on PlayStation 5 as well.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, a Call of Duty fan had their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tsa-seizes-call-of-duty-monkey-bomb-replica-from-passengers-luggage/1100-6531126/">Zombies-themed Monkey Bomb accessory confiscated</a> at the airport. I have this exact same accessory. It's just a solid mold of the CoD Zombies Monkey Bomb designed to hold a controller. This serves as a good reminder to myself and anyone else to not travel with any monkey bomb replicas.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> arrives this June, but there'll be an opportunity to check out its sandy survival action ahead of its full launch. Developer Funcom has announced it's holding the game's "largest beta yet" in May, with keys being made available to "tens of thousands" of players.
</p>
<p>
Funcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funcoms-open-world-survival-mmo-dune-awakening-gets-first-trailer">unveiled Dune: Awakening in 2022</a>, as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/conan-exiles-developer-funcom-lands-deal-to-make-dune-games">deal to make "at least" three games</a> set in the Dune universe. It whisks players to Arrakis for an open-world, multiplayer survival adventure drawing from Frank Herbert's sci-fi novels and Denis Villeneuve's film adaptations.
</p>
<p>
Dune Awakening has been in closed beta for over a year now, but with its full release now looming following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-delayed-for-last-minute-changes-from-beta-testers">brief delay</a>, Funcom is preparing one final, large-scale beta blowout that'll run from 9th-12th May. The studio is calling it Dune: Awakening's "largest beta yet... with a huge number of new players joining compared to previous closed betas".
</p>
<figure>

<p>
It'll give players a chance to experience survival in the vast, wormy deserts of Arrakis, as well as "most of" Dune: Awakening's first story act - which Funcom says should equal around 20 hours of playtime. Unlike previous betas, there's no NDA to sign, and all gameplay can be shared.
</p>
<p>
To be in with a chance of taking part in the beta, players have a number of options. They can either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">visit Dune: Awakening's Steam page</a> and hit the 'Request Access' button, or tune into the Global LAN Party Broadcast on 10th May, which will include developer chat and more. Funcom says "tens of thousands" of keys will be handed out during the broadcast, and these can be used to gain immediate access to the Dune: Awakening beta weekend.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening gets its full Steam launch on 10th June, and an Xbox Series X/S and PS5 release is due at a later date. It's looking pretty promising too; Eurogamer's Robert Purchese came away impressed after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">going hands-on with it earlier this year</a>, writing: "You can live out your Dune fantasy in the most faithful recreation of Arrakis we've yet seen in a game, pausing as the ground shudders from a nearby sandworm, ducking for cover as a sandstorm blows in, and searching crevices for the secrets of the world hidden within.... keep an eye on this one."

			<p>Sydney Sweeney is appearing in the news for video game to film adaptations for the second time this week. After a <a href="https://wccftech.com/michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney-have-reportedly-teamed-up-with-universal-to-make-a-film-adaptation-of-segas-out-run/">report from Deadline</a> that Sweeney would be teaming up with Michael Bay to adapt SEGA's Out Run into a movie, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney-jon-m-chu-video-game-1236377192/">Variety</a> reports that Sweeney is now teaming up with Wicked director Jon M. Chu to adapt Hazelight's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split-Fiction</a> into a film.</p>
<p>Sweeney is slated to be an executive producer and will also star in the movie. Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, the same writers behind Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, will write the script.</p>
<p>Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/">previously</a> reported that a Split-Fiction movie was happening, but now we know some of the key creatives behind the project. While Sweeney will play one of the lead roles between Zoe and Mio, characters named after Hazelight Studio head Josef Fares' daughters, it's not yet decided which role Sweeney will play.</p>
<p>In the case of a game like Out Run, it isn't easy to see what shape a film adaptation of that game will take. The opposite is true for Split-Fiction, which, despite having a predictable story, is ripe for a film adaptation with plenty of opportunities for big blockbuster movie moments in its fantasy and sci-fi settings.</p>
<p>The next big questions now are who will star alongside Sweeney, how Chu will bring some of the magic he brought to Wicked to Split Fiction, and whether the story can't be punched up in a new medium with its film version.</p>
<p>So far, in the renaissance of video game adaptations to movie or TV show adaptations, we've not seen an adaptation surpass the game in terms of storytelling. Some changes have been praised, but there hasn't yet been an adaptation where we could definitively say the story is improved in the adapted version. Split-Fiction feels like the perfect candidate to break that ceiling.</p>

It's being made inside CDPR by a dedicated team, Green added, noting that Nintendo staff helped with the project, too, when challenges or issues came up in development.</p><p>"Development still had challenges, of course, as any development process does, but we've been careful in picking tradeoffs to not compromise the game's vision," Green said. "We haven't had to fight with fitting into memory. And the speed of the data storage has helped alleviate some of those early streaming problems. This has allowed us to focus our attention on improving other things, and we're very happy with the result."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1309312638" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Green said the aim here was to "integrate this as naturally as possible" so that it "feels like using a PC."</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 for Switch 2 is the Ultimate Edition, meaning it includes the base game, all updates, and the 2023 expansion Phantom Liberty. The game weighs in at around 64 GB, and the physical version contains the game on the cart, which can't be said for every physical edition.</p><p>If you're keen to pick up Cyberpunk 2077 for Switch 2, you can consult <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-nintendo-switch-physical-game-cartridge-preorder-walmart/1100-6531086/" data-ref-id="1100-6531086">GameSpot's preorder guide to find out everything you need to know.</a></p>

It sold so much that, in fact, that <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250425.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Capcom officially announced</a> that it reached 10 million copies sold. Making it the fastest to reach that milestone than any other entry in the entire Resident Evil Franchise within just two years.</p><p>Capcom also compared the number of sales with the last few games of the series, starting with 2017's Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. Both Biohazard and the Resident Evil 2 Remake, released in 2019, have achieved over 15 million cumulative units sold. 2021's Resident Evil: Village has reached over 11 million cumulative units, while 2020's Resident Evil 3 Remake sold 10 million cumulative units.</p><p>Since the series launched in 1996, the company has sold 167 million units across almost 30 years of the franchise.</p><p>Resident Evil 4 was already touted as one of the greatest games of all time. Capcom raised the bar for what a good remake could be, all the while keeping the game's original legacy as a genre-defining experience intact. Of course, the memes of Ashley certainly didn't hurt, either.</p><p>It should be noted that Capcom didn't elaborate upon how the sales were broken down by platform, physical, digital, or any of that.

Those sales alone cemented it as one of the fastest-selling Resident Evil games ever.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-next-skate-game-wont-be-playable-offline-to-support-its-multiplayer-skateboarding-sandbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Players have asked EA for years to bring back the Skate series, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-4-announced/">four years ago</a>, EA finally answered those prayers with the official confirmation that the skateboarding series would indeed be coming back.</p>
<p>Four years later, we know that was just an announcement at the time and that this new Skate game was only beginning its development when EA confirmed the series' return. But now that we're <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-in-early-access-next-year/">approaching its early access</a> release sometime this year, we're learning more about it, and the latest bit of confirmed news is one that definitely won't go down well with fans.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-wont-be-playable-offline-to-offer-a-massively-multiplayer-sandbox-thats-always-online-and-always-evolving">Eurogamer</a>, developer Full Circle confirmed that the new Skate game will not have an offline mode. You'll always need to be online and connected to the game's servers when playing. In an FAQ section towards the bottom of a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-one">new blog</a> from Full Circle, the studio bluntly answered the question about an offline mode.</p>
<p>"<em>The simple answer: No. The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving. You'll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities. In order to deliver on our vision of a skateboarding world, the game will always require a live connection.</em>"</p>
<p>It's disappointing news for veteran fans of the series, many of whom likely don't want to be bothered with the live service elements of the new Skate game. They were just looking to spend hours enjoying the skateboarding mechanics and feeling that only the Skate series provided back when the original trilogy was in its heyday.</p>
<p>While this new Skate game will launch in early access later this year, Full Circle also confirmed that more than 200,000 players have already gotten the chance to check it out in the game's closed alpha test that's been running since September 2024. If you want to join that number, you can still sign up for the playtest and hope to be selected. There's also always the hope that Full Circle will run an open beta ahead of the early access release closer to the launch.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-hit-500k-in-first-24-hours.1173903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive have revealed that turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has hit a major sales milestone within its first 24 hours on sale.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1915777375834452273" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Sandfall reveals that the game has hit 500,000 sales, despite only being available for less than a day. That's a pretty impressive milestone by itself, but the game is also available on Game Pass, so it's managed to hit that figure despite being part of a subscription service (for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">certain tiers</a>, at any rate).</p>

<p>Rather humbly, Sandfall and Kepler say the sales figure is "a milestone for us, reached sooner than we'd ever imagined", thanking those who've bought&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-boss.jpg?itok=-GXe246t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-boss.jpg?itok=DrYZhsfn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is selling very well indeed.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG set in a world inspired by Belle Époque-era France (in much the same way as the Soulslike&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/lies-of-p" rel="nofollow"><em>Lies of P</em></a>, although the two have very different gameplay).</p>

<p>The game is set in a world in which a figure known as the Paintress paints a number each year, and everyone of that age dies. Every year, the number gets lower, meaning more and more people are dying each time a number is painted.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, you're part of the titular Expedition 33, which refers to the number the Paintress will paint on the day following the outset of the game. It's up to you to stop her before she can claim more lives.</p>

<p>To do so, you'll engage in turn-based battles with real-time elements; you'll need to dodge and parry attacks with good timing, and some attacks also have&nbsp;<em>Shadow Hearts</em>-style quick-time events to increase damage.</p>




<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/clair-obscur--expedition-33/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/clair-obscur-expedition-33/9ppt8k6gqhrz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also part of Game Pass if you're subscribed to the Ultimate or PC tiers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-just-got-a-sneaky-teaser-by-capcom-fans-believe<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Capcom just dropped a clever Resident Evil 9 teaser right in front of our noses - or so fans believe.
</p>
<p>
Tilt your head and you can see the Roman numerals for the number nine - IX - appear in a video published today from Capcom that celebrates the success of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>.
</p>
<p>
As the video wraps up, we see a fresh paint on a sign added to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>'s iconic village scene, with writing that thanks fans for playing. But squint and the sign's shape is also a nod to what's next, fans think. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">Capcom already casually confirmed Resident Evil 9 was in development last summer</a> - with Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi back at the helm.

<p>
But details of Resident Evil 9 are otherwise scarce - we don't even know if Resident Evil 9, or IX, will be its title, though today's apparent teaser seems to suggest this may be the case. 
</p>
<p>
One report from veteran Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-will-be-open-world-leaker-suggests">suggested the next Resi game would feature more of an open-world</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We're making a new Resident Evil," Nakanishi said last year. "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after Resident Evil 7, but I found it, and to be honest, it feels substantial. I can't share any details just yet, but I hope you’re excited for the day I can."
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if you tilt your head the other way, Capcom is already teasing Resident Evil 11. But that seems a little soon.
