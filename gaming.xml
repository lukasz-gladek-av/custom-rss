            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a new week, and we’re smack-bang in the middle of November. It’s a busy time all around – Thanksgiving is on the horizon, Christmas is just beyond, and Black Friday starts soon. There’s a lot to focus on, but today, let’s start small by smashing this NYT Connections puzzle.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions you need to start your week on a high.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-17">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 17)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #890:</p>



<ul>
<li>TABOO</li>



<li>SLAM DUNK</li>



<li>GO-GETTER</li>



<li>SURE THING</li>



<li>SHOO-IN</li>



<li>SCATTERGORIES</li>



<li>OKEY-DOKE</li>



<li>PROSCRIBED</li>



<li>ALLEY-OOP</li>



<li>ABSOLUTELY</li>



<li>VERBOTEN</li>



<li>FADEAWAY</li>



<li>OFF-LIMITS</li>



<li>LEAVENING</li>



<li>FINGER ROLL</li>



<li>OF COURSE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Responses that enthusiastically confirm agreement</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Words that mark something as off-limits or prohibited</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Different ways to score on the court</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word begins with a command meaning “get lost!”</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 17.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-17-890">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 17 (#890)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– ABSOLUTELY, OF COURSE, OKEY-DOKE, SURE THING</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – OFF-LIMITS, PROSCRIBED, TABOO, VERBOTEN</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – ALLEY-OOP, FADEAWAY, FINGER ROLL, SLAM DUNK</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – GO-GETTER, LEAVENING, SCATTERGORIES, SHOO-IN</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve played ARC Raiders, you’ve heard about (or seen, or fought…) the Queen. She’s a terrifying enemy with a hulking construct, an immense attack set, and an enormous health pool. Before the Matriarch arrived, she was the game’s apex predator and an aspirational target for talented players worldwide.</p>



<p>In a recent clip uploaded to social media, the Queen was flipped on her head and taken down in the most hilarious, unscripted way by her own kin, a lone Probe looking to ascend to the stars.</p>







<h2 id="h-queen-faces-brilliant-and-unscripted-takedown">Queen Faces Brilliant and Unscripted Takedown</h2>



<p>In a clip uploaded to social media by cHipChrome and shared by numerous users, we see a Queen thrown high into the air, flipped onto her belly, and sent crashing back down to Earth because she happened to wander over a Probe that was taking off at that moment.</p>



<p>The Probe, which must have one hell of a jet engine, took the Queen on a partial ascension to the skies, lifting her and bringing her back down again in the most undignified way for an ARC of her stature.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The player who captured the clip could do nothing but stare in awe at the event, which is a perfect representation of how unscripted and unpredictable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/arc-raiders-loaded-pc/">ARC Raiders</a> really is.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders has been on the market for almost three weeks, and just yesterday, it managed to hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-all-time-high/">new all-time high</a> peak player count on Steam, securing another lofty height even amid the launches of Black Ops 7 and Escape from Tarkov.</p>







<p>It’s proving to be one of the most genre-disrupting games ever, shattering expectations and standing firm as one of 2025’s most impactful smash hits.</p>



<p>Have you played ARC Raiders yet? Let me know what you’re thinking about it on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

Not only is the 1,414-piece half-skeleton, half-banana on sale for its lowest price yet, but Lego is retiring this set soon. Peely Bone has largely held its MSRP since launching more than a year ago, so it's nice that Fortnite fans have the opportunity to grab it for less before it's no longer sold at major retailers. Amazon notes this limited-time deal is "selling fast."</p><p>Peely Bone is one of two Lego Fortnite sets from last October's launch lineup that will no longer be produced going forward. The 193-piece Durrr Burger is the other soon-to-be retired Lego Fortnite set. Amazon is all out of Durrr Burgers, but you can still snag one for only $9.40 (was $15) at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Lego+Fortnite+Peely+Bone+Discounted+To+Best+Price+Ever%2C+Retiring+Soon&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-11-16+19%3A39%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-16+19%3A39%3A11&amp;fnarticle_id=6536261&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-Fortnite-tbd-77070%2F6922971258%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-fortnite-peely-bone-discounted-to-best-price-ever-retiring-soon%2F1100-6536261%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a> or $9.49 at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Lego+Fortnite+Peely+Bone+Discounted+To+Best+Price+Ever%2C+Retiring+Soon&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-11-16+19%3A39%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-16+19%3A39%3A11&amp;fnarticle_id=6536261&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-fortnite-durrr-burger-toy-for-gamers-77070%2F-%2FA-92538478&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-fortnite-peely-bone-discounted-to-best-price-ever-retiring-soon%2F1100-6536261%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target</a>.</p><div title="[Lego] Fortnite Peely Bone Lego Set Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5012" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Lego] Fortnite Peely Bone Lego Set Deal" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible\/dp\/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Lego Fortnite: Peely Bone (1,414 Pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible\/dp\/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$80 (was $100)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Peely Bone is the largest Lego Fortnite model from last fall's launch lineup, and it was only recently surpassed by Mecha Team Leader.

A Lego Fortnite nameplate attaches to the front of the stand. Along with the figure and stand, you'll piece together impressively detailed replicas of the Peely Pick Pickaxe and Paint Launcher weapons as well as a detachable Banana Bag Back Bling. You can move Peely's arms and wrists to create different poses.</p><p>Outside of Mecha Team Leader--the only other black-box Fortnite set--the 1,414-piece Peely Bone model has the most complex build process. The half-skeleton, half-banana frame makes each side of the build a unique and rewarding process. It's one of the most interesting Lego figures/statues I've built over the past few years. Plus, the finished model looks fantastic. The newer Mecha Team Leader model is a fun and challenging project, but I still think Peely Bone is the best Lego Fortnite model yet. And one of the best licensed video game builds, period.</p><p>If you register Peely Bone or one of the other original four Fortnite sets to your Lego account, you will receive a code to unlock the Operation Brite Starter Pack in the video game.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blast-r6-munich-major-champions-m80/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/m80-crowned-champions-at-blast-r6-munich-major-2025.1355278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The BLAST R6 Munich Major concluded in dramatic fashion in Germany, with M80 devastating Team Falcons with a 3-1 finish during the Grand Final. The victory secured M80 a massive $250,000 cut of the prize pool <strong>and </strong>direct qualification for next year’s Six Invitational tournament, the biggest event in Rainbow Six esports.</p>



<p>M80 commanded control of the final fixture, with Team Falcons firing back on just one map, and even that was a close finish that went down to the final round as a decider.</p>



<h2 id="h-m80-secures-top-spot-in-munich">M80 Secures Top Spot in Munich</h2>



<p>This is a monumental moment for North America as M80 stands up and collects a Major trophy in the Rainbow Six Siege esports scene. Team Falcons put up one hell of a fight and had a stellar run, but M80 proved to be the rock that broke open the hull of Falcons.</p>



<p>M80 has ticked a major box and qualified for the Six Invitational, which is the most important event in the Rainbow Six space. The Six Invitational will be held in Paris, France, and it will feature a multi-million-dollar prize pool.</p>



<p>This is now an even more insane record for M80’s Fabian ‘<strong>Fabian</strong>‘ Hällsten, a 31-year-old competitor-turned-coach who has achieved a stunning number of accolades in his many years in the Rainbow Six space:</p>



<ul>
<li>Six Invitational 2018</li>



<li>Six Invitational 2019</li>



<li>Six Invitational 2023</li>



<li>Dreamhack Winter 2018</li>



<li>Pro League Year 2 Season 1</li>



<li>Pro League Year 2 Season 2</li>



<li>Six Major Paris 2018</li>



<li>South Korean League 2024</li>



<li>North American League 2025</li>



<li><strong>Munich Major 2025</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>In 2023, Fabian also coached G2 Esports to success at the Six Invitational, but in 2025, a drastically poor finish left the veteran so far down the leaderboard, he might as well have not bothered attending the tournament.</p>



<p>Will 2026 bring about a redemption tale for Fabian? It also has the potential for M80 to give it a solid run and end up higher than ever before, a seventh-place finish.</p>



<p>I had the pleasure of attending the BLAST R6 Manchester Major in 2024, when the M80 crew, then playing under the beastcoast banner, beat BTS in a dramatic grand final that blew the roof off the venue. This event told a similar story.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-max-alternative-these-bose-ultra-headphones-reach-new-all-time-low-on-amazon-2000644687</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/airpods-max-alternative-these-bose-ultra-headphones-reach-new-all-time-low-on-amazon.1355248/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It typically takes over $500 to get flagship features from premium noise-canceling headphones and Apple’s AirPods Max sit at $549 with no discounts in sight. For way less money, Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones deliver comparable spatial audio, adaptive noise cancellation, and 24-hour battery life. The good news is that they <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/">just dropped to $298 on Amazon right now, down from the usual $429</a>. That’s a new all-time low and nearly half the price of AirPods Max which make these the obvious choice if you want premium features without the Apple tax.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Spatial Audio That Works</h2>
<p>The QuietComfort Ultra uses Bose’s I<strong>mmersive Audio technology to create spatial sound</strong> that feels like it’s coming from around you instead of directly into your ears. That works across any audio source, from streaming music to podcasts to movies, and doesn’t require special encoding like some competing spatial audio systems. CustomTune technology analyzes your ear shape and automatically adjusts the sound profile, so you get audio tuned specifically to how your ears receive sound.</p>
<p><strong>Three listening modes</strong> let you determine exactly how much of the outside world you want to hear. Quiet Mode gives you full active noise cancellation, shutting out ambient sound almost entirely for your next flight or a moment of focus in a noisy space. Aware Mode pipes in the outside audio so that you can hear flight announcements or converse with people without removing the headphones. Immersion Mode blends noise cancellation with spatial audio for the most immersive way of listening-although it eats more battery than the other modes do.</p>



<p>The microphone system focuses on your voice while filtering background noise and creates phone calls clearer than ever on any Bose headphones. Multiple mics work in concert to isolate your voice from wind, traffic, or crowded spaces, and people on the other end hear you without the competing noise drowning you out. It matters far more than it sounds like it would, since most pairs of headphones focus on music playback and treat call quality as an afterthought.</p>



<p>Comfort design employs soft ear cushions that seal around your ears without creating pressure points, and weight distribution on the headband falls evenly across the top of your head. You can wear these for hours without that hot, squeezed feeling some over-ear headphones create. Materials feel premium but not fragile, with metal reinforcements in stress points and cushions that keep their shape over time.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery life reaches 24 hours with standard listening or 18 hours with Immersive Audio mode active</strong>. That is good for several days of commuting or a number of long flights before you need to recharge. A 15-minute quick charge adds 2.5 hours of listening time, meaning even if you forget to charge them overnight, a quick top-up while you’re getting ready in the morning should give you enough juice for the day. The <strong>USB-C charging port</strong> uses the same cable that most modern devices use, so you won’t need any Bose-specific chargers when traveling.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth 5.3 provides stable connections up to 30 feet</strong> from your device with lower latency than older Bluetooth versions. You can walk around your house or office without your phone in your pocket, and the connection stays solid without dropouts or stuttering. <em>SimpleSync</em> lets you pair these headphones with Bose smart soundbars to watch TV at your own volume, not blasting sound through speakers and annoying roommates or family.</p>
<p>The <strong>foldable design collapses into a travel case that’s included in the box</strong>, and protects the headphones during transport without adding too much bulk to your bag. It holds the headphones securely in, with a pocket for the charging cable to keep everything organized rather than loose cables tangling with other gear. The hinges feel solid, not wobbly or creaky, which is important since these are the parts most likely to break on foldable headphones.</p>
<p>For $298, you’re getting flagship-level noise cancellation, spatial audio, premium build quality, and 24-hour battery life for roughly half of what Apple asks for similar features.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-all-time-high/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-just-hit-another-all-time-high-even-as-black-ops-7-and-tarkov-launch.1355245/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders, the exhilarating extraction shooter from Embark Studios, is still going from strength to strength. Today, the title hit a new all-time high player count on Steam, pushing ever higher and continuing to hold a solid bar for the genre. As time goes on, ARC Raiders is only getting stronger, even with the arrival of Black Ops 7 <strong>and </strong>Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Not only that, but ARC Raiders maintains a phenomenal track record in terms of user ratings, boasting a score of 88% on Steam from more than 100,000 reviews.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-won-t-slow-down">ARC Raiders Won’t Slow Down</h2>



<p>There’s no stopping ARC Raiders. It was thought that the 1.0 launch of Escape from Tarkov might halt ARC Raiders where it stands, but even that wasn’t enough to pull hundreds of thousands of players out of Embark’s all-new extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the game recorded a peak player count of 481,966 users, a new high and a stunning figure for any extraction shooter. By numbers, ARC Raiders is the most popular and successful extraction shooter ever made, and it’s <strong>dominating </strong>the genre.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As this article was written, ARC Raiders was the third-most popular game on Steam, beaten only by Valve’s titans, Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2. It has topped Call of Duty, Battlefield 6, Marvel Rivals, PUBG, and Where Winds Meet this weekend with ease. </p>







<p>There’s plenty in the pipeline for ARC Raiders. Embark Studios has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-2025-roadmap/">promised a hefty roadmap</a> for the title, which already covers November and December. Next month, we’ll get the Cold Snap update, which brings new map conditions, a new legendary weapon, a fresh Raider Deck, and <strong>much more</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>I spent the better part of<a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-luke-plunkett-leave-too-damn-long-goodbye-rip-1850630211?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>ten years covering board games at Kotaku</u></a>, even if it had never been a lifelong passion; I didn't really get into it until my 30s!</p><p>Beginning with accessible, licensed stuff that some friends had started picking up around 2010--like <em>Wings of War</em>, <em>X-Wing </em>and <em>Game of Thrones--</em>throughout the rest of that decade board games became everything to me. I played review copies for work, covered the industry at the same time, then I played them at home with my family and at <em>other </em>homes with my friends.<a href="https://stonehandgames.com/the-great-air-race/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>I even spent five years working on my own game</u></a>, which came heartbreakingly close to major international publishing deals at least <em>three </em>times before sadly going nowhere.</p><figure><figcaption><span>That's me and my buddy Sam demoing our game, 'The Great Air Race', at PAX AU in 2019</span></figcaption></figure><p>For ten years I couldn't go a week without talking about a board game, at home or at work. Then along came 2020. The pandemic made life hard for everyone,<a href="https://kotaku.com/board-games-are-having-a-bad-time-1842653367?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>but it made things <em>especially </em>hard for board games, throwing the manufacturing and shipping of their big boxes and plastic parts into turmoil</u></a>. The industry is still reeling five years later, as tariffs and uncertainty over international postage continue to make things tough for publishers and creators alike.</p><p>At a personal level, Covid's impact on board games ended up deeply affecting me as well. An explosion in the cost of making and shipping games not only sent many companies bust, but left those remaining extremely reluctant to ship review copies all the way to Australia. Throw in price increases from an inflationary crisis that made <em>buying </em>games difficult, and a loss of most of my industry contacts when I left Kotaku, and over the course of 2020 I went from someone who played a ton of board games to someone who was playing almost none.</p><p>Which, whatever, if I lose some free board games waaahhh, boohoo, but it helped change me from someone who had been playing a lot of board games with a crew--made up mostly of old friends I'd played football with in the 2000s--to someone who was now never playing them and rarely seeing them. No more nights at home poking at a game for review, no more afternoons at a friend's house with their latest ill-advised Kickstarter purchase. Even our ritual weekends away, which we'd tried to have at least once a year, were gone, a victim of not just everything above but an insane price increase on holiday accommodation in Australia; a house we booked for $450 for a whole weekend in 2019 was, by 2023, charging $1400 for the same weekend.</p><p>Joni Mitchell nailed it with 'You don't know what you've got til it's gone', because I'd taken that decade of good times for granted, and now that they were gone there was basically a big hole in my heart, one that's sat gaping and maw-like as I've spent nearly every waking moment since 2023 either working here or at the other jobs I have to do because all of them combined still don't pay what my old job did. Don't get me wrong,<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-relaunch-announcement/"> <u>I'm immensely proud of everything we've built here</u></a>, but also, all work and no play has taken its toll.</p><p>Luckily (?), I wasn't alone in feeling this. If I wasn't seeing the boys, the other boys weren't seeing the boys either, and so in an effort to try to fill the hole that been in <em>all </em>our hearts, two weeks ago one of us booked some accommodation and the five of us headed off to the beautiful Lake Crackenback in the Snowy Mountains for four days of nothing but board games. Well, board games and some drinking. And let me tell you, it was life-changing.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Panoramic views of snow-capped mountains sure beats playing on my kitchen table, that's for sure</span></figcaption></figure><p>We fucking <em>crushed </em>the brief. I played 15 different games over those four days, nearly all of them new (or at least new to me), and in spending that much time over a table with old friends, laughing and plotting and laughing some more, it reminded me of just how special board games can be, how they're able to do things that go beyond just running through some rules and moving some pieces around.</p><p>I played an entire campaign of <em>Forgotten Waters</em>, which is basically a pirate RPG with enough guardrails that five grown men who had maybe had a few too many drinks could play without rolling dice or arguing about rules. We won after <em>seven hours </em>of play by driving a trident through a witch's heart, but not before one of us had been beaten unconscious and had his pants stolen by dolphins. I played <em>Return To Dark Tower</em>, which also had a story (driven by an iPad), but whose details I never bothered with because it also has a giant mechanised tower looming over the middle of the board that <em>shoots miniature skulls at people</em>.</p><p>I played <em>Indiana Jones: Sands of Adventure</em>, a family board game with a card-battling feature that feels weirdly like an actual Indiana Jones fight scene. I played <em>No Thanks</em>, a card game where you're spared from doing the worst thing possible because the person taking their turn before you had to do it first. I played <em>Archaeology</em>, where selling artifacts to distant museums is fine, I guess, because the practice has had so many edges sanded off to make it a card game that it's a blast.</p><p>I played <em>The Grizzled</em>, a beautiful card game about how hard it is to keep you and your friends alive during the First World War, which was if nothing else faithful to its theme. I played <em>Game of Thrones</em>, a game I've played so many times<a href="https://kotaku.com/i-am-a-terrible-winner-at-game-of-thrones-1677851052?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>I don't want to write anything more about it</u></a>. I played <em>Raiders of the North Sea</em>, which might be<a href="https://kotaku.com/raiders-of-the-north-sea-the-kotaku-review-1822100886?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the most perfectly-designed board game ever made</u></a>.</p><p>I played <em>Courtisans</em>, a game about intrigue and secrecy that might have the most beautiful cards I have ever held, or will ever hold. I played <em>Lord Of The Rings: The Trick Game</em>, which I hated every second of, but will remember forever because of how beautiful the artists made every hobbit.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Raiders of the North Sea!</span></figcaption></figure><p>And then finally, on the last night, I played <em>Racoon Tycoon</em>, a game about industrialising a land inhabited only by animals, where doing things like sending cute cats with hats off to build railroads is just a normal thing that happens. Between some heated auctions, a vibrant marketplace system and constant five-beers-in deliberations on just <em>why </em>these animals were industrialising, it was one of the funniest nights of board gaming I've had in my life.</p><p>Of course we didn't <em>just </em>play board games; we also went to a distillery and ordered a tray of schnapps that was so big it came out on a modified ski, and the staff rang a giant cowbell when they delivered it to our table. I went for some lovely walks around an alpine lake, and both cooked and ate some great food. It was an A+ time from beginning to end.</p><p>After two years of relentless work with few breaks I <em>really </em>needed it, if nothing else than for the time away from a computer. But the thing that's stuck with me the most since getting home was just how good it was to be playing board games again. There's just something about sharing a table with friends, talking about the game but also everything else, that I struggle to fit into my life elsewhere.</p><p>Where else can you backstab one of your best friends and have everyone laugh about it, or feel your phone buzz under the table to read a text message from someone <em>else </em>across the table, telling you to murder someone <em>else </em>at the table? There's an accessible pleasure to being able to just sit down and play a game at the same time as someone is explaining the rules to you as you go, and there's something wonderful about the tactile experience of holding some glossy cards, moving some beautiful miniatures across a table just to annoy someone sitting next to you or...having a huge plastic tower shoot skulls at you.</p><p>Man, how I missed all this! And yes, this is now the point where I acknowledge that most of the things that contributed to my board gaming drought are still very much around; they're still expensive, accommodation is still unaffordable, I'm still working 2.5 jobs, seven days a week,<a href="https://triton-noir.com/pages/the-triton-noir-adventure-is-over?srsltid=AfmBOop3eIY1lZDGRH9A00ywqJrJfMYc0Fd_W27aCN--KZ8ybMWm1cu8&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>and one of my favourite board game studios shut down only a few weeks ago</u></a>, citing the same pressures that have been stalking the industry since 2020. I didn't spend four days in the mountains then come home to find everything magically better again.</p><p>But I did get to spend those four days in the mountains. And, however briefly, got to remember that board games fucking <em>rule</em>.</p><figure><div></div></figure>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-484-piece-lego-brick-box-is-nearly-free-amazon-slashes-50-off-this-creativity-essential-2000644683</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-484-piece-lego-brick-box-is-nearly-free-amazon-slashes-50-off-this-creativity-essential.1355233/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO sets that use specific instructions look great on shelves but they don’t teach kids how to build from imagination. A classic brick box gives them raw materials and lets them figure out what to make instead of just following steps to recreate someone else’s design. This medium brick box includes 484 pieces in 35 different colors with wheels, windows, eyes, and a green baseplate for building whatever comes to mind. It <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4299/">drops to just $17 on Amazon, down from the usual $34</a>. That’s an <strong>all-time low for a set this size with this much variety,</strong> and it’s the kind of price that makes stocking up for birthdays or holidays affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4299/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great for Creativity</h2>
<p>The 484-piece count gives kids enough bricks to<strong> create multiple creations at once</strong> instead of constantly tearing things apart to make something new. You get 35 different colors, which sounds excessive until you realize that having color variety lets kids create more realistic builds where different parts of a structure actually look distinct. The included 18 tires with wheel rims mean vehicles become an obvious building option and the windows plus toy eyes add character to buildings and creatures.</p>
<p>The green baseplate measures <strong>over three inches long and six inches wide</strong>, and provides a stable foundation for constructions that would otherwise topple over on a table. Baseplates matter more than most people realize, since they let kids build upward without having to worry about stability, and the green color works for grass, fields, parks, or any outdoor scene. If you grab more than one set, you can stick multiple baseplates together, creating larger building surfaces for ambitious projects.</p>



<p>Cross-compatibility with all LEGO construction sets means <strong>these bricks work with any other LEGO pieces you already own</strong>. Kids can mix this classic collection with themed sets like City, Friends, or Creator to expand their options without worrying about pieces not fitting together. This is across decades of LEGO production, so even vintage bricks from the 80s or 90s snap together perfectly with these new pieces.</p>



<p>The<strong> large plastic storage container serves as organization when play is over</strong>, keeping bricks contained instead of scattered across the floor, just waiting to ambush bare feet. There’s a handle for easy transport, which is conducive to kids taking their LEGO collection to friends’ houses or on trips without dumping loose bricks into a backpack. Of course, proper storage extends the life of the set, as pieces stay together and don’t get lost in couch cushions or vacuumed up by accident.</p>
<p>The builds, such as trains, cars, and tiger figures, will inspire kids when they don’t know what to do or need ideas. You can find simple building ideas in the included instructions or online, but the whole point is adapting those ideas into original creations. A basic train design becomes a starting point for adding cargo cars, passenger sections, or fantasy elements like wings or laser cannons. The tiger figure teaches how to use specific pieces for eyes and features, then kids apply that knowledge to building their own animals or creatures.</p>
<p><strong>The age range is from 4 to 99</strong> which reflects both young kids just learning to build and adults who still enjoy creative construction. Younger children focus on simpler builds and color sorting, whereas older kids create complex structures with moving parts or detailed scenes. Adults use them for desk decorations, stress relief, or collaborative building sessions with their kids.</p>
<p>At $17 for 484 pieces with specialty elements like wheels, windows, and a baseplate, <strong>you’re paying about 3.5 cents per brick</strong>. That’s exceptional value for real LEGO, particularly given that themed sets often ring in at 10 to 15 cents per piece.</p>

                <p>Ahead of Red Dead Redemption's Nintendo Switch 2 update next month, Amazon is offering a discount on the recently rereleased physical edition for Switch. Rockstar Games distributed a new budget-friendly $30 edition in September, and now you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPRNCXKB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">grab a copy of Red Dead Redemption for $25</a> during <a href="https://amzn.to/4nUYU6z" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon's early Black Friday video game sale</a>. </p><p>Red Dead Redemption's physical edition for Switch includes the full game and Undead Nightmare expansion on the cartridge.

The digital version still retails for $50, so you can save 50% by picking up the physical edition instead. Amazon's early <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday sale</a> also includes the Switch port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-nintendo-switch-amazon-game-deal-black-friday-2025/1100-6533883/" data-ref-id="1100-6533883">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</a> for $20 (was $30).</p><div title="6534660 - Red Dead Redemption and GTA Trilogy for Switch" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4321" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534660 - Red Dead Redemption and GTA Trilogy for Switch" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPRNCXKB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FPRNCXKB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPRNCXKB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Red Dead Redemption for Nintendo Switch</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPRNCXKB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FPRNCXKB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPRNCXKB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$25 (was $30)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Red Dead Redemption's Switch 2 update will offer 60fps as well as enhanced visuals with HDR and DLSS. Switch 2 players will also be able to play Red Dead Redemption with Joy-Con 2 mouse controls.</p><p>If you're buying RDR to play on the original Switch, you should know it's still a pretty impressive port from a technical perspective. It runs at a stable 30fps in handheld and docked modes with 720p and 1080p resolution, respectively.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption is a spaghetti western that nails the mythic appeal of being a cowboy. The game doesn't stray far from the open-world template that Rockstar perfected with its previous GTA releases. You have the freedom to explore, cause trouble, and complete quests provided by the large cast of memorable characters.</p><p>John Marston's journey across the sprawling expanses of the American Wild West and Mexico to bury his blood-stained past and protect his family is a memorable one.</p><p>Along with the base game, this edition of RDR comes with Undead Nightmare, a horror-themed adventure in which the world around you has been transformed into an apocalyptic landscape overrun with zombies. Undead Nightmare was originally released as a standalone expansion, but these days it's bundled with the base game on modern platforms.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Theft-Auto-Trilogy-Definitive-Nintendo/dp/B0FK6N3H12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Grand-Theft-Auto-Trilogy-Definitive-Nintendo\/dp\/B0FK6N3H12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Theft-Auto-Trilogy-Definitive-Nintendo/dp/B0FK6N3H12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy for Nintendo Switch</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Theft-Auto-Trilogy-Definitive-Nintendo/dp/B0FK6N3H12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Grand-Theft-Auto-Trilogy-Definitive-Nintendo\/dp\/B0FK6N3H12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Theft-Auto-Trilogy-Definitive-Nintendo/dp/B0FK6N3H12?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$20 (was $30)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you also want to explore the city streets of the modern age, check out Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition for only $20 (was $30).

The Definitive Edition launched in rough shape, but all three games are much better these days thanks to multiple patches and a significant overhaul last fall.</p><p>When you pop in the game card for the first time, you will be prompted to download roughly GTA: Vice City from the eShop (roughly 9GB). San Andreas and GTA III are stored on the card. The digital version of the trilogy from the eShop, for reference, is 25.4GB.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><h3>Nintendo Switch 1/2 Early Black Friday Deals at Amazon</h3><p>Along with deals on the pair of Rockstar Games titles, Amazon has deals on a bunch of other Switch and Switch 2 games.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has had a bumpy start, accruing an 'Overwhelming Dislike' verdict on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Metacritic</a> on its opening weekend, making it the most unpopular Call of Duty game ever by Metacritic user score.</p>
<p>Whilst critic reviews have contributed to an aggregated score of 84 on PC (there aren't yet enough critic scores to give a verdict on console), hundreds of users have given the shooter the dubious honour of being the franchise's most disliked instalment with an aggregate score of just 1.7 at the time of writing. A whopping 85 percent of users have left a negative review.</p>
<p>It's also currently sitting on a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/#app_reviews_hash">'Mixed' user score</a> on Steam, with just 42 percent of player reviews leaving a positive thumbs-up.</p>

<p>Steam only represents one segment of the game's PC audience, of course, and doesn't take account of users playing through the Xbox PC app, let alone those on console. Nonetheless, complaints are varied, ranging from accusations that the "<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/user/armbarvictim1/">franchise has lost its way</a>", "<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/user/DarkStrikeX/">strays far from Call of Duty's identity</a>", and uses "<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/?platform=pc">ai slop</a>", while others call it "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993890407/recommended/3606480/">out of touch</a>", "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199636448645/recommended/3606480/">disappointing</a>", and "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/september_cs/recommended/3606480/">another under-baked title delivered on false promises and blatant lies</a>".</p><p>While not all reviews are bad - there are <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/?platform=pc&amp;filter=Positive%20Reviews">several</a> 10/10s posted to Metacritic - most complain that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-campaign-cannot-be-paused-by-solo-players-has-no-checkpoints-and-requires-an-online-connection-at-all-times">campaign mode cannot be paused</a> or <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/aniketvcool/recommended/3606480/">saved manually</a>, and<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards"> criticise the publisher for in-game calling cards allegedly created using generative AI,</a> all of which came to light when the game debuted on 14th November.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> wasn't perfect but it felt like COD was back again," <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/user/Stihl24/">explained</a> one player. "Zombies were great, the campaign was okay and the multiplayer felt like it used to. For the first time in 10 years, my [sic] believed that Call of Duty was on the right track again. That is until, they announced Black Ops 7.</p>
<p>"Every. Single. Thing. That the community has been super vocal about hating, they decided to bring to Black Ops 7. Everything that we said we loved about Black Ops 6 and OG Call of Duty, they took away. Now all that's left is a steaming pile of dog crap [where] a once great first person shooter empire lived. I hope this is a wake-up call, and the company decides to revert 100% back to the way that Call of Duty is supposed to be. This is what happens when you continue to put profit over passion."</p>
<p>Though Activision has properly declared AI was used during the development of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/">its Steam page</a>, complaints about AI are particularly evident. As Connor explained for us earlier in the week, calling cards belonging to the 'Jack of All Trades' campaign challenges, as well as two specific calling cards in the 'Embrace the Nightmare' campaign endgame challenges, raised eyebrows as players noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards">similarities to the AI Studio Ghibli recreations</a> which have been circulating online for the past few months.</p><p>"If you can accept Black Ops 7's fundamental changes to the formula on their own terms, you'll have a good trip, despite the psychochemicals coursing through your veins," we said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 review</a>, awarding it 3/5 stars. "I'm just not convinced those changes bode well for the health of the series."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-%E2%80%98series-low%E2%80%99-metacritic-user-rating.1355170/</guid>

<p>While it does have an 84 critic score on Metacritic, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is not faring well with its user rating. The reviews, while not all serious, do touch on several notes like the reported usage of AI and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-reddit-reactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a disappointing campaign</a>.</p>







<p>Black Ops 7,&nbsp;which released last week, hasn’t had the best launch. While praise is there to the multiplayer and zombies, the game is in some hot water. First off, fans called out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-accused-of-using-generative-ai-art-for-black-ops-7-calling-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the usage of AI</a> for player calling cards and assets, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision has responded to</a>. Second, the campaign, fully co-op, has gotten a lot of flak for being absurd and far from the supposed series standard. With this, it’s not surprising that the game is not faring well with users on Metacritic, which is a series low.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/?platform=pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a>, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 currently has an 84 critic score with 16 reviews. However, the user rating, which has more than 540 reviews, is not as great. As of writing, its score is 1.6 out of 10. 2023’s Modern Warfare 3, which is one of the lowest-scoring Call of Dutys with a 56 critic score, still has a higher user rating with a 2.3.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that this number is likely to change as some reviews may be spam and as more longtime players get to it. Still, it’s not a great look for the franchise. Unfortunately, it looks like the damage has already been done, as Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t even reached 100k players</a> on Steam, while competitors like Battlefield and ARC Raiders consistently get over 200k. Whether Activision and the teams will address some of the problems is unknown. Hopefully, the next games will do a better job of satisfying fans and critics.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Partner Showcase Announcement Soon, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-partner-showcase-announcement-claim-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-partner-showcase-announcement-soon-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1355161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a credible source, an Xbox Partner Showcase announcement is coming soon. A presentation was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reportedly-has-a-partner-preview-event-scheduled-for-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored a while ago</a> to happen in November, but it seems it may actually be true.</p>







<p>Also known as Xbox Partner Preview, the events are short but substantial presentations on games going to Xbox consoles. However, compared to Game Showcases, they consist of third-party titles from various companies. For example, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-partner-preview-october-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last one</a>, which premiered in October 2024 had games like Cronos: The New Dawn, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and FBC: Firebreak. Last month, it was reported that Microsoft and Xbox were planning a new showcase, though details were thin. Now, it seems a prominent leaker has added some fuel to the fire.</p>



<h2 id="h-announcement-coming-very-soon-for-xbox-partner-showcase-claims-natethehate2">Announcement Coming ‘Very Soon’ for Xbox Partner Showcase, Claims NateTheHate2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The claim comes from notable leaker <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1989885666679718304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NateTheHate2</a>, whose track record has been quite good. From multiple <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-direct-will-take-place-in-september-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Directs</a> to full games, the leaker does have a solid track record. Nevertheless, in response to a question regarding a future Partner Showcase, NateTheHate2 said that an announcement is coming ‘very soon’. As for when exactly that may be, we still don’t know. </p>



<p>The most likely date is early this week, as one of the games supposedly there, Silent Hill 2 Remake, is releasing this week, and no official announcement of the game’s port has been revealed yet. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-store-leaks-silent-hill-2-xbox-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An Xbox Store listing</a> for the PS5 title popped up earlier this month with a release date of November 21st, 2025. If true, we could get an announcement tomorrow with a Wednesday date or Tuesday with a Thursday date. Either way, it seems all signs are pointing to a Partner Showcase sooner rather than later.</p>

            <p>The producer of the next highly-anticipated instalment of Resident Evil, Resident Evil Requiem, has teased that the upcoming horror retains "some" elements of its prior life as an online multiplayer open-world game, but wouldn't tell us what, exactly, they are.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/11/15/resident-evil-requiem-interview-putting-the-horror-in-survival-horror/">Press Start Australia</a>, producer Masato Kumazawa said that Requiem - initially conceived as an open-world, multiplayer game - was reinvented when the team decided fans of the franchise "wouldn't enjoy it" given the horror aspects were "very mild".</p>

<p>Questioned about this, however, Kumazawa would only say "there are some remaining elements, but we can't disclose what it is and how it is," and laughed when pressed harder for more details.</p>
<p>"Looking at the game when it was multiplayer, the horror part was very mild," he said. "However, in that build, we made a game that was fun to play. But we looked deeply into this game and wondered if a fan of the franchise would really like this, so we thought they [...] probably wouldn't enjoy it as much.</p>
<p>"That's the reason we made it back into single-player. But because it was fun, we added elements from that build to the final game to ensure it was fun."</p>
<p>Asked what, in his opinion, Resident Evil fans wanted from a new title, the producer added: "I believe fans of the franchise want [...] survival horror and being scared. That is the number one thing that fans want. So by saying that, we can't just slap on new skins and new characters and give you the same experience. It wouldn't be that good.</p>
<p>"That's why we wanted to make sure we added new elements that ensured this feels like a new survival horror game."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Kumazawa also revealed that Requiem was "in development way before Village", which is why the team is keen to ensure the game "focus[es] on the horror" and avoids becoming too combat-heavy.</p>
<p>Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-requiems-director-explains-how-in-one-crucial-way-it-is-the-most-extreme-title-in-the-series-yet">sat down with game director Koshi Nakanishi at Gamescom to talk about pacing</a>, where he explained that he would be taking the "same" approach" with Requiem as Resident Evil 7, which Nakanishi also directed.</p>
<p>Capcom also recently said it was looking to the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-wants-resident-evil-requiem-boss-battles-to-test-your-wits-rather-than-your-shooting-skill">for ideas about how to challenge players with boss battles in Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is set to release on 27th February, 2026.</p>

<figure><a title="Blippo+ Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160551/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to really understand (or remember) what TV looked like before the internet, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+</a> is just the ticket.</p>
<p>This unique little time capsule launched on Panic's Playdate in May and landed on Switch and PC in September. Now in full colour, this remarkable collaboration between the band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht_(band)">Yacht</a>, <a href="https://telefantasystudios.com/">Telefantasy Studios</a>, developer Noble Robot, and Panic itself teleports you back to a time when television was an appointment pastime and we viewed the world in fuzzy 4:3.</p>
<p>First off, Blippo+ is not a game, so if 'play' is the only verb that excites you, go ahead and hit that Back button or close the browser tab right now. 'Watch' is the, ahem, watchword here, and apt for a TV network sim and FMV experience like no other.</p>
<p>Serving up clips from a collection of fictional shows encompassing public, cable, and even pirate broadcasts on a distant Earth-like planet, it captures an alternate '90s buzzing with the static produced when older entertainment ideas and formats rub against an emerging youth movement looking to expand the horizons of art and tech with TV as their tool.</p>
<p>By the looks of its culture captured on screen, Planet Blip is all big colours and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/space_channel_5">Space Channel 5</a>-style energy, and instantly recognisable to any Earthlings born in the decades straddling 1985. Picture Bob Ross settling in at the Double R Diner while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etviGf1uWlg">Groove Is In The Heart</a> plays on repeat, and you're not far off the vibe.</p>
<p>You can cycle between channels at will, each one playing a series of minute-long clips that eventually loop around until a new 'packette' becomes available and you tune in a new batch. Along with packette notifications, messages from Blippo+ exec Lisa Duo periodically arrive, and interference from a nearby space anomaly means you'll occasionally have to manually recalibrate the signal. I played mainly with a Pro Controller, but you can snap off a single Joy-Con if you prefer remote-like control. You also have options to reduce background menu animation, and increase, reduce, or remove static effects entirely.</p>
<figure><a title="Blippo+ Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160169/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It would be easy to fill my word count here just listing references. Despite being 100% fictional, the array of programmes nails the feeling of switching on the telly and channel-hopping three-and-a-half decades ago. Werf’s Tavern blends the hokey energy of <strong>Star Trek</strong>, <strong>Dr Who</strong>, and '70s sci-fi with a dash of <strong>Cheers</strong>; Countertop's chatty 50s-styled waitress is equal parts Norma Jennings and Marge Simpson; trivia show Quizzards works in aspects of <strong>Crystal Maze</strong> and <strong>D&amp;D</strong>; the Boredome studio is filled with 'tude-laden teens lounging around, discussing topical youth issues, and generally shooting the blip.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, you've got talk shows, cooking clips, kids' claymation, antiques analysis, soaps, news reports, psychic weather forecasts, and a Teletext-style Femtofax app with Personal ads, review columns, and assorted hot takes and message-board wisdom. There's loads more besides, and the verisimilitude of the audio-visual experience is astonishing.</p>
<p>Among all the flotsam and jetsam in this channel surf, it's hard to think of anything missing from the Electronic Program Guide. Something with a puppet, perhaps? There's no live sports coverage. Were a clip evoking the Italia ’90 qualifiers, the Malaysian Grand Prix, or something more sedate — darts or snooker — to pop up, you’d swear you were sitting on a worryingly flammable family sofa back in 1990. But short of dropping in clips from <strong>The Simpsons</strong>, they've just about covered it all.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/accessibility-report/5859/embed @ 1763363941 -->
<p>Stylistic conventions from earlier eras bleed into the following decade(s), and that's the case with several shows; the brilliantly choreographed music videos, in particular, feel like authentic holdovers from early '80s <strong>Top of the Pops</strong>, with soft focus and light bloom aplenty. After seeing so many disappointing CRT filters in retro-themed games over the years, the accuracy of the signal warping, static, and distortion of an analogue broadcast here is enormously impressive.</p>
<p>That attention to detail extends to every part of the production: the calibration UI that pops up when your signal’s wonked; the early greenscreen compositing with prominent ghosting; the <em>spot-on</em> music, voice, and sound effect work; the collage-like, mismatching logo design; the editing and the way the minute-long clips automatically switch channels mid-sentence. Hitting 'Y' toggles to a 1-bit-style screen, presumably approximating how the image looks on a Playdate, and ‘X’ activates authentic-looking captions which I kept on most of the time. Every single detail is lovingly crafted and (re)created.</p>

<p>And threading all these disparate elements together is a gently comic narrative involving the discovery of a distant Blip-like planet on the other side of the galaxy. As you watch, topics and even cast members from one show begin appearing on others, with inter-show references woven in, sparking curiosity as you look out for new details and reactions to 'The Bend'.</p>
<p>Building a game around an activity born of boredom comes with risks of being <em>too</em> authentic, but the devs strike a nice balance between seeding narrative details and subtle worldbuilding while maintaining that odd, non-sequitous energy of channel-hopping.</p>
<p>My Switch says I've spent '9 hours or more' with Blippo+ before credits rolled, and only in short bursts towards the end was my attention beginning to drift. I probably didn't need to watch <em>every</em> cycle of <em>every</em> channel — including the ones with poor signals or others scrambled due to their 'adult' nature — but I didn't want to miss anything, such was the pull of those narrative threads.</p>
<figure><a title="Blippo+ Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160506/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Great performances from the sizeable cast keep you engaged, too. Representing all facets of '90s broadcasting involves being not just good, but <em>bad</em> if you want to accurately portray the awkwardness of a soap star's delivery, the unnatural line reading of an inexperienced teen, the overacting of a stage actor on the small screen. But it's all here - studied performances shot through with a dose of off-the-wall, intergalactic energy.</p>
<p>If it's not obvious by now, I love Blippo+, likely because it feels tailor-made for somebody born in 1984. For anyone who <em>hasn't</em> manually retuned a television — people who didn’t grow up before the World Wide Web arrived and everyone fragmented into online groups, who have always viewed the world in 16:9 and don’t know what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceefax">Ceefax</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboozle!">Bamboozle</a> are — I wonder if they’ll have the context to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Your agency is equal to watching TV with a remote in hand (slightly less, given the loopìng nature of the clips) as you exhaust each channel set and Femtofax update until it’s time to download the next packette. I found myself glued to the clips, only poking the analogue stick to shift once the loop was over, but would younger players without my reference points have the patience to stick with it?</p>
<figure><a title="Blippo+ Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160168/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Cleverly executed 'filler' channels here mirror the content supply problem broadcasters encountered back in the day as the number of channels exploded. The loving, lower-budget parodies here help turn a minus into a big (Blippo) plus and add to the impeccable presentation, but naturally, some people just won't 'get it'. It's not my place to worry about that, but it's important to flag in a review, I think. Perhaps necessarily, this entire project feels like an amazing joke that, by virtue of my age alone, I'm lucky to be in on.</p>
<p>I made a real effort to meet Blippo+ on its own terms, too. I treated it like television, switching it on in the morning for 20, 30 minutes while I ate breakfast with my mug of murk. You absolutely need to sit back and enjoy it in short bursts, coming back to the shows, developing a taste for your favourites, and yes, even skipping the ones you're not so keen on.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>For people who grew up watching <strong>Gamesmaster</strong>, early MTV, <strong>Hartbeat</strong>, ‘80s soaps, Bill Nye or Open University programming, and scanning the high channels past midnight for a glimpse of something softcore, Blippo+ is an absolute <del>must-play</del> must-watch. It really is a work of art, nailing the aesthetic of early-'90s TV and uncannily capturing a time and place in the way a song or a smell evokes a memory - in a way that feels almost personal.</p>
<p>You need to treat it like old-school TV, though, surfing a little bit each day and soaking up the static; do <em>not</em> approach it as a game. And as fun as it is — as wonderfully assembled, expertly performed, and lovingly crafted — nostalgia for (or at least intellectual interest in) the era feels like a prerequisite. I’m an ‘80s kid, though, so I adored every second.</p></section>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/821355/asus-falcata-review-hall-effect-switches-split-ergo-gaming-keyboard</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-asus-falcata-is-an-ambitious-split-ergo-gaming-keyboard-that-falls-short.1355086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hall effect gaming keyboards aren’t uncommon. But Asus’ ROG Falcata is the only one that’s also a split ergonomic keyboard, aimed at alleviating wrist, hand, or arm pain. For the luxury of having it all, you’ll pay $419.99, enough to buy a nice Hall effect keyboard <em>and</em> a split ergonomic one.</p><p>It’d be worth it if the Falcata truly represented the best of both worlds, but I’m split. As a Hall effect board, it succeeds, offering a wealth of customization options, including the ability to let you adjust each key’s actuation point by as little as a hundredth of a millimeter at a time. But if you’re buying it for ergonomics, like me, then maybe not. My biggest concern during testing was its limited tenting angles. $420 seems very steep for a keyboard that doesn’t... get very steep.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODIxMzU4"><p><span>$<!-- -->420</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Compact</li><li>Hall effect switches offer deep customization</li><li>Rapid trigger and Speed Tap in a split ergo</li><li>Browser-based customization</li><li>Ultra-fast polling over wire or 2.4GHz</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Tenting isn’t steep enough</li><li>Included USB-C link cables too short</li></ul></div></div></div><p>Tenting is an integral feature of split ergo keyboards. Being able to raise the inner sides of each of the two sections to your liking allows your arms and wrists to rest in a more neutral position than they would on a regular keyboard. The Falcata can only tent up to seven degrees (or six with the wrist rests installed). Some people may only need the slight tenting that the Falcata offers; I’m used to a 15-degree tent on my <a href="https://gaming.kinesis-ergo.com/product/freestyle-edge/">Kinesis Freestyle Edge RGB</a>, while some prefer even higher.</p><p>You may not know what feels right until you use a tented keyboard, but at this price, Asus should have included more tenting options — and longer USB-C link cables, too. The halves can only be separated by a maximum of 10 inches, which doesn’t let me spread my arms as much as I need to feel relief (the Freestyle’s non-detachable cable can go up to 14 inches). Sure, I can use my own longer cable with the Falcata, but at $420, this is an oversight.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</strong><span><figcaption><em>You can actually achieve one degree higher tenting without the wrist rests installed.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>The Falcata’s insufficient tenting aside, it’s everything that my daily driver isn’t. It has the same 75-percent key layout (minus the Freestyle’s left-hand macro key columns), so there was no learning curve. Yet its design is both far more elegant and more compact on my desk. The halves can fit together like a standard keyboard, which is convenient if you need to travel with it. Also, it’s <em>so </em>quiet to type on (to be fair, most switches are quieter than Cherry MX Blues, my point of reference).</p><p>The Falcata is overflowing with gamer-oriented features. It gives you the option to turn on rapid trigger and Speed Tap (Asus’ branded name for simultaneous opposing cardinal directions, or SOCD), controversial features designed to give players the advantage in competitive games. Additionally, it can operate wired or via Bluetooth or 2.4GHz wireless (in wireless mode, its two halves are still linked together via USB-C), with up to an 8,000Hz polling rate available in all modes except Bluetooth.</p><p>The perks of its Hall effect switches, other than being quiet, is that they’re analog, not limited to the binary on/off states of digital sensors. You can customize the distance at which each key registers an input (and a reset), which for gamers can mean lightning-fast commands with almost no physical movement. They’re a bit trickier to use with typing, at least with default settings. I accidentally typed “fffffffffffffffffffffffff” or “jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj” in many text boxes just because my fingers were putting a little too much weight on the home keys. The Falcata offers multiple ways to adjust their sensitivity, and to customize a <em>whole </em>lot more. One route is to use Gear Link, Asus’ browser-based app. In my case, tweaking the dead zones for each key helped to eliminate misfires. You can even adjust these settings via the keyboard’s multipurpose scroll wheel. It’s meant to be faster, and to some it might be, but it felt more cumbersome than just using the web app.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Gear Link is a browser-based tool that lets you easily configure the keyboard to your liking.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>Each of the Falcata’s keys can serve as a macro, if you want. While I’m more accustomed to the dedicated macro keys on my Kinesis, Gear Link makes it a breeze to assign additional functions to any key. In the app, you can assign simple functions to make life easier, like pushing a key also triggering a left mouse click. Since it’s a Hall effect board, there’s also Dynamic Keystroke, which lets you assign up to four unique commands depending on the key’s travel distance. For instance, you can program W (running forward in games) to just send W with a light press, and also trigger Shift and R with a full press, letting you sprint and reload any time you press it all the way. This level of customization is standard for Hall effect gaming keyboards, but this is the first time it’s available in a split ergonomic keyboard.</p><p>Coming back to rapid trigger and Speed Tap: They’re built to help you do things in games that are otherwise not possible, either due to the limitations of reflex speed or keyboard hardware. Rapid trigger, which is off by default and activated by flipping a switch near its multipurpose dial, allows key actuation to reset immediately upon release, even if you haven’t completed a full keystroke motion, readying the sensor to receive another input faster than the physical switches on your opponent’s keyboard might be able to.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>This satisfying toggle enables rapid trigger, which lets switches reset faster than usual.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Speed Tap (also off by default) lets you continue moving when two opposing cardinal directional keys (e.g., A and D) are pressed. For example, pressing A to move left and then pressing D to move right would normally make your character stop until you release one of them (reflecting reality — you can’t walk in two directions at once), but Speed Tap prioritizes your last input, overriding any other key that might still be pressed down. Valve considers the feature to be tantamount to an automatic assist, and therefore <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224261/valve-counter-strike-2-razer-snap-tap-wooting-socd-ban-kick">doesn’t allow its use in <em>Counter-Strike 2</em></a>. Still, it’s cool to have in games where you won’t risk getting banned.</p><p>For the Falcata to make sense, you have to really want both Hall effect <em>and</em> a split ergo keyboard. As an ergonomic board, it’s definitely a “try before you buy”; its limited tenting abilities could be fine, or you may realize right away that it’s not going to cut it. Unfortunately, you may not be able to try it <em>until </em>you buy it, as your local Best Buy may not have a model on display. If you decide to jump through that hoop, make sure you can get a refund if needed.</p><p>If you don’t mind missing out on the advanced features of a Hall effect board, the <a href="https://gaming.kinesis-ergo.com/product/kb975-plus/">Kinesis Freestyle Edge RGB Plus</a> is a great split ergo board that’s less than half the price. It offers hot-swap mechanical switches (it comes with either linear or tactile, but is compatible with thousands of different switch types), and with the Lift Kit that lets it tent at up to 15 degrees. Yes, it’s bulkier and wired only, with louder switches (depending on the ones you get), and it doesn’t have Hall effect switches. But it’s a very good keyboard, and it’s better ergonomically, too.</p><p><em>Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/821355/asus-falcata-review-hall-effect-switches-split-ergo-gaming-keyboard]]></content:encoded>

<p>Black Ops 7 brings back Call of Duty campaign co-op for the first time in a long time. You can experience Treyarch’s newest story offering with other players, but there’s some uncertainty surrounding Black Ops 7 and split-screen multiplayer for the campaign.</p>



<p>You might have heard one or two interesting things about the Black Ops 7 campaign. It’s true that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/you-cant-pause-the-black-ops-7-campaign-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t pause the Black Ops 7 campaign, ever</a>. There is also the odd suggestion of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-skibidi-toilet-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">giant Skibidi Toilet Boss</a>—don’t adjust your glasses or wipe your phone, you read that right.</p>



<p>But let’s see if any of this matters due to a potential lack of local split-screen multiplayer in Black Ops 7.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-7-campaign-split-screen">Is Black Ops 7 Campaign Split-Screen?</h2>

<p><strong>Despite the Black Ops 7 campaign being capable of co-op, this feature is restricted to online only, meaning you can’t play the campaign in local co-op split-screen.</strong></p>



<p>You can enjoy the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 campaign with friends, but you have to do it through online multiplayer. BLOPS 7’s campaign is an online-only experience for the first time, which might prove finicky where local co-op is concerned.</p>



<p>If you want to tackle the story’s main missions and reach the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-skip-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endgame</a>, you’ll either have to do so by yourself or online with other players.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-players-can-play-black-ops-7-campaign">How Many Players Can Play Black Ops 7 Campaign?</h2>



<p><strong>Up to 4 players can team up in Black Ops 7 campaign multiplayer, which is made easier because you all have your own screen to see.</strong></p>



<p>4-player local split-screen is seldom seen in modern gaming. It’s difficult to do, and presumably easier to code and develop with online multiplayer in mind. On the plus side, if you have three friends you want to spill blood, banter, and bullets with, the Black Ops 7 campaign allows you to.</p>



<p>If one or more of you need the game, we recommend you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">use this link to buy Black Ops 7 for cheap!</a></p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-black-ops-7-campaign-co-op">How To Play Black Ops 7 Campaign Co-Op</h2>



<p><strong>You must invite one or more users to your party in Black Ops 7 to play the campaign in online co-op</strong>.</p>



<p>Like you would with a normal Call of Duty party, invite your friends to a private party, and once you have a squad of between 2-4 players, head into the Black Ops 7 campaign.</p>



<p>Whoever is the party leader will determine what you play: It could be main missions, or it could be Avalon!</p>
