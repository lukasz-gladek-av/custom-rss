The shutdown is effective immediately. Meta acquired the studio <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/facebook-buys-ready-at-dawn-lone-echo/">in 2020</a>.</p><p>As for why Meta is shutting down the studio, here’s what <em>Android Central</em> said:</p><div><blockquote><p>One report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4-leaked-release-date">in mid-July</a>&nbsp;said that Meta was cutting its Reality Labs division’s budget by 20% by 2026, and an internal memo sent to Meta employees by Gio Hunt, VP Oculus Studios — seen by Android Central — supports this reasoning. A Meta spokesperson told Android Central that the cuts weren’t being made to “save money,” per se. Rather, these cuts are being made to ensure that Reality Labs stays within the new budgetary constraints and that Oculus Studios can make a “better long-term impact” in VR development.</p></blockquote></div><p>We tried to ask for more details, but Meta spokesperson Alaina Laszewski&nbsp;declined to comment. In its most recent earnings, Meta said that its Reality Labs division, which its VR efforts fall under, <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx">lost nearly $4.5 billion</a>. </p><p>When Meta announced that it had acquired Ready at Dawn, it said that <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/welcoming-ready-at-dawn-to-facebook/?utm_source=www.readyatdawn.com&amp;utm_medium=oculusredirect#new_tab">the studio would</a> “continue creating memorable, immersive, and innovative VR content for gamers around the world as an independently-operated studio.” And while it did go on to release <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/pcvr/1711938725528735/?utm_source=www.oculus.com&amp;utm_medium=oculusredirect"><em>Lone Echo II</em> for the Rift and Rift S</a> — the game isn’t natively available for Meta’s standalone Quest headsets — Meta shut down the well-loved <em>Echo VR</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23580356/meta-shut-down-echo-vr-oculus-quest-arena-ready-at-down">in August 2023</a>.</p><p>At the time, CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/6/23588083/meta-shutting-down-echo-vr-john-carmack">said that</a> the resources to make <em>Echo VR</em> “could be put to other uses that I think will be useful to the now tens of millions of people who are in VR.” The Ready at Dawn team also said that it was <a href="https://medium.com/@EchoGames/an-update-on-the-future-of-echo-vr-7f074dca1ed1">working on its next project</a>, but now it seems that project won’t be released.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24211339/humane-ai-pin-more-daily-returns-than-sales"><h2>Humane’s daily returns are outpacing sales</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214471/google-chromecast-line-discontinued"><h2>Google is discontinuing the Chromecast line</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215275/google-tv-streamer-chromecast-gemini-interview"><h2>Why Google decided now’s the time to move on from Chromecast</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215440/intel-13th-14th-gen-crash-raptor-lake-integrator-warranty-lenovo-dell-hp-acer-asus"><h2>Will PC makers replace your crashing Intel chip?

Try as they might, console makers and game developers can't escape the weight of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've been slow to make any judgment calls on this generation of game and console sales because, however you look at it, this was the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>weirdest</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> generation shift in the game industry's history. It took place during the height of COVID-19 pandemic when more people spent time indoors, and amidst a technological shift that's made it possible to play triple-A games on portable devices like the Nintendo Switch and portable PC devices like the Steam Deck.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's made direct comparisons with prior launches harder to make—but in the last week we got plenty of data to confirm an important fact: current-generation console sales are slowing down, and the last generation of consoles is partly to blame.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The three major data points are these: Xbox </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-hardware-revenue-is-in-decline-but-microsoft-says-subscriptions-and-content-define-success">reported a massive dip</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in game hardware sales that may mean Xbox Series X|S sales have peaked. Sony revealed that PlayStation 5 sales are going strong, but they're </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playstation-5-hardware-sales-are-slipping-away">on track to miss projected targets</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that could weigh on their hopes for overall sales this generation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These facts feel deeply intertwined with why Electronic Arts announced that the last-gen port </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/star-wars-jedi-survivor-double-jumps-to-last-gen-in-september">will arrive in September</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m delighted more people get to check out </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/game-developer-s-best-of-2023-bryant-francis-top-10-games">one of my favorite games from 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But this port undeniably shows how developers need the last generation of consoles to sell games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Even a Jedi can’t run from the past">Even a Jedi can’t run from the past</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-earns-1-2-billion-from-live-service-titles-during-record-first-quarter">success</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> EA decided a last-generation port of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jedi Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could juice the game’s revenue. It would take an impressive cost/benefit analysis to make that decision, because it’s not like there was a button somewhere in EA that just said “push button to port game.” It’s challenging work to take a game optimized for newer consoles and optimize it for older hardware.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">EA was probably looking at data similar to what our colleagues at Omdia have been seeing. As you can see in the chart below, the active install base of Sony and Microsoft’s next-generation consoles only surpassed the previous generation in 2023—three years (really two and change, given how late the consoles launched in 2020) after their debut.</span></p><p>Image via Omdia.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That change has accelerated in 2024 but Omdia projects that in 2025, 25 percent of players will still be hanging out on older-generation consoles. Analyst James McWhirter pointed out to me that Sony reported in early 2023 that 30 percent of active PS5 users had never used a PS4, which is “good and bad” for the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“What we saw in the first half of the PS5's cycle was the adoption of PS5 outpaced the decline of active PS4 systems,” he said. “This tells us many PS5 purchasers never had a PS4. While positive in its own light it does shine a light on the prolonged cross-generation period we've seen continue into the second half of the cycle this year.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, some PlayStation 4 players were happy to stay on their last-generation console.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why? It’s not clear. An obvious answer might be that Sony and Xbox were both slow to roll out games that made the most of their new hardware—but third-party games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jedi Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could have convinced plenty of players to make the jump, and the excitement around new consoles seemed as strong as it was in prior years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other analysis indicates this slow adoption is due to games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Online, Fortnite and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minecraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Though both games have received graphical updates on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, their prior-gen versions look and play just fine. Younger audiences accustomed to playing these games with their friends may not see the need to upgrade if their online social spaces aren't dramatically impacted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That’s probably partly true, but surely the number of players on mobile devices eclipsed console users for the latter two titles, and younger users wouldn’t have the purchasing power to drive that shift anyway.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s likely a combination of these and other factors that all were exacerbated by events no one could control: the economy and inflation got </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>weird</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> right in the window these consoles were rolling out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I say “weird” and not “bad” because, on paper, the post-COVID-19 recovery (at least in the United States) has been strong. There’s a reason people have been calling this a “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/opinion/biden-trump-vibecession.html">vibecession</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.” Inflation, “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greedflation-caused-more-half-last-100000899.html">greedflation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,” and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have all hit the market, but people still haven’t stopped spending money on entertainment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Spending on travel, concerts, and Barbenheiemer exploded in the last two years, each driving knock-on economic stimulation for tourist attractions and areas around concert venues. Again, platforms like Ticketmaster drove prices upward to cash in on this interest—and are now reaping the rewards of allegedly gouging concertgoers for post-lockdown enthusiasm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So if your household is shelling out hundreds for nosebleed tickets for Taylor Swift and buying custom Barbie outfits for repeat Barbenheimer outings, all while Kroger and other groceries twist your arm for basic groceries…upgrading your already-impressive game console may not look all that important.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does this slow adoption mean for game developers?">What does this slow adoption mean for game developers?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I have no idea what the heck this slow adoption means for game developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now it’s clear developers are planning to launch last-gen and current-gen versions of their games. Just this morning Future Friends announced that it’s porting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vampire Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> onto PS4 and PS5. It’s a great title to span both generations. The already massively popular PC game doesn’t need fancy high-end graphics, so making a play for PlayStation is just all about making the game available for people anchored on that platform.</span></p><p>Image via Respawn Entertainment/Electronic Arts.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some business brains in the industry are crossing their fingers for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to drag players forward, as the series is liable to drive millions of dollars in sales within 24 hours of launch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And it’s not like the spending shifts in 2022 and 2023 permanently dragged consumers away from games.

            <p>
As id Software's annual QuakeCon gets underway today, a new - and currently unannounced - Doom 1 &amp; 2 bundle has been sighted on Steam, promising "enhanced" versions of the classic shooters with a brand-new episode from Wolfenstein and Indiana Jones studio MachineGames.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1821578978462699748">flagged by Wario64</a> on social media, a new listing combining 1993 FPS classic Doom and its illustrious 1994 sequel has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/">now surfaced on Steam</a>, seemingly replacing the individual listings previously available on Valve's platform. This new dual listing contains what are being described as the "definitive" versions of Doom 1 &amp; 2, complete with a lengthy feature list.
</p>
<p>
First and most expectedly, the new bundle contains the DOS versions of Doom 1 &amp; 2. That's alongside a number of additional campaigns, including TNT: Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment (two community created Doom 2 expansions later officially packaged together as Final Doom), plus Master Levels for Doom 2, Doom 2 expansion No Rest for the Living, and Sigil - John Romero's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-romeros-unofficial-fifth-doom-episode-sigil-is-finally-out">unofficial fifth episode</a> in the Doom saga.
</p>

<p>
There's also a brand-new campaign, Legacy of Rust, created by MachineGames and Nightdive Studios, as well as a new Deathmatch map pack featuring 25 maps. In total, that makes for 187 mission maps and 43 deathmatch maps across Doom 1 &amp; 2.
</p>
<p>
That, however isn't the end of things. Alongside the enhancements added in id's previous updates of Doom 1 &amp; 2 - which included upgraded visuals and modern controller support - this new version features the likes of online, cross-platform deathmatch and co-op for up to 16 players, and community-published mod support with an in-game mod browser.
</p>
<p>
It's also possible to select between the games' original midi soundtracks and Andrew Hulshult's IDKFA versions, with other enhancements including improved performance with multithreaded rendering supporting up to 4K resolution, BOOM source compatibility, new accessibility options, and expanded language support.
</p>
<p>
Notably, while Doom 1 &amp; 2's Steam page is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/">now live</a>, id Software hasn't yet formally announced this enhanced version of its classic shooters. It seems likely the full reveal treatment will come during QuakeCon, which runs from today, 8th August, until this Sunday, 11th June.
</p>
<p>
To coincide with the event, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/quakecon2024">QuakeCon sale</a> is currently live on Steam, offering discounts on Bethesda and id Software titles until 21st August.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-esports-player-ever/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When diving into the vast and wonderful world of esports, many end up wondering exactly who the best esports player of all time is. With so many immense players already in the industry, and many retired pros who have already cemented their names in the industry’s illustrious history, who among them can be truly classed as the top esports player ever?</p>



<p>Let’s hope this doesn’t disappoint too many people.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-greatest-esports-player-of-all-time">The Greatest Esports Player Of All Time</h2>



<p>To be the best esports player of all time, you need to tick more than just a few boxes. It’s not just about being solid at your game – you’ll also need to win tournaments, titles, and net a hefty stack of cash for your efforts. The best esports player needs to have an immense following made up of thousands – or even <strong>millions </strong>– of dedicated fans, and they should be synonymous with their chosen game.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>There are quite a few factors to think about when trying to decide who the greatest esports player of all time is. If we add up the criteria, who is the GOAT of esports?</p>



<p>There can only be one answer…</p>



<h2 id="h-johan-n0tail-sundstein">Johan ‘n0tail’ Sundstein</h2>



<p>Johan ‘n0tail’ Sundstein is without a doubt the greatest esports player of all time. While many other names were just short of number one, n0tail has to be the most successful esports player <strong>ever</strong>, putting him above everyone else. But why?</p>



<p>Not only is n0tail one of the best Dota 2 players in the world, but he is also a two-time back-to-back champion when it comes to The International (the biggest Dota 2 annual tournament). He won the two titles back in 2018 and 2019.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>N0Tail has also won four Major championships, making him one of the most well-decorated competitors in the Dota scene. If that wasn’t enough, he has won a staggering <strong>fifty </strong>lower-tier events, including DreamLeague and DreamHack. </p>



<p>And if <strong>that</strong> <strong>still wasn’t enough</strong>, he is one of the leading co-founders of OG, a brilliant and highly regarded esports organisation. Despite not competing since The International in 2021, the Danish-Faroese gamer claims he is ‘just taking a break’.</p>



<h3 id="h-n0tail-earnings">N0tail Earnings</h3>



<p>N0tail also has the highest earnings of any esports player in history, with an estimated $7.1 million earnings in prize money. He sits at more than half a million dollars ahead of the second-highest-earning esports player of all time.</p>



<p>Sundstein started his career competing in the game Heroes of Newarth but eventually switched to Dota 2, which was a decision that ultimately led to his massive success and monumental profile.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Not only is n0tail the highest-earning esports player of all time, but even some of his teammates in OG are in the top five. It just goes to show how valuable Dota 2 is.</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<h3 id="h-lee-faker-sang-hyeok">Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok</h3>



<p>For many, Faker is the best esports player of all time, having won the League of Legends World Championship a record four times and having established himself as one of the most dominant esports players in history. He’s a rockstar competitor with a stunning profile, but he’s yet to break away from being ‘just’ a competitor and hasn’t won anywhere near as much as n0tail.</p>



<h3 id="h-ian-crimsix-porter">Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter</h3>

<p>It is a crazy day when a Vice-presidential Candidate acknowledges esports. The popular (and newly announced VP for Kamala Harris) political figure, Tim Walz, recently acknowledged a Minnesota high school on their Valorant varsity team’s State Championship victory back in 2022.</p>



<p>Walz, who has been governor of Minnesota since 2019, has already been seen doing various sporting activities with his kids, such as football coaching and more. And now, it would seem the political figure has esports under his belt, too.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tim-walz-congratulates-high-school-valorant-team-for-state-championship-victory-in-2022">Tim Walz Congratulates High School Valorant Team For State Championship Victory In 2022</h2>



<p>Back in 2022, the Apple Valley High School varsity Valorant team took home first place in the State Championship. Walz made sure to acknowledge this massive feat for the school, as he was well-known for acknowledging other sports too.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Congratulations on an undefeated season and winning the Minnesota Varsity League State Championship in Valorant. Competitive success requires more than mere physical strength and agility; it also demands mental fortitude and tactical planning.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Walz’s acknowledgement of esports is a huge feat for the industry, as in the past, many political figures have sought to restrict video games at various levels.</p>



<p><em>“With esports on the rise, I am extremely proud of you and the role you have taken on to grow esports participation at Apple Valley High School in Minnesota. You are at the helm of transforming a hobby into a potentially life-changing career in a new and innovative realm of sports.”</em></p>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verizon-announces-free-high-school-esports-league/">Verizon’s new esports program</a> being introduced into US schools, we are looking at a very bright future for scholastic esports events and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-get-aaa-games-at-launch-its-claimed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When the Nintendo Switch launched in 2017, one thing it didn’t really have in its library were AAA games. It had major first-party games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, but nothing from the bigger third-party developers. With the upcoming launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, there appears to be a shift happening with the games that’ll be available for players.</p>



<p>According to Paul Gale, the Nintendo Switch 2 will have “big launch window releases” from third-party studios. These include “significant” AAA games.</p>







<p>“A few major third party developers whom at E3 2017 weren’t anticipating Nintendo Switch taking off the way it did and didn’t have a Triple A title at launch/the show itself, are working on big launch window releases for Nintendo’s next system,” Gale posted <a href="https://x.com/paulgalenetwork/status/1820819933267403125?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter</a>. </p>



<p>“[Nintendo Switch 2] will have some early, significant ports, parallel releases, and exclusives.”</p>



<p>As far as what those AAA games on the Nintendo Switch 2 could be, that’s anyone’s guess.</p>



<p>Nintendo is expected to reveal its next console in early 2025 with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-reportedly-headed-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release rumored to be</a> for March 2025. The latest rumors on the system claim that it will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be backwards compatible and support 4K</a> resolution.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/08/see-the-black-ops-6-zombies-gameplay-reveal-and-its-definitely-round-based/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Activision and Treyarch have released the gameplay reveal trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> Zombies game mode and the Terminus map, and it totally has a lot of zombie fighting in it. Also a speed boat, intriguingly… A reveal for the Liberty Falls map will come on 28th August during Call of Duty: Next.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Round-Based Zombies Terminus Reveal Trailer | New Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZexnXA4mMEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If there’s one thing that Activision wants you to know about this game mode, it’s that it’s “round-based”, just like all the zombies modes were before last year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/15/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review/">Modern Warfare 3</a> made it all open world. This was not a particularly popular move, and so Activision is backtracking almost as fast as when the backlash to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/11/04/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review/">COD: Infinite Warfare</a> made “boots on the ground” the only thing they would ever say about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/10/call-of-duty-wwii-review/">Call of Duty: WWII</a>.</p>
<p>As featured in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/06/black-ops-6-zombies-cinematic-trailer-promises-gameplay-reveal-later-this-week/">the cinematic reveal</a> Terminus map is set in the Philippine Sea at a remote US naval base turned CIA outpost turned subterranean laboratory. As the Requiem crew are broken out of their confinement, they discover the bio-research in progress for Project Janus, and have to start busting it up.</p>
<p>Treyarch say that you’ll want to pick Grigori Weaver, Elizabeth Grey, Mackenzie ‘Mac’ Carver, and Maya Aguinaldo as player characters to get the richest story experience while playing this.</p>

<p>Getting back to the round-based format will have pretty much all of the zombies mode staples returning as well. There’s a main quest to follow and puzzle your way through across multiple attempts and explorations, but then there’s also plenty of side-content to discover as well with a whole host of easter eggs. It all builds up to (if you survive) a point where you need to extract.</p>
<p>For your character build, both pre-match and with a mid-game progression, there’s the returning systems of perks, weapons and loadouts, field upgrade abilities, and then series staples of perk-a-colas, pack-a-punch, ammo mods and more.</p>
<p>You’ll want to use everything you’ve got to blast away at the new upside-down head spiders called Vermin, flying Parasites, the newly armoured Manglers and the full body horror of the Amalgam</p>
<p>There’s a whole ton of detail to delve into, with specific examples, on <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel#Shamblers">the Call of Duty website here</a>.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 lands on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One and PC on 25th October. It will also be available on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> tiers with day one games.</p>

            <p>Did The Gentlebros come up with the pun "Pi-Rats" and then work backwards from there in deciding that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cat-quest-pirates-of-the-purribean">Cat Quest 3</a> should be pirate themed? Or was "Purr-ibean" the initiating pun? I feel that the action-RPG sequel had to begin with one of wordplay or another, given that its Steam page boasts that it also has "furr-ocious spells" and "gla-meow-rous costumes".
</p>
<p>It's also claws-out now on Steam, which has me feline fine.

<p>I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of puns or punworlds, but I am a fan of Cat Quest. The first two games are good, accessible hack-and-slashers, with a colourful world to explore, and Cat Quest 2 introduced co-op. They're great games to play with your kids, as a sort of My First Action-RPG experience.
</p>
<p>Cat Quest 3 continues in kind with solo and local co-op. Its big new features are nautical combat (previous games eventually allowed your character to simply walk on water), a 2.5D world (rather than simply 2D), and a "refined" combat system that allows for attack combos and hot-swapping weapons. The latter sounds great to me, but I hope it doesn't move it beyond the ken of kids.
</p>
<p>The Gentlebros should have some time to enjoy releasing one game, but the introduction of Pi-Rats to the Cat Quest animal ecosystem begs the question of which animal pun-theme might appear in Cat Quest 4. I propose Vi-King Crabs.
</p>
<p>Cat Quest 3 is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305840/Cat_Quest_III/">over on Steam</a> for £15.29/€18/$18.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Callisto Protocol was long billed as the spiritual successor to Dead Space by Visceral Games, especially because it was being designed by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield. However, the game eventually flopped when it launched in December 2022. On Wccftech, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave</a> it a 7.2/10:</p>
<p><em>While an incredible looker in screenshots and death scenes, The Callisto Protocol suffers from a lack of intriguing content that makes the twelve-plus hour journey through Black Iron Prison worth two, even perhaps one single playthrough. Crafting and skill trees are both minimal in nature (with both costing a heavy amount of credits where players might only be able to fully upgrade two or three weapons in the full playthrough) while melee combat and combat encounters as a whole feel largely scripted. The horror elements stand out as reason alone to play Striking Distance's debut horror game, but you might want to find yourself getting thrown back into Black Iron Prison rather than see the journey through to the end.</em></p>
<p>Why did the game turn out to be so disappointing? Well, Glen Schofield himself believes it's because it should have been delayed, but publisher Krafton refused. Speaking in a video interview with YouTuber Dan Allen Gaming, Schofield <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IIVia5aiUQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>I wanted about three and a half more months and I was led to believe for about three or four months that that's the way it was going to be. In October or September 21, I was told that we were going to get the time, just no regrets. That was the term that was being used, no regrets, just put whatever you want into the game. Then January comes around, and some of the folks come over, and they just said no, it's December of 2022, and I was like, it's not going to get done, and it's going to cost you more money.&nbsp;It's not like it costs you less money because you're getting it out three months sooner. If you want it done, I got to accelerate everything by three and a half months, which means I need to jam people on here. If I need 20 people, I actually get 30 or 40 because that learning curve will not adjust.</em></p>
<p>Glen Schofield <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-leaves-striking-distance-after-the-callisto-protocols-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> developer Striking Distance Studios nearly a year ago. In the above interview, he explained he wanted to focus on his health and taking care of his daughter.</p>

Earlier this year, an executive at Roblox Studio suggested the game, which lets users create their own content and make money off in-game purchases, could provide jobs to kids living in slums.

We are happy today to share that we will extend 2v8’s initial run until next week, August 15 @ 11am ET. <a href="https://t.co/2Udb1mmumz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2Udb1mmumz</a></p>— Dead by Daylight (@DeadbyDaylight) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1821547941246505174?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1821547943507152969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new post on X/Twitter</a>, Behaviour Interactive announced today that the initial run for 2v8 mode would now conclude on Thursday, August 15, at 8 am PT / 11 am ET. More interestingly, Behaviour Interactive disclosed the reason for extending the 2v8 trial run was due to the high demand from the community, in addition to <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1821547943507152969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealing</a> that 2v8 accounted for over 40% of all matches played in Dead by Daylight since its debut late last month, even though 2v8 had long queue times. </p><p>"We've been blown away by your reaction to 2v8 these past two weeks, and we've heard your demand loud and clear for the mode to be extended beyond its planned end date," Behaviour Interactive wrote in the post. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Although fans have requested 2v8 for years, there has yet to be an ETA on if/when 2v8 will be a permanent mode in Dead by Daylight. However, in a separate post, Behaviour Interactive <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1821547944820023425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> that the introduction of 2v8 was "only the first iteration" with intentions to refine the mode before making it a permanent staple in Dead by Daylight. Specifically, the development teams want to address challenges related to 2v8's matchmaking and variety in Killers, along with "a more compelling Survivor experience." </p><p>For those unfamiliar, 2v8 mode, as the name implies, is a game mode in Dead by Daylight that increases the player count from 1 killer and 4 survivors to 2 killers and 8 survivors. With the increase in player count, 2v8 introduces a few changes to the core Dead by Daylight gameplay experience. These include a larger map and the removal of Hooks and Perks. </p><p>In our review of Dead by Daylight, which we awarded a 9/10, IGN wrote: "After almost five years, Dead by Daylight has grown into an incredible slasher film simulator and the best asymmetrical multiplayer game around." </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-promo-codes">Roblox</a> has been banned in Turkey, with a government agency citing concerns over "child exploitation."
</p>
<p>The decision to ban all access to the game and platform was taken by the Turkish Information and Communication Technologies Authority (BTK), who also blocked access to Instagram in the country earlier this week.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The ban was <a href="https://x.com/yilmaztunc/status/1821259391087341579">announced by the Turkish Minster of Justice via X</a>. "According to our Constitution, our State is obliged to take the necessary measures to ensure the protection of our children," said the statement, which is otherwise light on detail.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.turkiyetoday.com/turkiye/4-reasons-why-turkiye-banned-roblox-37404/">Turkey Today reports</a> that the government has four key concerns which led to the ban: the sexual exploitation of children, "rampant" reports of pedophilia, children being incentivised to play Roblox via the virtual currency Robux, and the "inability to effectively monitor and regulate inapproriate content" on the platform.
</p>
<p>Last month, Bloomberg published <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">an investigation into Roblox's "pedophile problem"</a>.
</p>
<p>"We've spent almost 20 years making Roblox one of the safest online platforms for our users, particularly the youngest, and ensuring the safety of our users is at the core of everything we do," said a Roblox spokesperson in a response to the ban <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-responds-to-platform-ban-in-turkiye">shared with Eurogamer</a>. 
</p>
<p>"We respect the laws and regulations in countries where we operate and share local lawmakers' commitment to children. We look forward to working together to ensure Roblox is back online in Türkiye as soon as possible."
</p>
<p>Roblox has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, both for child safety reasons and the manner in which its creators profit from the labour of children. 
</p>
<p>"Like, you can say, 'Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labour,' right? Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income," said <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-studio-head-you-can-say-okay-we-are-exploiting-child-labour">Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza at GDC earlier this year</a>. "So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money and then sustain my life."

Among those is Something New, a Stasis hand cannon that's been around for quite a while. With a few new perks available, however, Something New might be a pretty viable option to take into the Crucible, and it sports a few that'll make it fun to use in PvE, too. Here's where you can get Something New and the god rolls you want to keep an eye out for.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Something_New">How To Get Something New</a></li><li><a href="#Something_New_God_Rolls">Something New God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Something_New_PvP_God_Roll">Something New PvP God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Something_New_PvE_God_Roll">Something New PvE God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Something_New">How To Get Something New</h2><p dir="ltr">Something New is one of four weapons exclusive to the Solstice of Heroes event, so the best way to get it is from Solstice's dedicated event, Bonfire Bash. Completing the event drops several Solstice weapons, so the most efficient method for chasing new rolls of the gun is there. You can also expect to pick up Something New rolls from completing Solstice bounties, opening Solstice packages, and completing Solstice event card Triumphs, but these are a lot less reliable than just fighting through Bonfire Bash.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Something_New_God_Rolls">Something New God Rolls</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4347319-20240806172132_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347319" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4347319-20240806172132_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347319"></a><figcaption>Something New</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4347319-20240806172132_1.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Something_New_PvP_God_Roll">Something New PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Small Bore  <ul><li dir="ltr">+7 Stability, +7 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Accurized Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Snapshot Sights / Rapid Hit  <ul><li dir="ltr">Snapshot Sights: Faster time to aim down sights.</li><li dir="ltr">Rapid Hit: Rapid precision hits temporarily increase stability and reload speed.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Precision Instrument / Explosive Payload  <ul><li dir="ltr">Precision Instrument: Dealing sustained damage increases precision damage.</li><li dir="ltr">Explosive Payload: Projectiles create an area of effect detonation on impact.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Something New carries a few solid perks for PvP that can make it pretty useful. The combination of Snapshot Sights and Precision Instrument can make it a little easier to nail precision hits and to keep the damage coming. Pair that with Nadir Focus, one of the gun's origin traits, and you get a lot of benefits for landing headshots.</p><p dir="ltr">You can alternatively go for Rapid Hit, which also takes advantage of landing headshots, if you're the kind of player with great aim in the Crucible. Explosive Payload is a decent replacement for Precision Instrument if the headshots are a little tougher to land, as you get some increased flinch against your opponent that can help you win duels. In any case, make sure you flip the Origin Trait on Something New to Nadir Focus, as it's way better in this case than the Solstice-specific trait, Dream Work.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Something_New_PvE_God_Roll">Something New PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Corkscrew Rifling  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Stability, +5 Range, +5 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Tactical Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Reload Speed, +5 Stability, +1 Magazine Size</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Rapid Hit / Demolitionist  <ul><li dir="ltr">Rapid Hit: Rapid precision hits temporarily increase stability and reload speed.</li><li dir="ltr">Demolitionist: Kills with this weapon grant grenade energy. Activating your grenade ability reloads this weapon from reserves.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Headstone / Explosive Payload  <ul><li dir="ltr">Headstone: Precision final blows spawn a Stasis crystal at the victim's location.</li><li dir="ltr">Explosive Payload: Projectiles create an area of effect detonation on impact.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Reload Speed / Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Though Something New has gotten a bit of a revamp with perks that are a bit more useful in PvP, its PvP selection is more or less unchanged from years past. That's okay, though, since the existing PvE perks are solid. Rapid Hit is always useful, as is the boost in grenade energy Demolitionist brings, and Headstone is a Stasis-only perk that's not too widespread, giving Something New an element that feels a little bit unique. Explosive Payload is a decent replacement, though, and great for knocking out minor enemies alone or in groups.</p>

While there's no guarantee that this fresh wave won't sell out as quickly--or that scalpers will have a change of heart--this is your best chance yet to get a physical version of the collection of JRPG classics without having to pay an outlandish sum.</p><p>If you haven't played it, Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster is a massive update of the NES and SNES Final Fantasy games. The original 2D-pixel graphics were enhanced to look sharper, the various game soundtracks were rearranged under the guiding hand of series composer Nobuo Uematsu, and there are numerous quality-of-life updates. The games also came with a few extra features, a bestiary, an illustration gallery, and a music player to enjoy the soundtracks on their own.</p></div>                      </div><p>Since some of the Final Fantasy games can feel dated, other enhancements include a modernized UI, auto-battle options, turning off random encounters, adjustable experience points muiltipliers, and other boost features. If you're looking to add a few more of the other almost-as-classic Final Fantasy games to your collection, Square Enix does have physical editions of them readily available.</p><h2>Classic Final Fantasy Games</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VIII-Remastered-Switch-Nintendo/dp/B08L42HJ4P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy 7 and Final Fantasy 8 Remastered Twin Pack</a> -- $33</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-IX-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C3DMTX14?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy 9</a> -- $41</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD</a> -- $32</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy 12: The Zodiac Age</a> -- $32</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crisis-Core-Fantasy-Reunion-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0B5B1864Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion</a> -- $30</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/lego-new-releases-august-2024-mario-star-wars-marvel-minecraft-batman/2900-5655/">Over 100 Lego Sets Released This Month - Here Are The Biggest Ones</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-18-lego-video-games-for-only-15-marvel-batman-lotr-star-wars-and-more/1100-6525462/">Get 18 Lego Video Games For Only $15 - Marvel, Batman, LOTR, Star Wars, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-world-lego-set-preorder-mario-and-yoshi/1100-6525283/">Super Mario World Lego Set Is Up For Preorder At Target</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/7-new-lego-minecraft-sets-are-available-now-including-the-iconic-crafting-table/1100-6523896/">7 New Lego Minecraft Sets Are Available Now, Including The Iconic Crafting Table</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-lite-bundle-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-only-159-at-walmart/1100-6522718/">Nintendo Switch Lite Bundle With Animal Crossing: New Horizons Is Only $159 At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-back-to-school-sale-2024-ps5-games-playstation-vr-ps5-slim-deals/2900-5638/">PlayStation Back To School Sale: Save Over 50% On PS5 Exclusives, $200 On PSVR 2, And $50 On Consoles</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-drops-to-best-price-yet-alongside-more-great-ps5-game-deals/1100-6525363/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Drops To Best Price Yet Alongside More Great PS5 Game Deals</a></li>   </ul> </div>
