			<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-last-of-us-renewed-season-3-hbo-1236364271/">Deadline</a> reports that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-hbo-series-multiple-season-things-to-be-flipped/">HBO's The Last of Us</a> has been renewed for season 3 just a few days ahead of the season 2 premiere this coming Sunday, April 13, 2025. The news doesn't come as a total shock, considering how often showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann have talked about needing at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-show-will-have-a-shorter-season-2-but-season-3-will-be-larger-and-there-may-even-be-season-4/">least three, potentially four seasons</a>, to tell the whole story of The Last of Us Part II.</p>
<p>Realistically, we won't know how plausible a fourth season will be until we reach the end of season 2, and see how far along into the story of The Last of Us Part II this season takes us. But if a fourth season is needed, HBO sounds likely to grant it, with the executive vice president of HBO programming and head of HBO drama series and films, Francesca Orsi, expressing every confidence in Mazin, Druckmann, and the entire creative team behind the series.</p>
<p>"<em>It can't be overemphasized how proud HBO is for the outstanding achievement we believe the second season of The Last of Us is,</em>" Orsi said in a statement. "<em>Craig, Neil, Carolyn [Strauss] and the entire executive producer team, cast and crew have delivered a masterful follow-up and we're thrilled to carry the power of Craig and Neil's storytelling into what we know will be an equally moving and extraordinary third season."</em></p>
<p>In a separate statement, Druckmann expressed his gratitude to fans for their positive reaction and credited Mazin with playing a huge role in the adaptation's success.</p>
<p>"<em>To see The Last of Us brought to life so beautifully and faithfully has been a career highlight for me, and I am grateful for the fans' enthusiastic and overwhelming support. Much of that success is thanks to my partner in crime, Craig Mazin, our partnership with HBO, and our team at PlayStation Productions [...] We're thrilled to bring you more of The Last of Us!</em>"</p>
<p>For his own part, Mazin added that season 2 has "<em>exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew.</em>"</p>
<p>Just because we're getting a third season, though, doesn't mean a fourth will follow. Mazin previously said in an interview that he will <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-showrunner-will-flat-out-not-go-past-the-story-in-the-games/">"<em>flat out</em>"</a> not go beyond the plot of the games, and if that means only needing three seasons, then that's what it means. According to Mazin, only if a fourth season is needed will it happen.</p>

            <p>The release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> brought with it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-verdict-monster-hunter-wilds">the usual comments</a> about the hypocrisy of a series that wants to both protect ecosystems and grind them up for parts. "When will Monster Hunter just be honest about its desire to endlessly turn dragons into pants," we lamented to ourselves. "When will the Monster Hunters recognise - nay, <em>embrace</em> the fact that they are the biggest Monsters of all". </p>
<p>We could have saved ourselves a few thousand words and just pointed at Hunters Inc, instead. It's basically a first-person low-budget Monster Hunter game in which the Hunters are Orcs. Orcs do not do self-deception, as a rule. They do not go for sanitised violence or anthropocentric fantasies about becoming "nature's caretakers". They are straightforwardly happy to club things to bits. Looks like ludonarrative consonance is back on the menu, boys!</p><!--more-->

<p>In Hunters Inc, you and up to four of your greenskin friends rampage around procedurally generated biomes mashing up the fauna. Their weapons include spears, hammers and bows, and their prey ranges from giant spiders to smaller giant spiders, giant crocodiles and, er, snails. Not especially giant snails, no, just regular snails that made the mistake of looking smashable. There are four Orc RPG classes to choose from: the Berserker, who's all about DPS, the Tracker, who's all about recon, the Blacksmith, who builds war machines using gatherable resources, and the Shaman, who is armed with protective totems and spells.</p>
<p>The larger creatures are so large they can smash up bits of the environment. You'll need to kite them around and exploit the terrain to get the drop on them, which, yes, I do mean literally. Orcs don't seem to have a problem with fall damage as long as they land spear-first on something with tendons. Once slain, you can carve the beasts up for parts to upgrade your gear and yes, I <em>also</em> mean "carving" literally. There's no performative jabbing with your beltknife while the slaughtered quarry gracefully dematerialises, as in Capcom's game. You can actually chop a giant croc's head off and roll around in the gore like a toddler invading a chocolate fountain.</p>
<p>Creators Wylderzone are also responsible for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2514460/GUARDS/">Guards!</a>, in which you play a bunch of city watchmen hobnail-booting the crims. That game wasn't rapturously received, but perhaps they've struck gold this time. Regardless, I consider this good catharsis after Wilds. The only thing I'm left bewildered by is the "Inc" part. This is an Orc corporation then? Do they have shareholders? Where are they registered for tax purposes?</p>
<p>You can assess the game for yourself by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2937090/Hunters_Inc/">downloading the Steam demo</a>. The full thing is out in July 2025. I feel bad about writing this up because it absolutely should have gone to Nic, author of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-easy-being-green-a-brief-history-of-orcs-in-video-games">the very best piece on video game Orcs</a>, but that's what he gets for [placeholder for whatever he does next that annoys me].</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Those changes came in the form of reduced health for some basic monsters, improvements to the Huntress (including a new skill), and restoring some of the power of minions in the early game while still

update). GGG confirmed it will be making them flow better, require less running around, and in some cases, smaller in size. Then on April 8, even more changes were <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2694490/view/497192510562500616?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a>, this time focused on buffs to underperforming class skills, improvements to crafting, and reducing monster speed in areas with lots of fast monsters that can easily overwhelm players.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the rapid fixes, Path of Exile 2 is sitting at "Mixed" recent reviews on Steam, although it still sports an "Overwhelmingly Positive" rating overall. In a recent interview with Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiFLwjFI4S4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zizaran</a>, Path of Exile 2 game directors Mark Roberts and Jonathan Rogers admitted some mistakes were made with Dawn of the Hunt, stating that many of the changes players complained about, especially in regards to the campaign, were unintended and meant to target endgame builds that were making endgame content "trivial."</p><p dir="ltr">"The first thing we thought was 'What the hell, we didn't even nerf the campaign," Rogers said in the interview. "Literally that's what a lot of developers were saying. 'We didn't nerf this, why is everyone saying we nerfed it?' We found a few things but we are still looking for what those things are. It's not always necessarily obvious with all the changes that you make."</p><p dir="ltr">Roberts said the team has adopted a "firing from the hip" approach given the game is in early access, and that if a change doesn't work out and is bad, they can simply undo it. That led to what Roberts said were some "pretty blatant f***-ups" in regards to things like some monsters having more life than intended.</p><p dir="ltr">Rogers went on to explain part of what he believes is one of the developer's main challenges with Path of Exile 2--that due to its slower-paced combat and intentionally higher-difficulty, GGG needs to be much more precise when it comes to getting the game's balance right. This is unlike in the original Path of Exile, where over a decade after its release, knowledgeable players can easily blast through everything in the game from the very start. It's for that reason GGG worries about reducing Path of Exile 2's difficulty too much, as Rogers said he thinks it would result in a game that isn't fun in the long term.</p><p dir="ltr">"If we get balance numbers wrong, if a monster has double life by accident in PoE 1, it doesn't even really matter," Rogers said. "Whereas if a monster has double life in PoE 2, it matters a lot. The threshold for what is right is way tighter in PoE 2 and that means it will just take longer to balance and get it all correct."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-into-path-of-exile-2-early-access/1100-6527842/" data-ref-id="1100-6527842">Path of Exile 2 is available in paid early access now</a> but will eventually be free-to-play.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> has <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1909999973258719307">confirmed</a> HBO's acclaimed live-action adaptation of The Last of Us is getting a third season, even before the highly anticipated season two has aired.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us' TV debut in 2023 was met with huge critical acclaim and brought in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-finale-breaks-another-viewership-record">record numbers of viewers</a>, so it wasn't much of a surprise when HBO confirmed it had commissioned a second season. And with excitement building ahead of season two's start date this Sunday, 13th April (its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-breaks-hbo-record-before-its-even-aired">already managed to set two records for HBO</a>, even before it's aired), fans will no doubt be thrilled to hear things won't be ending with an abrupt full-stop.
</p>
<p>
Plans for a third The Last of Us season have been discussed previously, of course. In August 2023, showrunner Craig Mazin confirmed the team would need more than one season to cover the events of the second game, noting that "four seems like a good number". That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbo-expects-the-last-of-us-to-run-for-four-seasons">figure was repeated again earlier this year</a>, when HBO executive Francesca Orsi revealed that while a "a complete or final plan" wasn't in place, "it's looking like four seasons" for the adaption.

<p>
Addressing today's The Last of Us season three renewal announcement (thanks <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-renewed-season-3-1236363976/">Variety</a>), Mazin said, "We approached season two with the goal of creating something we could be proud of. The end results have exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew."
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us season two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">spans seven episodes</a> (one "quite big" in length), with episode one airing this Sunday, 13th April, at 9pm ET/PT via HBO and Max in the US. In the UK, season two airs on Sky Atlantic and NOW, with the first episode becoming available on Monday, 14th April - presumably at 2am for those that want to get ahead of spoilers.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us season two sees the return of Pedro Pascal as Joel, Bella Ramsey as Ellie, Gabriel Luna as Tommy, and Rutina Wesley as Maria, with new cast members including Young Mazino, Alanna Ubach, Ben Ahlers, Hettienne Park, Joe Pantoliano, Robert John Burke, Noah Lamanna, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-twos-abby-kaitlyn-dever-wants-to-do-this-character-justice-and-make-the-fans-proud">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a>. Additionally, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-catherine-ohara-will-play-in-the-last-of-us-marking-a-significant-change-from-the-games">legendary Catherine O'Hara joins the cast</a> as a Jackson therapist - one with an intriguing connection to a minor game character whose story is set to be expanded in a similar style to season one's hugely acclaimed Bill and Frank episode.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-ceo-controversial-decision-to-unban-adin-ross-was-about-%E2%80%98second-chance-%E2%80%99-not-%E2%80%98business-considerations%E2%80%99.1159668/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/adin-ross-twitch-unbanned-dan-clancy-explains<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the tail end of March, over two years after being given the boot from Twitch, Adin Ross was suddenly unbanned. This came as a surprise to many viewers – and not a pleasant one.</p><p>Ross’ first tenure on the platform came to an end in early 2023, not long after he began cozying up to the likes of professional misogynist and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/andrew-tate-arrests-explained.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assault/trafficking allegations</a> magnet Andrew Tate. Things did not seem on track to improve, with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/adin-ross-andrew-tate-white-supremacists-1234705845/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> writing a couple months after Ross’ Twitch suspension that he platformed an anonymous neo-Nazi on Kick. As recently as October of 2024, he <a href="https://x.com/BenjaminGoggin/status/1841823020576293197/video/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platformed white nationalist Nick Fuentes</a>, who proceeded to engage in Holocaust denial during the broadcast, as he is wont to do. Ross was also accused of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-i-failed-adin-ross-apologizes-accused-hitler-salute-viral-clip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nazi saluting some fans earlier this year</a>, which is the same year he <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-this-fault-adin-ross-takes-accountability-x-community-saying-evilest-things" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swore he’d turn over a new leaf</a>, at least in regard to chat moderation.&nbsp;</p><p>"I feel defeated tryna even repair things or explain stuff because there’s no explaining,” Ross <a href="https://x.com/AR15thed3mon/status/1899217716130599138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a> after the Nazi salute clip, originally from earlier this year, went viral in March. “I’m pictured the way I’m pictured and it sucks, sorry to everyone I have failed."&nbsp;</p><p>It is not difficult to imagine why Twitch employees, like Twitch viewers, were upset that Ross has been permitted to return to his old, significantly more visible stomping grounds. After all, his recent actions do not exactly scream “reformed.” During a Twitch all-hands meeting that took place last week, of which Aftermath has viewed video, one employee voiced their incredulity to Twitch CEO Dan Clancy.</p><p>"What evidence did you evaluate that Adin Ross had reformed enough since his ban to justify him being unbanned?” the employee asked. “To be transparent, this is one of the decisions we've made that I've disagreed with the most. I strongly believe that this opens the wider community to harm and sends a signal that we will allow the sort of vitriol Adin has been known to perpetuate."&nbsp;</p><p>Clancy largely replied in platitudes and rules-speak, which we’ll get to in a second. But the last part of his response is the most interesting, so let’s start there:</p><p>“I can say this emphatically to everyone: This is [in] no way, shape, or form based upon any business considerations whatsoever,” Clancy said during the meeting. “This isn't even remotely related to a business. It's about deciding about when you can give someone a second chance – and then giving them a chance, but if they don't live up to our expectations, we can take action. So in terms of this opening the wider community to harm, I think that if he doesn't live up to our community guidelines, then he won't still be on Twitch."</p><p>This line of thought is worth scrutinizing, because it’s unlikely that having Adin Ross and his army of disaffected boys back in town is <em>bad </em>for business. Indeed, it could even prove beneficial for Twitch in the long run if the company – and Ross – play their cards right. For one, Ross is undoubtedly a needle mover; his <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Kick stream with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump</a>, a masterclass in the art of shameless suck-uppery, peaked at over 580,000 concurrent viewers. For two, the far-right grift is in right now all across the internet, even on Twitch, where Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt’s daily missives decrying DEI and Democrats have installed him as the new politics king over deposed leftist himbo sensation Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker. Hate is against Twitch’s community guidelines – unless you <a href="https://aftermath.site/nickmercs-twitch-ban-transphobia-slur" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">know how to word it correctly</a>.</p><p>Lastly and perhaps most importantly, Ross has crossover appeal; one of the biggest creators <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-kai-cenat-trying-get-adin-ross-unbanned-twitch-one-last-time-amid-rumors-leaving-kick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advocating for his return</a> from exile was Kai Cenat, livestreaming’s biggest star of the past few years and a bonafide <em>real </em>celebrity at this point (though I guess now the two are <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/adin-ross-shades-twitch-streamers-who-abandoned-him-during-two-year-ban-3174580/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maybe beefing</a> over the notion that Cenat didn’t try hard enough to help him get unbanned? I don’t know, man; it’s beside the point). Ross is also buds with manosphere-adjacent luminaries like Jake Paul and UFC president Dana White. Basically, he’s a terrible, irritating link in a lot of lucrative chains.</p><p>If you were Clancy, the head of a company that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/twitch-amazon-video-games-investment-9020db87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everybody knows isn’t profitable</a> – and that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/10/12/amazon-twitch-streamer-70-30-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains in thrall</a> to Jeff Bezos, one of history’s most bottom-line-obsessed overlords – and you were not being disingenuous about your purpose, which is always to make decisions motivated first and foremost by business considerations, you could do quite a bit worse than this.&nbsp;</p><p>The remainder of Clancy’s explanation reiterated his philosophy on the idea of indefinite bans, which he’s outlined elsewhere and which he does seem to really believe in, at least insofar as it allows him to be <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nominally friendly with everyone regardless of ideological bent</a>.</p><p>“Adin's been banned for over two years,” Clancy said. “He was banned for having a certain number of strikes on his account rather than a singular offense that [led to] indefinite suspension. It's important to note these suspensions are indefinite, not permanent. They've always been thought of as indefinite. Many organizations use indefinite suspensions. In basketball, Draymond Green was indefinitely suspended from the NBA and then let back on.”</p><p>On Clancy’s watch, Twitch has been allowing indefinite suspensions – and the black marks on streamers’ records left behind by prior suspensions – to expire. Outside of a few select <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3llkq2h2wv224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“high severity harms”</a> like violent content and youth safety, indefinitely suspended streamers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3llkps6psis24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can apply to have their accounts reinstated</a> after six months. Clancy said that Ross passed the test.</p><p>“We have a team that looks into this, and it is always a challenging line. We do believe that it's important for people to be able to change the way they have behaved in the past. I think that's a critical component, and we try to assess the likelihood that you will behave consistent with our guidelines,” he said. “In this case, Adin has made a number of public statements about trying to change where he's been. We've gotten feedback from various people about him trying to change. As always with this, we will see how it works out.”</p><p>Clancy added that Ross will find himself under extra scrutiny for the time being and that he’s looking at fewer potential strikes before he’s out again.</p><p>“In general, for those who are unaware, when people come back from suspensions such as this, we also hold them to a fairly high standard,” Clancy said. “It's not like they start off from ground zero. The severity of any enforcement actions or otherwise might be more severe given where we're at.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-interview-gamechat-discord-price"><h3>With The Switch 2, Even Nintendo Wants To Trap You In An Ecosystem</h3></a><p>Like Sony, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Valve, Epic, and everyone else before it</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/games-writing-words-that-are-bad"><h3>Games Writing Words I Hate</h3></a><p>Let's get pedantic, my favorite thing to be</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/into-dead-our-darkest-days-preview-side-scrolling-zombie-survival<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Whether you want to slay zombies or rescue survivors, you'll find opportunities for both in&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>by PikPok. A spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead</em>, a mobile action game, it's the first franchise entry to use sidescrolling mechanics. As a fan of survival games, I was interested in how this would differ from other recent genre titles. Just from the images, I was digging the retro late 70's-early 80's vibe the art really brings forth. Regardless of not having played either of the previous franchise games, I decided to try out&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>Preview - <em>Stranger Things</em> Meets <em>Late Night With the Devil&nbsp;</em>Vibes</h2>

<p>Right off the bat, the art direction for the title is on the nose for a late 1970's city. From the color palette used in text, to the style of clothing survivors wear, to the decor of different locations, everything oozes that end of the decade feeling. Every home has a corded telephone, TV's come with bunny ear antennas, the arcades are filled with retro machines, and the cars are long and boxy.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-vibes.jpg?itok=S0u0Drnf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-vibes.jpg?itok=ifH5nUs8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You get to pick two survivors to start with, each with their pros and cons. I personally love Penny and Daphne. Penny is an amazingly stealthy survivor. When armed with a blade, she can quickly take out a zombie without alerting others to her presence. Daphne is a multitasker built for shelter management. Able to get increased output from cooking and making medical items, her lessened damage crowns her as a shelter mother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scavenging is where all the action in the game takes place. You can send a max of three survivors out per phase, or day and night. Locations can be explored in a number of ways. You can go through the front door, climb a pipe to the roof, or jump to an overhang and climb through a window. Zombies can be stealthily killed from behind, but if you're seen, they can let out a horrible wail that alerts all nearby enemies to your presence. This can be negated by whapping the zombie before it unleashes its screeching howl.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The further towards escape you get the more zombies you'll encounter in a location. You'll have had the ability to upgrade your shelter units, though, allowing you to possibly arm yourself with guns or more durable weapons. Stealth is still important here, as you can quickly get swarmed with upwards of five zombies at a time. Taking hits from them can quickly render your survivor dead. The resources they gathered are left with the body, and all your survivors in the shelter get hit with a Grief state.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-recruit-barb.jpg?itok=HZKUvBUQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-recruit-barb.jpg?itok=KkQXasb9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>States in the game affect how characters interact with each other, what they need when at the shelter, and if they'll just up and leave your group. Grief can lead to the last result if left to turn into depression and hopelessness. This means you'll have to bench your best scavenger sometimes or risk the consequences.</p>

<p>A survivor's death also impacts your strategy moving forward. Are you willing to risk another survivor to get the items that were collected? I often sent someone to collect the backpack of a fallen survivor, especially if they had a gun. Guns are rare to find, so keeping your hands on them when you get them can mean the difference between successfully escaping or failing.</p>

<p>I found myself really enjoying trying to fully clear a location and find all the survivors currently available. There are hidden locations only found by talking to some survivors or finding secret notes. These are often filled with rare loot, including weapons and base materials. Sometimes, there are human enemies guarding these areas, adding a bit of spice to your zombie-killing routine.</p>

<p>There are ways to do no-kill runs at certain locations, which really challenges stealth and escaping alive. You can also kill every zombie you come across, managing the sound various weapons make as well as the lack of weapons you may run into by not paying attention to weapon durability. Depending on your playstyle, you can have a different experience from others while clearing locations.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-stealth-kill-with-bat.jpg?itok=bVZKT2k6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-stealth-kill-with-bat.jpg?itok=h-oi0UhE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The zombie sounds are eerie, even more so when you wear headphones and can hear all their movements. Some zombies cry or hum, and I've never heard anything as creepy. The first time I heard a zombie scream, the hairs on my neck stood on end. The audio is extremely important and highlights all aspects of&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days.</em></p>



<p>One of the major issues I take with the title is the lack of variety. There are plenty of locations you can scavenge, different weapons to use, and survivors with various traits to rescue. The main problem is the layout of the zombies themselves. Whenever you enter a place for the first time, the enemies are always in the same room, use the same movement patterns, and react the same way to loud sounds. If you end up replaying a part of the game multiple times, like the beginning, those areas can quickly become boring to explore. There's less challenge when you can memorize where the zombies are and move around them or stealth kill them without any worry for your survivor.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-escape-plans.jpg?itok=XWweYPPF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-escape-plans.jpg?itok=aXd7ZzP0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This applies to the Escape Plans, as well. Currently, there are two plans you can work towards to make it out of the city. The plans don't change. Their leads are located in the same places, the needed items are always found in the same area when scavenging, and the designated locations to progress the plan are the same. Again, if you play through multiple times, this can make the title more boring than intended.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are still a number of bugs that impact gameplay.&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</em>&nbsp;is in Early Access, so bugs are expected. Some that I've encountered include game crashes, softlocks, zombies attacking through doors, zombies moving through objects, and zombies not spawning correctly. The dev team has said they are working on them.</p>

<p>The number of times I've had to restart due to softlocks and crashes is far higher than it should be. Not only that, but there were different causes of the softlock, and they all resulted in an endless loading screen when returning to the shelter.&nbsp;Since returning to the shelter is when the game saves, this caused me to have to restart a new game multiple times. Depending on where you're at, this could be upwards of 10 hours invested in a save just gone.&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><span><span>Even though </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> has plenty of pros, the progression-ending bugs instantly kill any motivation to continue playing.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-zombie-in-car-bug.jpg?itok=1xsZGe2c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-zombie-in-car-bug.jpg?itok=VStGWbQi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Thankfully, the game is in Early Access, meaning many of these issues are going to be addressed as time goes on. Development is already noted on the EA Roadmap for "curveballs", or world events that will affect your shelter in various ways. Further down the pipeline are additional survivors, NPC traders, an expanded map, more escape plans, and more zombie behaviors. These will certainly change how the game plays and, hopefully, keep it fresh and exciting each time you start a new game. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>PikPok is a leading game studio in New Zealand, so I have faith the development team will be able to remedy the different causes for crashes and softlocks, as well as the other bugs present in the title, before it fully launches. The core mechanics and the story of&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</em>&nbsp;is solid. Flushing it out with more variety or a more challenging mode will only make it a stronger contender in the survival genre.&nbsp;</p>

In a recent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/power-rangers-racist-casting-black-yellow-rangers-mistake-1236362807/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/power-rangers-racist-casting-black-yellow-rangers-mistake-1236362807/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a></span>, however, the head writers of the series confessed to the “mistake” they made casting the series, specifically when it came to racial stereotypes.<br></p><p>In the original series, the only Black character, Zack Taylor (Walter Emanuel Jones), and the only Asian character Trini Kwan (Thuy Trang), played the Black and Yellow Rangers, respectively. “None of us are thinking stereotypes,” former Power Rangers head writer Tony Oliver said on the latest episode of  Investigation Discovery’s new docuseries, “Hollywood Demons.”<br></p><p>Oliver added that it took his assistant one day calling it for them to realize what they had done. “It was such a mistake,” he explained. During the episode, they even show never-before-seen footage from behind-the-scenes, where Jones says to the camera, “My name’s Walter Jones, I play Zack. I’m Black, and I play the Black Ranger — go figure.” During the series’ casting, Oliver revealed how the Black Ranger “seemed to have the swagger of the group,” while the Yellow Ranger was “peaceful” who tended to “the conscience of the group.”</p><p>For many millennials, Power Rangers is a big part of their childhood, so of course they took to X with their thoughts on the matter. Some fans were quick to point out that the roles eventually were replaced, with a Black actor taking over as a Yellow Ranger and an Asian actor taking over as the Black Ranger.</p><p>Should they have thought more about stereotypes before casting the show this way? Or was the representation in the 90s good enough for the time? Fans seem divided on the issue. For some, this revelation is not that big of a deal. One user wrote, “Nobody was upset about this watching this as kids.” Another added sarcastically, “Cause 3 y/o me is so mad rn.”</p><p>One X user called out the show for making the Black Power Ranger “pop-lock before every punch/kick.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But in the wake of the roadmap’s release, Diablo 4’s community has expressed concern about 2025, and questioned whether there’s enough new content to keep them coming back.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/09/d4-roadmap-r7-fp01-1-1743949275184-1744209873506.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oh boy! Can't wait for new Helltide color and temporary powers,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1juiw91/the_roadmap_was_just_announced/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Inangelion</a>. “It's gonna be so dope!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a sentiment shared by a number of hardcore Diablo 4 players who were hoping for more excitement around upcoming content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A new season in other ARPGs is like ‘let's put in a little housing system where you build up a home base with vendors that give you more gear’ or ‘let's put in a whole shipping system where traders from other lands bring materials that let you upgrade your items in ways that change your class mechanic entirely,’ “ added feldoneq2wire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A new season in D4 is ‘what color are we making helltides this time?’ And ‘what powers and reputation skins are we whipping up this time?’ “</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not a Diablo 4 hater, I love the game, but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of meat on the bone here which is a bit disappointing,” said Fragrantbutte.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“ ‘And more’ is doing a lot of heavy lifting here,” added artyfowl444.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The debate online got to the point where Diablo community manager Lyricana_Nightrayne <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1juiw91/comment/mm3yj10/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stepped into the main thread on the Diablo 4 subreddit to address the complaints</a>: “We added fewer details to the later parts of the roadmap to accommodate for things the team is still working on,” they insisted. “This isn't all that's coming in 2025 :)”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of the issue is Blizzard’s one-shot approach to seasonal content for Diablo 4. Some like that the experience resets somewhat each season, whereas others have complained that it makes engaging too deeply in each new season pointless. Where some say if all seasonal content remained constant Diablo 4 would become overwhelming, others say they’re thinking of ditching the game and not coming back until 2026 when more meaningful content comes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mike Ybarra, former president of Blizzard Entertainment and corporate boss at its parent company, Microsoft, waded into the debate in a post on <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1909926972106342845" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/ Twitter</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Don't ship to check a box,” Ybarra said. “Season's need to get off the cycle of shipping, spending two months to fix issues, then repeating. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Pause and give the team time to really address the end-game issues. Playing for a week to then one or three shot a ‘uber’ boss 500 times for a unique, then quitting until next season is fundamentally not fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Expansions schedule is too long - should be yearly. Reduce ‘story’ investment (costs so much for one time element in a ARPG) and focus on new classes, new mob types, new end-game activities that last more than a few days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If the cycle continues to just ship w/o fixing the fundamental issues, then I'm not sure where Diablo is going. You can add all the end-game activities you want, but you'll be running in place with the same issues. At some point there's just so many random things, it's not worth the effort.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The comments on Diablo 4’s expansions have to do with the delay to expansion two, which was once due out in 2025 but will now launch in 2026. Blizzard’s initial plan for Diablo 4 was to release an expansion every year, and while expansion one, Vessel of Hatred, launched in 2024, expansion two will skip 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our interview, Gibson discussed the reality of continuing to develop Diablo 4 as a live service game with free seasonal content as well as a big paid-for expansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I definitely feel like gamers are more hungry than they've ever been,” Gibson said. “And even if you delivered on their appetite today, that appetite will shift tomorrow. And so you just have to be in a really good spot to adapt to that situation. Because a lot of times too, what's important this month is going to be completely different three months from now. The priority of things can shift very, very quickly based on another game release or the state of your own game. Or maybe we've discovered something really cool and we want to be able to get it in there to change the formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And so it is definitely a new way of developing. It is definitely high interaction with the community. The interesting thing about Diablo is that we have a lot of different community types, right? We have our casual players, we have our hardcore players. They all fall into subdivisions of types of players inside of that. And so what we look to do is season upon season, look at the things that are important to some of those groups and go after them with focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you take a look at something like what we're doing in Season 8, we know we have a ton of boss lair feedback and so we're adding in the quality of life improvements for those players where that is a big focus of their gameplay type, or we might shift to nightmare dungeons when we're in Season 9. And so it's an opportunity for us to address different groups at different times, leading to an expansion where we're going to be addressing everybody all at once with something big.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo 4 Season 8 launches later in April, with Season 9 currently due out in the summer, and Season 10 later in the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gets-first-gameplay-video-and-info/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 would be featured in a Direct-style presentation immediately following the Xbox Summer Showcase slated for June 8. However, fans of the game were also treated to a surprise: IGN published the first gameplay video, and more coverage can be expected throughout April as part of IGN First.</p>
<p>The footage sees the player character infiltrating an N-Ray facility with the help of a slightly crazed cultist companion. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-gameplay-the-outer-worlds-2-ign-first" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to IGN</a>, the game features a full-fledged stealth system. Enemies can detect bodies and alert fellow guards, though players obviously have ways to prevent that from happening, including a skill that can disintegrate bodies as soon as they drop.</p>
<p>There are also more effective melee weapons and abilities to perform silent takedowns. Moreover, Obsidian introduced an easy way for players to gauge how much they're going to take out of the enemy's health with a stealth attack, so that they can assess whether a one-hit kill is even possible in the first place.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2: 11 Minutes of Exclusive Gameplay – IGN First" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LhDvnM3wBaQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>New gadgets are being used to spruce up the gameplay variety. In this mission, the N-Ray Scanner allows the player character to spot otherwise invisible cultists. Gunplay also seems improved in The Outer Worlds 2 compared to the first installment, with the developers claiming to have taken inspiration from Bungie's Destiny in that regard.</p>
<p>Movement was also fine-tuned to allow for greater agility, not to mention the addition of a sprint-slide move while aiming down sights. The Bullet-Time-like Tactical Time Dilation returns, and in the footage, we can see the main character tossing a grenade, activating Tactical Time Dilation, and shooting the grenade to have it explode on multiple enemies.</p>
<p>IGN also said that Obsidian mentioned having Fallout: New Vegas as the main inspiration for this sequel. The footage does hint at some of that when, all of a sudden, the player takes down a non-hostile character that had actually provided them with help (and could have been saved if provided with a trauma kit). It looks like there will be a lot of choices and consequences.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is scheduled to launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

Meanwhile, many people will likely be excited to see <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> be added to PS Plus Extra and Premium’s game catalog. Personally, I’m more excited about <em>War of the Monsters</em> coming to PS5 and PS4 later this month. I played the OG PS2 version a lot, and Sony says this port of the monster brawler will include a Platinum Trophy. Perhaps all that time spent playing it back in the day will come in handy. </p><p> Remember, to access, download, and play these games you’ll need to be an active PS Plus Extra or Premium tier subscriber.

<p>Don’t get your hopes up for Titanfall 3 just yet. After a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/titanfall-3-is-almost-complete-says-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak came out suggesting</a> that Titanfall 3 is “almost complete” along with a number of planned features, one prominent journalist has publicly reported that none of the leaked information is accurate.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XsBHGnG9LQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Breaking News</a>, Jeff Grubb shot down the claims by Apex Legends leaker Osvaldatore. </p>



<p>“This isn’t real,” Grubb said. “I’m sorry. It’s not real.”</p>



<p>Grubb then went on to talk about Respawn having a small team that is “probably messing around with games that have titans in them”.</p>



<p>“Does he ( Titanfall 1 director Steve Fukuda) have something like a prototype that has titans in it? I would guess so,” Grubb added. “I don’t know for sure, but I would certainly assume that that is a safe thing to think.</p>



<p>“Now, is that going to get announced in 2025 and released in 2026? No way.”</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-2025">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase Announced For June 8, 2025</a></h6>



<p>He then touched on the fact that EA has been on a trend of canceling various games at Respawn. Those cancellations include Titanfall Legends which was a “previous version of Titanfall 3”.</p>



<p>“Do not expect an Unreal Engine 5, single player campaign Titanfall 3 with a full multiplayer suite,” Grubb said while saying he hated being the one to rain on the parade. “I’m not sure where this is coming from…don’t get your hopes up for Titanfall anytime soon.”</p>



<p>Do you think EA and Respawn will ever release a Titanfall 3? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1835/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

originally debuted in March 2017. The PS4 and PS5 consoles also didn't arrive in China at launch either, nor did the newest Xbox systems. "Part of that is approvals / regulations, part of that is finding a suitable partner, part of that is demand," Ahmad said.</p><p>Companies not based in China need to have a Chinese partner for product releases. For the original Switch, Nintendo partnered with Chinese internet behemoth Tencent. For Sony, it partnered with Shanghai Oriental Pearl to bring PlayStation consoles to China. Microsoft, meanwhile, made a deal with BesTV to bring Xbox consoles to China.</p><p>The Switch 2 is set for release in the US and other markets on June 5. Nintendo announced a $450 price point for the console, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">some expect a price hike due to the impact of tariffs</a>.

The company said it was taking time to "assess" the impact of the tariffs.</p>

                <p>After launching in 2023 as a Switch exclusive, Disney Illusion Island is now coming to PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC on May 30. The port has been rebranded to <a href="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends</a>, and it now comes bundled with two previously released DLCs and a new DLC featuring Scrooge McDuck. Preorders are available now, and despite all the included DLC, it's available for $30--that's <strong>$10 cheaper than the base game launched for on Switch</strong>. That makes this an excellent time to dive in and explore everything this family-friendly metroidvania has to offer.</p><h2>Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey and Friends Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4473382-f6dc9c3e-f5a7-4697-8274-34968edf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473382" data-ratio="0.56264066016504" data-width="1333" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4473382-f6dc9c3e-f5a7-4697-8274-34968edf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473382"></a><figcaption>Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4473382-f6dc9c3e-f5a7-4697-8274-34968edf.jpg"></figure><p>Physical editions of the game come with an exclusive poster, though it’s only available while supplies last. This isn’t listed as a preorder bonus, but since inventory is limited, reserving a copy of the game is the best way to grab one before it disappears. The poster appears to be a universal bonus available at most retailers. We've verified it's bundled with purchases at Best Buy and GameStop, though double-check the listing if you're purchasing from other vendors.</p><div title="6530722 - Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3358" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6530722 - Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17442104080764?u1=subid_value\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value ">Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends Standard Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17442104080764?u1=subid_value\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value ">$30 | Releases May 30</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This is the only version of the game up for preorder. Along with the base game and its three DLCs (Keeper Up, Mystery in Motion, and CASH featuring Scrooge McDuck), you’ll get the aforementioned poster while supplies last. Since this is $10 cheaper than the Switch version and it's loaded with DLC, it’s an easy recommendation for anyone looking to get started with the platformer. Physical copies of the game can be purchased at GameStop and Best Buy. PC players can also find it on Steam and GOG.</p><p>Expect more retailers to open preorders in the coming weeks.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you’re a Switch owner yet to play the platformer, you’ll find it available for $40 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-4-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09Z16XWH8?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/lrh6h7romg0ql?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442102223806?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>. That makes the upcoming edition on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC a much better option, as it’s cheaper yet bundled with additional goodies.</p><p>Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey and Friends is a cooperative platformer where you play as iconic characters like Mickey, Donald Duck, and Goofy, who find themselves on the strange island of Monoth and are tasked with recovering three unique Tomes that protect the island. Along the way, the team will unlock a variety of new abilities and discover a cast of colorful characters, making it a fun choice for both Disney fans and metroidvania enthusiasts.</p><p>Our original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disney-illusion-island-review/1900-6418094/" data-ref-id="1900-6418094">Disney Illusion Island review</a> gave the game a solid 7/10, noting its incredible visuals and simple controls that result in smooth gameplay. There’s also a heap of collectibles to discover that offer a fun twist to the usual exploration loop.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-is-first-switch-2-game-you-can-preorder-in-the-us/1100-6530662/">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Is First Switch 2 Game You Can Preorder In The US</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-lego-set-gets-rare-discount-snag-the-ornithopter-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6530648/">Dune Lego Set Gets Rare Discount - Snag The Ornithopter For Its Best Price Yet</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-console-bundle-deals-still-available-at-amazon/1100-6529417/">Astro Bot PS5 Console Bundle Deals Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-movie-steelbook-and-exclusive-crafting-table-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6530625/">Minecraft Movie Steelbook And Exclusive Crafting Table Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Nintendo Switch 2 Preorders Delayed Due To Tariffs, Release Date Still June 5</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-here-are-your-options/1100-6530578/">MicroSD Express Cards For Nintendo Switch 2 - Here Are Your Options</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-four-mario-kart-lego-sets-for-the-best-prices-yet-at-amazon/1100-6528603/">Grab Four Mario Kart Lego Sets For The Best Prices Yet At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-fans-can-preorder-shadow-labyrinth-secret-edition-for-only-60/1100-6528469/">Pac-Man Fans Can Preorder Shadow Labyrinth Secret Edition For Only $60</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Not only are the typical struggles of game development a day-to-day challenge, but, like many, Bloober had to learn about the realities of making games remotely in the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally the country is nervously watching developments over the border in neighboring Ukraine, where Russia's invasion sparks concerns over a broader response </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/poland-nato-rutte-russia-ukraine-49fa0ce0763926f3c57f6783457ec0e6">that could draw in NATO.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> With game development cycles for games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos: The New Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> running about 5 years, the decisions Babieno makes have huge ripple effects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Russia's invasion seems to be top of mind for Babieno, who explained that Bloober employs developers who hail from Russia and Ukraine—both of whom had to relocate given the circumstances of the war. The studio was also one of the first to publicly halt sales of its games in Russia—not out of spite for the Russian people, Babieno said, but because the company did not want to contribute tax revenue to the government's coffers which could drive spending on its invasion.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-microsoft-ea-and-others-unite-to-make-accessibility-messaging-a-priority" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo, Microsoft, EA and others unite to make accessibility messaging a priority</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Games should connect us rather than make [barriers] between countries or between fans," he said.

Day-to-day, Babieno said he's grappling with the same things many developers at his company (and around the world) struggle with: self-imposed crunch. "I'm not a good example," he admitted, describing the feeling of wanting to work longer hours because of "passion" for a project. "We are trying to support our team as much as we can and sometimes will increase the time of development if needed to create a good game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bloober apparently also connects employees with psychologists in and around the company to access mental health support (and considering their games are about psychological horror, perhaps some consulting on the topic), but Babieno said regular messaging about "having your own life" is the "first" step in creating that environment.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-games-boss-says-the-streamer-must-seek-to-cause-disruption-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Netflix Games boss says the streamer must strive to cause 'disruption'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the topic of depicting mental health in games—we've heard from developers over the years that sometimes researching real-world injuries, be they </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/id-have-these-extremely-graphic-dreams-what-its-like-t-1834611691">physical</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or mental, can sometimes have a psychological shock of its own. Babieno said he hasn't seen that happen at Bloober, in part because the studio is deliberate about what topics it tackles. "When we are creating a new title, there's always the question of 'what would we like to add to the conversation,'" he said, adding that these topics are meant to encourage "judgment-free" debate on the team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's the "planning" stage that Babieno seemed to circle back to in our conversation. If you want to better understand the company releasing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos: The New Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2025, you need to go all the way back... to 2019.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cronos"><span>Cronos</span> shows the strategic scaling of Bloober's headcount</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Track the arc of Bloober's lineup from 2015 all the way through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and you'll see a fairly steady increase in game scope going from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Layers of Fear</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Observer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, past </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Medium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and all the way through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This was deliberate, said Babieno, and followed a strategic decision in 2015 to commit to horror games. When the company had fewer employees, it focused in on narrative experiences buoyed by environmental storytelling, and scaled up to include more action and player navigation, now seen in the combat-heavy </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because of this, it was a natural step to increase the team and increase the scope of our games," he said, noting that the studio has picked up "more fans" because of this. He echoed a common refrain you hear from indie and triple-A studios, that the company is in business to make high-quality games, not just turn a profit. It does seem the company communicates to its workers that they have to make solid decisions as early as possible, because when they do, they're locking into a long commitment they can't easily get out of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When we are talking about what will be next, it has to be something we would like to work on for the next five years...to spend a big part of our life to create something unusual."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those kinds of impactful decisions can include something as fundamental as setting. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the second game from Bloober set in the studio's native Poland, a decision that doesn't seem so unusual in 2025 but Babienbo said in the beginning, it was a really risky call when trying to make a game that appeals to a global audience. "That was the conversation in the Polish game industry," he recalled. "That we shouldn't make games in Poland because it might not sell as well as if you made a game set in the United States."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers in other regions might feel buoyed by Babieno's words, as he said the "act locally and think globally" approach has paid off. Developers at the studio have an opportunity to be "faithful" to their homeland but also embrace the "trust" of players that they'll be curious enough to embrace that faith and explore new kinds of horrors in a land they may never have visited.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He tossed out the idea that Bloober could make a game set in San Francisco (itself beset by the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.inman.com/2016/04/15/is-the-san-francisco-tech-boom-harming-business/">horrors of the tech industry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), but it would never be as good as one made by people living in the United States.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">None of what Babieno described in our conversation should be seen as easy or simple. It's common knowledge that in today's market, just making a good game isn't enough to sustain a business, and you can put "we don't crunch" in your company values all you want, but you might look up one day and realize your whole team has worked until 9PM out of love for the game. Taking on the mantle of leadership is about setting yourself up to make hard decisions. "If you would like to have advice, don't run a game studio because maybe it could kill you" Babieno joked.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Babieno—and Bloober—are still here, still alive and standing in the tough environment of 2025. Perhaps for however difficult the road has been, seeing his job as being about "protecting" his workers may be the kind of principle that could help other studios endure these difficult times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

			<p>A report from <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Nintendo-postpones-launch-of-Switch-2-in-China">Nikkei</a> reveals that Nintendo has decided to postpone the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-stepping-up-to-be-more-of-a-primary-platform-says-analyst/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in China. According to the report, this indefinite delay comes from Nintendo waiting to see what demand exists for the Switch 2 before its launch in China.</p>
<p>This is not unlike the original Nintendo Switch coming to China. Officially, the original Nintendo Switch arrived in China in 2019, two years after the console was available worldwide. Currently, the Nintendo Switch is sold in China through a collaboration with Tencent, who declined to comment to Nikkei when asked if they would also distribute the Nintendo Switch 2 in the region.</p>
<p>Nintendo's delay in bringing its new console to China isn't the biggest surprise, considering that last November, the company <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-to-close-switch-eshop-and-online-services-in-china-in-2026">confirmed</a> it would be shutting down online services, including the eShop, in China by 2026.</p>
<p>While some of the world's biggest games come from Chinese developers like Genshin Impact or the recent free-to-play success, Marvel Rivals, strict regulations around video games in the region still challenge releasing a game in China and finding success in the country.</p>
<p>Chief analyst at Gamma Data told Nikkei, "<em>The hurdles to success in China remain high. They need to improve the consumer experience while complying with government policies, and there is also the issue of whether they will be able to introduce major international software</em>."</p>
<p>Nikkei's report also adds that the console and the software released will need to go through approval processes from Chinese authorities, which could result in more restrictions on releasing the hardware and software.</p>
<p>Regarding the demand for the Nintendo Switch 2 in China, the report adds that retailers have been accepting pre-orders for the device, both in-store and online—pre-orders that will now presumably be canceled.</p>
<p>There's definitely some demand for Nintendo consoles and games in China, but the rollout of the Nintendo Switch and now the Switch 2 show just how precarious it is to get the console to the region in the first place.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-delayed-in-china-thanks-to-government-regulations-and-demand<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has reportedly postponed the Switch 2 in China, with stringent government restrictions and a continuing analysis of demand in the country being the main reasons for said delay.</p>

<p>According to Nikkei (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-wont-be-releasing-switch-2-in-china-yet-as-it-reportedly-analyses-demand/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Nintendo is looking into how much demand there would be among Chinese gamers for the Nintendo Switch 2 before deciding to release the console in the country.</p>

<p>Nikkei says that games and consoles in China are subject to exhaustive government inspections, with the Chinese government often imposing restrictions on said software and hardware based on what VGC calls its "intentions". As such, Nintendo may decide the headache of going through said inspections isn't worth the returns it would get by selling the Switch 2 in China.</p>

<p>It's possible, then, that the Switch 2 won't see an official release in China; it's a market largely dominated by mobile and PC games, so it may be that Nintendo decides the potential customer gain isn't worth the hoops it would have to jump through.</p>

<p>Additionally, Nintendo is in the process of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-eshop-online-closing-china-2026" rel="nofollow">closing down the Switch's online services and eShop</a> in China, with the shutdown scheduled for the end of March next year. Evidently, the company doesn't see a benefit to keeping the services online any longer than that, which is another indication that there's not a large audience for the Switch 2 in China.</p>




<p>In case you missed it, the Switch 2 was revealed in full during a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Direct show last week</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the world, the console is set for a June 5th release, a date Nintendo insists hasn't changed despite delays to pre-orders in both the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">US</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">Canada</a>. Whether or not it sees a release in China remains to be seen.</p>

            <p>Two Microsoft software engineers who interrupted a Microsoft anniversary event to protest against the company's dealings with the Israeli military have been fired for misconduct, according to a report. Software engineer Ibtihal Aboussad, who is based in Canada and once worked for the company's genAI division, lost her job on Monday 7th April due to "wilful misconduct, disobedience or wilful neglect of duty," according to internal documents picked up by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/07/microsoft-fires-engineers-who-protested-during-anniversary-celebration.html">CNBC</a>. Another Microsoft software engineer, Vaniya Agrawal, had announced that she would resign on April 11th, but according to another document cited by CNBC, Microsoft have terminated her job in advance.</p><!--more-->
<p>Microsoft's business dealings with Israel's defence establishment have been in the spotlight recently thanks to investigations by the Guardian, +972 Magazine, Local Call, Drop Site News and the Associated Press. In a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-ai-technology-737bc17af7b03e98c29cec4e15d0f108">lengthy and very disturbing article from February</a>, the AP claim that the Israeli military's use of Microsoft computing services and OpenAI technologies has "skyrocketed" to "nearly 200 times higher" since the surprise attack on Israel by Hamas and other Palestinian militants on 7th October 2023.</p>
<p>The AP report is based upon interviews with current and former members of Microsoft and the Israeli armed forces, together with internal company data and documents. It claims that the Israeli military have used "AI-enabled systems" for intelligence operations during Israel's subsequent invasion and bombardment of Gaza, which has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people. It also discusses the use of genAI transcription software and Microsoft Azure for mass surveillance. There's a lot more in the full piece, which doesn't begin and end with Microsoft's alleged involvement: the AP also discuss the Israeli military's relationship with other big tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Palantir, Cisco and Oracle.</p>
<p>Prior to Aboussad and Agrawal's intervention, many Microsoft employees have spoken out against their employer's reported involvement with Israel's armed forces. Back in May 2024, Microsoft workers <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">launched a petition</a> calling on the company to disclose all ties with the Israel Defense Forces, submit to an independent audit for potential human rights violations, protect employees speaking up for Palestinians, and overall "end Microsoft's complicity in Israeli genocide and apartheid by terminating all Azure contracts and partnerships with the Israeli military and government". The signatories are also pushing Microsoft to make a formal call for a ceasefire. "The products and services we build are being used and distributed around the globe to surveil, censor, and destroy," the organisers write. "We cannot stand by while our labor is utilized to aid in the oppression of innocent people."</p>
<p>Aboussad and Agrawal both took action on Friday 4th April at separate events organised to celebrate Microsoft's 50 year anniversary.  As reported by CNBC, Aboussad approached the stage during a speech from Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman in Redmond, Washington, calling him a "war profiteer" and declaring that "all of Microsoft has blood on its hands," before being escorted out. "Mustafa, shame on you," she said. "You claim that you care for using AI for good, but Microsoft sells AI weapons to the Israeli military. Fifty thousand people have died, and Microsoft powers this genocide in our region."</p>
<p>Aboussad subsequently spelled out her grievances in an email to Suleyman and Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella, finance chief Amy Hood, operating chief Carolina Dybeck Happe, and company president Brad Smith. "I spoke up today because after learning that my org was powering the genocide of my people in Palestine, I saw no other moral choice," she wrote. "This is especially true when I've witnessed how Microsoft has tried to quell and suppress any dissent from my coworkers who tried to raise this issue." This last part may be a reference to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/microsoft-workers-fired-gaza-vigil">Microsoft's firing last year of Abdo Mohamed and Hossam Nasr</a> after they held a vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza.</p>
<p>In further correspondence cited by CNBC, a Microsoft contact then told Aboussad that her email to executives served as "an admission that you deliberately and willfully engaged in your earlier misconduct", adding that she could have aired her grievances "confidentially with your manager, or with Global Employee Relations. Instead, you chose to intentionally disrupt the speech of Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman." The message to Aboussad concludes "that your misconduct was designed to gain notoriety and cause maximum disruption to this highly anticipated event", and that "immediate cessation of your employment is the only appropriate response."</p>
<p>As for Agrawal, she interrupted a speech by Nadella at another event, and sent a similar email to executives afterwards. "You may have seen me stand up earlier today to call out Satya during his speech at the Microsoft 50th anniversary," Agrawal writes in the email, as reported by CNBC. "Over the past 1.5 years, I've grown more aware of Microsoft's growing role in the military-industrial complex." Agrawal further argued that Microsoft are "complicit" in the bloodshed as a "digital weapons manufacturer that powers surveillance, apartheid, and genocide", and that "by working for this company, we are all complicit."</p>
<p>Microsoft have yet to say anything about all this publicly save for the following statement to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/microsoft-fires-employees-protesting-israeli-militarys-use-of-companys-ai-tech/">PCGamer</a>: "We provide many avenues for all voices to be heard. Importantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption. If that happens, we ask participants to relocate." The company have also yet to comment on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">last week's news</a> that the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement have made Microsoft a "priority target", and are <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft">calling on supporters</a> to avoid Microsoft and Xbox gaming services and products.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was released on March 20 to a reception that nobody expected. It was lauded in the press, and the reviews were pretty stellar on a universal scale, and then the game went on to sell millions of copies. That performance and the ultimate delivery of the game have led many to believe that it’s a turning point for the series.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been a single month since Assassin’s Creed Shadows hit the market, and it’s already winning awards… <strong><em>Kind of</em></strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-voice-of-the-players">Voice of the Players</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the winner of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/01/players-choice-vote-for-march-2025s-best-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation’s Players’ Choice for March</a>. It was voted the best game of the month based on the results of a poll on the PlayStation Blog, which is about as official as it gets. </p>



<p>Admittedly, the competition wasn’t all that strong in March, except the smash hit Hazelight game, Split Fiction.</p>



<p>I think that Assassin’s Creed Shadows <strong>will </strong>go on to win some prestigious awards this year, as what Ubisoft produced was one of the best games we’ve seen in the series for many years. That’s a sentiment that I echoed in my in-depth review of the game.</p>



<p>Last night, I was fortunate enough to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-lead-actress-shrine-destruction-hurt-heart/">catch up with Masumi</a> (Naoe) at the BAFTA Games Awards, learning more about her role in Assassin’s Creed Shadows and what she thought about the more controversial elements of the game.</p>



<p>It’s not the end of the road for AC Shadows, of course. There is DLC in the pipeline, and Ubisoft is hard at work producing patches to add more quality-of-life improvements, including a recent one that I was desperate for.</p>

<p>Completing the Return to Verdansk event requires players to open safes in every area of the map. With that in mind, here are all the safe locations in Prison. </p>



<p>The Return to Verdansk event started on April 3 and runs through April 15. Unlike other events in Black Ops 6 that could be completed in multiplayer or battle royale matches, this one can only be completed in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-player-count-off-charts-as-verdansk-exceeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a> on Verdansk.</p>



<p>Your loadout weapons will make completing this event easier, as they are much better than what you find from ground loot. So, check out which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loadouts are the best in Season 3</a>, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cr-56-amax-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CR-56 AMAX</a>, before starting this challenge.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-warzone-verdansk-safe-location-in-prison">Every Warzone Verdansk Safe Location in Prison </h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-warzone-verdansk-map-return-intel-drop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Return to Verdank event</a>, the objective is to open one safe in each of <span>Verd</span>ansk’s<strong>&nbsp;12 zones</strong>. In the Prison zone, there are nine safes. Despite the POI being nestled in the bottom right corner of the map, Prison is a hot drop, and it will be challenging to open a safe without facing some opposition.</p>



<p>The image below shows where all of the safes are. After opening one, you can move on to the next zone. However, even after opening one, there is still an incentive to open more because each safe has a chance of unlocking <span>Caine’s rare&nbsp;<strong>Trail Blazer operator skin</strong></span>. </p>

<h2 id="h-warzone-return-to-verdansk-rewards">Warzone Return to Verdansk Rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Kali Sticks always wreak havoc in Warzone. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Each Zone has a different reward in the Return to Verdansk event. To unlock the <strong>Kali Sticks</strong>, you must&nbsp;<strong>acquire all 12 zone rewards</strong>. </p>



<p>Superstore, Prison, Stadium, and Hospital will be the most challenging zones to open a safe in because those POIs always attract a lot of players when a match first starts. In addition, it will take at least a few matches to complete this event, as the closing circle limits how many zones you can reach in one match. </p>



<p>And even when other players have completed every zone, safes will always be hotly contested throughout the event because everyone wants the rare operator skin. </p>



<p>Here are all 12 zones and rewards. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Zone </th><th>Reward </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dam </td><td>“Let’s Plan Something!” <strong>Loading Screen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Miltary Base </td><td>“Jarvdinsk Spomenik” <strong>Emblem </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Quarry </td><td>“Lumberjack Legends” <strong>Calling Card </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Storage Town </td><td>“Deathly Chill Return” <strong>Weapon Decal </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Superstore </td><td>“With Fries, Please” <strong>Weapon Charm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Stadium </td><td>“Breaking News” <strong>Calling Card </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Train Station </td><td>“The Back Adjustment” <strong>Finishing Move </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hospital </td><td>“Love 4 Tha Game” <strong>Spray </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Downtown </td><td>“Cheering the Squad” <strong>Emote </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hills </td><td>Double XP Token (45 minutes)</td></tr><tr><td>Port </td><td>“Shipping to Verdansk”<strong> Sticker </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Prison </td><td>“Wheel of Glory” <strong>Calling Card </strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>That’s everything you need to know about opening safes on Prison for the Return to Verdansk event. With that out of the way, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-warzone-april-7-patch-notes-buy-stations-receive-major-update-attachments-suddenly-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> fans have much to look forward to. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-2-3-rated-in-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD MW2 and MW3</a> were reportedly rated in Australia, hinting at potential remasters.

                <p>A report recently emerged claiming to have new details on Titanfall 3, but there is more to the story.</p><p>Reporter Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb said on GameBreaking News today that people might want to temper their expectations for a new Titanfall game. As we've known for some time, there is a "skunkworks" team inside Titanfall studio Respawn now working on a new project. And it is true that this team is tinkering with gameplay elements involving titans, Grubb said.</p><p>However, any such project that could theoretically emerge from this skunkworks unit would likely be years away, Grubb added. There is also a possibility that whatever is being made by this team doesn't make it to release. That would be normal part of the creative process, after all.</p><p>"Don't get your hopes up for Titanfall anytime soon," Grubb said.</p><p>The Titanfall 3 rumor said the game was "almost complete" and would have single-player and multiplayer elements. For now, Grubb said he's confident in saying there would definitely be no announcement of the Respawn skunkworks project in 2025, and no release is planned for 2026 either.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INbzQN3gXkA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/INbzQN3gXkA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In 2023, we learned that Respawn veteran Steve Fukuda was in charge of the skunkworks team working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/titanfall-director-making-something-new-but-its-not-more-titanfall/1100-6513762/" data-ref-id="1100-6513762">"something new."</a> Just what this game actually is, however, has never come to light.</p><p>Titanfall fans have been waiting years for a potential sequel to Titanfall 2. It was previously reported that EA canceled a game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/canceled-apex-legends-game-wasnt-titanfall-3-but-would-have-featured-everyones-favorite-titan/1100-6511126/" data-ref-id="1100-6511126">"Titanfall Legends,"</a> that would have blended elements of Apex Legends and Titanfall.</p><p>2014's Titanfall was Respawn's first release after Vince Zampella, Jason West, and numerous other Infinity Ward developers left to start a new company. The game was a success and spawned a sequel, Titanfall 2 (2016), but that would prove to be the final entry in the main series before Respawn shifted focus to its battle royale game, Apex Legends. Since then, fans have called on Respawn to return to the Titanfall series with a bonafide new entry--but as of yet, nothing has materialized. Apex Legends and Titanfall are connected, and some elements of Titanfall have surfaced in Apex Legends before.</p><p>As for what Respawn is developing, we know the studio is working alongside Bit Reactor on a Star Wars turn-based game--it will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawns-star-wars-strategy-game-will-be-revealed-in-april/1100-6530159/" data-ref-id="1100-6530159">officially unveiled on April 19.</a> The EA-owned studio is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-to-develop-final-game-in-star-wars-jedi-trilogy-says-ea/1100-6526559/" data-ref-id="1100-6526559">expected to be working on the next Star Wars Jedi game</a>. Its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawns-star-wars-fps-game-canceled-report/1100-6521461/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter/" data-ref-id="1100-6521461">unannounced Star Wars FPS was canceled in 2024. </a></p>
