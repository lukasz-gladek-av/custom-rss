            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 has revealed its roadmap for 2026 ahead of its release and hints at some new free and paid DLC.</p>



<p>If you enjoy cozy games, PowerWash Simulator is a familiar name to all. The simple maintenance simulator took the world by storm in 2022, getting everyone to do something many hate doing: cleaning. With its huge popularity, the game teamed up with iconic IPs like Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2024-every-game-shown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shrek</a>. A sequel was announced earlier this year, with a release date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed just this month</a>. Now, with its release in a few hours, Futurlabs has shown off its planned roadmap for 2026, as well as how it’ll spend 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-powerwash-simulator-planning-three-major-paid-free-dlc-in-2026-teases-crossovers">PowerWash Simulator Planning Three Major Paid + Free DLC in 2026, Teases Crossovers</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We have our PowerWash Simulator 2 Roadmap to share with you all 💦</p><p>Coming in 2025/2026 ⤵️</p><p>– 3 Paid IP DLC<br>– 3 Free Caldera Chronicles Jobs<br>– A bucket full of other planned additions</p><p>For the rest of 2025 we’re focusing on fixes, further optimisations and QOL improvements! <a href="https://t.co/eUOk2bfEzP">pic.twitter.com/eUOk2bfEzP</a></p></div>— PowerWash Simulator (@PowerWashSim) <a href="https://twitter.com/PowerWashSim/status/1980972487199379614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post from PowerWash Simulator’s <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1980972487199379614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Twitter/X account</a>, the roadmap for 2026 is now available. As shown above, the team plans to have new paid and free DLC every quarter, starting with Q1. No specifics were given for what to expect, but the free DLC, called the Caldera Chronicles, will likely be similar to the original’s Muckingham Files. As for the paid DLC, it’ll be based on other IPs, so we may see some zany crossovers like last time. </p>



<p>Additionally, updates to the game, including community events and costumes, will be added over time. No DLC or new content is coming out in 2025, as the team plans to focus on QoL and optimization fixes. Reviews for PowerWash Simulator 2 came out today, and, for many, it maintains the charm and fun the original did. Given how much of a sleeper hit it was, its sequel may just give it the attention it deserves. Plus, with a Day One release on Xbox Game Pass, it’s sure to keep many of us company (and make us clean freaks again).</p>



<p>Are you excited for PowerWash Simulator 2? What do you hope becomes DLC? Did you enjoy the original? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>Sonic Rumble is making its way to PC and mobile devices in early November.</p>



<p>The party royale game, which capitalizes on Fall Guys’ success, has been in development for quite some time. Gameplay consists of players choosing their favorite Sonic characters and duking it out with others in fun and interesting mini-games. Despite positive feedback from early playtests, Sonic Rumble was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-delayed-yet-again-by-sega/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met with multiple delays</a>. Earlier this month, however, it was announced that the game would release in November. Now, we finally have the official release date, as well as a cool new trailer to debut it.</p>



<h2 id="h-sonic-rumble-sets-november-5th-2025-release-date">Sonic Rumble Sets November 5th, 2025 Release Date</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/ZSF2uZ7W5Ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a short YouTube video</a>, SEGA and Sonic Team officially reveal the release date for Sonic Rumble: <strong>November 5th</strong>. The game will launch on Steam, Google Play, and the Apple App Store, with pre-registration available now. Currently, there are no announced plans to bring the game to consoles like Nintendo Switch 2. Regardless, given its successful playtests, it may very well happen. Plus, given the popularity of similar titles like Fall Guys and the Sonic brand, it’ll likely gain some attention.</p>



<p>The last update for Sonic Rumble <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-pc-mobile-launch-november-2025/">provided some insight</a> as to what the full release will look and play like. With the playtests, the development team took the feedback from fans and fine-tuned many elements. For example, the progression and rewards system is now more streamlined, as well as an overhaul of the game’s user interface and onboarding. In addition, many new features like skills and joinable Crews with friends add more to the competitive side of the title. While it has taken a while for it to arrive, Sonic Rumble will finally see the light of day, and it won’t be long until we get to see how it goes.</p>

    <p><span>Bandai Namco following an "announce and release what's ready quickly" approach.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>A <em><a title="Series > Tales of [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/tales-of">Tales of</a> Xillia 2</em> remaster is underway, and the announcement of the next remastered <em>Tales of</em> game is expected relatively soon, series producer Yusuke Tomizawa said in the latest issue of Weekly Famitsu. <span id="more-1001196"></span></p><p>“We’ve formed teams with several partner development companies, and including projects from the verification stage to the late development stage, there are more than two titles in progress,” Tomizawa said in an interview celebrating the upcoming release of <em><a title="Games > Tales of Xillia Remastered [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tales-of-xillia-remastered">Tales of Xillia Remastered</a></em>. “The pace of releases depends on the planning and development status—it could speed up or slow down. But even so, we’re hoping to deliver the fans as many titles as possible, as quickly as possible.”</p><p>Asked if that means the next remastered project will be announced soon, Tomizawa said, “I’m unfortunately unable to provide specifics about the next title yet. But the timing of the next remastered title announcement should be relatively soon… or at least, that’s the plan.”</p><p>As for a remastered <em>Tales of Xillia 2</em>, Tomizawa said, “As mentioned earlier, we’re following an ‘announce and release what’s ready quickly’ approach. In that vein, <em>Xillia 2</em> is still in progress, which is why it hasn’t been announced. We will do our best to deliver updates as quickly as possible.”</p><p>While there has not been a brand-new entry in the <em>Tales of</em> series since 2021’s <em><a title="Games > Tales of Arise [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tales-of-arise">Tales of Arise</a></em>, which received a post-game story expansion called “Beyond the Dawn” in 2023, Tomizawa said, “As the <em>Tales of</em> series development team—as we always have throughout the history of the series—we continue to think about and work on new titles. Any announcements regarding a new title will take some time, but alongside the remasters, we are also planning and considering initiatives such as real-life events, merchandise, and various other promotions. Following the 30th anniversary, through the 40th and 50th, we hope to continue creating opportunities for players and characters to experience and share stories in various forms.”</p><p><em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,657 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,134 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,857 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,599 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246670/Tales_of_Xillia_Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on October 31.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-ring-alarm-for-3-bedrooms-hits-a-new-record-low-amazon-dumps-stock-of-its-own-brand-2000638348</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Home security used to mean signing expensive contracts with professional monitoring companies, paying installation fees and dealing with clunky equipment bolted to your walls. Ring changed that equation entirely by putting professional-grade security into a DIY package that anyone can install in an afternoon: The Ring Alarm 14-piece kit gives you comprehensive <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4931/">coverage for a typical 2 to 4 bedroom home, and right now it’s down to just $198 on Amazon, slashed from its regular $329 price</a> (40% off). This is an all-time low for a complete system that would cost you thousands in installation fees and monthly contracts with traditional security companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4931/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What You Need for Full House Coverage</h2>
<p>This 14-piece system comes fully equipped with everything you’ll need to construct a strong security network all the way through your home. You <strong>get one base station, the system’s central brain, which connects all of your sensors</strong> and communicates through your smartphone via your home Wi-Fi network. Two keypads allow you to arm and disarm the system from two locations which is absolutely convenient where you have entries on different floors or want one on the bedroom for nighttime arming.</p>
<p>Eight contact sensors cover your doors and windows and they sense the exact moment the door or window gets opened. Two motion detectors provide extra security by detecting movement inside your home, catching burglars who would go around the entryways. You get a range extender so your signal gets through every corner of your home, even though your home has solid construction or your sensors are significantly far from the base station.</p>



<p>The contact sensor are simple but effective devices that mount in seconds using adhesive strips, avoiding any need for drilling or wiring. Each sensor has two parts: one attaches to the door or window frame, the other to the moving part. A magnetic connection keeps them talking to each other, and the moment that connection breaks because a door opens, the alarm triggers.</p>
<p>Motion detectors cover larger spaces like hallways, living rooms or basements: They use passive infrared technology to detect heat signatures from moving bodies, giving you interior protection even if someone manages to enter without triggering a contact sensor. The detection angle is wide enough to monitor an entire room from a corner mount, and they’re smart enough to distinguish between your pet cat and an actual person, reducing false alarms.</p>



<p>You get <strong>automatic cell phone notifications the second any sensor activates through the Ring app</strong>. You’ll be able to disarm and arm the system from your computer, view the status of the individual sensors, and view your security history to know definitively when doors opened or motion occurred. The app interface is intuitive and responsive, providing you total command anywhere you have cell reception.</p>
<p>It <strong>works seamlessly with Alexa</strong>&nbsp;so you are able to arm or disarm by issuing commands through any Echo device using your voice. Simple commands such as “Alexa, arm Ring Alarm in away mode” handle the whole procedure all by themselves. This <strong>voice integration becomes second nature soon</strong>&nbsp;whenever your grocery-stuffed hands are full or you are going to bed.</p>
<p>At $198 for complete coverage of a multi-bedroom home, this beats the economics of traditional security systems by a landslide.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jackery-1500w-power-station-is-going-for-peanuts-and-amazon-adds-2-free-solar-panels-on-top.1332271/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages, camping trips or simply wanting energy independence at home all share one common need: reliable portable power that doesn’t tie you to the grid. The Jackery Explorer 1000 solves this problem beautifully and right now Amazon is offering an incredible deal that changes the game entirely: The power station normally retails for $799 on its own, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4930/">Amazon has slashed it down to $699 and is throwing in two 100W solar panels completely free</a>. That <strong>bundle would typically cost you $1,299, meaning you’re saving a massive $600 on this package</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4930/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Is This Generation Station Different From Others?</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 represents a major upgrade from Jackery previous products: LiFePO4 battery chemistry on this item produces <strong>4,000 charge cycles and yet delivers 70% of original capacity</strong>&nbsp;or roughly 10 years of typical use. Compare this to previous lithium-ion products, which eventually start to fade even after 500 to 800 cycles, and you’ll understand why this style of battery chemistry is rapidly becoming the industry standard for heavy-duty portable power use. That long life translates to your purchase today still keeping your gear powered 10 years later.</p>
<p>The 1,070Wh capacity provides you with extensive runtime on multiple devices: You’ll be able to power a full-size refrigerator for approximately 10 hours, charge a laptop approximately 10 times or power a portable AC unit for several hours through a hot summer power outage. The <strong>unit supplies clean 1,500W of uninterruptible AC power continuously</strong> through three pure sine wave outlets, and <strong>3,000W of surge to power appliances</strong> and devices with high startup surges like power tools or air compressor appliances. Pure sine wave output is essential because it emulates the power you get from your household outlet, and it prevents the damage of computer equipment and new appliances.</p>



<p>The charge rate on this unit is absolutely stellar: Plug into any standard household outlet and you’ll be <strong>topped off 100% within the hou</strong>r thanks to the advanced ChargeShield 2.0 technology. That’s 7.5 times the charge rate of the original Explorer 1000 (v1) model and makes all the difference should you need to recharge rapidly between uses. Two 100W included solar panels recharge the unit 100% within 6 to 8 hours of favorable sunlight, giving you 100% fully off-grid power generation. These collapsible panels are compact and lightweight enough to bring along on any adventure and rugged enough to handle the elements.</p>
<p>Port selection keeps all your current charging demands met, thanks to <strong>three AC plugs, two 100W USB-C ports for fast laptop and tablet charging, one USB-A, and 12V auto port for accessories</strong>. That 100W USB-C outlet is strong enough to charge through a MacBook Pro full speed without the use of any of those big power adapters. You’ll be<strong> able to charge six gadgets all at once</strong>&nbsp;and this makes it ideal for camping excursions with the family or even as an emergency power hub.</p>



<p><strong>Weighing only 23.8 pounds</strong>, this power station remains light even though it packs a big punch. Its ergonomic handle ensures it can be conveniently moved from your automobile to your campsite or down the storm cellar. Its compact size won’t hog your valuable trunk space on long car rides or dominate your storage closet inside the house.</p>
<p>At $699 with two solar panels included, you’re getting emergency preparedness, camping power and energy independence for less than many standalone power stations cost without any solar capability.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-droideka-model-is-selling-for-pennies-star-wars-droid-figure-has-never-been-this-cheap-2000638337</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-droideka-model-is-selling-for-pennies-star-wars-droid-figure-has-never-been-this-cheap.1332250/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve ever watched Star Wars and found yourself mesmerized by those rolling, shield-generating battle droids that gave the Jedi such a hard time, you’re definitely not alone. The <strong>Droideka</strong> has always been one of the most visually striking droids in the entire saga with its menacing tripod stance and devastating firepower.</p>
<p>Now LEGO brings this iconic destroyer droid to life in a way that lets you display it proudly on your desk or shelf. And here’s the kicker: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4929/">this premium collectible is currently down to just $48 on Amazon, slashed from its original $64 price tag</a>. This is the first time this set has gone on sale since its release, and with a stellar 4.9 out of 5 star rating, it might run out of stock quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4929/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why should you pay attention to this Droideka?</h2>
<p>The LEGO Star Wars Droideka brings interactivity to your collection with <strong>movable arms that replicate the realistic shooting motion</strong> these droids are famous for in <em>The Phantom Menace </em>and<em> The Clone Wars</em>. You can pose it in full attack mode, arms extended and ready to unleash a barrage of blaster fire or you can fold it into its iconic ball configuration for that classic rolling transport mode.</p>



<p>The construction of the build itself is very rewarding for the adult constructor looking for something interesting but not intimidating. Articulation points are well-crafted and provide solid movement within the arm joints without the flimsiness or looseness. You are able to remove and reattach the legs easily which makes the wheel transformation seamless and natural.</p>
<p>Apart from the actual main Droideka model, the set comes with thoughtful additional pieces to make it go beyond just an ordinary build and become an actual display item. You receive your<strong> own exclusive stand</strong> along with an information plaque to provide context of the Droideka within Star Wars history. You also get a <strong>special Lego Star Wars 25th-anniversary brick</strong> to commemorate a quarter century of the popular sets. For good measure, the set even comes with your own buildable, but smaller, Droideka model to sit atop the display stand.</p>



<p>The color scheme remains true to the original with metallic and bronze shades that evoke the threatening demeanor of these war droids. They are proportioned just right too, the tapered shield generators and signature head shape instantly recognizable to any Star Wars buff. That attention to detail makes it ideal for display with your other Star Wars collectibles or even just as a display item that’ll spark conversations.</p>
<p>At this lower price, you are getting wonderful value for the upscale LEGO set designed specifically for adult fans. That original price of $64 was already quite reasonable for the number of pieces and quality of display, but at $48, this is the absolute bargain for any Star Wars fans.</p>

At the time, Miller said that the deal was meant to “expand our business capabilities and provide immersive content for our partners, advertisers and fans.” The deal <a href="https://kotaku.com/giant-bomb-gamespot-metacritic-fandom-layoffs-1850008228">also led to</a> multiple <a href="https://aftermath.site/fandom-gamespot-screen-junkies-layoffs-restructuring">rounds of layoffs</a> for the editorial staff at some of Fandom’s newly-acquired properties. During <a href="https://siliconvalleyjournals.com/fandom-cuts-11-of-workforce-affecting-gamespot-and-other-gaming-outlets/">an all-hands meeting last October</a>, Miller pointed to corporate restructuring and missed revenue targets as some of the causes of the layoffs.</p><p>While Fandom’s IP-specific wikis are popular, they have become widely known for being difficult to navigate due to a preponderance of aggressive ads that often make pages unstable to the point of being nearly unusable.

It's really quite interesting how, in a time where big budget live service games are doing anything they can to get you to continue playing (and importantly spend money on) them, the sort of spiritual opposite of this to rise out of this are games where you just hang out with a few buds doing silly nonsense that don't cost very much. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, Peak, you know the kinds of games I mean, and yesterday a new one I quite like the look of arrived: RV There Yet?
</p>
<p>
First of all, kudos on the naming there, developer Nuggets Entertainment, just an all timer of a pun. In RV There Yet?, you and a few other friends play as what I can only describe as "the kind of guy who thinks going on a camping trip with an RV out in the middle of nowhere is a good time." The concept is quite simple: your vacation is over, you're trying to drive home, but, uh oh, the route you took is closed, so you have to find another way back, and hijinks ensue!

<p>
That might mean doing the very dad core thing of getting out of the RV and pushing or pulling the air to suggest you need to reverse or move forward, replacing a tire, smoking a cigarette, using a pulley system to lift up your RV, fighting off a wolf, grilling frozen meat patties, putting on a cassette tape with some age inappropriate tunes. Dad core stuff! Not to mention the most important core feature, "hats."
</p><p>
It's possible that RV There Yet? ends up as another log in the friendslop fire, but I do find it interesting to see the ways that the core concept of "four friends goofing around" has been explored. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">Multiplayer</a> games typically don't appeal to me due to their frequently competitive nature, and while I don't have time for every single collaborative co-op game under the sun, it's nice to see online games opting for a different approach. Like Peak before it, RV There Yet? was a made during a game jam, once again showing you how limitations can often lead to some neat results.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beefed-up-twitchcon-security-couldn%E2%80%99t-stop-the-internet%E2%80%99s-issues-from-spilling-over-into-real-life.1332238/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TwitchCon, which took place last weekend in San Diego, California, is an overlapping series of cacaphonies. A quick stroll down the show floor reveals a hodgepodge of advertisers like State Farm, booths dedicated to high-profile games like <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>The Sims</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>, a tabletop section, a music stage Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has been known to perform on, and eventually, an esports arena. There are also panels in various rooms, as well as an artist alley like you’d find at Comic-Con or an anime convention. But these are all distractions. The real main event – the reason people spend hundreds of dollars to attend – is the streamers.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite all the aforementioned sights and sounds, one scene defined TwitchCon 2025. During a meet and greet on Friday, Emily “Emiru” Schunk was approached by a man who proceeded to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/twitch-faces-backlash-popular-streamer-emiru-says-was-assaulted-twitch-rcna238496" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grab ahold of her and attempted to forcibly kiss her</a>. Schunk’s personal security guard quickly intervened and pushed the assailant away, but after that he was reportedly allowed to roam free. Schunk, rattled, resumed her meet and greet, but the next day she declared that she’ll never return to TwitchCon.</p><p>“Thank you guys again, sorry you all had to see that,” she <a href="https://x.com/emiru/status/1979602519967060414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a>. “This is definitely my last TwitchCon, and it saddens me to say as a 10-year off and on attendee of TwitchCon. I think other creators should seriously consider not attending in the future. I did not feel cared for or protected, even bringing my own security and staff. I can't imagine how creators without those options would feel. … [The assailant] was allowed to walk away from my meet and greet, and I didn't hear he was caught until hours after he attacked me, and it felt like this only happened because of my manager pressing for it, not because TwitchCon staff present thought it was a big deal.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Saw so many women saying they weren’t going to be attending TwitchCon this year because they don’t feel safe, and then this happens to Emiru on day one <a href="https://t.co/Yazc5VBPWF">pic.twitter.com/Yazc5VBPWF</a></p>— shenAndygans (@Sh3nAndygans) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sh3nAndygans/status/1979416324842369034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Prior to TwitchCon, a slew of high-profile streamers including Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker, Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt, Rachell “Valkyrae” Hoffstetter, and QTCinderella <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/who-has-backed-out-of-twitchcon-2025-every-streamer-not-attending-3263201/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped out in advance of the event</a>, citing <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-gamergate-ghost-of-yotei-probablymonsters-fired" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the current political climate</a>. The latter two also pointed to instances of violence against female streamers in public – Hoffstetter and Schunk were both <a href="https://aftermath.site/valkyrae-cinna-emiru-attacked-amouranth-robbed-twitch-kick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attacked on stream</a> at the Santa Monica Pier earlier this year – and <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/asia/japan/airi-sato-death-tokyo-b2715019.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the March 2025 murder</a> of Japanese content creator Airi Sato.&nbsp;</p><p>One streamer to whom Aftermath spoke, <a href="https://x.com/DenimsTV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denims</a>, was planning to attend the show, but changed her mind a few days prior.</p><p>“To be honest, I just don’t feel like TwitchCon is what it used to be, both in terms of more general vibes, but also in the effort that Twitch puts in,” Denims told Aftermath. “After my experience last year, where I <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-israel-palestine-frogan-ban-h3h3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got banned for participating in a panel</a> that was supposedly preapproved by Twitch, I had concerns about diligence on behalf of Twitch staff. Seeing the laxity that allowed Emiru to get assaulted in such a terrifying way only confirmed to me that Twitch doesn't allocate enough resources to TwitchCon, and that the organizers are stretched thin enough that they don’t seem to even know what’s happening at their event. This is unsurprising to anyone that has been to a TwitchCon before, but in the face of the current political climate in the United States, I think the negligence is unacceptable.”&nbsp;</p><p>In response to streamers’ concerns leading up to this year’s event, Twitch promised “<a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2025/10/08/what-we-re-doing-to-keep-you-safe-at-twitchcon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">robust security measures</a>” including “screening procedures at all entry points and rigorous access control protocols,” a variety of security personnel including armed police officers, and a command center focused on monitoring and protecting the venue. This varied from prior events, which featured metal detectors and guards, but not quite so many. The command center also appeared to be new, especially in terms of how it was monitoring the event – pulling footage from hundreds of IRL streamers (almost certainly more than were present in previous years).&nbsp;</p><p>This year’s measures did not successfully deter Schunk’s assailant, however. Following the assault, Twitch published another statement:</p><p>“In line with existing TwitchCon security protocols, law enforcement and event security were on site and responded to the incident,” the company <a href="https://x.com/twitch/status/1979464697364779065?s=46&amp;t=L-Xht24CY5-UBFgAlG58bg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Twitter</a> the day after the attack. “We immediately blocked this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises, and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events. We are coordinating with the impacted creator’s team and, per our standard protocols, continue to cooperate with any law enforcement investigations. We have increased security at the Meet &amp; Greet attendee check-in point and will have additional security personnel surrounding participating streamers. … Twitch has zero tolerance for harassment or acts that inhibit the safety and security of our community.”</p><p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.usermag.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">User Mag</a>’s Taylor Lorenz, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy put things in slightly more personal terms, as <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tends to be his way for better or worse</a>.</p><p>“We’re looking very closely at everything that happened there, and I care deeply about Emi,” <a href="https://x.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979972799243649257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clancy said</a>. “She’s a friend of mine, and so I want to see how we can support her. This is just something we have to keep working on. I think everyone identifies our tools in terms of trust and safety as the leaders in the industry about helping creators, but that means there's always more work to be done, because that's the world we live in now."</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Twitch for additional information, but did not receive a reply as of this publishing.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of the weekend, a handful of other streamers came forward with <a href="https://x.com/RickyVT_/status/1980034157989552238" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stories</a> <a href="https://x.com/nightroseVT/status/1980709926998515866" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and</a> <a href="https://x.com/feinmadeit/status/1980110299421356179?s=46&amp;t=L-Xht24CY5-UBFgAlG58bg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clips</a> <a href="https://x.com/jade_infinite/status/1979574029196640360?s=46&amp;t=L-Xht24CY5-UBFgAlG58bg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of harassment</a> <a href="https://x.com/cuppycakiee/status/1980015232140657142?s=46&amp;t=L-Xht24CY5-UBFgAlG58bg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at and around TwitchCon</a>. In another case that caught the attention of the wider content creation community, a streamer named Emerome was <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/articles/emerome-forced-leave-twitchcon-n3on-005507783.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approached by N3on</a>, a notorious shit-stirring IRL streamer more frequently associated with Kick than Twitch, who invited her to a party entirely on the basis that she was “very beautiful” and then, when she sarcastically replied that she loves being objectified and walked away, started screaming that her friend was fat. It should be noted that N3on did not simply buy a ticket to TwitchCon and show up; Twitch featured him and <a href="https://www.twitchcon.com/archive/san-diego-2025/whos-coming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave him his own meet and greet</a>.</p><p>On another occasion, Jack Doherty – who, like N3on, loves to shove cameras in people’s faces and provoke them until they lash out, but who was <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/jack-doherty-banned-on-kick-after-crashing-his-mclaren-while-on-his-phone-2920078/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned from Kick</a> after crashing a McLaren while looking at his phone, then unbanned, and then <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/kick/jack-doherty-banned-from-kick-again-after-street-brawl-3035013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned again</a> a few days later for getting into a street fight – <a href="https://x.com/idiotpeach/status/1979855973272735820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repeatedly shouted the f-slur at a PeachJars</a>, a popular Twitch streamer, after she suggested, correctly, that Doherty is a homophobe.&nbsp;</p><p>Clips like these have led many in the Twitch community to decry both TwitchCon security and Twitch as a company and platform. Content creators like Hoyt, Ethan Klein, and John “Tectone” Robertson, <a href="https://aftermath.site/otk-asmongold-mizkif-twitch-youtube-sponsors-controversy-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">absolutely</a> <a href="https://spitfirenews.com/p/ethan-klein-lawsuits-kaceytron-frogan-denims" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of the problem</a>, used these incidents as an opportunity to <a href="https://x.com/Tectone/status/1979916191184347263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretend like</a> <a href="https://x.com/Asmongold/status/1979963336558080140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they care about women</a> – as well as safety or anything else beyond whatever drama of the day gets them views and allows them to go after perceived enemies – while Twitch mainstays like <a href="https://x.com/cohhcarnage/status/1979866669032845718?s=46&amp;t=L-Xht24CY5-UBFgAlG58bg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben “Cohh Carnage” Cassell</a> and <a href="https://x.com/DevinNash/status/1980034928042737902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devin Nash</a> have advocated for Twitch or a new platform like it to implement a strict games-only policy, to eliminate IRL streaming. There were also calls for Twitch to eliminate politics, even though the category is not really directly relevant to anything that happened at TwitchCon (Hoyt, again part of the problem, <a href="https://x.com/Asmongold/status/1980083165076000961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concurred with Cassell here</a>; hmmm, <a href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wonder why</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>But these are alluringly simple solutions to a host of complex problems, the kind that play well online but don’t really hold up under scrutiny. For one, the most viewed clips from TwitchCon are illustrative of two related but <em>different </em>problems: 1) Obvious security concerns around streamers’ physical safety, and 2) IRL streamers farming for salacious moments, a type of stream that doesn’t necessarily perform well on Twitch but does lead to engagement in the algorithmic short-form clip slurry that is YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. The latter is a gray area. The former is a can of worms so full-to-bursting that I’d recommend taking cover.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Secure, But Not Always Safe</strong></h2><p>Many have made the claim that there was no security at TwitchCon – that, for example, if Schunk’s assailant had decided to bring a knife, it would have been game over for her. But to even enter the convention center, attendees had to pass through a metal detector and bag check, and security was posted up around entrances and exits, on the show floor, next to escalators, and near meet and greets.&nbsp;</p><p>User Mag’s Lorenz received a tour of TwitchCon’s security command center, images from which Aftermath has viewed. The setup included a series of monitors cycling through hundreds of attendees’ streams (with handles attached for identification purposes), as well as more traditional security footage – all of which was monitored by dozens of security staff. This probably-unintentional <em>Dark Knight</em> homage, Lorenz told Aftermath, allowed for “mass surveillance” of the event. Compared to other events she’s attended like Vidcon, which also plays host to creators with millions of followers, she found it to be a more sophisticated security apparatus.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite security discourse from big streamers, only some of whom were at TwitchCon, general Twitter sentiment around the show <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/1980325875460763746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skewed more positive than negative</a>, according to resident Twitch newsman Zach Bussey.&nbsp;</p><p>Streamers to whom Aftermath spoke reported a relatively incident-free weekend.</p><p>“I had no [security] concerns [with attendees],” Tanya “Cypheroftyr” DePass, who previously <a href="https://kotaku.com/for-streamers-dealing-with-stalkers-twitchs-solutions-1832063386" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dealt with stalker-related issues on Twitch</a>, told Aftermath. “Someone I’ve had an issue with at PAX East was spotted but did not engage. I didn’t hear about Emiru until after it had happened.”</p><p>“I felt safe, but luckily I’m a man,” ConnorEatsPants, whose <em>Fortnite </em>Friday interview show has recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inuZ7mcNlq0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attracted high-profile guests like Gavin Newsom</a> and The Rizzler, told Aftermath. “There’s always a few ‘weird’ people, but mostly just awkward folks. Past two years, I had issues with Twitch not clearing me for proper security assistance, which had led to some issues with me walking the floor and getting swarmed. Luckily this year I was cleared in advance, thankfully.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>My personal experience this weekend, I did feel secure, but I know that wasn't everyone's.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Twitch also maintained a special Purple Lounge exclusively for “premium partners” – aka, those with high view counts – that they could access without ever exposing themselves to the hopefully-washed masses.</p><p>"I could go from my [hotel] room to events without ever encountering any floor time,” politics streamer Michael “<a href="https://x.com/Mike_from_PA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MikeFromPA</a>” Beyer, who is no stranger to the kinds of <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-charlie-kirk-death-streamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politically motivated</a> death threats that made Twitch especially squeamish this year, told Aftermath. “So I could go through a utility elevator in the hotel, get into a black Suburban, be taken [to the convention center], and go to the Purple Lounge, which is behind two layers of security as well – former police, military, bodyguards, etc."</p><p>Beyer said that months before the event, Twitch told him it would not provide security details for individuals, but that there’d be “an opportunity to bring your own security if you feel you’d need it.” However, the company seemed to have changed its tune following Charlie Kirk’s death, as it did provide a security guard for entertainment and politics streamer <a href="https://x.com/carolinekwan?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Caroline Kwan</a>, who received death threats prior to the show over <a href="https://x.com/DramaAlert/status/1978279379995086865" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her defense of Piker</a> during <a href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the ludicrous CollarGate scandal</a>, including one about how somebody wanted to “Charlie Kirk” her “so bad.” Big Twitch streamers have partner managers, not all of whom are cut from the same cloth, but Kwan says hers spearheaded the effort to make sure she was safe.</p><p>“I had a security person [thanks to my partner manager],” Kwan told Aftermath. “They were [Twitch owner] Amazon security; it was not a temporary TwitchCon security officer, like people they hired just for the weekend. And then after the Emiru situation, my partner manager reached out to me and was like 'If you don't want to do your meet and greet anymore, no problem.' ... She was very communicative.”</p><p>But Kwan recognizes that she’s in a unique position among TwitchCon attendees.</p><p>"My personal experience this weekend, I did feel secure, but I know that wasn't everyone's,” she said. “I talked to a lot of people, especially women, and the vibes were just that everyone was furious – female streamers saying that they weren’t hanging out in the [convention center] at all. People would be in the Purple Lounge or do their shows, and that was it."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Despite the 'no backpack' rule, I saw people admitted with backpacks, and I was given a hassle for my small bag.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Kwan also noted that big streamers like Schunk spend upwards of $10,000 per year on personal security. Smaller streamers can’t necessarily afford that.&nbsp;</p><p>Kwan also said she heard stories of backstage locations – where big names sought refuge – being inconsistently guarded, while other streamers spoke of needlessly strict security protocols at less crucial junctures. The latter caused some streamers accessibility issues – on top of the event’s preexisting and <a href="https://x.com/bbjesslive/status/1980375385067184438" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at this point notorious accessibility issues</a> – by, in one case, <a href="https://x.com/ezenaldarcen/status/1979764908117135762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking a bag away from a person with diabetes and multiple sclerosis</a> and forcing them to carry blood-sugar-regulating snacks in their hands. In other cases, creators who’ve striven to keep their IRL identities secret for privacy purposes and chronically ill people were <a href="https://x.com/arunareaver/status/1979981569562734866?s=46&amp;t=L-Xht24CY5-UBFgAlG58bg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to remove masks and show their faces in public</a>.</p><p>DePass was irked by security she described as “inconsistent joke theater.”</p><p>"Despite the 'no backpack' rule, I saw people admitted with backpacks, and I was given a hassle for my small bag,” she said. “My [<em>Magic The Gathering</em>] mat was unrolled by a security officer on entry on Sunday despite it being design-side out. His explanation? Sometimes people have lewd or inappropriate designs on these. Like, pornography. My mat had a Chocobo, which he could see without having to touch it or unroll it."</p><p>Therein lies the problem with calls for more security at the convention. Twitch hired numerous security guards who ostensibly did their jobs, but in some streamers’ experiences were neither consistent nor useful. They accosted and irritated attendees; they did not immediately pursue Schunk’s assailant, as they should have. In the same way that <a href="https://www.cjcj.org/reports-publications/report/more-law-enforcement-spending-accompanies-worse-not-improved-crime-solving" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overfunding police does not solve crime</a>, throwing more dudes in uniforms at a convention full of famous people and their parasocial fans does not guarantee safety. Twitch surely knew its security would be under scrutiny due to issues raised before the event. But a performance intended to satisfy an audience that equates scale and spectacle with quality is very different from a targeted, effective operation that considers the unique needs of a one-of-a-kind event.</p><h2>IRL Ire</h2><p>Which brings us to the IRL streamer issue. These opportunists did not generally pose a physical threat, but some bothered attendees and caused them – most of them women – to feel unsafe. Emerome, for example, <a href="https://x.com/emerome/status/1979934255363874862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said she began receiving death threats</a> online after the clip of her shrugging off N3on went viral, and as a result she decided to skip the remainder of the con. Many IRL streamers attended an outdoor block party Twitch hosted and roamed streets near the convention center, ravenous for content. This contributed to a general sense of anxiety and unrest.&nbsp;</p><p>"[The block party] was chum for these IRL streamer sharks to go in and try to farm these moments,” said Kwan. “When [my team and I] looked outside [from the restaurant we were eating at], it was just all these cameras and lights, and you could see obnoxious streamers on the hunt. ... A lot of people who went to [the block party] were like 'You know what? It was just not fun. I felt like everywhere I went, there were just cameras being shoved in my face.'"</p><p>Twitch could not have prevented <em>all </em>of this; the outdoors and parties hosted by other orgs, of which there were many, are not the company’s purview. But at least on convention grounds, it did possess the means to do so. The problem is that Twitch had security personnel monitoring hundreds of streams for more traditional security concerns (physical safety, etc), but it evidently didn’t consider the IRL streamers <em>themselves</em> to be a potentially serious security issue. Guards did not intervene when people like N3on and Doherty made people uncomfortable (though Doherty’s Twitch account was suspended sometime in the past few days).</p><figure><blockquote><p>It was just not fun. I felt like everywhere I went, there were just cameras being shoved in my face.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The question then becomes: Is that something Twitch <em>wants </em>to curtail in the future? TwitchCon has become a hotbed for content creation, and preventing online conflict and misogyny from spilling over into real life might require a cultural intervention as much, if not more than, a security one, the kind that would necessarily involve giving the boot to big-name creators with misogynistic tendencies.&nbsp;</p><p>"The truth is, TwitchCon was probably the most surveilled, security rich, and filmed event in the [San Diego] convention center all year," Bret "Cinemarxism" Hamilton <a href="https://x.com/cinemarxismbret/status/1980383032621330722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>. "Surveillance and buff dudes just don’t prevent cultural issues like misogyny from causing harm to vulnerable people. Could more be done? Of course. I wish harassment and misogyny [were] taken 100x more seriously by the platform, but the problems that actually cause these people to behave this way are so deep and wider in scope than the platform of Twitch. As evidenced by this weekend, cops, surveillance and other forms of security theater can’t and don’t actually keep us safe. Only we keep us safe, and a lot of us are not doing nearly enough to counter misogyny and online harassment."</p><p>"A lot of male streamers participate in [the culture of misogyny] without maybe understanding that this is all part of a larger problem,” said Kwan. “They go 'Well, I would never assault a woman or say that was OK. And in fact, I'm condemning what happened to Emiru, and if I were there, I would have protected her.' ... When we call women whores, when we say these really misogynistic things and normalize it, and then we have these audiences comprised of very impressionable, vulnerable young men who are learning from this, not every one of them is going to do something like the guy did to Emiru, but it's all part of a broader systemic issue."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Surveillance and buff dudes just don’t prevent cultural issues like misogyny from causing harm to vulnerable people.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Some have suggested simply banning all IRL streamers from TwitchCon, but that would effectively mean throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>“I’ve been on Twitch as a viewer for 15+ years," Jakenbake, an OG IRL streamer who made his name by exploring Japan with his viewers, <a href="https://x.com/jakenbakelive/status/1980309672478531733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>. "I’ve seen the growth, the ups and downs, streamers come, streamers go, and an ever evolving community. I’ve witnessed the diversification of content into non-gaming 'IRL' since the inception. Seeing all of the understandable frustration with TwitchCon and IRL streamers this year definitely hurts as it lumps in everyone in an already hard to navigate category. ... I understand the frustrations completely because I have them too. [Of course] this isn’t everyone, and there’s tons of amazing creators doing things properly."&nbsp;</p><h2>Clip That</h2><p>This is where calls to eliminate IRL streamers entirely – either from the convention or Twitch as a platform – begin to ring hollow. Painting with too broad a brush blots out those who just want to bring viewers along for a ride. The medium is not intrinsically the problem, nor in this case is Twitch.&nbsp;</p><p>“Jack Doherty had 300 viewers [on Twitch] during [the livestream that produced] the clip where PeachJars and him got into it,” said Kwan. “Do you think he’s farming that stuff because he’s doing so specifically for a livestream? No. That’s this whole meta of clip farming. That’s the kind of stuff that pops on other platforms: that short-form content.”</p><p>What we’re experiencing is the logical endpoint of other, much more algorithmic platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter prioritizing dramatic, controversial, and generally negative clips – the kind that generate engagement by making people mad. Platforms have been doing this for a few years now, but we’ve reached the apotheosis of the form. Creators, who’ve optimized their content to appeal to algorithms, have transformed themselves into vessels for the sort of smirking sociopathy that reliably reaps sweet, sweet views. They do it naturally and shamelessly. The machine is so well oiled that, at this point, slamming the brakes would be much harder than just letting it continue to plunge off a cliff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>That’s this whole meta of clip farming. That’s the kind of stuff that pops on other platforms: that short-form content.</p></blockquote></figure><p>IRL streamers are far from the only ones leaning into this meta. Most recently, CollarGate was rooted in a similar sort of amoral cynicism and, again, was ginned up entirely via a series of out-of-context clips. Countless other online controversies and nontroversies have taken on a similar shape. TwitchCon 2025 was this terrible, multifaceted fly-eye lens applied to the outside world, as opposed to the online one. What happens when people look at IRL existence as nothing more than a staging ground for an endless feed of disingenuous clips? TwitchCon was a glimpse of the grim future that awaits us, or perhaps just another angle on the present we’re already inhabiting.</p><p>This is why calls to return Twitch to the good old days or make a new platform in 2011-era Twitch’s image are destined to fail: Whatever emerges from such an effort will still be subject to the prevailing winds of the modern internet. No platform is an island, as TwitchCon demonstrated by attracting so many creators who were primarily hoping to farm views on non-Twitch platforms. Similarly, there’d be nothing to stop someone from clipping a streamer saying something dumb or controversial on a hypothetical pure gaming platform and turning them into a lolcow. The root issue is not the kinds of content Twitch allows; it’s the behavior patterns incentivized by the platform ecosystem at large.&nbsp;</p><p>Streamers who are calling for a return to Twitch’s halcyon “bleed purple” days are also falling into the same trap as conservatives: They’re harking back to a time that never actually existed. Yes, Twitch at one point required streamers to play games, but creators and fans have always argued about subjects and people they deem inappropriate for Twitch, even when those at the heart of bitter debates were operating well within the rules. Remember “<a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-boobie-streamer-says-she-s-done-showing-cleavag-1764285119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boobie streamers</a>”?&nbsp;</p><p>"Kaceytron did nothing but play <em>League of Legends</em>, but because she was a woman doing it – and because she was wearing normal clothes that women wear with maybe a plunging neckline, but certainly nothing that you wouldn't see out on the streets walking around – she was bombarded with nonstop threats,” said Beyer. “Even if we strip away IRL streaming and we strip away non-gaming streaming, there's still going to be this culture of misogyny that is targeting creators. ... It seems like a bad idea overall to try to restrict people's content that's not in any way related to harassing people because of some sort of faux-nostalgia for a time that never existed where women were safe on the platform."</p><figure><blockquote><p>In terms of what Twitch can do better, I’d say to listen to the girls.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Twitch, meanwhile, is a relatively small platform – a fraction of the size of YouTube or TikTok with a vastly smaller staff (cut to the bone by <a href="https://aftermath.site/latest-twitch-layoffs-spread-teams-even-thinner-no-idea-how-folks-are-going-to-make-it-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a>) to match. As a result, a handful of bigger creators both on and off platform have proven reliably capable of hijacking and controlling conversations around it. Twitch’s major misstep, in Beyer’s eyes, has been catering to those users instead of implicitly telling them to change the channel like YouTube.</p><p>"Nobody is talking about enforcing YouTube terms of service, but if you search 'Twitch TOS' on YouTube, there's a million YouTube videos about it,” said Beyer. “It's like, well, the reason why that's happening is because Twitch is catering to these people. If Twitch just said [to streamers constantly complaining about women] ... 'As long as [women’s&nbsp; streams are] not pornographic, as long as it's not illegal, fuck off,' then we might actually have the platform grow.”</p><p>ConnorEatsPants thinks Twitch would do well to listen more attentively to the people impacted by recent incidents – not its loudest rage baiters.</p><p>"In terms of what Twitch can do better, I’d say to listen to the girls," he said. "They’ve been expressing stuff like this since I began attending [TwitchCon] years and years ago. Emi’s had these issues everywhere she goes, and the last place she should have to worry about it is TwitchCon."</p><h2><strong>Show Must (?) Go On</strong></h2><p>Once upon a time, an event like TwitchCon made perfect sense; streamers have always sold themselves as more authentic and accessible than traditional celebrities. Why wouldn’t they want to chill with their fans? But now, top streamers are nearly as famous as the aforementioned celebrities, and parasociality means there’s no world in which all their fans will just be normal about it.&nbsp;</p><p>What does safety at scale – both in terms of actual physical safety and peace of mind – look like when Twitch can’t tightly control everything and everyone, as one would at a more traditional celebrity appearance or meet and greet? The whole appeal of TwitchCon is the idea that a regular person could run into their favorite streamer milling about on the same plane of reality as them. If content creators are going to take advantage of that because other platforms incentivize it, does Twitch have a responsibility to rein them in on its own turf?&nbsp;</p><p>There are tweaks that make sense from a common sense standpoint – some kind of physical barrier at meet and greets, a stricter screening process for IRL streamers – but how much more could Twitch be able or willing to change when the big debut of its latest, greatest security theater was a flop? Is there a point at which TwitchCon becomes such a reputational risk that the company just pulls the plug on the event entirely?&nbsp;</p><p>With a growing number of popular streamers saying they won’t attend TwitchCon next year – even if they’re basing that decision on a lone, regrettably timed incident rather than more pervasive issues – something’s got to give.</p><p>"I don't know how Twitch convinces people to come back, because they announced in the lead up to this TwitchCon that they were going to be taking extra security measures,” said Kwan. “And then day one, [Schunk’s assault] happens, and they produced a poor response to it. Very reactive, not proactive. And if big streamers don't come, then they don't sell tickets."</p><p>“Because these little shitbag IRL clip farmers,” she added, “they’re not bringing in the viewership [for Twitch]. Not at all.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <a href="https://defector.com/why-your-team-sucks-2025-baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> haven’t had a great season so far in the NFL. Their current record is an abysmal 1-5, tied for the team’s worst in 30 years. And a new report claims the team’s coach, John Harbaugh, is understandably not happy about this and has removed many fun items from the locker room, including the team’s video games.</p> <p><a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/10/20/whats-wrong-with-the-baltimore-ravens/">On October 20, <em>The Baltimore Sun</em></a> reported that after going 1-3 and a player posting a photo of them playing games to social media, team officials and Harbaugh removed several “recreational staples” from the Ravens’ locker room. These included a basketball hoop, a ping pong table, a few corn hole boards, and some “video game consoles.”</p>

 <p>The report doesn’t specify which consoles, but it does mention that the team often played “intense rounds” of<em> Super Smash Bros</em>, so I’d assume some Switch or Switch 2 systems were removed. The outlet also says that these <em>Super Smash</em> sessions drew “small crowds of teammates late in the day.”</p> <p>Ravens players told <em>The Baltimore Sun</em> that the football team’s coaching staff wanted to “remove distractions” and help players focus more on playing, practicing, and, I assume, eventually winning. This isn’t the first time the team has done this, either. In past seasons when the team struggled to win, so-called “locker room freedoms” and benefits were scaled back or removed entirely. For players who need a break from having to focus and work all day, that can be tough. After all the fun toys and consoles were removed, the team lost two more games.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-server-slam-embark-studios-ferro-2000638324</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders%E2%80%99-dev-addresses-graphics-downgrade-enemy-difficulty-and-more-ahead-of-release.1332211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/server-slam-thank-you/">a blog post</a> thanking everyone who participated in last weekend’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">super fun Server Slam</a>, <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ developer Embark Studios commented on a few topics of note, three of which address some changes the team is making in light of the experiences folks shared online.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders </i>Is So Good I’m Worried It Will Completely Take Over My Life</a></p> <p>Those who played during the Server Slam and previous technical tests have raised a number of questions and concerns, mostly over the fine edges of what is shaping up to be one of the best and most approachable extraction shooter experiences yet. So let’s get into some of what Embark is looking to fix, and some fun data points from the test over the weekend.</p>

 <h2>Flying Arc are getting a gentle nerf</h2> <p>Let’s jump straight into the most consequential change Embark is looking to make for launch: The flying Arc drones are too damn perceptive. While many people, including myself, felt that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oarm5m/please_dont_nerf_the_arc/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">dealing with our robot overlords</a> above Speranza was appropriately challenging, those damn drones were quick to find and harass enemy players. Embark is changing that. In the post the studio said:</p>

 <p>It turns out their <b>awareness was a bit too high</b>, allowing them to essentially see through trees and bushes. This made their vision unintentionally over-powered, but we’ve adjusted what they can see now, so expect a fairer fight at launch.</p> <p>As a multiplayer game, I’ve no doubt this isn’t the end of difficulty tweaks for <i>Arc Raiders</i>. But preserving the tension and difficulty of the game is important. I mean, Leapers need to be able to scare the shit out of us, as one does to some hapless players in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oa6sr6/mistakes_were_made/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">this absolutely hilarious clip</a>.</p>

    <p>That said, diminishing just how quickly a drone can catch sight of you sounds like a reasonable adjustment.</p>

   <h2>Fairness adjustments</h2> <p>Embark is also making it a little tougher to get into the Dam Control Tower on the Dam Battlegrounds map. Seeing so many players easily access it during the Server Slam “was fun to watch,” the post says, “but [it’s] a bit too accessible for a key loot location. That’s been fixed to keep the challenge sharp.” That <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1odcjy5/good_or_bad_change/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sounds like a wise change</a>.</p>

 <p>On a similar topic, it will be interesting to observe how the devs respond to the various ways players end up using in-game gadgets. There’s a fine line between an OP tactic and, well, griefing. While it doesn’t sound like there were too many abusive uses of gear during the Server Slam, one technique comes to mind as a possible indicator of things that might become controversial: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1obv44e/barricading_the_tower_zipline/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Placing a barricade in front of a zipline</a>.</p>

    <p>There are plenty of vertical and horizontal ziplines all over the map, and if you place a barricade in front of one, it blocks an approaching player with sometimes hilarious results; watch the video above to see a downed player get stuck at the top of the barricade. I’ve seen other players just fall to their deaths with this. Is it fair? Is it ripe for toxic abuse? The devs will no doubt have a lot of interesting decisions to make in the future.</p> <h2>Addressing the “graphical downgrade”</h2> <p>Though it may have been the first time for some, the Server Slam wasn’t the first chance folks had gotten to play <i>Arc Raiders</i>. There have been two previous technical tests and during those, it seems the game had some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oagvwj/dear_embark_please_explain_or_undo_this_graphical/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">more visual spectacle</a>, a discrepancy some players noted.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ocnp9m/devs_respond_to_graphics_downgrade_just_make_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Embark has replied</a> to this concern, stating that it had “done optimization to ensure higher and more stable framerates on low and mid spec hardware.” As someone with a temperamental PC, I really appreciated how smooth the game ran. But the game does <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ociyyf/dear_embark_studios_please_dont_forget_players/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">look notably fancier in previous builds</a>. Embark says it will try to find the “right balance” to this discrepancy. And players have another concern regarding the graphics: Foliage.</p>

 <p>On lower graphical settings, the dense bushes that are perfect for hiding just vanish. It brings up a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1odehgm/petition_to_remove_low_foliagegraphics_settings/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">serious concern about fairness</a>. If I can just turn my graphics settings to low, then I can see anyone hiding in the bushes. It’s an odd situation in which having a lower-end machine could mean an advantage over someone cranking their RTX 5090.</p> <h2>800k ducks and everyone’s favorite single-shot menace of a rifle</h2> <p>Embark shared a number of fun stats from the Server Slam, including which Arc was deadliest (obviously it was the Rocketeer. Somehow, though, ya’ll took down 77 Queens. I only faced it once, and that was because some genius in my party said “Let’s go take the Harvester!” and I couldn’t muster an “Are you nuts?” in response.</p>

 <p>That “77” number is put into perspective when you realize that collectively, we destroyed 58 million other machines. Yeah.</p>  <p>Also, the Ferro, the game’s single-shot gun that melts shields, was the most-crafted weapon and it sounds like rubber ducks were among the most commonly found treasures in the Rust Belt.</p>   <p>Honestly, I can’t wait for <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ release. One more week, ya’ll. Drink some water and spend time with your loved ones while you still can.</p>

			<p>A <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/gaming-copilot-installing-automatically-on-windows-11-pcs-now-trains-microsofts-models-on-users-pc-gameplay.1332163/">user on ResetEra spotted</a> that as part of their network traffic, Microsoft's new <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/">Gaming Copilot AI</a>, which is automatically installed on Windows 11 PCs, was sending screenshots and captures of everything they were playing back to Microsoft, so Microsoft could use that data to train its AI models further. The setting is on by default, which means that unless you turn it off, Microsoft is using your gaming time to train its AI.</p>



<p>Wccftech can confirm that when you navigate to Game Bar, and then to Settings, and Privacy Settings, the option for Gaming Copilot to pull "<em>Model training on text</em>" is defaulted to being activated. I found the setting activated on my own laptop, before turning it off.</p>



<p>There's also options for Gaming Copilot to train using any vocal conversations you have while playing games, though that was not defaulted to being 'on,' when we looked at our settings. It'll also capture personalization and memory data, and of course, keep track of any conversations you have with Gaming Copilot, if you were actually using the service.</p>



<p>You can turn all of these settings off and/or ensure they're off by going into Game Bar, then to Gaming Copilot, then the Settings gear, which should be in the bottom left corner, and then lastly Privacy settings. There, you'll be able to turn off, or at least knowingly opt in to letting Gaming Copilot train on your gameplay, instead of it being on by default.</p>



<p>In the past month or so, Microsoft has done nothing, it seems, but be a public disappointment for players. The price of the Xbox Series consoles <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">went up in the US for the second time this year</a>, followed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">a price hike for Xbox development kits</a>, meaning even game devs have to pay more for Xbox hardware. The price of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">Xbox Game Pass went up 50%</a>, while at the same time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-removed-10-discount-on-call-of-duty-add-ons-cod-points-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers/">discounts</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rewards-points-xbox-game-pass/">reward programs</a> for Xbox software and services were shut down. And in the midst of all of that, we can probably expect a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-preparing-free-ad-supported-version-xbox-cloud-gaming/">version of Cloud Gaming with ads</a>. </p>



<p>Now, the latest is that Microsoft is training its AI with your gameplay, almost definitely without you strictly knowing about it.</p>



<p>None of it exactly endears Xbox and Microsoft to players, but it does at least seem par for the course for a company that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">laid off 9,000+ people to bet more on AI.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yotei-seems-to-have-sold-just-fine-despite-reactionary-boycott.1332190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> was the fourth best-selling game in the U.S. for September with just three days out on the market, according to the latest figures from Circana. Sony’s latest open-world blockbuster appears to be doing just fine despite an attempted boycott by online grifters and their followers.</p> <p>“With one week in market, the US sales performance of<em> Ghost of Yotei</em> was basically flat to that of <em>Ghost of Tsushima,” </em>the research firm’s Mat Piscatella wrote on Bluesky. “It did great. <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> launched in July 2020 (if you’ll recall, stuff was happening at the time that significantly boosted gaming), and the PS4 installed base at the time was significantly higher than the PS5 is today. Like, anyone with ‘concern’ about this title should be looked at with a side eye.”</p>

 <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> was behind <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>NBA 2K26</em>, and <em>EA Sports FC 26</em>, which isn’t surprising considering those are multiplatform best-sellers and the samurai revenge tale remains exclusive to PS5 right now. Sales were still enough to make <em>Yotei</em> the 18th best-seller of the year so far by revenue and the second best-selling game on PlayStation during the period, just behind <em>NBA 2K26</em> but ahead of <em>Borderlands 4</em> which had two additional weeks on the market.</p>   <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> has been on the receiving end of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478">slow-burn reactionary backlash</a> from online culture warriors ever since it revealed its protagonist was a woman named Atsu. She’s played by Erika Ishii who was attacked by the <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511">usual suspects</a> for being queer and for posting about about defunding the police during the 2020 George Floyd protests. The flame war intensified after a Sucker Punch developer posted a joke about the Charlie Kirk assassination, with some calling for a boycott of <em>Yotei</em> even after the developer <a href="https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-sony-2000627290">was fired for the remark</a>.&nbsp;Boycott or no, it seems to have had little meaningful impact on <em>Yotei</em>‘s trajectory, at least at launch.</p>

 <h2>Is<em> Borderlands 4</em> still a sales juggernaut?</h2> <p>The September sales figures have some other interesting nuggets to chew on. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> posted some impressive Ws but with a few major caveats. It was the best-selling game in the U.S. for the month and instantly hit number three for the entire year, with 30 percent higher dollar sales at launch than <em>Borderlands 3</em>. But <em>Borderlands 3</em> was $60 instead of $70, didn’t have a Super Deluxe Edition selling for $130, and wasn’t initially available on Steam, where <em>Borderlands 4</em> appears to have sold a good portion of its copies.</p>

 <p>2K Games hasn’t released any official sales figures yet. <em>Borderlands 3</em> sold <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1kns4wo/borderlands_3_is_2ks_fastest_selling_title_with/">over 22 million copies and before that, <em>Borderlands 2</em> hit 30 million</a>. My guess is that<em> Borderlands 4</em>, a return to form hampered somewhat by PC issues at launch, ends up tracking somewhere in-between.</p>

 <p>In other news, the PS5 has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3ry7dpojc2x">already outsold</a> the entire PS3 generation in under five years. It has a couple of years left to beat the PS4 globally. I don’t think anyone’s ever beating the PS2. Not even the Nintendo Switch.</p> <p>But my favorite sales data point of all from last month is <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a>. It came in ninth overall, and second on Switch, which is extra impressive when you remember it’s selling for only $50. Square Enix hinted at <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-cloud-wiegraf-cid-sequel-2000622717">a possible sequel</a> if it does well enough, or at least more strategy RPGs. I’m buying everyone I know a copy for Christmas.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-companion-list-faction-loyalty-2000638303</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-hope-my-outer-worlds-2-companions-really-do-try-to-kill-me.1332157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Companions in the original <em>Outer Worlds</em> were kind of stiff. You could build up your relationships with them. They’d tell you when they were unhappy. But none of it ever led anywhere. They amounted to a fire-suppressing peanut gallery that helped you learn about and reflect on the world around you but little more. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> will try to fix that. You still can’t romance companions in the sequel but at least they’ll try to kill you this time if you really piss them off.</p> <p>You’ll have six optional companions in Obsidian’s upcoming sci-fi RPG, many associated with particular in-game factions. Niles is an engineer from the Earth Directorate. Valerie is a robot from the same faction. Aza is a cultist from the Glorious Dawn. Inez is a field medic from Auntie’s Choice. Marisol is an assassin from the Order of the Ascendant. Finally there’s Tristan from the Protectorate who has a giant hammer. Hurt their friends or break their rules and they’ll turn on you.</p>

 <p>“One of the things that was really important is we wanted these characters to feel like they’re their own people,” design director Matt Singh said on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VLPpTh_v8&amp;t=827s">latest episode</a> of the Xbox Expansion Pass show (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/screw-up-too-hard-in-the-outer-worlds-2-and-your-companions-may-fight-you-to-the-death-because-obsidian-wanted-the-rpgs-cast-to-feel-like-theyre-their-own-people/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>). “They have their own goals, their own motivations, and if the player’s aligning with them, that’s great. They’re going to be there for you. They’ll fight alongside you. But if you go against their interests, they’re going to have something to say about it. That might break out into a conflict, that might mean they leave you or you have to fight them to the death. But if you do build that relationship with them, they’ll be there for you in the end.”</p>

 <p>This sounds neat and builds off one of the most memorable moments from the original <em>Mass Effect</em> in which two of your squadmates clash, resulting in an unreconcilable showdown. Over a decade later I still remember what choice I made during that part of the game and why (fuck you, Ashley). I don’t expect <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> to rise to the same level since these confrontations don’t sound like pivotal scripted moments so much as procedural consequences.</p>

 <p>Singh also suggests you can sort of skate by the friction if you have a good enough relationship with the NPC. Something like, “Uh, sorry I wiped out your clan, remember that time I finished your second loyalty mission though?” I hope that’s not the case. I hope we have some real friends-to-enemies journeys out there in Halcyon this time around. One of my biggest complaints with party-based RPGs is that the people you’re with never seem to quite have a mind of their own outside of sassy retorts and disappointed scowls. It sounds like <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is trying to evolve the formula beyond that.</p> <p><b>“</b>We still wanted to make sure that the player has choice<span>—</span>meaningful choice—here,” Singh <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/18764-the-outer-worlds-2-interview-talking-role-playing-second-chances-with-obsidians-brandon-adler-matthew-singh">told <em>RPGSite</em> in another interview</a>. “Companions are completely optional. If you don’t want to engage with them, you don’t have to. But you can take them along and see how that changes your story. Same thing with factions, right? The factions are there. They have their goals. They have their motivations. You can try to side with them. You can try to bring them together. Or you can say, ‘F it. I’m going my way. I don’t care about you. We’re going to do it the way that I would like.’ We’re all trying to figure out how to give the player as much player agency as possible and respond to it in interesting ways.”</p>

      <div><p>Official Netflix Catan adaptations may be on the horizon. The popular streaming platform has announced it has secured the global rights for film, TV, and unscripted formats of Asmodee's signature resource-gathering board game.</p>

<h2>The Netflix <em>Catan</em> Rights Acquisition</h2>

<p>In an official post on <a href="https://corporate.asmodee.com/news/netflix-scores-10-victory-points-winning-rights-to-global-phenomenon-catan-r-with-wide-ranging-deal" rel="nofollow">Asmodee's website</a>, they announced Netflix had secured the rights to produce live-action and animated projects based on <em>Catan</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-catan-board-close-up.jpg?itok=HHqdKRC0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-catan-board-close-up.jpg?itok=oPats_wZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The board game, originally called <em>Settlers of Catan</em> in 1995, is a resource management board game where players secure and gather resources on a bountiful island to gain victory points. It is a wildly popular board game. It has sold over 45 million copies, is currently up to its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-catan-sixth-edition-is-out-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sixth edition</a>, as well as artisanal, bespoke game piece collections such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-masterpiece-kickstarter-fully-funded-within-hour-promoting-bespoke-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Catan Masterpiece</em></a>.</p>

<p>That straightforward set-up will be the focus of these adaptations. Settlers on the fictional island of Catan navigating landscapes, shifting alliances, managing their limited resources, and dealing with robbers and bandits.</p>

<p>The producers for these projects will include Vertigo Entertainment's Roy Lee, Catan Studio's Pete Fenlon, Asmodee's Darren Kyman, and Guido and Benjamin Teuber.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Millions of people are enjoying CATAN since it was created and for many, it remains a gateway to modern board gaming. I am thrilled to see the game expanding to a larger audience who will discover the richness of its universe, I find it exciting for the future of the brand.” said Thomas Koegler, CEO of asmodee. “It’s also a testament that board gaming is truly part of pop culture and a popular form of entertainment in everyone’s homes, and I am delighted to continue asmodee’s relationship with Netflix.”&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
Anyone who has played CATAN knows that the intense strategy at the core of the game has endless opportunities for some serious drama,” said Jinny Howe, Head of Scripted Series, US and Canada, Netflix. “We're thrilled to partner across series, features, animation, and games to bring this world to life for hardcore 'Settlers' and new fans alike.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>The Netflix <em>Catan</em> announcement seems to be part of the trend of modern Hollywood leveraging recognizable IP for content. This has included turning the board game Clue into a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/clue-tv-show-has-been-greenlit-by-netflix" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">competitive game show</a>, and feature <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-screenwriters-have-been-summoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">film adaptations</a> of Wizards of the Coast's popular card game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>.</p>

<p>This also isn't the first time one of Asmodee's board games got a Netflix adaptation. As part of their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-gets-into-movies-with-radar-films" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2021 deal</a> with Radar Films, the movie <em>Family Pack</em> released on Netflix in 2024. This adaptation of <em>The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow</em> currently sits at a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/family_pack_2024" rel="nofollow">38% rating</a> on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>

Whether I’m enjoying the absurdity of its main cast’s antics or passing by an NPC who says something so out of pocket I have to do a double take at their speech bubble, I’m getting plenty of chuckles out of my time in Lumiose City. The citizens of the Paris-inspired setting seem to be </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-secret-npc-dialogue-sinister/"><span>going through it</span></a><span>, and it means that you’ll find a lot of odd one-liners popping up as you run through the city.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There’s much to be said about whether or not Lumiose City feels “alive” in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, as the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-small-boring-map-how-big-time-to-walk-around-2000636148"><span>small map’s</span></a><span> lack of distinct districts and visual identity has come under fire since the RPG launched last week. Still, you can’t deny that its people have character. The main cast of Z-A Royale participants and members of Team MZ are some of the most memorable characters Game Freak has put in one of these games. While the nameless denizens of Lumiose City you encounter aren’t decked out in glitz and glamour like the members of the main cast, they make the most of their screentime, like that </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jun/30/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-got-upstaged-by-a-swivel-eyed-extra"><span>one lady in the background of </span><i><span>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the brief quips you’ll see while running around actually drop surprisingly insightful tidbits, like revealing what’s happened to characters from </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. Others are just the ramblings of mad people at their wits’ end, who can’t be bothered to mask their discontent in front of a group of young adults tirelessly trying to save the city. Without further ado, here are some of the best, funniest, and most unsettling quotes I’ve seen both online and in my own playthrough.</span></p>

It follows June’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-expansion-made-200-million-in-just-one-day">record-breaking Final Fantasy set</a>, marking yet another major gaming crossover with Magic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh off the launch of Ghost of Yotei, we caught up with Jason Connell, Creative Director at Sucker Punch, along with Wizards of the Coast’s Jacob Covey, Steve Sunu, and Annie Sardelis, to learn how Jin Sakai’s world was reimagined in card form. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They shared how brushstroke met blade, and how Sucker Punch’s involvement went far beyond a simple seal of approval. And even more excitingly, IGN has also got an exclusive first look at Ghost of Yotei’s Atsu card, joining the upcoming PlayStation superdrop.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Once we had the basics set up, it was a super collaborative process" - Jason Connell, Sucker Punch</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">A Cardboard Ghost</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">“Part of the fun of working with game studios is the mutual fandom between us—there’s usually a Magic fan or three on their side and a group of fans for their game on our team,” WOTC Art Director, Jacob Covey, explains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to Sucker Punch, there are even a few tournament games being played within the development team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's about 10-12 folks who play monthly, mostly Commander format,” Jason Connell explains. “A few people who regularly come into the office have decks at their desks just in case the mood ever strikes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for making it happen, the conversation began a while ago, and it was Wizards who wanted to work on a PlayStation collaboration.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/22/0-1761130497622.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Exclusive: Atsu, Ghost of Yotei - Secret Lair x PlayStation - Credit: Wizards of the Coast.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Ben Jafari [a manager at WOTC] worked hard to not only make this happen between many different studios at once, but to do it on the same timeline,” Covey reveals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We knew we wanted to work with these iconic PlayStation properties, so it was difficult to narrow it down to just a handful.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That initial discussion then fed down to the team at Sucker Punch, Connell said, and it was clear that the two Ghost titles would make for ideal fits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Across both the Sucker Punch and PlayStation side, it was pretty clear that Ghost could be a really great fit as one of the featured franchises, though, so it came together pretty naturally once they reached out. We were definitely excited by the idea.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rub? <strong>Ghost of Yotei hadn’t been revealed to the public yet.</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2">Landing a Sucker Punch</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our conversations with Wizards of the Coast began before Yotei had been announced, which we admit was probably frustrating from the Wizards' side since we had to be so cryptic,” he recalls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We just kept saying we had a great idea for a secret card, but then saying we couldn't elaborate yet, and thankfully, they were such great partners that they rebuilt the schedule to accommodate us delivering the information and art for Atsu after we announced the game last year, even though the rest of the cards had been locked in by that point.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We knew the drop would be coming right around Yotei’s launch, so it felt like a perfect fit to try to get her included, and we’re grateful it worked out.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We aim to be authentically rooted in the Ghost universe while giving it our unique spin" - Jacob Covey, WOTC</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for card designs, the Sucker Punch part of the Secret Lair drop incorporates Jin Sakai and Atsu, the two protagonists of both games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“On the art side, Sucker Punch was very trusting and also involved in helping us remain true to their carefully constructed universe, full of its own untold stories,” said Covey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We aim to be authentically rooted in the Ghost universe while giving it our unique spin, focusing on how the characters and settings relate to the Magic ecosystem and gameplay.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We had some great early conversations with the Wizards team, including an initial kickoff where we just explained the key points of Ghost of Tsushima and sent over some materials from the game,” Connell adds.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/22/e82ad013-1f36-4bdf-abc4-250616839cb4-1761134212017.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Jin Sakai, Ghost of Tsushima - Secret Lair x PlayStation - Credit: Wizards of the Coast.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We explained what we felt was important to capture, even discussed some specific artist names and our overall style. It was really interesting getting a glimpse into their process, meeting artists and writers and directors who oversaw all of the different pieces that go into making a card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Once we had the basics set up, it was a super collaborative process. While the actual writing and artist selection happened on the Wizards side, we had a ton of input and chances to provide feedback and went through multiple rounds making sure everyone was happy with the overall look and mechanics for the cards."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the ways Wizards and Sucker Punch helped bring Jin Sakai to Magic: The Gathering was to lean into the duality of his fighting styles in Ghost of Tsushima, where he’s torn between samurai combat and the stealthier ‘Ghost’ path.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Jin Sakai is about a warrior torn between two identities — the honorable samurai and the shadowy Ghost,” Connell explains.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"From the start, I wanted to capture two ways of approaching encounters in Ghost of Tsushima..." - Annie Sardelis, WOTC</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wizards of the Coast did a great job capturing this in the card with the Standoff ability, which represents his swordsmanship, while Ghost highlights his stealth and ability to strike fear into his opponents. The rest of the Secret Lair cards that Wizards of The Coast curated for this drop helped show his journey to support that theme: tools of conflict, sacrifice, and shifting control that echo Jin’s struggle between tradition and survival."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From the start, I wanted to capture two ways of approaching encounters in Ghost of Tsushima," explains WOTC Senior Game Designer, Annie Sardelis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I combined elements of how Magic has classically expressed a lone fighter's skills by only giving that bonus to a single attacker. Since double strike and "can't be blocked" are phrases we've seen time and again on Magic cards, I added the words to help my coworkers become familiar with what I was going for. Flavor words, like flavor text, can help give creative definition to rules text, and we ended up keeping them."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A PlayStation Pantheon</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/magic-the-gathering-playstation-secret-lair-superdrop-1758926000898.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Magic: The Gathering Secret Lair x PlayStation Superdrop. Credit: Wizards of the Coast.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from Ghost of Tsushima and Yotei, there are sets focused on God of War’s Greek and Norse tales, as well as Horizon Forbidden West and two sets for The Last of Us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the mix of gods and robot dinosaurs, however, it was the gritty post-apocalyptic tale from Naughty Dog that gave Sardelis the biggest challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The hardest challenge I signed myself up for are the four "Survivors" Partners from The Last of Us series," she explains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I thought it was important to represent all the playable characters in the story, but I also wanted your Commander games to feature the infected. It was tricky to find out how to generate the Fungus Zombie tokens on characters that canonically fight against them!"</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Any player can make infected tokens with Ellie, Brick Master and Abby, Merciless Soldier riffs on cards like "Hunted Dragon" to create an increasing number of tokens. Once that was figured out, the rest of the pieces were designed to complement a token/sacrifice strategy- hopefully in a way that inspires mixing and matching between the two drops!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Commander, it’s Magic’s most popular format, and I wanted to know which of the new PlayStation cards would make an ideal choice to helm a 100-card deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you’re sitting across from me, I think you can expect me to have an Aloy, Savior of Meridian deck or Jin Sakai, Ghost of Tsushima deck somewhere on me," WOTC Senior Product Designer, Steve Sunu, says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Annie Sardelis really hit it out of the park for all these designs, Aloy and Jin specifically feel like the designs were created just for a player like me. Annie’s an incredible designer, and we were so lucky to have her lend her talent to these new-to-Magic designs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong></strong></em><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-the-playstation-superdrop" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Magic: The Gathering's Secret Lair x PlayStation Drop</strong></em></a><em><strong> launches on October 27, 9 AM PT, at the </strong></em><a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>official Secret Lair website</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

		<p>Just last week, TinyBuildGames and developer Fire &amp; Frost announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/13/of-ash-and-steel-will-launch-on-november-6th/">Of Ash and Steel would launch on November 6th,</a> but what a difference a week makes. However, after some more testing the development team has discovered some issues that need additional work, so Of Ash and Steel will not make the November 6th date as planned. The delay is not too long though, with Fire &amp; Frost confirming that the new date is now November 24th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - Steam Next Fest Demo and Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHDPSRpxF1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, the team wrote, <em>“Right now, we are in the active phase of testing the game before its release, making sure your journey across the island will be as smooth and bug-free as possible. Originally, we announced that your adventure would begin on November 6. However, during testing, our teams discovered several issues that require more time to fix than we initially expected. We’ll need a few extra weeks to properly address these issues. The new release date for Of Ash and Steel is now November 24th, 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>Announcing the release date was one of the most exciting and nerve-wracking moments of development, because deep down we feared something like this might happen at the very last moment. And… it did! Hopefully, you haven’t booked your vacation around the release just yet. We sincerely apologize for this short delay, and hope you’ll understand our decision. Finally, for those who haven’t tried the demo yet — good news! It will remain available for a while longer, so you still have time to step onto Grayshaft and experience the first hours of your adventure. Thank you for your support, and we’ll see you (just a little later) on Grayshaft!”</em></p>

<p>Steam Next Fest was a success for Of Ash and Steel with the demo being one of the best performing demos, and the game has now been wishlishted over 220,000 times. The game is being billed as an old school RPG where players will explore the Kingdom of the Seven without mission markers or overt quest guidance. The demo features part of the main quest, side missions, professions, and upgrades.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="f7323ddf36ebf"><a title="Legends Z-A 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f7323ddf36ebf/legends-z-a-1.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>There’s been quite a lot of talk recently about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-is-it-about-time-game-freak-added-voice-acting-to-pokemon">lack of voiceover work</a> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, and I can understand why. Game Freak has made some pretty decent strides with its cutscenes, depicting characters that animate realistically right down to their facial expressions and mouth movements. Yet they don’t actually talk. It’s weird in practice to see such well-constructed scenes play out in near total silence, but that’s actually not my biggest gripe with the residents of Lumiose City.</p>
<p>If you go into a real-life busy city centre in the middle of the day, one thing you’ll notice is that most people will probably be walking somewhere. Whether they’re darting from shop to shop, slowly ambling along in chattering groups, or even taking a few steps backwards to pick up the sausage that’s slipped out of their hotdog bun, everybody’s moving. Heck, it’s the reason why cities are often described as ‘bustling’ – it literally means ‘full of activity’.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59jlyqts&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Not in Lumiose City, though, oh no. You take a stroll through Legend: Z-A’s environment, and you’d be forgiven for thinking Medusa had run amok and turned almost everybody to stone. They just stand still, and it’s <em>so</em> <em>creepy</em>, man.</p>
<figure data-uuid="02291a5c99b34"><a title="Legends Z-A 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/02291a5c99b34/legends-z-a-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Erm... Hello? Anybody alive? — <em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, I want to acknowledge right off the bat that this isn’t a new thing; NPCs have always been averse to movement in Pokémon games. But there’s just something about Z-A that makes it more noticeable than ever. My theory is that because Lumiose City is the only major environment, anything that detracts from its sense of place is immediately more glaring. You could almost forgive previous entries for similar infractions because their towns and cities were simply part of a much larger world. Here, the city <em>is</em> the world.</p>
<p>There are so many people, too. I’ve honestly never seen a wider selection of NPCs in a Pokémon game, and the fact that 99% of them stand completely still makes for some seriously weird, unsettling imagery. They're not just on pavements too, but in the roads, sitting down for a sip of coffee (not actually drinking though), or standing on the grass, facing in seemingly random directions. It’s like that scene from M. Night Shyamalan’s cult classic <strong>The Happening</strong> where everyone suddenly stops dead in the middle of the street (I’m joking about the ‘cult classic’ bit – it’s a stinker).</p>
<p>I know everyone’s made a big fuss about the buildings in Z-A, and I get it, they’re pretty awful. But in my opinion, you can get away with quite a lot if you actually make it seem like your environment is busy with activity. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADY4LTn7TNA">Go back to the first 3D GTA games</a> if you don’t believe me. The cities there may look pretty crude by today’s standards, but of the few pedestrians and vehicles that those games are able to handle in one go, the majority of them are moving in some way. It makes a huge difference.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e2f97d24045ec"><a title="Legends Z-A 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e2f97d24045ec/legends-z-a-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Let's just ignore that sadist on the right, hm? — <em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s not just an aesthetic thing, either. One of the biggest mechanics introduced in Z-A is the ability to sneak up on your fellow trainers and land a move on their Pokémon before they’ve even had a chance to respond. So if I can do that, why can’t they? It would make navigating the Battle Zones so much more interesting and engaging if I knew that an NPC could get the drop on me at any moment. It’s yet another indication that in the world of Pokémon, you’re the hero, and everyone else is just surface dressing.</p>
<p>I’m not completely down on Legends: Z-A. I think the overall structure of having specific zones for catching and battling is quite interesting, and the character customisation is frankly the best it's ever been. But man, I’m so tired of these games feeling so lifeless all the time. Its environments are supposed to convey a sense of excitement and positivity, and I just feel like I’ve been plunged into the middle of a horror movie.</p>
<p>I don't know... Maybe I've been spoiled by games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>. Or maybe Game Freak needs to get a grip and start making its worlds feel a bit more alive. It's not much to ask, right?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Am I crazy in thinking this, or do you agree? Should more NPCs in Pokémon games actually start moving and living their lives, or are you happy for them to just stand around and wait for you to interact with them? Let me know with a comment in the usual place.</em></p>
