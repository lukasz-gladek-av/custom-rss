		<p>The end of 2024 is nigh, which means we're crossing 18 months running <em>Remap</em>. <em>Waypoint</em> was the longest I'd ever been at the same job, and it was easy to track how long I'd been there because it was the same age as my oldest child. That  system broke when <em>Remap</em> started, because my oldest daughter is now eight years old, <em>Waypoint</em> lasted seven, and <em>Remap</em> is approaching an opportunity to be rounded up towards two. Strange times, but I remain eternally thankful for this situation, given how things are unfolding elsewhere. I've been hoping for some kind of bounce back in games media, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts?ref=remapradio.com">but...how, exactly?</a></p><p>-pk, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/memes/i-like-my-suitcase-barron-trump/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">whose children were into the "I Like My Suitcase" meme</a> until I told my oldest that it was Donald Trump's son's voice in the video (something I was not initially aware of) and she told me to turn it off lol</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>After Dark</em> – We know that people have been asking for thoughts on what Old Waypoint thinks about New Waypoint, and as you've seen, we've been a little cautious. But on both last week's episode of Remap Radio and this episode of After Dark—well, we're tearing the band-aid off. Though our thoughts might land a little different than you might think. </li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Infinity Nikki</em> – I've been curious about this one for a hot minute now. Whether to not I'll actually end up liking it remains to be seen, but I gotta know. (Side note: No, I haven't forgotten about doing monthly horror streams.)</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Hot Frosty</em> – Yes, we're doing it. You'll hear this during the break.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Space Marine 2</em> – I don't know if we can finish the game, but we'll do our best to get as far as we can before the holiday season kicks off for us. (If we don't beat it on stream during this season, we'll do it in the new year.)</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – Chance I'm sitting this one out due to the way we're going to shift recording schedules on this one, but remains to be seen. Rob'll be back in the host chair!</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

Does such an eagerly awaited release live up to the hype? Is it full of anomalous bugs that mar the overall experience? Only the user reviews on Steam can provide such insights!</p><p>Of course, with so much strife pulling the development team in multiple directions, it would make sense that the open-world survival game felt half-baked to some, missing features to many, and downright buggy to most. That said, despite its flaws, there’s a genuinely exceptionally good time to be had in <em>Stalker 2</em>. But that’s just my opinion, and you’re here for everyone else’s!</p><p>On the positive side of the spectrum, the Steam user reviews for<em> Stalker 2</em> vary greatly, ranging from jokes and memes to declarations of undying support and love. More than a few user reviews claim this is the ultimate nostalgia trip back to childhood, while others can’t thank the team at GSC Game World enough for their work.</p><p>But it’s not all roses. On the negative review front, people claim it’s an excellent game but a terrible <em>Stalker </em>title. They point toward the lack of an A-Life system, initially announced for the game but didn’t make the cut, along with countless soft-locks, crashes, and game-breaking bugs.</p><p>Most agree that <em>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> required a little more time to cook, but what’s available now is surprisingly excellent despite its flaws. If you’re on the fence about the open-world survival game, then here’s your look at<em> Stalker 2</em>, as told by Steam reviews!</p><hr><figure id="" data-id="271d9e5b8fcc52dd0a79bf82d7836335"

Drawing on everything from the German Expressionist techniques of the 1922 classic <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em> to the grotesque transformation of Bill Skarsgård into the demented clown <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pennywise-is-excited-about-getting-his-ass-kicked-1839988581&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pennywise-is-excited-about-getting-his-ass-kicked-1839988581">Pennywise</a></span> in the recent <em>It </em>films, Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em> continues a storied horror legacy.</p><p>To fully appreciate the beauty behind the brutality of <em>Nosferatu</em> when it arrives in theaters on Christmas Day, it’s essential to familiarize yourself with its inspirations. The dreamlike visuals, the grayscale color palette that conveys a pervasive gloom, and the tight framing that creates an unsettling sense of confinement will all feel strikingly familiar if you explore these 12 must-watch films before immersing yourself in Eggers’ latest masterpiece.</p></div></div><div><p>An adaptation of the classic fairy tale, Jean Cocteau’s <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> is set in the 18th century and features a visual style that feels both sumptuous and nightmarish. The decadent costumes resemble Lily-Rose Depp’s beautiful gowns in <em>Nosferatu</em>, with plumes of silk, flowing skirts, and tight bodices. The black-and-white cinematography has a sharp, surreal quality, illuminating the piercing whites of the Beast’s eyes. The monochrome visuals are so stark they seem dreamlike—note the scene set in a pitch-black hallway lit by tiny, twinkling lights from candelabras. Like <em>Nosferatu</em>, <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> is a monster movie that is beautiful to look at, even in all its darkness.</p></div><div><p>Before seeing <em>Nosferatu</em>, you should brush up on the origins of German Expressionism, as these filmmaking techniques are still being used today. Watching Robert Wiene’s silent movie about a murderous hypnotist, you can observe the sort of visuals that continue to influence horror movies like <em>Nosferatu</em>, such as chiaroscuro lighting (heavy contrasts of light and shadow), jagged, angular buildings, and twisted, disorienting backgrounds. The scenes feel even creepier due to the older camera technology, the scratches on the film, and the eerie glow of the film stock. You can clearly see where Eggers, as well as directors like Tim Burton, draw their inspiration from.</p></div><div><p>During an appearance on Alamo Drafthouse’s YouTube series <em>Guest Selects</em>, Eggers praised Jack Clayton’s <em>The Innocents</em> as “one of the best—perhaps the best—gothic ghost movies ever made.” The film follows a governess who fears her children are possessed. Eggers mentioned that he watches the movie a couple of times a year for inspiration, and it’s evident that much of its essence will influence <em>Nosferatu</em>. Eggers was particularly inspired by Freddy Francis’ cinematography, which uses special glass filters to create a cocoon-like effect and tight framing that makes the spaces feel oppressive. In every shot, Clayton carefully positions the actors against the intricate architecture of the sprawling mansion, which dominates the scene to suggest an otherworldly presence lurking within the walls. The film is visually stunning yet deeply unsettling.</p></div><div><p>Talent and a penchant for horror clearly run in the family. Lily-Rose Depp, who stars in <em>Nosferatu</em>, follows in the footsteps of her father Johnny Depp, who was also part of a classic horror retelling: Tim Burton’s <em>Sleepy Hollow</em>, based on Washington Irving’s tale of the headless horseman. Both films are historical, set in the 18th and 19th centuries, and are filled with elaborate gowns, ripped bodices, stuffy waistcoats, and tailored trousers. They also share a grim, Gothic, grayscale color palette. Tim Burton emphasizes the vividness of red blood, making it stand out as it spills in buckets. Despite these visual similarities, the two films convey different tones: Burton’s film has a more cartoonish, whimsical vibe, while <em>Nosferatu</em> appears to be more sensuous and classical.</p></div><div><p>Gary Oldman chews the scenery as Vlad the Impaler, a warrior who loses his beloved wife to suicide, and later as the older Count Dracula, complete with a ridiculous wig resembling giant orbs. There are strong performances from Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins, though not so much from Keanu Reeves. Francis Ford Coppola’s <em>Dracula</em> adaptation is hypersexual and goofy in the weirdest ways—more colorful and splashy than Gothic and dark. For some, this ostentatious style suits a character who thrives on decadence and desire. With over-the-top dialogue and dramatics, combined with camerawork that whirls and twirls through Dracula’s lavish castle, it’s an epic adaptation worth watching. It even includes stylish visual homages to the original <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>.</p></div><div><p><em>Nosferatu</em>’s Count Orlok is not the first terrifying character Bill Skarsgård has transformed into; he also portrayed Pennywise the Clown in the recent adaptation of Stephen King’s epic novel <em>It</em>, which follows a group of children confronting an alien entity that haunts their Maine town of Derry over several decades. As Pennywise, Skarsgård immersed himself in the role not only through grotesque prosthetics—featuring a bulbous head, buck teeth, yellow eyes, clown makeup, and a twisted smile—but also through his unsettling physicality. His movements are eerily fluid, and his voice, initially light and fluffy like cotton candy, can shift instantly to become gruff and menacing. This commitment to transforming his physicality will likely be on display again in <em>Nosferatu</em>, and watching <em>It</em> offers just a glimpse of how demonic Skarsgård can be.</p></div><div><p><em>The Lighthouse</em> is another Eggers film you should catch up on. Shot in stark black-and-white and filled with salty sea dog language, it immerses you in its claustrophobic island setting, surrounded by tantalizing mermaids and flocks of seagulls—one of which meets a violent end. In this isolated and stormy space, Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson’s lighthouse keepers slowly descend into madness, creating a dizzying spectacle of cursing, heavy drinking, farting, and simmering sexual tension. The ending leaves a haunting final image that lingers long after the credits roll.</p></div><div><p>Eggers made a striking debut with <em>The Witch</em> in 2015, immediately establishing himself as a distinct new filmmaker. From this film, you’ll quickly get a sense of what to expect from him: folkloric tales of darkness with a Gothic aesthetic and antiquated dialogue. <em>The Witch</em> immerses you in the mundane, rigid daily life of Puritan New England, as a family accuses their daughter of witchcraft following the disappearance of their youngest son. Eggers carefully and methodically builds the tension, uncertainty, and mistrust, culminating in a mystical and deliciously sinful finale. After watching it, you’ll never look at a goat the same way again.</p></div><div><p>Another important influence on Eggers is Bela Lugosi’s portrayal of Count Dracula in Tod Browning’s 1931 version of the tale. Lugosi’s take on the world’s most famous vampire became the quintessential archetype—mysterious and monstrous, yet debonair and hypnotic, with a regal cape, a transfixing stare, and the ability to glide through his castle like a ghost. The film exudes a Gothic elegance that is more seductive than frightening, a quality <em>Nosferatu</em> may draw upon in its own way.</p></div><div><p>Eggers told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/robert-eggers-nosferatu-same-castle-werner-herzog-exclusive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/robert-eggers-nosferatu-same-castle-werner-herzog-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Empire</em> magazine</a></span> that he has been “consciously not watching” Werner Herzog’s version of <em>Nosferatu</em>, though he did end up shooting at the same castle, Pernštejn Castle in the Czech Republic. It seems Eggers is avoiding this version because it’s another filmmaker’s interpretation of the original, and he doesn’t want to cloud his own vision. However, for us as the audience, it’s fascinating to watch and compare the original silent film, Eggers’ adaptation, and Herzog’s version. Herzog’s <em>Nosferatu</em> is highly stylized, with every frame resembling a slowly moving painting. Eschewing the shadow-drenched visuals typical of the genre, Herzog often bathes Klaus Kinski’s Count Dracula in bright light, highlighting his pale white skin and sunken eyes. Much of the terror comes not from what is hidden but from what is revealed. This approach contrasts sharply with Eggers’ darker, more somber aesthetic, offering a compelling study in how different directors can interpret the same iconic story.</p></div><div><p>There’s some meta casting in Robert Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em>, as Willem Dafoe, who plays Professor Albin Eberhart von Franz, also portrayed actor Max Schreck in <em>Shadow of the Vampire</em>, a fictionalized account of the making of <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>. In <em>Shadow of the Vampire</em>, Max Schreck takes his role as the prowling vampire a little too seriously—so much so that he might actually be a vampire. This clever premise leads to humorous moments about method acting, with Schreck skulking around the set creepily and even eating bats, while John Malkovich’s F.W. Murnau gleefully captures it all on camera. The film builds to a chilling finale where fiction and reality blend in the most horrifying and violent ways, adding an unsettling layer to Dafoe’s connection to the <em>Nosferatu</em> legacy.</p></div><div><p>A key film to watch before Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em> is, of course, the 1922 original directed by F.W. Murnau, <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>. In <em>Nosferatu</em>, you can see the German Expressionist techniques that have influenced countless horror films since, such as exaggerated, theatrical gestures and the use of tilted camera angles. So many images from the film remain powerful and unforgettable, from Orlok’s shadow creeping across the wall as he stalks his prey to the ravishing Ellen clutching her heart and collapsing into bed. Perhaps most striking of all is the image of Max Schreck as Count Orlok standing motionless in a hallway, his eyes bulging and his sharp claws outstretched. It’s thrilling to witness the infancy of the horror genre in <em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em>, a silent film that, even over a century later, continues to send shivers down spines with its blend of terror and artistic innovation.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Eve can complement her holiday look by also equipping the Santa Girl hairstyle and the Snow Crystal Glasses, Wreath Earrings, and Sleigh Ear Cuffs. Eve's drone also receives the Rudolph Pack that attaches a new look to it, complete with a red nose and horns.</p><p>A new minigame has been added as well. It looks like players just have to shoot at a target wrapped in a wreath to win prizes, although it wasn't stated what those prizes were. At camps, players can choose the seasonal "Dawn (Winter)" and "Take Me Away" background music tracks. Last but not least, the update adds a Christmas tree in The Last Gulp, the bar where Xion's citizens gather.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4416230-image_2024-12-16_111541103.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416230" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4416230-image_2024-12-16_111541103.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416230"></a><figcaption>Adam's "I'm No Santa" costume</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4416230-image_2024-12-16_111541103.png"></figure><p>In the settings, players can also toggle seasonal and DLC content on/off whenever they want, which includes the holiday and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-is-getting-a-nier-automata-crossover-dlc/1100-6526688/" data-ref-id="1100-6526688">Nier: Automata content</a>.</p><p>Stellar Blade is currently available for PS5, and on sale for $50 as part of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stellar-Blade-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CTVK7GBM?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation's holiday sale.</a> Shift Up is aiming to release it on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-expects-the-game-to-be-even-bigger-on-pc-aiming-for-2025-launch/1100-6527731/" data-ref-id="1100-6527731">PC next year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bendy-lone-wolf-roguelike-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Joey Drew Studios has announced a new&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>game in the form of&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf</em>, but it looks like this one will be taking a slightly different tack with regards to genre.</p>

<p>Where previous&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>games were (by and large) first-person horror affairs,&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>is a roguelike that pits its titular canine Boris against "endlessly generated corridors" and "ever increasing odds".</p>

<p>Exploring the twisting hallways of the <em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>series' fictional Joey Drew Studios (for which the developer is also named), Boris will need his wits about him as "monsters and obstacles emerge from every direction".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bendy-lone-wolf-announced-boris.jpg?itok=U1Bd5DSa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bendy-lone-wolf-announced-boris.jpg?itok=6YeGBlx2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>pits Boris against the ever-shifting corridors of Joey Drew Studios.</figcaption></figure><p>As Boris explores, he'll come up against the "cartoon creeps of the Dark Puddles", and it's up to you to use the weapons and resources you've gathered, as well as "the clever use of dangerous traps", to get rid of them.</p>

<p>Additionally, you'll be chased by a truly terrifying foe known only as the Ink Demon, and it sounds like you won't be able to fight him. Instead, you'll have to "run and hide" when you hear the "beating of his ink heart".</p>

<p>It's a shift away from&nbsp;<em>Bendy</em>'s traditional first-person horror puzzling, but it looks like the game still retains the signature atmosphere of the&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>series. You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>Action roguelikes (or roguelites) based on popular franchises are becoming increasingly prevalent. In the last couple of years alone, we've seen the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-another-stellar-aa-addition-to-prince-of-persia-franchise" rel="nofollow"><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redacted-callisto-protocol-spinoff-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Redacted</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em></a>&nbsp;carrying that particular torch.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>will be released sometime next year for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3232610/Bendy_Lone_Wolf/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, and it'll also be available on mobile devices. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Bendy</em>-related.</p>

The RG34XX can be <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg34xx">ordered through Anbernic’s website</a> for $69.99, but is discounted to $63.99 until December 18th. It comes in four colors, including the GBA’s original purple and black, as well as transparent green and red options.</p><p>Although it looks nearly identical to the original GBA’s hardware, the RG34XX adds a pair of additional action buttons, two more shoulder buttons, microSD card slots, an HDMI port, and a larger 3.4-inch display with a 720x480 resolution and a 3:2 aspect ratio. The handheld also appears to carry over the GBA’s volume dial, but it’s actually a two-way toggle switch allowing the volume to be adjusted up and down in small increments.</p><p>The RG34XX only became available for sale starting today, but Anbernic sent units to reviewers last week so we already have our first impressions of the new handheld. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Russ Crandall</a>, who runs the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RetroGameCorps">Retro Game Corps</a>, found the emulator to be a “nearly perfect” recreation of Nintendo’s hardware. That can be either a good or bad thing, depending on how you remember the GBA’s ergonomics.</p><p>The RG34XX is powered by the Allwinner H700 chipset that Anbernic has already used in eight other devices. It won’t be able to play all the games released for 3D consoles like the Nintendo 64, Sega Dreamcast, and Sony PSP, but the handheld will handle 16-bit games with ease, and excels at emulating the Game Boy Advance given the matching screen ratio.</p><div><figcaption><em>The secondary set of shoulder buttons on the RG34XX are smaller and positioned in a way that larger hands may struggle to comfortably reach.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Keep Retro</cite></p></div><p><a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/anbernic-rg34xx-review/">Retro Handhelds</a>, a site that focuses on portable devices for playing classic games, also found the RG34XX to be an accurate recreation of the GBA, but found it a little cramped for larger hands to play. The RG34XX’s primary shoulder buttons, located in the same position as the GBA’s felt good. However, the secondary set, which are smaller and positioned closer to where the GBA’s cartridge slot was located, were not very comfortable to use.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was a massive hit from the start--so much so that the sales of Elden Ring have almost caught up with From's previous franchise, Dark Souls, in just under three years.</p><p>Bandai Namco has announced that as of September 2024, Elden Ring has sold 28.6 million copies worldwide. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC expansion surely helped raise those numbers in 2024. Before Elden Ring's 2022 release, the Dark Souls games sold 27 million copies combined. This led some observers to suggest that Elden Ring had already surpassed Dark Souls' all-time numbers.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1868133441243394315" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Fun Fact: The entire Dark Souls series had sold 27 million units combined prior to Elden Ring's release. <br>Now Elden Ring alone has surpassed that total. <a href="https://t.co/Y8yLNzdhfZ" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/Y8yLNzdhfZ</a></p>  — Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1868133441243394315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>However, that was a premature assessment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m finally playing <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. I’ve had a good time so far climbing all over the game’s Vatican map and getting into clumsy fistfights, but one thing that hasn’t been such a good time are the quests that involve the in-game camera, because I hate in-game cameras.</p><p>(Spoilers for the first quest and some early side missions of <em>Indiana Jones</em>.)</p><p>Early on in the game, you have to purchase a camera. You need it to move the story forward, but it’s also used in side activities: you’ll overhear some nuns wishing they had a photo of Indy’s pal Father Antonio, so you can go snap a pic and give it to them. A priest is bummed he didn’t get a photo of the Sistine Chapel, so you can take one for him. As I wandered the Vatican, I’d constantly get prompts that there was something I could take a picture of; I’d equip my camera, raise it to my face, and swing the viewfinder around until the game told me what it wanted me to snap.</p><figure></figure><p>These kinds of tasks in games drive me nuts. I’ve always chalked this up to being primarily a PC gamer–my whole machine is basically a camera, able to take screenshots with a single button press, so in-game cameras make a simple task more clunky by throwing a bunch of interface stuff in the way. I hate having to swap things around in my inventory just to <em>look</em> at something, the task I’m already mainly engaged in through playing a first-person game. I hate trying to figure out what a game wants me to take a picture of and then trying to take whatever the game thinks is an acceptable picture of it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Indiana Jones</em>’ implementation of this task at least <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3ldf5ohpbdk23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guides you </a>toward the correct framing by giving you a viewfinder to line up with, and it also gives you visual and audio prompts when there’s something photographable nearby. But last night, when I was playing through the area under the Vatican, I kept getting photo prompts as I was busy evading fascists and trying to escape the labyrinthian area; really not the time to stop for photos! (I should also mention that I’m playing on keyboard and mouse despite the game suggesting I don’t, which makes pulling things out of my inventory slightly more cumbersome than I imagine it is with a controller.) So far, most of the game's camerawork has been optional, so as long as I can deal with ignoring the little prompt, I can mostly pretend it doesn’t exist. I’m not sure how long that will last, though. </p><p>I complained about these quests on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3ldeyxhhy622r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, where many people defended their love of in-game camera quests, or games like <em>Umurangi Generation</em> or <em>Pokemon Snap</em> that are <em>just</em> about taking pictures. I support all of this! I’m envious that you are able to find joy where I am not, through a very popular mechanic that many people seem to like. I know that my dislike of in-game camera quests is a narrow personal gripe, getting into “<a href="https://aftermath.site/i-hate-double-jump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hating double jump</a>” territory, and I appreciate hearing why other people like them because maybe, one day, I can learn to like them too. Please teach me your ways or, failing that, at least help me feel like less of a killjoy by admitting that you don't like them either.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2024-future-class-game-changer-geoff-keighley"><h3>With The Future Class On Hold, The Game Awards’ Attempts At Doing Good Produce Mixed Results</h3></a><p>Geoff Keighley wants to be perceived as an agent of change for the better, but he's propped up by the status quo</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile-brings-a-classic-detective-mystery-next-year.1062579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/agatha-christie-death-on-nile-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microids has announced&nbsp;<em>Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile</em>, a brand new adaptation of one of the mystery writer's most celebrated books, and the adventure game is due to hit PC and current-gen consoles next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.microids.com/microids-unveils-the-video-game-adaptation-of-the-iconic-novel-agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a>, Microids says its&nbsp;<em>Death on the Nile&nbsp;</em>adaptation will explore "all-new plots, advanced gameplay mechanics and a unique setting" in the form of 1970s Egypt, so even if you've read the book, it sounds like you'll still have plenty to discover.</p>

<p>This time around, you won't just be playing as the legendary Hercule Poirot, but also as new detective Jane Royce, who must pursue her own investigation adjacent to Poirot's. The two investigations will then "collide" in Abu Simbel, an important location in the original novel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile-jane-royce.jpg?itok=Xo8KrHNY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile-jane-royce.jpg?itok=Yc5zzHQJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile&nbsp;</em>introduces us to Jane Royce, a new detective character.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'll know if you've read Christie's original book, Jane Royce is an entirely new creation for this game, so it'll be interesting to see where her investigation takes her and how it dovetails with the mystery from the novel.</p>

<p>As well as a new character and new plot threads, Microids' adaptation of&nbsp;<em>Death on the Nile&nbsp;</em>will also offer a raised level of difficulty, "more complex puzzles", and "more freedom in the progression of the investigation", according to Microids head David Chomard.</p>

<p>He also promises a closer dovetailing of Poirot's and Royce's stories when compared to those of Poirot and Joanna Locke in&nbsp;<em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>, which was Microids Studio Lyon's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/murder-on-orient-express-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous stab at a Poirot game</a>.</p>

<p>You'll use the detectives' mindmap - which looks not unlike the mind palace from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sherlock-holmes-awakened-gets-release-date-goes-gold" rel="nofollow">Frogwares'</a>&nbsp;<em>Sherlock Holmes&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/how-frogwares-created-sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-without-crunch" rel="nofollow">games</a> - to piece the cases together, and you'll then confront suspects to expose their lies. It all sounds like classic detective adventure stuff.</p>




<p>We don't have a release date for <i>Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile&nbsp;</i>yet, but when it arrives, you'll be able to play it for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3150480/Agatha_Christie__Death_on_the_Nile/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.

			<p>There’s an ungodly number of new games released every week these days, and it’s a lot to just keep up with what’s coming out, let alone play them all. On top of the sheer volume of general chaff and nonsense we get served, there are also games that are very similar to something else, but with a couple of tweaks – just look at the bullet heaven genre that Vampire Survivors spawned. So, in amongst all of that, TankHead stands out as being quite refreshing. It’s not perfect, but it is novel, and that counts for a lot.</p>
<p><iframe title="TankHead - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KzYw01FIwUc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>TankHead is set in a world where mechs are actually humans that have infused their spirits into floating robots that then build tanks on their heads… I think. Alright, so basically people can project themselves into a little drone, and then use that drone to explore areas they wouldn’t normally be able to. Some people that do this get lost in the sauce a little bit though, and they become TankHeads, horrifying masses of technology and human spirit. The first one of these you meet is an enormous tanker with too many weapons, too many limbs, and a big old life bar. It’s seriously weird in a wonderful way.</p>


<p>You play as someone called Whitaker, who’s looking for a way to get into the Event Containment Area, the main area that people can’t go into. To that end, you hook your little drone up to a vehicle and just drive in there. Thankfully, considering what you’ll find in the ECA, that vehicle is actually a tank.</p>


<p>The majority of the game has you driving between objectives, getting into a few fights with some incredibly strange enemies, and then doing a little bit of scavenging to get more ammo, fuel, and new parts – you’ll need to hurry to grab them before they blow up, but can apply new parts in the field for an instant boost. It’s a nice mix-and-match of things to do, and while it can get old if you play for too long, each individual mission doesn’t ask too much of your time.</p>
<p>If you don’t succeed in doing all of your main objectives in any given mission, then you’ll be booted back to before you started, stripped of any new parts you found on your attempt and given the opportunity to rejig your tank before you try again, so long as you have enough funds. It’s a little bit extraction shooter, a little bit roguelike in that sense. You can also get permanent upgrades using chips you can find, which is a nice bit of progression.</p>

<p>The combat feels good for the most part, and while it quickly becomes clear that your only real strategy is strafing with your strongest armour toward the enemy and shooting back at them. The variety of enemies is good, whether it’s smaller spider-bots and drones or rival tanks of various designs, where you need to chip away at their armour to reveal weak spots. The AI can be a little simplistic, but it all comes together to be fairly satisfying and fun.</p>
<p>It all builds up to the huge spectacles of the boss battles, which really lean in on the bizarre kitbash vibe of the enemies and take them to new heights. You’ve seen the multi-legged walking building and flying stingray in the launch trailer, but there’s plenty more beyond these. The only downside is that, because the fundamental formula strafing to avoid damage while picking off armour to reveal weakspots doesn’t change, these can feel like a slog and bullet-spongey.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		TankHead is, overall, an enjoyable and interesting take on tank gameplay and on roguelike ideas. It looks fantastic, the story is compelling, and the world it's set in is very cool. I like it, but I don't love it. A bit more variety would have been nice, but in the end, it's going to be exactly what some players are looking for, and that's gonna be great for them.	</p></div>

			<p>Tales of series remasters will be released fairly consistently in the future, according to the series producer Yusuke Tomizawa.</p>
<p>Speaking during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs4h2yfF8D4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tales of Series 30th Anniversary Project event</a>, the JRPG series producer talked about what's next for the series in terms of remasters, saying that Bandai Namco is planning to release remastered entries in the series fairly consistently in the future. He also added that a development line for the Remastered Project has been created to support this consistent release plan, so we should expect older entries in the series besides Tales of Graces f to become available on modern platforms in the future relatively quickly, which is great news considering how most entries in the series are stuck on previous generation consoles.</p>
<p><iframe title="『テイルズ オブ』シリーズ 30周年プロジェクト スペシャル生配信" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fs4h2yfF8D4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The next month or so is going to be a great time for fans of the Tales of series. Before the aforementioned Tales of Graces f Remastered launches on PC and consoles next month, a dedicated team called Life Bottle Production will launch its English translation patch for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-rebirth-english-patch/">Tales of Rebirth</a>, one of the 2D entries in the series originally launched on PlayStation 2 which will unlikely ever be remastered. This translation patch will launch later today.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is Tales of Arise, which launched back in 2021 on PC and consoles. The game is a solid addition to the series, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-arise-keeping-the-flame-alive/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/festive-stellar-blade-update-brings-new-costumes-and-more-tomorrow.1062546/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/festive-stellar-blade-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Shift Up has announced a holiday-themed&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>update, and it's bringing all kinds of festive goodies for you to enjoy, including new costumes, new decorations for certain areas, and more.</p>

<p>Previous&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>updates have brought things like a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>&nbsp;and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-new-game-plus-mode" rel="nofollow">New Game Plus mode</a>, but this one's all about celebrating the holiday season, and the new costumes and content reflect that aim.</p>

<p>First up, Xion now sports its own Christmas tree, and The Last Gulp has been "decorated for the holidays". New seasonal music will play in the camp as well, contributing to a festive atmosphere and "melting away battle tension".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-holiday-update-festive-outfit.jpg?itok=jXGU0VJX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-holiday-update-festive-outfit.jpg?itok=I95xgi7y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Blade</em>'s new holiday update brings new costumes and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>update without new costumes, and this one brings a festive Santa dress for Eve to wear, described by Shift Up as giving the game's protagonist an "adorable and festive appearance".</p>

<p>A new hairstyle, Santa Girl, has also been added, in addition to accessories like "Snow Crystal Glasses, Wreath Earrings, and Sleigh Ear Cuffs". Suffice it to say Shift Up's going all in with the holiday theming for this one.</p>

<p>It's not just Eve getting in on the festive fun, either. Adam also gets a new costume in the form of "I'm No Santa", which sees him riding atop the shoulders of a fake Santa. It's a cute costume idea, but perhaps not as cute (or horrifying) as your drone's Rudolph cosmetic.</p>

<p>If you want to, you can disable all of this festive fun and just play&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>as it was originally intended, but where's the fun in being a grinch, eh?</p>

            <p>Sometimes dogs are hard to shut up. Over a year and half after releasing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hrot">Hrot</a> from early access, the developer of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>-inspired shooter has fixed the dogs after discovering that a few of the canines have been, for some players, barking in a hideous and endless loop. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"A lot of people have complained about some barking," said developer Spytihněv in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/824600/announcements/detail/606394123884168300?snr=2___">an update post</a>. "There are some negative reviews about it, but I've always thought that it's just some people who don't like the dog barking while [firing guns]. Today I found out that on some PC configurations there was a looping unbearable barking." </p>
<p>Here is how one dog is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JXA7CvNZgY">meant to behave</a> in the game. And here is an example of the same dog, but <a href="https://x.com/DInexistente/status/1868377773313765755">infinitely barking</a>. You can shut the pup up for two seconds by feeding him until he vomits, but then he just starts yapping again. Then again, is this too not normal dog behaviour? Who can say. Judging by some of the Steam comments, it looks like this bug was affecting Linux-based systems.</p>
<p>"It's a shame that such a bug survived there for almost 2 years," said the developer, "levels with the ratters must have been awful, even downright unplayable, brrr."</p>
<p>I haven't played Hrot (to my shame, as a Quake-liker) but I do know that the "ratters" mentioned here refer to those same puppies that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAGPFrzehyE">hunt rats for you in this level</a>. They are very cute, but it wasn't the highlight of the game for Rick, who wrote our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hrot-review">Hrot review</a>. He preferred the opening episode:</p>
<blockquote>"Here, the game's socialist parody and nuclear anxiety are in perfect sync. As you wander through Prague's abandoned streets, gymnasiums, and cultural centres, you'll encounter pictures of Czechoslovakia's first communist dictator Klement Gottwald, which you can kiss to show your allegiance to the nation. Later, you'll descend into some subterranean chamber lined with desiccated corpses, as that Geiger-counter crackle rises to an overwhelming crescendo."</blockquote>
<p>This makes it sound very high-brow. It is also a game in which you shoot a horse wearing a gas mask with a double-barrelled shotgun. It is a game where you fight a doppelganger of Putin riding a bear. Since finishing work on the shooter, the developer turned his sights to the strategy genre, releasing a retro RTS set on "a sandy planet with horses, tractors and techno music". It is called - let me check... ah, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2630920/Shrot/">Shrot</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

On the series’ 20th anniversary, there are now dozens of sequels, upgrades, ports, and spin-offs that have introduced new creatures, iterated on the core boss fighting design, and expanded the lore in fascinating ways. To help explain what the franchise’s universe is all about, Capcom turned to none other than <em>Star Wars</em>’ Rey:</p><p>“Since ages long forgotten, one word has defined our very existence: balance,” Ridley says at the beginning of the brief history of <em>Monster Hunter</em>. “From the humble Felon to the ferocious Tigrex, every living being across this vast land plays its part in the great cycle, including us.” She explains why players spend all their time killing stuff in the game, as well as the hierarchy of beasts, from weak packs of Jaggi to all-powerful Elder Dragons. </p><p><em>Monster Hunter </em>has always walked an uncomfortable line between the necessities of repetitive arcade action loops and the narrative repercussions of the ensuing carnage. “There is no thirst for violence, just an appreciation of life,” Ridley explains. More so than any previous entry in the series, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> seems intent on trying to convey the need for harmony, exploration, and curiosity as motivating virtues in its nevertheless brutal boss-slaying world. </p><p>The series’ first mainline entry built from the ground-up for the current generation of consoles, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 28 along with a slew of other big games in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/february-2025-too-many-games-assassins-creed-civ-7-ps5-1851657731?_gl=1*1q0b6l0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDM1NzkwMy4xMzUuMS4xNzM0MzYxOTc4LjQzLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/february-2025-too-many-games-assassins-creed-civ-7-ps5-1851657731?_gl=1*1q0b6l0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDM1NzkwMy4xMzUuMS4xNzM0MzYxOTc4LjQzLjAuMA..">what’s already a super-packed month</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia’s upcoming GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards were recently spotted on Zotac’s website.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/zotac-confirms-geforce-rtx-5090-with-32gb-gddr7-memory-5080-and-5070-series-listed-as-well" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>, Zotac’s website featured listings for the upcoming, next-gen Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs. These listings have been removed; however, there are still some hints that point towards an upcoming announcement. If you head to Zotac’s <a href="https://www.zotac.com/us/product/graphics_card/all?field_filter_g_memory_type_tid%5B%5D=2954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, you will observe new additions to its filters section. Players can filter the GPUs on the website by GDDR7 memory type and 32 GB capacity; these features are not available for the current RTX 40 series GPUs.</p>



<p>Five new Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs surfaced on Zotac’s website, including RTX 5090, RTX 5090D (China Exclusive), RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070. The website didn’t feature the RTX 5060 and RTX 5080D GPUs. The listing also confirms 32 GB GDDR7 memory for the upcoming GPUs. With the graphics cards already surfacing on hardware manufacturer’s websites, it seems like Nvidia might be gearing up for an announcement soon. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-pc-game-of-2024.1062528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-game-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The PC is arguably the definitive gaming platform, deeper and broader than any of the bespoke boxes you stick under your TV. It has become a catch-all for multiplatform games, an inevitable second home for first-party console exclusives, and a bastion for smaller games that may not be able to develop ports. It’s also a destination of its own for unique, mouse-and-keyboard-driven genres that just aren’t quite as comfy to play while sitting on a couch, while also being the place for portable-friendly games thanks to the likes of the Steam Deck. Unsurprisingly, it meant we had a lot of games to pick from when it came to crowning our 2024 PC favourites. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While plenty of incredible games came to both the PC and other platforms this year, our picks for the best PC games of 2024 stand as a mix of impressive experiences across multiple genres – some of which you simply can’t play with a controller in your hand. There’s the intricate, automated empires of Satisfactory; the exquisite puzzle design of Animal Well; the just-one-more-round compulsion of Balatro; the thrilling detective work of The Rise of the Golden Idol, and more besides.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But only one can be crowned the best PC game of 2024. What did the IGN team judge to be the most worthy? Let’s take a look at the results…</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Honorable Mentions</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With so many excellent games to choose from this year, the spread of votes for the best PC game was understandably broad. The varied taste of the IGN team meant that several games picked up a strong number of votes, but sadly not enough to secure a podium finish. Of those games, the two that only just missed out were 1000xResist and The Rise of the Golden Idol.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plenty of games tell a compelling story, but it’s the way 1000xResist tells its story that truly stands out. It is a confident and moving tale that isn’t afraid to get deep, blending surreal concepts with emotionally charged deconstructions of the human condition in a manner reminiscent of games like Nier: Automata. Thanks to its narrative-first design being something of a first cousin to visual novels, 1000xResist’s story is able to double down on delivering ideas and plot in innovative ways that raise the bar for its genre. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/mixcollage-13-dec-2024-01-42-pm-1990-1734126162303.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Rise of the Golden Idol and 1000xResist</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A follow-up to 2022’s breakout detective game, The Rise of the Golden Idol continues to impress by empowering you to solve its crimes with hands-on detective work. Set in the 1970s, it presents multiple diorama-like crime scenes in each chapter, demanding you to gather clues via close observation and then piece together exactly what happened. Rarely are the actual events as simple as they seem, and the truth can only be deduced from spotting minor things such as an empty gun chamber or the hidden subtext in an angry note. It’s a “puzzle” game that’s not simply about finding the right button to push, with an artistic presentation uniquely its own.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Animal Well</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/animalthumb-1716580525971.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Animal Well</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">2D pixel art platformers can feel like they are a dime a dozen these days, but Animal Well is different. That may sound like a cliche setup, something you’ve heard before about plenty of other games, but it really is true here. Animal Well wears the skin of a puzzle-driven metroidvania while also twisting all the usual trends that come along with that structure. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You aren’t fighting your way through waves of enemies or upping your missile capacity here, in part thanks to Animal Well’s almost complete rejection of violence. Instead you’ll find bubble-blowing wands that can produce floating platforms, frisbees that can tame ferocious dogs, and firecrackers that illuminate the dark to reveal the hidden platforming challenges ahead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real joy of Animal Well, though, is realising that there’s far, far more to each item than their obvious use. And then you begin to realise that there’s far, far more to each location than the obvious objectives. And as you begin to peel back the layers, you soon discover that what initially appeared to be a five-hour metroidvania is instead a gargantuan puzzle with enough secrets to discover that they could fill an actual well. It’s an innovative and endlessly enticing take on otherwise well-worn territory. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Satisfactory</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/satisfactoryversion1-0tlaunchtrailer-ign-blogroll-1725975211485.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Satisfactory</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After nearly five years in Early Access, Satisfactory’s 1.0 update arrived this year to cement it as one of the absolute best automation games around. It’s a game all about building assembly lines and laying down endless miles of conveyor belts, which is much more of an immense joy than it may initially seem. The subsequent tech climb that sees your factories become faster, more efficient, and inevitably more complicated always keeps you looking forward to that next big breakthrough. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sight of spaghetti-like factories that span a thousand acres can seem intimidating at first, but don’t let that put you off: Satisfactory’s well-constructed web of objectives helps you build confidence in your engineering capabilities. Within just a few hours you’ll have graduated from novice conveyor belt enthusiast to an automation veteran, capable of troubleshooting catastrophic malfunctions as if they were minor inconveniences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while the factories are your primary concern, Satisfactory is much more than the end result. This is also a Minecraft-style open world in which you must delve into caves, survive deadly gas clouds, and stripmine rock formations in order to gather the materials needed to both fund and fuel your colossal creations. Throw in a few friends working together in co-op to pave over every inch of green on this detailed alien world and you’ve got a recipe for “blink and an hour has passed” captivation that rarely quits. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: UFO 50</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/09/26/ufo-50---screen-3-1569520006711.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">UFO 50</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">UFO 50 is an almost incomprehensible achievement. The concept of an old-school gaming system being miraculously unearthed and made available today is a cute one already, and I wouldn’t blame you if you assumed the catalogue of 50 games that came with it were largely just quant minigames that make for an amusing but fleeting distraction. But that’s simply not the case. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each and every entry in this library is essentially the size of an entire retro game of its own, many of which would have surely been standout hits in their era if they actually existed at that time. But this isn’t a collection of games made in the 1980s, and the deeper down the rabbit hole you go the more obvious that becomes. The games of UFO 50 are <em>smart.</em> Like, <em>modern day indie darling</em> <em>smart. </em>Each one weaves excellent new ideas into the canvass of a retro classic, resulting in games that feel like toys of yesteryear but play like a 2024 Steam top-seller. Echoes of No Man’s Sky, Hotline Miami, Into The Breach and more can be found between the scan lines, but each game is more than just a de-make of its inspiration. UFO 50 is essentially a playable examination of the past and present of video games.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s just so much to dig into here, with an almost alarmingly consistent level of quality. UFO 50 could have been half as big as it is and it still would have been impressive – instead, it’s borderline stunning.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Winner: Balatro</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/05/balatrothumb-1725546218547.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Balatro</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve already played Balatro, you probably understand why it’s here. In fact, odds are good you might still be playing it right now. And if you haven’t, I’d recommend you do, but the kinder thing might be to tell you to run. Because once you’ve jumped into its smart mix of roguelite deckbuilding and digital poker, you might find your free time slipping away and the sun creeping up during what was supposed to still be night. But then again, it sure is worth it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s something about Balatro that effortlessly hooks you, the “just one more turn” syndrome distilled into its purest form. Everything about its fairly simple presentation is tuned perfectly to be endlessly satisfying, bringing delight or destruction with every card you play. While on the surface it’s a poker game that’s approachable for anyone who can tell their flushes from their full houses, don’t be fooled into thinking you need to know the rules of the classic casino game to play. In fact, this isn’t <em>actually</em> poker. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Balatro is an entirely original idea, and while poker hands may be at the centre of the screen, the real centre of the experience is building wild game-breaking decks that can send your score multiplier skyrocketing. Each round allows you to tweak and improve your collection of cards, switching out suits to more easily achieve better hands, or using celestial powers to assemble literal wildcards. The options are unbelievably deep for those who then want to break the intuitive tropes open with smart modifiers – you may have put together a four-of-a-kind in your day, but play a five-of-a-kind for the first time and you won’t ever want to go back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the truly impressive trick of Balatro, making you think you know what it’s doing at every step of the way, then teasing you in deeper as more game-shifting Jokers are discovered, more decks are unlocked, and the scores you consider impressive start stretching from the thousands into exponents so large you need a degree to decipher them. Wrap that up in a lo-fi presentation as deceptively well designed as the card game it houses, and you’ve got a game we’re undoubtedly going to be playing for years to come. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Of the four best decks in Pokémon TCG Pocket — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Mewtwo ex, Pikachu ex, Charizard ex, and Starmie ex</a> — only one (Pikachu) doesn't rely on these additional mana generation cards. They're therefore very powerful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Misty is one such card, as players can flip a coin until hitting tales, and add one energy to a single Pokémon for every heads. This obviously gives players a 50% chance of getting an additional energy, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokmon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain">Misty became Pokémon TCG Pocket's most infamous cards for instances when players would get several heads in a row</a> and add five, six, seven, or more energy to a single Pokémon.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/misty-1734356473654.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a soft limit to how useful this is, as most cards don't need more than three or four energy to use their most powerful attacks. but that's all about to change. A handful of cards including Stage 1 Pokémon Vaporeon were revealed in the Mythical Island trailer, and it's this card that could turn those several successful coin flip turns into practically an instant win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vaporeon has an Ability called Wash out, which lets players move around an unlimited number of water type energy between their Pokémon. This means the several energy created by successful Misty turns are no longer trapped on one Pokémon and can instead be spread around evenly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At its most extreme, players on Turn 3, the opening player's first chance to attack, could therefore play a Misty and have a board with Starmie ex and two Articuno ex all capable of unleashing their strongest attacks; players would have, say, eight energy at their disposal instead of the two provided to most.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This exact play will be the exception and not the rule, but it will almost certainly make those already annoyed by Misty even more frustrated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vaporeon could still be an incredibly strong card outside of these major Misty moves too, as being able to move around energy freely offers myriad new solutions to old problems.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/screenshot-38-1734356696953.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If an Active Pokémon is near a knock out, for example, players could shift all its energy to another Pokémon so the replacement is immediately ready to fight next turn, or transfer energy the opposite way to allow it to retreat and not damage the player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It therefore could be enough to bump the Starmie ex above the other meta leaders, though with more than 80 new cards coming to the game in Mythical Island, the entire player versus player scene could be due a mix up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived October 30 and is a certified hit for Creatures Inc. and The Pokémon Company, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">having earned an estimated $200 million in its first month</a> across more than 60 million downloads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as Pokémon TCG Pocket follows the standard mobile and free to play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Image quality issues, persistent performance wobbles, and challenges with the console's exclusive AI-upscaling technology, PSSR have all been noted. A <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new update for the survival-horror game</a> aims to fix most of these issues, some of which boil down to disabling PSSR entirely.</p><p>Alan Wake 2 is the first game to allow players to toggle PSSR on or off, with the game falling back to its previous implementation of AMD's FSR upscaling when disabled. In most instances, PSSR has been an improvement over FSR (which uses linear scaling as opposed to AI-enchanced upscaling), but Alan Wake 2 has been an outlier. In its analysis of the game on PS5 Pro, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-alan-wake-2-how-does-ps5-pro-handle-one-of-the-best-looking-games-of-this-generation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> observed issues with image quality that FSR handled better. It did, however, note that PSSR was overall a better solution.</p>

<p>It's clear then that developer Remedy is giving players the option to decide for themselves, letting them omit one of the biggest features of the PS5 Pro entirely if they choose. Included in the patch is a new 40fps mode, too, which balances the image enhancements found in the PS5 Pro Quality mode and the fluidity of the Performance mode if you have a display that supports 120Hz.</p><p>Further adjustments to image settings have also been made to the Performance mode to stabilize the frame rate, while other tweaks the to game's ray-traced reflections should reduce their overall noisy presentation. The update also includes some smaller changes to DLC content, as well as minor fixes across all platforms. It's available to download now, with the full patch notes listed below.</p><h3>Improvements and additions</h3><ul><li>[PS5 Pro] Added a new “Balanced” graphics mode. This mode requires compatible displays that can achieve a 120Hz refresh rate. The Balanced mode combines PS5 Pro Quality mode settings including raytracing with Performance mode resolution. This mode targets 40fps.</li><li>[PS5 Pro] Slightly adjusted visual settings of the Performance mode to achieve a more consistent framerate.</li><li>[PS5 Pro] Quality and Balanced mode: Adjusted Raytracing settings to achieve a less noisy image.</li><li>[PS5 Pro] Added an option to toggle PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) On/Off.</li></ul><h3>Fixes</h3><ul><li>[The Lake House] Fixed manuscript collectables that showed the wrong page in Saga’s Mind Place.</li><li>[The Lake House] Fixed “Welcome to the Lake House” video collectable missing audio.</li><li>Minor fixes and optimizations.</li></ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-series-remasters-to-be-released-fairly-consistently-bandai-namco-says.1062489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-series-remasters-regular<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series publisher Bandai Namco has revealed that it plans to release remastered versions of games in the series on a regular basis, and that a special development initiative has been set up to this end.</p>

<p>Speaking as part of a new 30th-anniversary broadcast (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/12/bandai-namco-to-release-remastered-tales-of-titles-fairly-consistently" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>),&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series producer Yusuke Tomizawa says that remastered&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>titles will be released "fairly consistently", and that the studio "intends to continue" remastering&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>games "as much as possible".</p>

<p>He then goes on to say that what he calls the "Remastered Project" now has a dedicated development initiative devoted to it, and that the team is hard at work on that project, although he didn't say which&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game is up for a remaster next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-combat-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=uhSZKwAP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-combat-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=qITewjIS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More remastered&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>games are on the way, Bandai Namco says.</figcaption></figure><p>Tomizawa's words come around a month before the newest&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em>, is set to launch. It's a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f</em>, which is itself a port of the 2009 Wii game&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces</em>, with the Wii version only ever being released in Japan.</p>

<p>Contrary to what you might believe, the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series does not include the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tales-of-shire" rel="nofollow">Tales of the Shire</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em></a>. It's confusing, I know, but Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>games carry a specific action RPG formula that marries real-time combat with fairly typical JRPG dungeon and overworld exploration.</p>

<p>The most recent mainline&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game, and the series' 17th main entry overall, is 2021's&nbsp;<em>Tales of Arise</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-arise-has-sold-3-million-copies-before-releasing-on-game-pass-and-playstation" rel="nofollow">managed to rack up three million sales for itself</a> before being added to Microsoft and Sony's subscription services earlier this year.</p>

<p>Tomizawa has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tales-of-arise-interview-yusuke-tomizawa/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">described</a>&nbsp;<em>Arise&nbsp;</em>as a&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game for first-timers, but he has also acknowledged the importance of making the RPG, which has a slightly more realistic visual sensibility than many of its predecessors, appeal to "everyone".</p>




<p>As for which&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game is next to get the remastering treatment, it's far too early to say.</p>

<p>Tomizawa and Bandai Namco are staying tight-lipped, and since&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f Remastered&nbsp;</em>still hasn't come out yet, it's likely that launch will take up a lot of the publisher's attention for the foreseeable future. Stay tuned for more.</p>

On average, it will take players anywhere between 50-100 hours to max out a class through various end-game activities, depending on your playstyle and any assistance you receive. That’s a lot of playtime if you’re intent on trying out everything on offer. Let’s go over which classes are the best options for new <em>Path of Exile 2</em> players. </p><figure id="" data-id="8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-recommend-id="image://8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the class selection screen focuses on the Mercenary class." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the class selection screen focuses on the Mercenary class." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-recommend-id="image://8266c27c78f4650b95a54bcbfc974e25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the class selection screen focuses on the Mercenary class." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While you should always play whatever class speaks to you the most, from a playstyle and preferences perspective, <strong>choose the Mercenary as your first class if you want to see everything <em>Path of Exile 2</em> offers</strong>. It’s one of the all-new classes designed for the ARPG sequel, and as such, developer Grinding Gear Games spent a lot of time refining its abilities, gems, and passive skills, making for an exceptionally strong playstyle.</p><p>The Mercenary primarily utilizes crossbows with various round-based attachments and unique grenades to deal damage. One of the first skills you’ll unlock as part of the game’s prologue is Fragmentation Rounds, which essentially turns your crossbow into a close-range shotgun loaded with Dragon’s Breath rounds. Every shot, while slow to fire and reload, unleashes a burst of fire that deals significant up-close damage to enemies.</p><figure id="" data-id="8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-recommend-id="image://8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Mercenary’s skill menu features the Fragmentation Rounds ability gem slotted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Mercenary’s skill menu features the Fragmentation Rounds ability gem slotted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-recommend-id="image://8db37e37db87020798f7e6e9d6c07151" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Mercenary’s skill menu features the Fragmentation Rounds ability gem slotted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>From there, you’ll gain access to the game’s skill panel to unlock additional abilities once you receive an Uncut Gem. There are a few choices for the Mercenary’s best starting skills, but there’s nothing wrong with experimenting. You’ll receive countless gems throughout your playthrough, allowing you to mix and match or outright remove and replace abilities depending on the zone or your preferences. You’re not locked into a single build!</p><p>One crucial aspect to consider when selecting a class in <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is how it plays solo. Many people play the game alone, though the sequel allows up to six players to cooperate while clearing bosses and zones. After spending approximately 30 hours playing through the main storyline as a Mercenary, I can attest that, while weak against certain bosses, the class does exceptionally well for the most part. It keeps enemies at range with diverse abilities designed to reduce movement capabilities, AoE (area-of-effect) attacks that make clearing small mobs of standard enemies a breeze, and single-shot damage attacks designed for elite enemies, like bosses and named mobs.</p><figure id="" data-id="670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-recommend-id="image://670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the game’s inventory screen features the Mercenary’s armor choice." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the game’s inventory screen features the Mercenary’s armor choice." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-recommend-id="image://670245bd8ae6c2a138e7f34c75109776" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the game’s inventory screen features the Mercenary’s armor choice." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Furthermore, the ability to wear various armor types, from leather to plate, makes the Mercenary a stalwart choice. If you don’t mind moving slowly, becoming a mobile tank, then heavy armor locks down your defense. But if you want to keep moving, use run-and-gun tactics with the crossbow, wear light armor, and dodge-roll away from danger with relative ease.</p><p>There’s a lot to love about Path of Exile 2, from its classes to the many tough-as-nails boss fights you’ll encounter, but it appears there’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-patch-notes-dodge-roll-rewards-mods-1851717522&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-patch-notes-dodge-roll-rewards-mods-1851717522">loot problem the devs intend to solve</a></span>.

The first response to the post on X (formerly known as Twitter) is a player asking, “Why would anyone want to fast forward through this masterpiece, you need to experience every second of it?”</p><p>Good question! When the speed is doubled, players talking become mostly incomprehensible. It’s fine for reading the subtitles, but makes the entire scene sound like fast-forwarding through an old VHS. It might be fine for trying to consume info really quickly in a podcast, especially when those podcasts are multiple hours long and full of repeating conversations and fluff, but it does seem to defeat the purpose of engaging with an epic, dialogue-driven RPG. </p><p>Many modern blockbusters have various ways of dealing with players’ impatience. Some are very clever about silencing characters and skipping only through the next piece of spoken dialogue when players hit the next button. Others, like <em>The Witcher 3</em>, fast-forward the animations but not the voice acting to move things along. Personally, there are still lots of conversations in games that I wish weren’t voice acted at all, the RPG equivalent of “this could have been an email.” </p><p>Still, <em>FFVII: Rebirth</em>’s new option is better than none at all, especially for players just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-guides-walkthrough-review-1851302235&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-guides-walkthrough-review-1851302235">grinding through side quests or plaything through a new game plus</a></span>. The PlayStation 5 console exclusive is also one of those games for which the Platinum Trophy requires beating the game twice. Those achievement-chasing completionists will certainly appreciate the new 2X speed option. The game is also headed to PC on January 23, 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
