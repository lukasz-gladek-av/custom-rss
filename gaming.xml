			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a> on PC got its <a href="https://support.nixxes.com/hc/en-us/articles/26565118695837-The-Last-of-Us-Part-II-Remastered-PC-Patch-1-1">second patch</a> from developer Nixxes. This update addresses crashing issues that players reported, an audio issue players had while watching the Grounded documentary, fixes for the sliders in the display menu, and more.</p>
<p>However, it does not address the autosave issues that players have reported to Nixxes, which Nixxes says it is still working to fix. For now, Nixxes suggests players try a workaround if they do run into the issue and a potential explanation as to why the problem is occurring in the first place.</p>
<p>"<em>Our investigation shows that issues can occur when OneDrive or similar cloud services block the save file from being written,</em>" Nixxes wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1910698603439444167">post on X</a>. "<em>As a workaround, we suggest that you pause OneDrive while playing the game: Right-click the OneDrive icon in the Windows taskbar, click the gear icon and Pause sync.</em>"</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered arrived on PC right at the beginning of April, and in just over a week, Nixxes has released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-hotfix/">two patches</a> for the game, addressing the big issues players were immediately reporting. At the pace Nixxes is working at, it likely won't take them too much longer to work out a fix for the autosave issue.</p>
<p>Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">dug into the PC port</a> for The Last of Us Part II Remastered when it arrived a little more than a week ago, and even without these patches, at the time he wrote that The Last of Us Part II Remastered "<em>is one of the best games ever made in its genre, and it is absolutely unmissable for anyone who enjoyed Part I. As such, it is hard not to recommend, even though it's an entirely straightforward, albeit not problematic, port</em>."</p>

Elsewhere, there’s photo mode, cross-play, and Xbox Series S split screen. Check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-due-out-in-2025-adds-12-new-subclasses-and-loads-more"><u>Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 8 patch notes</u></a> for more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 new subclasses:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bard - College of Glamour</strong><br>As a College of Glamour Bard, you’ll find you have the power to heal friends and command enemies in equal measure. Cast <strong>Mantle of Inspiration</strong> to bestow your allies with 5 temporary hit points. And should an enemy attack while it is cast, they’ll find themselves <strong>Charmed</strong>. Play your hand correctly and you’ll be able to use this to your advantage with <strong>Mantle of Majesty</strong>. Target Charmed enemies and you can command them to flee, move closer, freeze, drop to the ground, or drop their weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barbarian - Path of Giants</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Opt for the Path of Giants, and your newfound giant strength will make it easier for you to yeet friend and foe alike. Forget chugging potions to pump those muscles, these Barbarians benefit from the <strong>Giant’s Rage</strong> passive that grants both strength and size - allowing you to deal additional damage with Throw attacks. Pockets weighing you down? Not for you and your increased carry capacity!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cleric - Death Domain</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a cleric of death, you’ll find a few dark new tricks up your sleeves - from spells that specialise in necrotic damage to three new necromancy cantrips. This includes <strong>Toll The Dead</strong>, a cantrip that causes 1~8 damage when your cleric rings the bell of impending doom - a number that scales if your target has already been damaged. We’ve also added the homebrewed ability to explode nearby corpses, damaging enemies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Druid - Circle of Stars</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">These Druids look to the stars for answers, accessing powers beyond those offered through the classic wildshapes. Taking on one of three <strong>Starry Forms</strong> for their power - the constellations of the Archer, Chalice, and Dragon. Each one favours a different play style and strategy - the Archer dealing radiant damage with astral arrows, the life-giving Chalice restoring hitpoints to you and others nearby, and the wise Dragon, allowing you to deal damage with an added bonus to constitution rolls. The Starry Forms offer not just a celestial aesthetic, but practical, powerful options to enhance your role as a healer, fighter, or strategist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve been sworn to uphold the principles of law. Stay true to your oath and you'll be rewarded with the power to aid your allies and disrupt your foes. Guide your companions in battle with <strong>Righteous Clarity</strong>, taunt enemies with strategic interrupts, and keep your party standing strong with <strong>Divine Allegiance</strong>, absorbing their damage while restoring their health.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fighter - Arcane Archer</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mastering the dual arts of magic and marksmanship, the Arcane Archer subclass offers unique skills on top of new shooting animations. Banish foes to the Feywild, removing them from the battlefield for a turn, or unleash Psychic damage that forces enemies to make a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the start of their next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Monk - Drunken Master</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Putting the brew in homebrew, as the Drunken Master, you have the ability to consume alcohol straight from your inventory, as well as drink from bottles you see around the Sword Coast, in order to recover Ki. By sharing the bottle with your enemies using <strong>Intoxicating Strike</strong>, you’ll generate a buff towards your Armour Class and your Chance to hit Drunk targets. Drunk enemies are also susceptible to the Drunken Masters' other abilities, like <strong>Sobering Realisation</strong> - which sobers up drunk targets, dealing physical and Psychic damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Swarmkeeper subclass provides Rangers with three kinds of deadly swarms to assist them in combat. The <strong>Cloud of Jellyfish</strong> deals extra lightning damage - potentially shocking your enemy. <strong>The Flurry of Moths</strong> deals Psychic damage, giving you the potential to Blind your enemy. The <strong>Legion of Bees</strong> deals piercing damage and forces the enemy to make a strength-saving throw or be knocked back 15ft. Each swarm also has the ability to provide you with teleportation capabilities!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rogue - Swashbuckler</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Rogue subclass introduces a range of new actions fit for the piratical life. Play dirty by tossing sand at enemies to <strong>Blind</strong> them. Flick your weapon at a target to <strong>Disarm</strong> them. Or use your new <strong>Fancy Footwork</strong> passive while meleeing your enemy to ensure they can’t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a Shadow Magic Sorcerer, you deal in a form of magic that makes you deadliest in darkness. This subclass gives its sorcerer <strong>Superior Darkvision</strong>, as well as the ability to <strong>Shadow Walk</strong> between places of dim light or darkness. It also lets you call forth the perfectly homebrewed <strong>Hound of Ill Omen</strong> to harass your foes, and use <strong>Strength of the Grave</strong> to prevent you from being downed - ideal for those attempting Honour Mode runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warlock - Hexblade</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hexblade Warlocks make a pact with an entity from the Shadowfell that manifests in the form of magical weapons. Curse your enemies and force their souls to do your bidding. Slay any enemy that isn’t generally an element of nature, construct, giant blob, or already dead, and you’ll be able to raise their spirit from their corpse for ten turns. This new summon can deal necrotic damage and will rip away a chunk of your enemy’s soul to provide your Hexblade Warlock with healing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wizard - Bladesinging</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Bladesinging subclass merges swordplay with wizardry. Expect new spellcasting animations when casting spells with your weapon, a new Bladesong ability to grant you supernatural speed, agility, and focus, plus gives you a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN 10 of 2023</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 8, as Larian has signalled, is the final major update for the game and draws a line under what has been a remarkable time for the developer. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">Baldur’s Gate 3 launched to critical acclaim</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larians-huge-2023-profits-revealed">enormous commercial success</a> back in 2023, and has continued to sell strongly throughout 2024 and into 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian shocked the gaming world by confirming its intention to leave Baldur’s Gate 3 and Dungeons &amp; Dragons behind to work on a brand new game, which it teased at various points before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-says-its-full-attention-is-on-its-next-game-media-blackout-for-the-foreseeable">announcing a media blackout to focus on the new mystery project</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">D&amp;D owner Hasbro. however, has teased plans to continue with the series. Speaking to IGN at the Game Developers Conference last month, SVP of digital games at Hasbro, Dan Ayoub, let on that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated"><u>with Larian moving on</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says">Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in Baldur's Gate."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ayoub didn't offer any further information about whether this "stuff" would be a full-blown new Baldur's Gate in the works, or some sort of crossover like the characters had with Magic: The Gathering previously. However, he did acknowledge that he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, but that making one will likely take a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he said. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Larian will celebrate the release of Patch 8 with a Twitch livestream in which senior systems designer, Ross Stephens, will run through the changes and additions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/atomfall-blows-past-2-million-players-in-first-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">Atomfall</a> publisher and developer Rebellion has announced that their new post-apocalyptic adventure in the British countryside has attracted more than <strong>2 million players</strong> within the game's first month.</p>
<p>Rebellion also shared a few in-game statistics about how players have been interacting with Atomfall, like the fact that players have killed more than 5.9 million enemies with cricket bats, ordered over 250,000 pints of beer, drunk 500,000 cups of tea and died from rat swarms more than 420,000 times. Rebellion also pointed out that 'tin of meat' is players' preferred in-game food choice, with more than 14.1 million tins of meat being consumed so far.</p>
<p>In the game's opening weekend, Atomfall surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomfall-surpasses-1-5-million-players-in-its-opening-weekend/">1.5 million players</a>, so it's not surprising that it went well past 2 million within its first month of launch.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It should also be pointed out that part of Atomfall reaching the audience it has is due in part to the game being available on Xbox Game Pass from day one. Still, even considering its inclusion in Microsoft's subscription service, 2 million players in weeks for a brand-new game is still an incredible feat.</p>
<p>Just one year ago, at the time of writing, there were no Fallout-esque games that took the adventure across the pond to the United Kingdom. Now, with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/">Fallout: London</a> last July and Atomfall, we have two of them. This brings up an interesting point as to whether we'll start to see the same kind of post-nuclear apocalypse setting happening outside the United States more often.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/">review</a> of Atomfall, we said, "<em>Atomfall is a thoroughly enjoyable game which looks and plays well, and offers a compelling narrative with surrounding exploration to keep you entertained. It's well-polished, offers good replay value, and encourages you to do things a little different, and isn't bad on the eyes either, with a good design that allows it to both look good and support last-gen consoles."</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/has-schedule-1-been-sued-lawsuit-controversy-explained/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/has-schedule-1-been-sued-lawsuit-controversy-explained.1162014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/has-schedule-1-been-sued-lawsuit-controversy-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1 is one of the most impressive success stories of 2025. The indie drug-dealing game is a hit sensation on Steam, but a lawsuit controversy has jeopardized that feel-good story. </p>



<p>The concept of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> is simple. Players start as small-time drug dealers and work their way up, producing drugs and distributing them. However, It’s not always smooth sailing, as law enforcement and rival cartels will force you to defend your empire. </p>



<p>While relatively straightforward, the addicting gameplay loop is a massive draw. In only a few weeks after launching,  Schedule 1 reached nearly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/#:~:text=You're%20a%20small%2Dtime,coast%20city%20of%20Hyland%20Point." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half a million concurrent players</a> at its peak. The meteoric rise inspired <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console port imitations</a> as other developers tried to steal the magic formula. Yet, Schedule 1 also faces similar clone accusations. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-schedule-1-being-sued">Is Schedule 1 Being Sued?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Schedule 1 puts you in the shoes of a drug dealer. Image via TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Schedule 1 is not being sued</strong>, <strong>but the game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/#:~:text=April%204%2C%202025-,Schedule%201%20Being%20Investigated%20For%20IP%20Copyright%20Infringement%20Claims,full%20investigation%20into%20the%20game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under investigation</a> for IP copyright infringement</strong>. </p>



<p><a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/movie-games-sa-172025-podjecie-decyzji-o-rozpoczeciu-dochodzenia-wzgledem-tworcow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">papbiznes</a> published a document titled “MOVIE GAMES SA (17/2025) Decision to commence investigation against the creators of the Schedule 1 production for claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and related to committing an act of unfair competition against it.”</p>



<p>Movie Games S.A. already had an established foothold in drug-dealing games with Drug Dealer Simulator 1 and Drug Dealer Simulator 2 before Schedule 1, raising questions about whether it is too similar. </p>



<p>The investigation is strongly looking into: “Elements of the game’s plot, mechanics, as well as UI – User Interface.” It finishes by saying: “The Issuer will immediately inform about further actions related to the pursuit of claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and the act of unfair competition in subsequent current reports.”</p>



<p>When news about the investigation surfaced, Schedule 1 fans lept into action and review-bombed the Drug Dealer Simulator games on Steam. The feud forced Movie Games to respond. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-schedule-1-be-sued">Will Schedule 1 be Sued?</h2>



<p><strong>If the investigation concludes that the similarities between Schedule 1 and Drug Dealer Simulator’s game plot, mechanics, UI, or anything else are too close, a lawsuit could be filed. </strong></p>



<p>After the incessant review bombing of Drug Dealer Simulator, Movie Games stepped forward and cleared up any confusion with a post on its <a href="https://x.com/MovieGamesSA/status/1909573722219888913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official X account</a>. </p>



<p>The company made it abundantly clear, “<strong>There is no lawsuit</strong>,” and it’s not the company’s intention to “<strong>Prevent TVGS from selling or developing their game</strong>&nbsp;[Schedule 1].” The statement goes on to say the investigation is being conducted because of the similarities, and “Movie Games, being a publicly traded company,&nbsp;<strong>could face severe litigation for negligence.</strong>“</p>



<p>Movie Games emphasized, “There is no ill will toward TVGS,” and they “<strong>Emailed them best wishes shortly before the release.</strong>“</p>



<p>Despite the reassuring statements, the investigation is ongoing, and we won’t know if there will be a lawsuit until it concludes. </p>

<p>The investigation hasn’t slowed down the creation of new content for TVGS. Schedule 1 has an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensive roadmap</a>, including the addition of fishing, shooting, mini-games, and more.

<p>On the way to Room 46, you’re likely to come across the Billiard Room. No, we’re not stopping for a quick game as we need to head into here so we can complete the ever-changing Darts puzzle, which offers free bonuses if you can complete it.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-creator-praises-blue-prince-as-one-of-the-best-games-hes-ever-played/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Prince</a> is a game where I cherish the first few hours. Eventually, you come across the same rooms and items, and it becomes familiar. The initial wonderment comes from the beauty of exploration. You draft new rooms, see what they do and what they hold, and you find curiosities such as the Billiard Room.</p>



<p>Inside awaits a devious little puzzle. If you’re having trouble with it, don’t worry, I did at first. But once you understand its cunningness, it’s easily solvable.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-solve-the-billiard-room-dart-puzzle-in-blue-prince">How to Solve the Billiard Room Dart Puzzle in Blue Prince</h2>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>You’ll probably find this note. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>The maths don’t seem to add up. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p><strong>We need to use the mathematical properties of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division to select the correct numbers on the dart board and beat the puzzle.</strong></p>



<p>In theory, with enough time and patience, you can solve the puzzle with a process of elimination. But it’s more fun and satisfying to work everything out for ourselves—<strong>and it would take hours!</strong></p>



<p>You need to complete several stages of increasingly more difficult calculations and understand the colors to beat <a href="https://www.blueprincegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blue Prince</a>‘s Dartboard test in the Billiard Room.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-dartboard-colors-mean-in-blue-prince">What do Dartboard Colors Mean in Blue Prince?</h2>



<p>Below is a handy chart showing what each color means and how they influence the puzzle. You are likely to see one to complete the puzzle.</p>



<p>I haven’t seen any other colors during my playtime, but developer Dogubomb could always add more, or the late-game may feature further complications.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Segment Color</th><th data-align="center">What it Means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Light Blue</td><td data-align="center">Addition</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Yellow</td><td data-align="center">Subtraction</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pink</td><td data-align="center">Multiplication</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Purple</td><td data-align="center">Division</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-dartboard-puzzle-example-in-blue-prince">Dartboard Puzzle Example in Blue Prince</h2>



<p><strong>The puzzle, in my experience, has the same number of steps, and the equations become more difficult. Use the numbers on the inside of the board first and make your way to the outside of the board. Your answer should never be above 20.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s an example of how to complete the puzzle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Interact with the dartboard to start the puzzle.</li>



<li>The first step is likely to be a single blue number—<strong>the answer is the highlighted number</strong>.</li>



<li>So, if 14 is highlighted blue, the answer is <strong>14</strong> to start.</li>



<li>Next, 6 could be highlighted in yellow, with 14 still blue.</li>



<li>14 minus 6 equals <strong>8</strong>, so press this number.</li>



<li>8 could be in blue next, with the number 2 highlighted in pink.</li>



<li>If we take 8 and multiply it by 2, we get <strong>16</strong>.</li>



<li>Say the number 18 is in blue and 3 is purple now, we divide 18 by 3 to get <strong>6</strong>.</li>



<li>For the next step, 20 is blue, 10 is yellow, 2 is pink, and 4 is purple.</li>



<li>This means 20 minus 10 equals 10. Then 10 multiplied by 2 equals 20 again, and then 20 divided by 4 equals <strong>5</strong>!</li>
</ol>

                <p dir="ltr">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-a-launch-title/1100-6530557/">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> seem like they could be the most technically ambitious games coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. But neither surprised Digital Foundry as much as Ubisoft's Star Wars Outlaws--an open-world title that is current-gen only and never arrived on PS4 and Xbox One.</p><p dir="ltr">Digital Foundry technology editor Richard Leadbetter opened up the discussion about Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 on this week's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZAr1c0Wqg">DF Direct</a> podcast (seen below). "I think this one's quite surprising, to be honest, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>," said Leadbetter. "This is like a technologically demanding game on the new Snowdrop engine for Ubisoft Massive. The concept that it's running on this class of hardware is pretty mind-blowing, I'd say."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZAr1c0Wqg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EZZAr1c0Wqg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Leadbetter wasn't alone, as the rest of the crew seemed quite intrigued by Ubisoft bringing Star Wars Outlaws to Switch 2. In fact, Digital Foundry contributor Oliver Mackenzie called it "a really exciting port, possibly an impossible port, if you will." That's because it's such a large game utilizing features like ray tracing. Plus, there isn't say a PS4 edition, while other third-party titles like Elden Ring and Street Fighter 6 did come to last-gen consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">All of that led to Digital Foundry video producer ​​Alex Battaglia saying, "This is by far the most technically ambitious game that we've seen mentioned as having been ported to Switch 2, like by far." The crew believes the Xbox Series S version of Star Wars Outlaws could give us a clue of what to expect on Nintendo's upcoming system. However, Leadbetter noted how Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora struggled when he played that on an Asus ROG Ally, since both games share the Snowdrop engine.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars Outlaws originally launched on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in August and follows the adventures of Kay Vess in the Outer Rim. Ubisoft has continued to overhaul the game since release, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/">dropping forced stealth</a>. Star Wars Outlaws has also received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/landos-back-in-star-wars-outlaw-wild-card-launch-trailer/1100-6527960/">story DLC in which you get to team up with Lando Calrissian</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no release date for Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 yet, though it is planned to arrive this year.

Around 1,000 years ago, Miraland was embroiled in the War of Heavens against an evil force called The Dark, which sowed chaos and ultimately caused Miraland's destruction.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> Season 2 begins today, which means it’s time to jam another syringe into the scarred and bleeding flanks of the Great Marvelbeast and extract a fresh superhero. This season kicks off with Emma Frost, a Vanguard hero with very large hams and a couple of strings to her bow. By default, she fights as a midranged psychic, casting beams, damage-multiplying orbs and crystalline shields. Switch to her diamond form, however, and she becomes a tanky brawler with the ability to grab and slam people out of their ultimates or boot them into walls.</p><!--more-->

<p>That’s your first new Marvel Rivals character in Season 2, out now. The second will be Ultron, the bot with a god complex, who lands in a few weeks. He’s a nimble Strategist who does his dirty work using drones. More details to follow.</p>
<p>There’s also a new map, the Krakoa Hellfire Gala. It’s the kind of high society do where you’d expect to find Agent 47 pushing a mop, eyes peeled for weaponisable suitcases. Hmm, how would a Hitman party level work if all the guests were superheroes? I can’t really see Agent 47 dragging Ultron into a closet and stealing his trousers.</p>
<p>The new Marvel Rivals heroes and map accompany the usual live service avalanche of character skins and balancing or structural changes. There will now be weekly missions in addition to daily missions and challenges. Ranked mode is being given a rigorous rejig: the minimum level for competitive will now be 15, not 10, and players in Eternity and above will only be able to queue alone or in pairs to stop people forming big groups in advance. We can expect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-season-2-will-add-more-team-up-skills-plus-the-usual-new-heroes%E2%80%9D">new team-up skills</a> (and the loss of a couple of older ones). </p>
<p>Possibly most anticipated is the addition of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-performance-bottlenecks-are-a-very-big-problem-agree-netease-but-dont-worry-theyre-adding-a-box">a box that makes your computer go faster</a>. This being the new switch shader compilation mode, an experimental performance-boosting feature which is being added to the game’s launcher.</p>
<p>“Since our launch, we've heard your battle cries through the community and customer service channels,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2767030/view/541101973283275818?l=english">explains a blog post</a>. “Players on various PC configurations have encountered performance stutters and crashes, often due to high memory consumption during gameplay. PCs equipped with 16GB of RAM or less, when faced with excessive RAM usage can force the system to use swap memory, leading to unwanted slowdowns in the heat of battle.”</p>
<p>The switch shader compilation feature promises to “dramatically reduce” the game’s memory usage, “cutting down on severe FPS drops, frozen visuals, and crashes triggered by memory shortages.” The developers caution, however, that it might have a few teething troubles to begin with.</p>
<p>NetEase have elsewhere revealed that from Season 3 onwards, each Marvel Rivals update will only last two months instead of three, which means you’ll get a new hero every month. Which is a lot of heroes. I hope the developers aren’t crunching to meet the demand. NetEase <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">don’t have a spotless track record</a> for looking after their staff.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That DLC is available as a separate purchase." The news was first discovered by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NSCollectors/comments/1jv22rv/zelda_botw_ns2_does_not_include_expansion_pass/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit user raptormelonsite</a> (via <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch-2-edition-does-not-include-expansion-pass-content/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Soup</a>) , who got word from My Nintendo Store UK's support team.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmDD7JSfhcE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dmDD7JSfhcE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Following its launch in March 2017, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">Breath of the Wild</a> received two DLCs tied to its expansion pack. The Master Trials' DLC added a Trial of the Sword challenge for players to complete, Hero's Path and Master modes, a travel medallion to simplify fast travel, and more. Then, The Champion's Ballad introduced more substantial story content. In 2021, a version of Breath of the Wild containing all DLC on the game card was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/zelda_breath_of_the_wild_and_splatoon_2_will_get_new_physical_releases_with_dlc_included_in_japan" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released in Japan</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2 game card won't contain content from The Master Trials or Champion's Ballad, and players will have to buy the expansion pass in addition to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of this game. It will cost $70, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-10-price-tag-for-zelda-switch-2-upgrade-packs/1100-6530664/" data-ref-id="1100-6530664">$10 more expensive than Breath of the Wild retailed for in 2017</a>.

Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass subscribers will gain access to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade pack at no additional cost if they already own Breath of the Wild.</p>

                <p>Since A Minecraft Movie was released in theaters, there have been plenty of videos emerging from screenings showing moviegoers yelling, screaming, throwing popcorn, and even <a href="https://x.com/videosinfolder/status/1910045142985171028" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bringing a live chicken with them</a>.

Director Jared Hess has now reacted to the... passionate response from viewers.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://ew.com/minecraft-chicken-jockey-director-jared-hess-reacts-exclusive-11712098" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EW</a>, Hess said, "It's weird when you're having too much fun and the cops get called."</p><p>The director went on to say "it's just literally cheering and throwing popcorn," so he found it funny that the cops were called. "Yeah, it's hilarious. I've seen so many funny videos. It's great, especially when people are climbing on their friends' shoulders and standing up and cheering for those moments," he said.</p><p>Hess said part of why people are getting so excited about A Minecraft Movie is due to the size and scale of the franchise--it has millions upon millions of fans who have been waiting for the movie.</p><p>"It's like this crazy anticipation. But, man, I'm just glad people are making memories with their friends and families," Hess said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Hess reacted to what's been one of the breakout sequences from A Minecraft Movie, and that's the <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Chicken_Jockey" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"chicken jockey."</a> He said "it's just a bonanza" to see the reaction so far.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ollie_twt/status/1908414804823543938" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">the minecraft movie is truly one of the worst movies i’ve ever seen but the universal reaction to “chicken jockey” im seeing made it all worth it. <a href="https://t.co/0mxgliSYEp" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/0mxgliSYEp</a></p>  — ollie 🧡🤍🩷 (@ollie_twt) <a href="https://twitter.com/ollie_twt/status/1908414804823543938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>A Minecraft Movie earned more than $300 million worldwide after just its first weekend, immediately positioning itself as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/highest-grossing-video-game-movies-of-all-time/2900-3968/#1" data-ref-id="2900-3968">No. 9 highest-grossing video game movie</a> with $343 million through April 10. It's expected to pass The Angry Birds Movie ($352 million) this weekend to keep climbing up the charts.</p><p>Like many of Hess' movies, reviews for A Minecraft Movie were mixed.
