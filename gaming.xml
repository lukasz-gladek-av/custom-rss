                <p>As a part of today's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6636/" data-ref-id="2900-6636">PlayStation State Of Play livestream</a>, Digital Eclipse and NetherRealm Studios have announced the Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection, a collection of classic Mortal Kombat games from across the series' arcade, handheld, and console titles.</p><p>The collection includes several games from Mortal Kombat's history, including Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Mortal Kombat III, and Mortal Kombat IV. The trailer stated it will include additional titles as well, though the studios have yet to clarify what games that might entrail. Here are the games currently included in the collection:</p><ul><li>Mortal Kombat – 1992: Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear</li><li>Mortal Kombat II -1993: Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, 32X</li><li>Mortal Kombat 3 – 1995: Arcade, SNES, Genesis</li><li>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 – 1995: Arcade, SNES</li><li>Mortal Kombat 4 – 1997: Arcade</li><li>Mortal Kombat Advance – 2001: Game Boy Advance</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance – 2002: Game Boy Advance</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition – 2003: Game Boy Advance</li></ul><p>Each game will feature modern enhancements as well as online play thanks to the inclusion of rollback netcode. On the official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/mortal-kombat-legacy-collection-launches-on-ps5-ps4-this-year/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Sony confirmed that the collection will give players "open access to everything in these games without need for hidden codes or memorization." However, how exactly this will be implemented is "still a secret." Sony stated that fans can look forward to hearing a bit more about the Legacy Kollection ahead of its release later this year.</p><p>The announcement comes after NetherRealm Studios stated that the most recent game in the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-devs-respond-to-calls-for-more-dlc/1100-6531826/" data-ref-id="1100-6531826">Mortal Kombat 1, would no longer be in active development</a> after the release of the Definitive Edition last month. Mortal Kombat 1 served as a soft reboot for the franchise, with the in-game universe under the direction of Liu Kang instead of Raiden. Guest characters added via DLC included Invincible's Omni-Man, Scream's Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian.</p>

                <p>Announced during the February State of Play earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/digimon-story-time-stranger/" data-ref-id="5000-663007">Digimon Story: Time Stranger</a> reappeared during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6636/" data-ref-id="2900-6636">June State of Play</a>. The new trailer offered a more detailed look at the RPG's story as well as a release date: October 3.</p><p>Time Stranger is the next game in a Digimon RPG series that dates back to 2006 on the Nintendo DS. As the title implies, this new game puts you into the role of a time traveler who has mysteriously been sent back in time eight years, just before a devastating disaster--it seems it's up to you to ensure it doesn't happen, as well as investigate other timeline anomalies. Like the past games, you'll also collect and train Digimon partners, which you'll command in turn-based encounters against enemy Digimon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVvDc7_w5ZY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IVvDc7_w5ZY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The story will take place in both the real and digital worlds, and you'll be able to recruit and train over 450 different digital monsters. As seen in the new trailer, each Digimon has a wealth of options when it comes to customization, too. The full depth of options available is still unclear, but it looks like Time Stranger is shaping up to be an ideal game for folks who want to really dive into the minutia of turn-based combat.</p><p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC.</p>

A free demo is launching today on the PlayStation Store. The full game is set for release in early 2026 on PlayStation 5.</p><p>Fans have been waiting some time for another Nioh game, as Nioh 2 was released in 2020. It scored strong reviews and <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/02/nioh-2-shipments-and-digital-sales-top-2-5-million" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shipped more than 2.5 million copies.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXGm-JaxY54" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KXGm-JaxY54" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are two fighting styles in Nioh 3, and they are are Samurai and Ninja. Below is how Team Ninja describes each.</p><h3><strong>Samurai: </strong></h3><p>"The Samurai style provides a gameplay experience similar to previous Nioh titles. New actions such as Arts Proficiency, which enhances the power of martial arts, and Deflect, which allows players to block enemy attacks at the last moment have been added, helping create a series of intense and deadly face-to-face confrontations."</p><h3><strong>Ninja:</strong></h3><p>"The Ninja style excels in quick movements like dodging and aerial actions, giving ninjas the advantage of being able to attack from outside of the enemy’s range by utilizing a variety of 'Ninjitsu' techniques according to the situation on the battlefield. Players have the ability to use techniques like Mist, which leaves a clone after an attack, and Evade, which allows for narrowly avoiding enemy strikes. Both techniques help players outmaneuver foes while delivering devastating speed attacks from behind."</p><p>The game allows players to switch between the two styles at any time, so they can play how they want. Team Ninja also confirmed that Nioh 3 includes an "open field that offers a new freedom of exploration" for the series. </p><p><span>"Experience unexpected encounters with formidable yokai, explore suspicious villages riddled in violent secrets, and take on the daunting challenges of The Crucible. Enjoy the thrilling, hostile new environments as you fight to survive the cursed kingdom!" Team Ninja said.</span></p>

                <p>The Sony State of Play on June 5 debuted the next game from the Bloodstained series. Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement is coming in 2026, and the first trailer showed some of the metroidvania action we can expect.</p><p>The cutscenes for The Scarlet Engagement featured Victorian-style intrigue as guards spoke about castles and magic, but the real thrust of the game was in its combat. The gameplay looked very similar to Ritual of the Night, though it appeared to have much more emphasis on player customization. It's not clear if this game will have a single, specific protagonist like the first game.</p><p>The first Bloodstained was a crowdfunded game from Koji Igarashi, best known for Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Ritual of the Night had a similar tone and spirit, with some of its own intricacies and new features that helped set it apart. Two retro demakes, Curse of the Moon and Curse of the Moon 2, were produced by Inti Creates, to help flesh out the world.</p>

                <p>Grasshopper Manufacture and Suda51 have finally announced a brand-new game for PlayStation 5, and it as every bit of strange as you would expect it to be. Romeo Is A Dead Man is Suda51's first new game in over four years. Players will be controlling the hero Romeo Stargazer, an FBI investigator recently brought back to life by a mysterious device injected into his face by his grandfather. Resurrected as the masked hero "Dead Man," Romeo battles all sorts of undead with a variety of weapons including beam swords, machine guns, and what appear to be electric boxing gloves.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW1cE6sj6h8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nW1cE6sj6h8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Suda51 describes the game as a "strong-style action game," with its aggressive blood sprays and inspirations from Japanese action shows like Kamen Rider. It's very much like previous titles by Grasshopper Manufacture but with a much more aggressive style of combat more like Devil May Cry. The trailer shows off a huge variety of weapons to use and all of their strange effects, like a freezing shot that turns enemies into ice, or electric gauntlets that chain energy across nearby targets. Enemies also have tons of strange effects, shooting massive beams as Romeo as he dodges them.</p><p>It's not known if this game will have open-world elements like in No More Heroes 3, but it's likely with the story involving chasing criminals across spacetime, there will be exploration alongside all the action as well. There were also some hints of vehicle use with some visuals of Romeo riding a motorcycle in the trailer, but we don't see any gameplay of it.</p><p>Romeo is a Dead Man will be out sometime in 2026.</p><p>For more news, check out GameSpot's coverage of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6636/" data-ref-id="2900-6636">PlayStation State of Play from June 4th.</a></p>

                <p>In the June 2025 State of Play, Capcom reintroduced Pragmata, an oft-delayed sci-fi game, and announced a planned 2026 release window. Pragmata was originally announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcoms-pragmata-is-a-new-ps5-xbox-series-x-and-pc/1100-6478339/" data-ref-id="1100-6478339">back in 2021</a>, delayed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcoms-pragmata-has-officially-been-delayed-to-2023/1100-6498139/" data-ref-id="1100-6498139">six months later</a>, and then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-reminds-us-pragmata-still-exists-then-delays-it-indefinitely/1100-6515152/" data-ref-id="1100-6515152">dropped from Capcom's release calendar entirely</a>. A space action-adventure game, the game follows an astronaut exploring an abandoned space station who encounters a mysterious young girl.</p><p>The trailer shown at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6636/" data-ref-id="2900-6636">State of Play</a> is the most in-depth look Capcom has given of the game so far. It alternates briskly between cutscenes and what appears to be gameplay; a "captured on a PS5 Pro" disclosure displays early on in the footage.</p><p>The trailer starts with the young girl awakening the astronaut after he has been injured. The two begin to wander the space station where he has awoken, bounding through hallways and boosting across gaps, with the girl riding piggyback. They encounter a thin robot wielding a laser sword. During combat, it appears the astronaut can boost for a quick evade, utilize drones, and enlist the girl to use her hacking powers to "freeze" robots. Later in the trailer, you see the pair fight a larger, mech-like robot. The UI displays damage numbers as each hit collides with that enemy.</p><p>At the trailer's end, the astronaut dubs the girl "Diana," loosely based on the string of numbers and letters she offered as name earlier. A note written by the girl appears, reading "2026, It's real XD." Though it reveals more, the trailer hardly breaks the marketing's cryptic streak.</p>

The trailer mainly showcases the relationship between the protagonist and a mysterious girl with technological powers who rides on his back, but it opens with a mysterious trailer for a fictional tech company called Delphi. You can watch it for yourself below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdDVyBtYrUI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdDVyBtYrUI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The game appears to be a third-person action game, and in the footage shown today, we see that you play as a man in a futuristic astronaut suit – think NASA body with an Iron Man mask. In a mostly-isolated space station on what appears to be Earth's moon, this protagonist has to battle a legion of robots using a pistol and handy gadgets built into his suit, like an attachment that lets him ride up walls, or jets on his waist that allow him to dodge and hover.</p><p dir="ltr">The star of the trailer, however, is D-I-03367, better known as Diana, who calls herself a "state-of-the-art Pragmata," which seems to be another word for a human-like android, capable of hacking and harnessing technology by pointing at it. In the trailer, we see her stun enemies and override doors, which is likely just the tip of the iceberg for her capabilities in the main game.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer ends with what seems like an apology for the last time we saw the game – the note Diana wrote delaying its release is erased and replaced by a new launch window: 2026. Hopefully, that date sticks this time.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> has landed itself a release date, and got itself a new trailer to go with it.</p>
<p>The next entry in the Silent Hill series, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">first announced back in 2022 with a trailer that still gives me goosebumps due to that young girl's face just sliding off</a>, will launch later this year, on 25th September.</p>

<p>In Silent Hill f, players take on the role of Shimizu Hinako. She is a high schooler in 1960s Japan, who "explores her hometown as it becomes engulfed in fog and shifts nightmarishly, solving puzzles and fighting for her life in the process", the developer shared in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/">new blog post</a> accompanying the release date news.</p>
<p>"As Hinako tries to survive the now fog-wreathed town, she will be faced with decisions that will shape her ultimate fate. Will she choose to embrace elegance and beauty? Or will her path lead her to madness and horror?  Is she doomed to succumb to the insanity unfolding before her, or can she face her fears and find a way to escape?"</p>
<p>The developer has promised puzzles that are "grounded in psychological anguish and suffering," on the game's release later this year, because what else says longer autumnal nights than that.</p>
<p>On the combat side of things, there are going to be "as challenging as the obstacles that Hinako must overcome in life". Konami states that combat in f will be "more action-oriented" than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, which released last year.</p>
<p>If this all sounds like your kind of thing, pre-orders are live on PlayStation Store from today.</p>

            <p>
The long-rumoured remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> is real and was finally revealed at tonight's PlayStation State of Play.
</p>
<p>
Tactics is a beloved entry in the iconic series, that released in 1997 for Sony's PS1 in Japan and North America. It wouldn't reach Europe until its War of the Lions re-release on PSP in 2007.
</p>
<p>
This remaster is known as The Ivalice Chronicles. It's set for release on 30th September across PS4 and PS5.

<p>The game will include both the original version of the game with War of the Lions translation, as well as an enhanced version with fully voiced dialogue, graphical enhancements, and a new easier Squire difficulty.</p>
<p>
Released shortly after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, Tactics shifted from turn-based combat to grid-based strategy. It introduced the world of Ivalice, which was later used as the setting for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xii">Final Fantasy 12</a> as well as PS1 classic Vagrant Story.
</p>
<p>Final Fantasy Tactics has become legendary among fans, praised for the depth of its battle system and more politically-leaning storyline. </p>
<p>
Rumours of a remaster began back in 2021 with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidia-acknowledges-leaked-pc-game-list-including-god-of-war-and-final-fantasy-7-remake">infamous Nvidia leak</a>, which included a list of datamined yet-to-be-announced games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, Chrono Cross, and Final Fantasy Tactics - all of which have since proven to be real.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-reportedly-real">Jason Schreier later claimed the Tactics remaster was real last summer</a>, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-rumours-squashed-by-director">original director Yasumi Matsuno squashing rumours of a revival</a>.</p>
<p>Only now has <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> officially acknowledged its existence.</p>
<p>
A remake of Final Fantasy 9 remains from the Nvidia leak and, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/official-final-fantasy-9-25th-anniversary-website-ignites-remake-hopes-once-again">Square Enix updating the game's anniversary website</a>, fans are still holding out hope for its veracity.

		<p>Well, here’s an unexpected announcement. Thief is back and this time in VR form. Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow is being developed by Vertigo Games, the team behind Arizona Sunshine and Metro Awakening, and it will take players back to The City. In this Thief game, players are the thief known as Magpie and she is on a mission to steal and find the secrets of this world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow - Reveal Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrtbCcnZEhQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow says, <em>“The City is a place of shadows, ruled by the tyrant Lord Ulysses Northcrest. You are Magpie, a cunning thief orphaned by Northcrest’s brutality and shaped by the streets, who steals as the only means to survive. That is until you uncover something greater: a legendary artifact holding a legacy from the past. Use immersive VR mechanics to steal, evade, and outsmart the forces controlling The City. Unravel its darkest secrets and expose a sinister conspiracy that looms over its very foundation.”</em></p>
<p>As a Thief you have to be stealthy and precise. Pickpocketing, opening compartments, and lockpicking will all be part and parcel for success.</p>

		<p>A remaster of the 1997 PlayStation classic, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles has been revealed. The game is coming out for PS5 and PS4 on 30th September 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sSC0eQdzM20?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles can be enjoyed in two ways. There’s the enhanced version, which has somewhat modernised graphics, tweaked gameplay, full voice acting and more… but there’s also the original game which you can switch back to, if you want something classic –&nbsp;though it does have the War of the Lions translation wrapped around it.</p>

<p>Here’s the trailer blurb:</p>

<p><em>FINAL FANTASY TACTICS – The Ivalice Chronicles includes two different versions of the game: enhanced and classic. The enhanced version adds fully voiced dialogue, an optimized and updated UI, graphical improvements, and a number of other quality of life features. The classic version unites the graphics and gameplay of the original game with the renowned War of the Lions translation and includes convenient features such as auto save.</em></p>

		<p>Konami have dropped by Sony’s State of Play broadcast to deliver a new trailer for Silent Hill F, a reinvention of the franchise that is set in Japan.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill f Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5m9uALtSyn0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“In the remote mountain town of Ebisugaoka, teenager Shimizu Hinako leads an unremarkable life—until a thick fog descends, transforming her once-familiar home into a desolate and terrifying place. With the town seemingly abandoned and an unknown, creeping menace lurking in the mist, Hinako must navigate the spectral remnants of her past, solve intricate puzzles, and battle horrifying entities to survive.”</p>
<p>“Faced with impossible decisions, she must ultimately choose between beauty and madness, confronting the horrors that await within the fog.”</p>
<p>The narrative has been written by Ryukishi07, renowned for his work on&nbsp;<em>Higurashi</em>&nbsp;<em>When They Cry</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Umineko</em>&nbsp;<em>When They Cry.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>“To this day, I remember the feeling of my first encounter with the strangling and oppressive atmosphere of SILENT HILL,” he said. “It still deeply haunts me, and it still utterly fascinates me. It’s an honor to find myself involved with a series I have so many memories with. I’ve poured all my efforts into this story, so much so that I don’t think I would mind if it was the last thing I ever wrote.”</p>
<p>“To me, the SILENT HILL series is more than just a collection of stories, it’s a medium; an amazing, phenomenal way of exploring and experiencing a person’s heart and mind. It’s my hope that players out there will come to appreciate it in the same way. To all of our overseas friends, I hope you’ll enjoy a look at what SILENT HILL might be like if set somewhere a little different, like Japan.”</p>
<p>He is joined by celebrated illustrator and monster designer kera, and composer Akira Yamaoka who has scored the games for the last twenty five years.</p>
<p>Silent Hill F will launch on September 25th 2025 on PlayStation 5 and XBOX Series X|S consoles or on PC via Steam, Microsoft Store and the Epic Games Store.</p>

			<p>Nioh 3, the third entry in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/">action role-playing game series</a> developed by Team Ninja, has been announced today with a new trailer.</p>
<p>The new trailer, which was shown during today's State of Play presentation, provides a first look at the game's historical setting, the main character, who seems to be a fixed character like in the first entry in the series, and action-packed gameplay. While on the surface the game doesn't seem to be too different from its predecessor, there will be plenty of features that will set it apart from the rest of the series, such as a unique Ninja style in addition to the Samurai style, which is sure to make the experience deeper than ever, and the overhauled stages, which will be open fields offering more freedom and immersion. At the end of the trailer, it's been confirmed the game will launch in early 2026 on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nioh 3 - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXGm-JaxY54?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While we will have to wait a few more months to play Nioh 3, it is now possible to try out the game thanks to a playable demo available on PlayStation 5. Considering the demos released for previous games, the Nioh 3 demo will likely give players a pretty good idea of what to expect in the final game.</p>
<p>Nioh 3 launches in early 2026 on PlayStation 5. No other platform has been confirmed, but the game will likely launch at least on PC at some point.</p>

The <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/games/digimon-story-time-stranger">game’s description</a> says it tells an “epic story that unravels the mystery of the world’s collapse” as you carry out turn-based battles with a variety of Digimon collected throughout the game.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc5ODgw" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679880/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-square-enix-ps5">Square Enix surprise announced a Final Fantasy Tactics remaster</a></h2><div><p>Not to be upstaged by all the Nintendo Switch 2 shenanigans, PlayStation decided to steal some of that attention back in the form of a major, nostalgia-fueled announcement: <em>Final Fantasy Tactic</em>s is getting a remake and it’s coming in September.</p><p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> <em>The Ivalice Chronicles </em>will take players back to a time when <em>Final Fantasy</em> wasn’t an action RPG or even a turn-based RPG but an isometric strategy game. Take control of Ramza Beoulve as he fights in the Lion War and build an army of powerful fighters utilizing the game’s job system. But don’t expect just the standard RPG classes like Fighter, Black Mage, or Summoner. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> has a host of unique, often arcane, and never-seen-again job types like Geomancer, Chemist, and Oracle. For this new edition, players will be able to choose between the classic version of the 1998 original PlayStation game or an enhanced version with fully-voiced dialogue and other quality of life improvements.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/679880/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-square-enix-ps5">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Take some Baby Steps this fall.</p><p>The latest infuriating game from Bennett Foddy and friends now has a release date: September 8th.

Not much of the gameplay was shown but we were given a 2026 launch window and introduced to our Elizabeth/Atreus analogue, an adorable little robot child named Diana.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Romeo must die.</p><p>At least I assume that’s what will happen in this ultra-violent action game <em>Romeo is a Deadman</em>.

A remake of a 1997 tactics game? In this economy? </p><p>This new version will include both the classic RPG and a new enhanced version that includes new graphics and voice acting. Here’s the trailer for this long-rumored remake. </p><p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>, directed by the famed Yasumi Matsuno,<em>&nbsp;</em>follows the story of Ramza Beoulve. He’s the bastard son of a respected general, who becomes a mercenary after his faith in the nobility is shattered in the face of how their  petty power grabs lead to ruin for the people they were supposed to be serving. Eventually things go sideways and a tale of war, tragedy, and political intrigue gives way to a mystical showdown with evil demons. It also features a top-notch job system, gripping unit customization, lovely battlefield dioramas, and an amazing soundtrack.</p><p>The game was previously revised in a 2007 PlayStation Portable port called <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions</em> that featured some additional end-game elements and a much improved translation. It was the definitive way to play the game, outside of an awful slow-down bug during some battle animations. That version is also available on mobile and PC, but has never been playable on newer consoles. </p><p>Square Enix’s <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> remake comes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ff-tactics-xenogears-vagrant-story-remaster-rpgs-1850621353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ff-tactics-xenogears-vagrant-story-remaster-rpgs-1850621353">as several other games have either been remastered</a></span> in HD or given HD-2D glow-ups, like <em>Star Ocean: Second Story</em> and <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>. Only <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>has gotten the full-blown hyper-realistic 3D remake treatment. While some fans might prefer a sequel or new franchise to the publisher fiddling with its old games, I’m fine with it, especially in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>’ case. One of the best of all time deserves to make a comeback in style. </p><p>. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
