            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Microsoft did what has become something of a habit for the company: raised the price of playing games on Xbox. This time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">instead of the consoles getting a price hike</a>, it was Xbox Game Pass this time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">with a 50% price jump for Game Pass and the overhauling of its three tiers</a>, which are now called Essential, Premium, and Ultimate.</p>



<p>Well, shortly after the news broke, <a href="https://x.com/_sunday_rain_/status/1973396317838684668">Pocket Tactics writer Sam Comrie</a> shared to X (formerly Twitter) that, perhaps somewhat unsurprisingly, the page to cancel your Xbox Game Pass subscription had essentially broken, likely thanks to an influx of users who decided they did not want to be paying $30/month for Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Users in the comments shared they were also having trouble accessing the cancel page, though for many more, the issues seem to have now been resolved, and you should have no problem cancelling your subscription.</p>



<p>Not everyone will move to cancel their subscriptions from this price hike; in fact it could be the case that many simply adjust their subscriptions from the top Ultimate tier and bump down to Premium or Essential based on their needs. </p>



<p>But this response to the latest price increases is just a sample size of what will continue to happen as playing games on Xbox gets more expensive. We know that Xbox won't be getting a return on its investments through hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/reports-confirm-costco-has-stopped-selling-xbox-series-consoles-in-us-uk/">especially with major retailers dropping the consoles entirely</a>.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/">growth Microsoft previously reported for Game Pass</a> continues through its next fiscal year. Especially when considering that the company is apparently making its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-making-largest-investment-in-game-pass-to-date-xbox-game-pass/">"<em>largest investment to date</em>" in the service</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
When you review a game, if you don't know anyone else that's also reviewing it, it can be a bit difficult to guess how it might be received overall. There's normally some assumptions you can make, but with a series like Silent Hill, a series where the general consensus is all over the place from game to game, it's certainly not easy to predict. I myself ended up being quite fascinated by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-review">review of it</a>, but in a recent interview series producer Motoi Okamoto said that despite an overall positive reception, you shouldn't expect every consequent game to be just like it.
</p>
<p>
Speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/NhEFMQmxm1g">IGN Japan</a> at TGS last month (as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/future-silent-hill-games-wont-necessarily-follow-silent-hill-f-formula-producer-says-we-want-to-keep-experimenting-with-each-new-title/">Automaton</a>), Okamoto said how he expected responses to the game much more divided than they ended up being due to its "challenging" elements. This is where the but comes in. But! As he notes, "that doesn’t mean every future Silent Hill will be like Silent Hill f. Each one will have its own distinct flavor. We want to keep experimenting and be ambitious, both in terms of gameplay design and storytelling, so please look forward to the next Silent Hill as well."
</p>
<p>
The producer doubled down on this sentiment on <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1972230163380535537">Bitter</a>, the nothing app, saying he wants to be bold with the series and make it so that each subsequent game offers fresh gameplay. Though he doesn't want to abandon a key point about the series either - "I believe psychological stories are essential to what makes Silent Hill feel like ‘Silent Hill,’ and we’ll continue to place great importance on that in future works as well."
</p>
<p>
Part of the process I took with reviewing Silent Hill f was working out my own feelings on how necessary the series is now, and if there's anything it can offer any more. The answer, as it turns out, was yes, actually, so despite my curmudgeonly attitude towards it, I am curious to see where it goes next.

</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea%E2%80%99s-saudi-deal-fallout-junk-credit-ratings-risky-ai-bets-and-developer-fears.1314118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re two days out from EA’s announcement that it would <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">sell to Saudia Arabia and private equity</a> for $55 billion, and as the dust settles, concerns continue to mount. Some inside the company are worried about possible cuts, layoffs, and censorship coming down the road, and the logistics of the deal don’t necessarily do much to reassure them. Downgraded credit ratings, rumors of ramped-up AI initiatives, and relative radio silence from the executives and investors involved isn’t helping.</p> <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/s-p-says-it-expects-to-cut-electronic-arts-to-junk-status?srnd=phx-fixed-income"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a> that S&amp;P Global Ratings plans to lower EA’s credit rating to “junk status” once the leveraged buyout deal is completed sometime next year. It’s currently “BBB+” but would fall into the “non-investment grade” or “speculative” territory once saddled with the $20 billion loan required to pay off all of the <i>Battlefield 6 </i>publisher’s existing shareholders at a 25-percent premium. Moody’s Ratings announced it is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-30/moody-s-says-it-s-likely-to-cut-electronic-arts-following-s-p?srnd=phx-deals">planning a similar reappraisal</a>. And the more context we get around the financing of the deal, the worse it looks.</p>

 <p>“JPMorgan made the commitment through its leveraged-finance arm, not its private credit strategy, and the biggest U.S. bank is expected to share the risk with rival firms to create a global syndicate of underwriters, according to people familiar with the deal,” <em>Bloomberg</em> reported yesterday. “The debt— expected to be rated in the single-B range—is set to be sold through high-yield bonds and leveraged loans in a cross-border, dual-currency transaction, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential details.” Smells like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m23a2o4avs2f">high-interest-rate debt</a>.</p>

 <h2>BioWare on the chopping block</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-battlefield-6-mass-effect-bioware-private-equity-2000629947">Some analysts who spoke to<em> Kotaku</em></a> have suggested that going private could free EA from the whims of a stock market based around quarterly earnings reports, but it could also be that being saddled with a ton of debt completely reshapes the decades-old gaming company as we know it. EA has an infamous reputation for buying up acclaimed studios with big creative ambitions and eventually gutting them when they fail to live up to the earnings potential of the loot-box machines fueling <em>Madden</em> and <em>EA Sports FC</em>.</p>

 <p>Respawn Entertainment recently faced multiple rounds of layoffs and saw multiple projects canceled, including a prototype for a long-awaited return to the world of <em>Titanfall</em>. BioWare has suffered even worse. Following a tumultuous development cycle for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> due to shifting schedules and live-service goals, the RPG powerhouse is back to being a one-game studio (<em>Mass Effect</em>) and a shell of its former self. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> now reports</a> that EA was at one point looking to possibly sell off its $775 million acquisition from back in 2007. At least some developers there are just as worried about a future under Saudi ownership. They told<em> Insider Gaming</em> that it feels like only a matter of time before BioWare is downsized further.</p>

 <p>“For the studios that have more of a track record, especially a track record that maybe doesn’t line up with your own political views…you’re going to look at that studio and wonder how you make them fit into your new structure,” former BioWare project director Mark Darrah said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNGc8oq9uq8&amp;t=50s">in a new YouTube video</a>. “It’s hard to imagine that you have BioWare pivot from having very progressive messaging to having the reverse because it’s what the government wants. It’s hard to imagine that the public perception of a game that comes out of BioWare, even if you do do that, isn’t apocalyptically bad.”</p>

 <h2>Pivoting away from human rights</h2> <p>In an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3m23abrrwj22v">FAQ directed at employees</a>, one of the only pieces of communication EA has released since the deal was announced, the company claims, “There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction.” Amid concerns about the abysmal human rights record of Saudi Arabia, where same-sex relationships are outlawed, EA has stopped short of reaffirming its long-standing commitment to inclusivity, which included asserting “<a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-trans-rights-star-wars-jedi-survive-apex-legends-res-1848998351">Trans Rights Are Human Rights</a>” as some US states pushed anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in 2022.</p>

 <p>“Andrew Wilson basically said ‘f you’ to all women and LGTBQ employees at EA with this deal,” one current EA employee <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-saudi-arabia-pif-silver-lake-affinity-partners-deal">told <em>Game File</em> this week</a>. “It just shows how many people have been collateral this past year for executives to make out rich. Nothing feels great. And we know, when the deal closes, it’s going to get worse before it gets better, if better is even possible.” A separate employee, also speaking anonymously, reiterated those concerns to <em>Kotaku</em>.&nbsp;“Members of the Pride Employee Working Group are currently being very vocal about our concerns for our future,” they told me. “We’re worried LGBTQ content will be deprioritized or cut entirely and that LGBTQ and especially trans employees will be on the chopping block. Few of us feel heard right now.”</p> <p>There’s also concerns about what the new ownership arrangement will mean for EA’s ongoing push around generative AI. It was a big part of the company’s pitch <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">at its 2024 Investor Day</a>. At the time, CEO Andrew Wilson said AI was “the very core of our business” and “not merely a buzzword,” claiming there were over 100 “novel AI projects” the publisher was experimenting with to improve how it made games. These lofty promises have reemerged in light of the Saudi deal.</p> <h2>Banking on an AI revolution that may never arrive</h2> <p>Reporting on the sale earlier this week, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133">the<em> Financial Times</em> wrote,</a> “investors are betting that AI-based cost cuts will significantly boost EA’s profits in coming years,” according to people involved in the transaction. It continued, “The deal is a huge bet that artificial intelligence can significantly cut EA’s operating costs, allowing the equity consortium to manage a large debt load on a company that historically carried limited net debt.”</p>

 <p>Some employees <em>Kotaku</em> has spoken with say EA has continued beating the drum of AI over the last 12 months, but with varying degrees of urgency. While developers are encouraged to experiment with AI tools as much as they can, none reported being forced to implement them directly into their workflows. At the same time, AI is becoming a cornerstone of customer service management, something the company behind microtransaction-fueled sports franchises does a lot of. Where players might have been routed to humans for help in the past, their complaints, ranging from bugged items to lost accounts, may now be fielded by AI agents instead.</p> <p>The Saudi deal is the second-biggest gaming merger ever. The first, Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard, faced a surprising and prolonged level of scrutiny among regulators in the U.S. and abroad, including an entire lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission. That was under the Biden Administration, however, which made anti-trust enforcement a priority for the federal government. Under the pay-to-play and pay-to-win mechanics of the current Trump Administration, EA’s sale to private equity and a foreign government isn’t expected to hit so many roadblocks, especially with the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as one of the buyers.</p> <p>“Kushner has a personal relationship and he has deep ties in Saudi Arabia. He is very comfortable operating in the Middle East. It created a basis of trust,” one source <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f">told the <em>Financial Times</em></a>.&nbsp;“We are in a regulatory environment that is welcoming of [Saudi Arabia]. We are not in what was the previous regime,” said another. And according to a third: “What regulator is going to say no to the president’s son-in-law?”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We're like, we should have thought of that."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom's upcoming new IP, Pragmata, features a main antagonist that's really a rogue AI on the moon making the life of a spaceman and his android buddy difficult. But as much as artificial intelligence is in the news lately, especially in gaming, the developers of Pragmata say they had absolutely no idea it would be such a hot topic when they started developing the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to me at Tokyo Game Show 2025, game director Cho Yonghee and producer Naoto Oyama tell me that the concept for Pragmata simply came from Yonghee thinking about the moon, and asking the team to brainstorm ideas for a game set on the moon. From there, developers pitched a "black and white world" on the moon, and the concept of the enemy being AI came later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But none of the team, they said, knew they were about to release a game about an enemy AI at a time when real-life AI was such a fraught subject.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We really couldn't predict that AI would be this big from where we started from what you see now, but now that we have AI become this huge thing in the real world, we see like, 'Oh, maybe we should have added this or that from what you see in the AI right now,'" Yonghee tells me. "So we are like, 'We should have thought of that.'" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the pair confirm that the real-world shifts around AI didn't impact the game's story or direction. By the time it became a hot topic, the direction was already set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have this sort of the idea of the AI in the game locked down very early in the development back when we released the concept trailer back a few years ago," Oyama says. "And so we had that as what you see in the game basically. And then we really couldn't predict that the AI would become this big right now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah," Yonghee adds. "So the real life AI's progression or development, it's been so fast that it's perhaps overtaken what do we have in the game right now. So what you see in the game might not look as amazing than what'd you compared to real life."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I laughed a bit at this and remarked that I didn't think we had Dianas running around in the real world just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We created to be in the near future, but the future has come closer," Oyama replies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah, just the word AI is getting a bit old right now," Yonghee says. "So maybe by the time that we reach the age or the time where Pragmata takes place, people are not using the word AI even anymore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We recently got another look at Pragmata at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-online-program-tgs-2025-everything-announced">Capcom's Online Program alongside TGS</a>, and we had a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-aims-to-break-the-rules-of-third-person-shooters-gamescom-2025">hands-on preview of the game at Gamescom earlier this year</a>. We also spoke with Oyama and Yonghee about early ideas for Pragmata, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmatas-early-concepts-for-diana-included-a-robot-animals-and-even-a-talking-dog">possibility that it might feature a talking dog</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-midnight-%E2%80%93-the-first-hands-on-preview.1314109/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the intro cinematic for World of Warcraft: Midnight, Lady Liadrin of the blood elves was joined by a conspicuously anonymous group of reinforcements to defend the Sunwell against this and last expansion's big bad, Xal'atath. And it turns out there's a reason for their ambiguous appearance: it's us, the players. The first moments of the next chapter of the Worldsoul Saga, which I've played through a big chunk of on an alpha build, had me emerging at that precise moment to put a stop to this shadowy invasion. And the revamped elven kingdom of Quel'Thalas beyond was worth the abrupt summoning.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Clock Strikes</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you aren't caught up on the events of The War Within, Midnight is something WoW has never really tried before: a direct follow-up to a previous expansion, and the midpoint of a planned trilogy that tells a single, overarching story. And at the end of The War Within, the manipulative Xal'atath used us to knock out a godlike being called a Void Lord and slurped it up to power her favorite plot bauble, which has enabled her to launch a full-scale void invasion of Azeroth. To bring about her plans, she has to snuff out the Light itself, hence starting her invasion at the logical place, the Sunwell.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The design of the new void creatures is diverse and evocative, especially with the more powerful lieutenants, and they help sell the stakes of the invasion well. I won't spoil exactly how this intro section ends, but Blizzard has once again done a great job using the skybox to tell a story.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Eversong Woods one is one of my favorite zones since The Burning Crusade, and I was thrilled to come back and see it bigger, healed, and thriving.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I got a bit of a welcome breather once the immediate disaster was under control, though, as I was quickly shepherded into the new expansion hub of Silvermoon City. This was an awe-inspiring homecoming as someone who has followed the story of this elven kingdom since Warcraft 2 and would call myself kind of a Thalassaboo. The reimagined version is so much larger, richer, and more dense than the one that's been around since 2007. Quel'Thalas, and the adjoining troll kingdom of Zul'Aman, are also now fully, seamlessly connected to the Eastern Kingdoms, finally letting us fly across the entire continent without entering a different instance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where once the Dead Scar left by Arthas tore the city in half is now the Path of Dawn, a highway stretching all the way across the zone and through the capital. Only small remnants remain of the undead corruption and mana addiction that once plagued these lands. What were once the gloomy Ghostlands are now folded into the larger Eversong Woods zone, with the eternal light having returned to all but the furthest corners. It's been one of my favorite zones since The Burning Crusade, and I was thrilled to come back and see it bigger, healed, and thriving.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Summit of the World</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the city itself, most of the real estate is now a faction-neutral expansion hub with all of the vendors and services you'd expect. The Bazaar has been extended across the Path of Dawn to form a new city center, anchored by our command HQ in the war against Xal'atath – the imposing Sanctum of Light. What was once the Ruins of Silvermoon sub-area on the western side has been completely rebuilt with two lovely districts: Falconwing Square, new home of the Farstriders, and Thalassian University, a gleaming college of magic that's also the setting of one of the new delves. Murder Row, representing Silvermoon's shady back alleys, is also tweaked and now part of the faction neutral area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around a quarter of the city is still a Horde-only zone, taking up the remixed Path of the Elders, Royal Exchange, and Court of the Sun areas from old school Silvermoon. The old Farstrider Square has sort of been folded into the latter two, with the Exchange leading right up into the Court of the Sun, but there is also a new subdistrict on the Southeastern side called the Court of Blood, where all of the Blood Knight stuff has been relocated. The Sunfury Spire, center of the kingdom's government, is now a floating tower above the city that is also restricted to Horde only.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alliance players who enter these areas will get a 10-second grace period before all the guards become hostile like any other faction capital, but this aggro can be cleared instantly by re-entering a sanctuary area. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the balance of cross-faction to faction-specific areas, even if it feels like maybe we should be ready to bury the hatchet at this point. The tensions between the visiting Alliance and their Horde hosts play out in the opening hours of the story, which makes for an interesting political drama.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Blinded By the Light</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first conundrum we're sent to solve in Quel'Thalas is an odd and unexpected one, having just come from beating up a bunch of void baddies. It seems that the reignition of the Sunwell has also caused areas called Lightblooms to pop up, which have become overgrown with life and brightness. In fact, the entire zone looks a bit washed out, with an altered color balance that makes it feel like someone has turned a floodlight up too high. The ongoing story of WoW has long hinted that Light can be just as dangerous as Void if you have too much of it, and it seems like we might be dealing with both this expansion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft: Midnight Cinematic Images and First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This issue becomes even more dire in the first of Midnight's delves, Collegiate Calamity, which takes us inside Thalassian University where the Lightbloom has gotten out of control. Compared to The War Within's delves, it felt quite short, but I was playing it on a fairly low difficulty. On the other hand, it feels much more like a connected area, similar to a lot of WoW's best dungeons, as opposed to several War Within delves that were caves with no real sense of place. You can see the rest of Silvermoon in all its glory from the upper terrace, which really helps situate it as part of the world and the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Replacing the cheerful Brann Bronzebeard as your delve companion is the ruthless Valeera Sanguinar, a blood elf assassin who still dresses like every female video game character did in 2007. She's pulling it off, though. I like the new cape. I've only found a couple of her curios so far, so it's hard to say how she fights, but the tone is very different when you're running with a femme fatale edgelord instead of a happy-go-lucky explorer. The change of pace is kind of nice. I don't know if we'll be BFFs, but stranger things have happened.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">In Shadow I Serve</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We haven't been able to play the new Haranir allied race yet, and Midnight isn't adding any new classes. But it does include a whole new spec for the Demon Hunter, the Devourer, using the Void to fuel its powers rather than demonic energies. Thematically, it's a very cool idea with a lot of grim reaper vibes and a rotation that encourages getting into melee for a bit, then getting some distance, and repeating that dance. If you've played a Red Mage in Final Fantasy XIV, it's kind of similar. The best part about Demon Hunters has always been how much their fighting style relies on movement, and that's still true here.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest feature coming in Midnight is definitely player housing, and I was thrilled to discover how powerful the tools for customizing my own little abode in Azeroth are.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for my trusty Marksmanship Hunter, it's hard to compare apples to apples when this is still an alpha and my character on the test server is hilariously undergeared compared to my retail main, but it doesn't feel vastly different, at least in single target. I did my best to recreate my talent build as close as possible to how it is on the live version, and the biggest thing I noticed was that cast time reduction for Aimed Shot is much harder to come by, which slows down the tempo of my rotation quite a bit. The Sentinel hero talents have also seen a significant rework, as have our main multitarget damage-dealing abilities. We'll put a pin, or an arrow, in that.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Homecoming</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest feature coming in Midnight is definitely player housing, and I was thrilled to discover how powerful the tools for customizing my own little abode in Azeroth are – from the floor plan, to the decor, to the walls and flooring. It seemed like adding multiple levels was a little bit buggy in this build, so I didn't get to mess with that much. But everything else works great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Horde neighborhood of Razorwind Shores is triumphant, with everything from a blooming desert to rocky bluffs to tropical islands to a rugged pine forest. I do think the Alliance might be getting the short end of the stick here, though. Their neighborhood of Founder's Point seems really one-note in comparison. It's mostly just a sweeping, green fairy tale forest with a couple areas featuring different kinds of trees, one being mildly spooky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's still a lot of the Midnight alpha for me to see. Try as I might, they wouldn't even let me into the mysterious realm of Zul'Aman! But having played it basically every waking hour since I got access, which was about 10 hours ago as I write this, I am certainly impressed with the new zones and the customization housing allows, and I'm excited to see where the story of the Worldsoul Saga goes next. World of Warcraft: Midnight is due out some time next year, but housing will be rolling out to anyone who owns the expansion in December.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-the-first-hands-on-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Welcome home, champion.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Over a year after its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-next-expansion-finally-adding-player-housing-after-years-of-requests-by-fans">announcement</a>, World of Warcraft's long-awaited housing feature is finally hitting prime time, and we now have a date. Early access for housing will start for players who pre-purchase the new expansion, Midnight, on December 2, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news comes directly from Blizzard, who shared it with us alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-the-first-hands-on-preview">an early alpha preview</a> of the game. During this preview, we actually got to mess around with the new housing system a bit: we explored some of the neighborhoods available to build houses in, moved some chairs and tables around, and dyed a couple of tablecloths.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though we haven't yet had enough time to fully explore the promised wide range of options available, we can confirm there's already a lot one can do to customize the housing space even fresh out of the housing tutorial. And while we didn't get to experiment with some of the more advanced features, in a presentation shown off by Blizzard yesterday, we got a look at how players can add rooms of all sorts of different shapes, tweak item placement at a very granular level, and even decorate the outsides of houses with fancy chimneys and towers, elaborate gardens, and exterior styles themed around humans, orcs, blood elves, or night elves. If we'd had access to the full array of available decor from the get-go, we probably never would have left our house in the alpha.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To start with, players can pick a spot for their house in one of a number of different themed spaces within their neighborhood. For Alliance players, that includes spaces such as a farm, an autumnal forest, a coastal plain, and right next to the local graveyard. For Horde players, options include areas themed after the red rocks of Durotar, the plains of Mulgore, an oasis, and more. Some houses are clustered close to others, while others are spread apart. And you can either join a public neighborhood with strangers, or a private one with members of your guild or in-game community. And all of this is cross-faction, though you do ultimately have to pick either the Alliance- or Horde-themed neighborhood and get locked into one style of architecture or the other. Each player can have two houses per Warband: one in an Alliance neighborhood, and one Horde.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft: Midnight Cinematic Images and First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that is currently able to be explored by players with access to the game's alpha, so expect to see streamers, content creators, and us sharing more about housing in the coming weeks. But anyone who has pre-purchased World of Warcraft: Midnight will get access to this feature themselves on December 2, 2025, ahead of the actual expansion launch. We don't have a final release date for Midnight just yet, though it's expected in early 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Midnight, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-midnight-the-first-hands-on-preview">initial alpha preview impressions right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

These include Rumi's Empowered Sword, Zoey's Golden Bubble Shield, Mira’s X-tra Spicy Ramyeon and the Derpy Teleporter Mask.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of Epic Games' own offerings, KPop Demon Hunters will become the latest officially licensed brand made available for creators to build their own experiences with.

			<p>Marvel Rivals' next update, Season 4.5, launches next week on October 10, 2025, adding Daredevil to the roster as a new duelist. Beyond a new character, next week's update will add the beginnings of a highly requested feature: cross-platform progression support. The catch, unfortunately, is that it'll only be live for players invited to try it out, while everyone else will have to wait for cross-progression support to be available to all players with Season 5's launch.</p>



<p>As is routine with every major Marvel Rivals season update, developer NetEase has debuted two new videos. The first is a gameplay trailer showing off Daredevil gameplay and each of his skill and abilities in action. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Daredevil: The Man Without Fear | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV8lE08wGoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The second is a Dev Vision video featuring the game's creative director, Guangguang, going over the key changes in the coming season, including being able to customize the background of your home screen, and how cross-platform progression will work once it's live for all users.</p>



<p>You'll be able to access a main character across PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms, though your statistics and rankings will be separate for each platform. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marvel Rivals: Season 4.5 Update! // Dev Vision Vol. 10" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RIrLxa_TgKU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Guangguang also teased that a new mode is going to be added to the game, with details set to premiere on October 17, and that the team is preparing a Halloween event with new cosmetics for various characters on the Marvel Rivals roster.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals' fourth season has seen some major changes, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-release-date-season-4/">the addition of a PlayStation 4 version of the game</a> and the introduction of cross-platform progression. However, a bigger, and likely more controversial change is still to come, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/loot-boxes-might-be-coming-to-marvel-rivals/">rumours still loom that loot boxes will be added to the game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new beginner-friendly role-playing game has gone live on Kickstarter. David Marron's first major campaign on the platform is <em>Wizard Community College</em>, an RPG that revolves around learning magic at a magic school. The twist is that magic can easily get out of control if you're not careful.</p>



<p>According to the campaign page, <em>Wizard Community College</em> is a role-playing card game designed for 3-8 players. Each game is meant to last about twenty minutes. As the name implies, the players are newly inducted student wizards, solving problems with spells that go horribly wrong. The promo material is light-hearted and comedic, invoking works like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/strixhaven-curriculum-of-chaos-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Strixhaven</em></a>&nbsp;and the TV show,&nbsp;<em>Community</em>.</p>

The rules can easily be taught in about two minutes. The game is GM-less, allowing all players to contribute to the fiction. Lastly, it is designed to contain the best elements of a one-shot adventure. If you have been looking for a way to bring players into the hobby that isn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> or Monster of the Week, this may be the answer.</p>

<p>Setting up a game of <em>Wizard Community College</em> is simple. The scene is established by drawing an Event Card. This will give players objectives to complete. From there, players take turns in clockwise order, casting spells to solve the problem. Those spells are represented by spell cards.</p>

<p>Whenever a spell is cast, a disk is drawn at random from a bag. The symbol of the disk determines how the spell acts up. The color determines which player gets to explain how the spell messes up. The next player then reacts to the complication. This repeats until the main objectives are completed.</p>

<p>There is only pledge tier <em>Wizard Community College</em>: a physical copy of the game at an MSRP of $20 not including shipping. No add-ons or stretch goals are planned. This was an intentional choice by Marron to keep the project affordable and straightforward. A copy of the game contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>45 Spell Cards</li>
	<li>27 Magic Item Cards</li>
	<li>36 Major Event Cards</li>
	<li>18 Minor Event Cards</li>
	<li>8 Double-Sided Character Cards</li>
	<li>9 Player Aid Cards</li>
	<li>32 Colored Wooden Disks</li>
	<li>1 Drawstring Bag</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, Wizard Community College has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$3,380, which is just shy of its funding goal of $4,000. The campaign ends on October 31.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> may not have a release date yet, but it does have a demo. The coolest-looking Marvel game in years, and a game many of us at <em>Kotaku</em> are excited to play later this year, now has a small demo up on Steam letting you play the superhero brawler alone or with a few pals.</p> <p>On October 1, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4013980/MARVEL_Cosmic_Invasion_Demo/">Tribute Games and publisher Dotemu announced and released a free, playable demo</a> for the upcoming <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>. The demo contains two full levels with boss fights, supports both local and online co-op, and features nine playable characters: Rocket Raccoon, Nova, Phyla-Vell, She-Hulk, Venom, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Storm, and Captain America. Here’s a new trailer for the demo:</p>

  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-brawler-dotemu-tmnt-co-op-switch-1851772740">Announced earlier this year</a> during a Nintendo Direct,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> is a side-scrolling 2D retro-inspired beat ’em up being developed by the same studio behind the extremely tubular and awesome <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, which was also a 2D co-op brawler.&nbsp;<em>Cosmic Invasion,</em> like Tribute’s past games, is a snappy and action-packed retro throwback. I played the new demo on Steam for a few minutes and immediately had a blast smashing baddies as She-Hulk and Spider-Man. <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681">Swapping between the two, which is this game’s big gimmick</a>, was great as it let me switch between Spider-Man’s fast and agile action during some segments and She-Hulk’s heavy hits during fights with tougher foes. I did encounter some performance dips, which wasn’t ideal, but hopefully those issues get ironed out when the game launches…eventually.</p>

 <p>While there are nine characters in the demo, that’s not the game’s full line-up. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is set to include a large roster of 15 characters. <a href="https://kotaku.com/two-new-heroes-marvel-cosmic-invasion-full-roster-black-panther-ghost-rider-2000626521">We know 12 of the 15 characters</a> that will be playable at launch. Three more have yet to be revealed.</p>

 <p>Now the bad news for console players: The new <em>Cosmic Invasion</em> demo isn’t available on Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch. This has understandably disappointed many players online, with some jumping into the comments of the trailer above to share their frustration.</p> <p>Regardless, we shouldn’t have to wait long, as <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is set to arrive in 2025. Exactly when hasn’t been announced yet, but there’s not much time left in the year so if it’s not getting delayed, the game is likely weeks away from launching on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Although I’ve sought out a handful of cards featuring my favorite monsters and characters, I generally only pay casual attention to the </span><i><span>Pokémon Trading Card Game</span></i><span>.&nbsp; I grew up with a giant cardboard box of old cards under my bed, but as an adult, I can’t imagine putting in half the time or money I did into it as a kid. It just seems like it would be too much hassle, and that’s not to mention everything that happens around the game. When I do hear stories about the TCG, they’re usually </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>stories of controversy</span></a><span>. Images of people nearly destroying the Van Gogh Museum in order to get exclusive cards and merchandise to sell online, as well as grown-ass men fighting and camping out for cards outside of GameStops, are seared into my brain. This toxic, predatory side of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collecting </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087"><span>has pushed a lot of people out of the space</span></a><span>, as memories of excitement at finding your favorite card have been replaced by stories of scams and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/card-shop-pokemon-robbed-100k-hammer-rare-cards-thief-1851786241"><span>robberies</span></a><span>. That was how it was for me until fairly recently, when I saw a video from </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>vendor @beard_dad_cardz having an extremely sweet interaction with a girl named Sophia at a card show.</span></p>   <p><span>As a fan of his streams, Sophia is excited to be at beard_dad_cardz’s booth, and his viewers are so excited about her excitement that they donate so she can get a card she likes. She says she’s a fan of Umbreon and Espeon, and after she finds a card of the dark-type Eeveelution she likes, beard_dad_cardz gives it to her for free. The moment went viral on multiple social media apps and has accumulated over 17.8 million views on TikTok alone.</span></p>

 <p><span>A lot of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card vendors have taken up content creation as an extension of their business, and that means several of them livestream from card shows and capture moments like this regularly. You wouldn’t know it from the news, but there’s a lot of kindness, charity, and community in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards that often gets drowned out by the worst bad actors. And as the stigma around the space has grown, creators and vendors like Chris Daywalt, the owner of HLD Cards and Collectibles, are trying to combat these notions by putting these moments of kindness on the internet, where people can see them.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The rise of videos where you’re seeing people scalping Costco for cards or doing things like that, that’s going to happen any time you really shine a spotlight on something, especially something as big as </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>,” Daywalt told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “When people start hearing money around it, those people are going to come out of the woodwork. They did the same thing to sneakers and to Supreme clothes, video cards, and PSIs, anything else that they feel like they can make a quick dollar on, but I think what makes </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>different is the 30 years of community that’s been built around it.”</span></p>

    <p><span>Daywalt started HLD as a way to connect with his son Henry, whom the shop and channel are named after. Henry returned from a summer camp trip with his first set of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards, which led to the father and son bonding over their collections. Daywalt says this ignited a passion in his son to start collecting and gave them a common interest, as Daywalt has been a lifelong TCG player, and grew up playing and trading with others.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I always used to say ‘I play </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span> for the gathering,’ and so I really knew the community part of it before I knew the reselling part of it,” Daywalt said.</span></p> <p><span>What started as an opportunity for Daywalt to pass on his values around taking care of something and finding community quickly became a family business after his brother started making content out of their card show appearances, and his wife started handling other aspects of the business. Daywalt says he’s comfortable sharing this with his son because in his experience, the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community sticks to the messages of kindness the franchise touts. There are still some bad actors that try to take advantage of others, though, which is why Daywalt </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hldcardsandcollectibles/video/7545145575449152799?lang=en"><span>doesn’t do “trade-ups,</span></a><span>” or card exchanges in which the card the event attendee receives is of greater value than the one they part with, with adults, but will do them with kids.</span></p>

   <p><span>Promoting those good moments is why a lot of vendors are branching out into content creation. Sure, it’s another extension of the business and also works as viral marketing, but the narrative of bad actors dominating the space has become so prevalent that long-time fans feel protective of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>and the space they’ve cultivated, and want to push back. Aaron Lee, one of the co-founders of Duckbird, grew up watching the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>anime and has memories of waiting for new episodes to premiere on WBTV back in the day. As such, he’s been in the space long enough to have encountered people engaged in shady practices at card shows time and time again. However, he says a lot of these are less common at in-person events than one might think, and he especially experiences them less in his small North Carolina town.</span></p>

 <p><span>“You’ll see people who you can tell are, like, obviously there to make a quick buck,” Lee told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “There will be even kids and adults who are obviously there trying to make money essentially; taking advantage of vendors and whatnot, and have their kids try to do a trade-up challenge to get them a better card. That’s a big one that I’ve seen a lot, and that has come from a lot of influencers or YouTube content creators being able to do that. But if it’s, you know, someone who knows what they’re doing and[is] just trying to take advantage of people, that’s something that’s not so fun.”</span></p>   <p><span>For Lee and his partner, “Duck,” trying to make people feel welcome at card shows is important. Lee says that the pair tries to give free stuff to kids who show up, especially if they seem to be in the early days of their own collection journey.</span></p> <p><span>“We kind of do like a rock-paper-scissors game, but we use Poké Balls with different types [of Pokémon], and we give them free packs if they win,” Lee says. “Even if they lose, we still give them free packs. We’ll do coin flips with kids for free, and then even if they lose, we’ll keep flipping until they win. So it’s stuff like that to just make sure that anybody who we feel like is new to the hobby or is genuinely passionate about collecting is able to have a positive experience when they go to a show or if they stop by our stream. Anything to just let them know,&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>‘Hey, there are still people out there who really enjoy the space and just want to grow the community in the right direction.’”</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p><span>Stories of vendors going out of their way to help kids get cards they’re looking for are pretty common at these events. Which is why, despite all the talk of big money in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>these days, a lot of the biggest transactions are completely free.</span></p> <p><span>“I had people who were trying to find a card for a kid who’s looking for, like, a specific Pikachu card,” Lee said. “They’ll tell their buddies and their buddies will tell their buddies, and then the whole show will be searching for a card and bringing it to the kid. Half the time, they give it to the kid for free. It really just depends on where you are and who you talk with, but I would say like 80 to 90 percent of vendors that you see in real life are kind. They go out of their way to help the kid out or help somebody out when they’re looking for something specific. I see a lot of kindness with vendors when, sometimes, you might be trying to trade a card in that might not necessarily move as well. A lot of times, vendors will match the card 100 percent and just give the kid what they want, just to help the kid out. That’s where it starts, when you’re a kid and you don’t really wanna look at this in a monetary way. You just want to collect cards. You can really tell if a kid is just trying to collect cards, you know, versus trying to make some money. And that’s what I like to see.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Even with all these positive stories, piercing through all the constant reports of crimes and the viral moments showing scalpers acting a fool at major events can feel impossible. When I asked Daywalt what advice he’d give to someone trying to enter the space, he said the average collector and vendor is not going to be making thousands of dollars off these cards, and if you go into the hobby expecting that, you’re likely going to be disappointed.</span></p> <p><span>“If it’s about the money, go trade stocks or work in finance,” Daywalt says. “What I always say to people is that the reason I don’t necessarily worry if the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>market crashes tomorrow is because I’ll look at it as an opportunity to go get all the cards I wanted. They have a value to me outside of what a TCG player says the market value is. Don’t put that pressure on something, you know, buy it because you like it and it’s something that brings you joy intrinsically, not extrinsically, because it could make you some money.”</span></p>   <p><span>Lee echoed the sentiment and said that some of the best cards are ones you won’t find selling for three or more figures, and if you aren’t interested in the art or community, there are easier ways to make money.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We get tons of people coming up asking for particular Pokémon because they want to collect all of that Pokémon,” Lee says. “Then if it’s a less popular Pokémon like Dunsparce, then, you know, the cards aren’t gonna be as expensive, and it makes for a really fun time.”</span></p> <p><span>Daywalt says that even after the time he’s put into buying, selling, and collecting, HLD isn’t paying his family’s bills, and that every dollar they make at these shows is going back into the business. While he admits he does get invested in predicting the market, he encourages people who are hoping to find the golden ticket in a Target booster pack to interrogate whether they’re in it for the right reasons.</span></p> <p><span>“There’s a lot of knowledge and a lot of really sharp people that are already in the space, and you’re not going to catch up to them tomorrow,” Daywalt says. “I don’t care how many YouTube videos you watch or how many articles you read about it. If you want to get into this space, do it because it brings you joy. Do what you like, and make the money a secondary part of it if it’s important to you.”</span></p>   <p><span>After talking to vendors and seeing these kinds of wholesome interactions online, I still don’t know that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card collecting is for me. I have a collection of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371">Raichu</a> and Professor Turo cards on my shelf, and I think that’s probably enough. But after seeing the uptick in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card scams and content mills over the past few years, it was disheartening for a while to know a series that had brought me so much joy had become a symbol of predatory greed. At the very least, it’s comforting to know that some people are keeping the childlike wonder alive, and that they’re posting reminders of it online.</span></p>

Take a look at what's in store in the teaser below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ipctlvNePk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5ipctlvNePk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In all, Fortnite x KPop Demon Hunters is adding quite a pile of stuff around the Fortnite ecosystem. There are at least three new weapons and items to Battle Royale and Blitz, with Rumi's sword, Mira's Spicy Ramyeon, and a new version of the teleporting void mask. There's Demon Rush, the new KPop Demon Hunters-themed re-do of the limited-time Horde Rush mode, which Epic brings back each October. There are KPop Demon Hunter items and NPCs that can be used for modes designed using Unreal Engine for Fortnite (UEFN), as we've seen previously with Squid Game and The Walking Dead.</p><p>And, yes, there will be skins in the item shop for each member of HUNTR/X. There's been no word about any jam tracks, however.</p><p>October is a busy month for Fortnite. In addition to the Fortnitemares event that is expected to significantly shake up the loot pool in Battle Royale next week, October 2 marks the start of Fortnite OG Season 6, and October 9 marks the beginning of Fortnite Festival Season 11. The new music pass is expected to be full of Fortnite-original stuff instead licensed music and skins like usual--but the KPop Demon Hunters takeover has fans wondering if HUNTR/X might actually be the new season headliners. But there have been no leaks thus far about the upcoming Festival season, so that's pure speculation at this point.</p><p>KPop Demon Hunters is just one of a pretty massive pile of new Fortnite collaborations we're expecting this month.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="010e79099c209"><a title="Silksong Funny" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/010e79099c209/silksong-funny.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's very easy not to see the funny side of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Don't worry, I've been there. Something about bashing your head against a boss for the 20th time takes away the giggles a little bit, and that's okay. But you have to hear me out here: I haven't laughed this much at a game in a very long time.</p>
<p>It tickles a very <strong>Looney Tunes</strong>-esque niche that I didn't realise I still found so funny. There's none of the surrealism of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thank_goodness_youre_here">Thank Goodness You're Here</a> or the quips of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/portal_companion_collection">Portal</a>, but if you're the kind of person who likes watching Wile E. Coyote finally catch Roadrunner only to immediately land a heavy anvil to the noggin, then Silksong has more than enough opportunities to laugh away the pain.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957otjriv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>I first noticed this at the end of my battle with The Last Judge — the final boss of Act 1. I know that I'm not alone when I say that this battle was a <em>pain in the butt</em>. I threw countless, and I mean <em>countless</em>, attempts at this bell chucker (<em>steady</em>), and just when I thought I had wrapped it up at last, it landed one final twisted joke: a massive explosion.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9742e7970a2ea"><a title="Silksong Funny" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9742e7970a2ea/silksong-funny.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'd defeated my much-battled foe and was in the process of performing my victory dance around the sofa when I spotted the smoke spilling from its mace. I dived back to my controller and hit dash just in time to see the whole thing go up in flames, instantly hitting me for three points of health and leaving my already dishevelled Hornet with just one Mask left.</p>
<p>If I had been caught in the epicentre of the blaze and died in the process, it's unlikely that I would have found it as funny, but after hours of trying to beat this thing, the way that it so very nearly got the last laugh was enough to tickle me pink.</p>
<p>It's that last-minute bait and switch that Silksong does so well. It butters you up to the point of <em>thinking</em> you've beaten its toughest challenge, only to then drop a metaphorical Acme Anvil on Hornet's head. If you don't laugh, you'll cry.</p>
<p>And I started to see it everywhere. I'd be patting myself on the back after clearing a particularly perilous bit of platforming along Sinner's Road, only for the floor to crumble away and chuck me into a pit of spikes below. Hunter's March is home to the nasty bench of doom. And what's the High Halls' gauntlet challenge if not a Pharloom rendition of the broadcaster brawl from <strong>Anchorman</strong>?</p>

<p>But like the very best comedies, there are layers to Silksong's laughs. Take the NPCs, for example. When was the last time that you laughed this much at a little guy? They might have a particularly comical look like Garmond's sublime 'stache <em>[Zan-zi-baaaar! - Ed.]</em> , a voice that gets funnier the more you hear it (you know we're talking about you, Caretaker), or just a generally giggle-worthy vibe like... well, all of Trobbio. The more I played, the more I chuckled whenever I ran into a new or familiar face.</p>
<p>There's a sprinkling of slapstick, too. The bug-obsessed Nuu is funny enough on looks alone — Sly Snootles fans, rise up — but let's not pretend that watching Hornet deny their kissy advances with a swift slap to the face <em>didn't</em> make you snort.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's what it all comes down to: Hornet is the ultimate straight man. The weirdness of Pharloom gets dialled up to eleven because we experience it all through the never-wavering emotionlessness of Hornet's mask. I laugh at all of the above examples because I can feel Hornet pulling a <strong>The Office</strong>-style look-to-camera whenever something unexpected happens. You just know that this fearless warrior hates how goofy she looks floating in the Drifter's Cloak or being relegated to riding with the mutts in the back of the Flea Caravan.</p>
<p>I've only seen the one ending of Silksong so far, but I fully intend to go back to it one day and wrap up Act 3. I hear the finale is tough, like <em>really</em> tough, but as long as my beloved little weird guys continue to crop up all over the place, I know I'll have a laugh seeing it through.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Right, there's just a constant wall of bad news at the moment, so how about something a bit nicer. Earlier this year, Summerfall Studios announced that the Kickstarter for their demonic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/malys">Malys</a> didn't work out, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-kickstarter-for-dragon-age-writer-david-gaiders-demonic-deckbuilder-malys-didnt-work-so-here-it-is-in-early-access-instead">so they'd be releasing it in early access instead</a>. Much like Kickstarters themselves, early access releases are risky business too, but it appears that at the very least it's worked well enough to grant the game a 1.0 release.
</p>
<p>
Summerfall shared word of this very fact yesterday, revealing a release date of October 23rd in the US and Europe, or October 24th in Oceania. "There are a million more things we’d put into Malys if we had the time and runway, but we’re so proud of where we’ve been able to get the game to, and how fun it is to play," Summerfall explained in a <a href="https://www.summerfallstudios.com/malys-developer-updates/devlog-6-v1-is-coming">devlog</a>. They also shared that you can expect them to be quiet in the lead-up to launch as they deal with last minute bits of feedback, as well as getting as much actual video game into the video games as possible (plus a bit of polish and "pizazz").
</p>
<p>
In terms of what to expect from 1.0, don't go too attached to your current save file, as it'll be completely reset when the update drops. With the full release, there will be a completely playable story, three regions to get through, a big music update, and the cherry on the icing, a final boss fight. Plus, there are double the "amount of random encounters, or the numerous new cards, curios, demons, consequences and rewards."
</p>
<p>
For those that haven't been ensnared by Malys' dark and mysterious ways, it's one of those roguelike deckbuilders, one where you are a former priest turned demon-hunter who is going around a ruined city performing exorcisms. Summerfall Studios, quite notably, was also co-founded by original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> writer David Gaider, so there's certainly some veteran skill attached to the project.
</p>
<p>
You may also want to pick up Malys now if you're at all interested, as the price will be going up slightly on launch - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449690/Malys/">it's available on Steam now</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Amazon's Luna cloud gaming service, now in its third year, has been a constant part of their Prime lineup, allowing Prime members to stream games at no extra cost right from their PCs or TV sets. Today, the company has <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/new-amazon-luna" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced its plans</a> to overhaul the Luna experience, with new social features and a slew of new games coming to the service later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">The main new offering of the Luna redesign is called GameNight, which will offer a collection of multiplayer-focused games that players control with their cell phones. The collection will include adaptations of classic board games like Taboo and Clue, established party games like Exploding Kittens, and new titles like Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg, where players must try to convince Judge Snoop Dogg to rule in their favor by spinning stories and placing the blame on other players.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajawdjs6KKA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ajawdjs6KKA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The selection of games available to stream on Luna will also increase with the overhaul, with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, and Dave the Diver among those announced. Luna Premium members will gain access to even more games, including Lego DC Super-Villains, Team Sonic Racing, Batman: Arkham Knight, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Amazon Luna fully launched in March 2022, following a "soft launch" trial period that began in October 2020. Subscribers can access Luna on tablets, smartphones, PC, and smart TVs, and they can use any Bluetooth-enabled controller to play streamed games. A Luna controller specifically made for the service was released by Amazon just before the October 2020 soft launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard invited various content creators and press members, Wccftech included, to get a brief taste of the World of Warcraft: Midnight Alpha before it goes live tomorrow. In this short period of time, we were able to capture some footage of Silvermoon City and the new Housing feature, arguably two of the standout features of the upcoming expansion.</p>



<p>We also watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmG98apVwKw&amp;pp=ygURd29ybGQgb2Ygd2FyY3JhZnQ%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deep Dive presentation</a> in advance. This 30-minute video reveals many new details about World of Warcraft: Midnight; here's a summary of what the developers explained about the second chapter in the Worldsoul Saga.</p>



<p>The arrival of the Voidstorm—a swirling vortex of shadow—heralds the return of Xal’atath, the big bad enemy introduced in The War Within, now wielding the Dark Heart. Her goal is simple and rather scary: to devour the heavens and extinguish all light in the universe. The expansion centers on a desperate defense of the Sunwell, led by Lady Liadrin and Lor’themar Theron (and, of course, the players), as the forces of Light and Void clash in a battle that is more reckoning than war.</p>



<p>The Blood Elf capital of Silvermoon City has been reimagined as a shared hub for Horde and Alliance. It's also, at last, a city fully renewed by the Sunwell's light. Landmarks that Horde players have are familiar with now shine renewed, but there are also brand new areas like the Sanctum of Light and Garden of Remembrance, which offer fresh lore and exploration. The shared space includes trainers, vendors, and more. <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As we were told in our Gamescom 2025 interview</a>, a third of Silvermoon City remains exclusive to the Horde, and Alliance players must remember not to get too close or they may be attacked.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="World of Warcraft: Midnight Alpha - New Silvermoon City Tour" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lrmzYU1rbYg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Because of the Sunwell's healing outburst, the Eversong Woods, once scarred by the Scourge campaign led by Arthas Menethil on his way to become the Lich King, are now teeming with life. Eversong Woods has also been merged with the Ghostlands into a seamless, expanded zone connected to the Eastern Kingdoms. The healing energy might have revitalized the land, but it also inadvertently caused a mysterious and dangerous overgrowth known as lightbloom, which, if left unchecked, could cover the whole zone in a jungle-like environment. Quests include solving noble feuds, investigating suspicious apothecaries, and unraveling a murder mystery with Magister Umbric.</p>



<p>After they're done with this first region, players will be able to progress in World of Warcraft: Midnight in any order of their choosing. There are three main options: Zul’Aman, Harandar, or a continent-spanning storytelling experience with Arator, son of Turalyon and Alleria Windrunner. Once those main stories are completed, the paths converge as heroes make their way into the Voidstorm itself to face Xal’atath’s fiercest allies.</p>



<p>The fallen Amani empire seeks redemption in Zul’Aman (once a 10-man PvE raid). Players join Zul’jarra, granddaughter of Zul’jin, to reclaim sacred temples and fight deranged Void cultists. This region features fog-shrouded ruins, stormy wilds, and sky-scraping peaks. Helping the Trolls means they will, in return, aid the Sunwell's defense.<br>Harandar, a primordial jungle deep within Azeroth, is where the roots of the World Tree converge. This region is home to the Haranir, already seen in the previous expansion. They are a reclusive race now forced to join the surface war against Xal’atath. Harandar features fungal towers, moss bridges, and the Cradle—a sacred site once ruled by a nascent goddess, now vanished. The Haranir are also the next playable allied race; their racial abilities include the ability to fast-travel via the World Tree roots. Haranir characters can be Warriors, Hunters, Rogues, Priests, Shamans, Mages, Warlocks, Monks, and Druids (with unique forms reflecting their jungle origins).</p>



<p>As for Arator’s journey, it follows the son of High Exarch Turalyon and Void Elf Ranger Alleria Windrunner on a continent-spanning quest to search for sacred relics and strengthen the Light. Featured encounters include defending Light's Hope Chapel, cleansing Scarlet Monastery, and ultimately confronting his legacy with the Sons of Lothar at Blackrock Mountain, all of which are iconic places vanilla World of Warcraft players will recognize.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, there is the Voidstorm, a chaotic, gravity-defying zone filled with ancient Void creatures called Domanaar. Here, three huge Nexus Points fuel Xal’atath's power. Players must uncover the storm's secrets alongside the Void Elves and other champions from Azeroth.</p>



<p>When it comes to launch content, World of Warcraft: Midnight offers over ten Delves, including Parhelion Plaza (located in the Isle of Quel'Danas), Collegiate Calamity, and Shadowguard Point, and one seasonal Nemesis Delve. Each Delve has its own unique mechanics, like commanding Light artillery or navigating pocket dimensions. The War Within's Brann Bronzebeard will take a break this time so that players will be joined by a new Delve companion: Valeera Sanguinar. Like Brann, her abilities differ depending on her player-selected role of tank, DPS, or healer. When set to DPS, her Killing Spree skill damages multiple enemies at once as Valeera phases in and out of the shadows. As a healer, her Vampiric Reaping extracts the enemies' life force in the form of orbs that the players can collect to get healed. As a tank, she has an ability called 'Your First Mistake' that taunts and deals damage over time to ensure an enemy is focused on her rather than the players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The expansion also includes eight new group dungeons, such as Windrunner Spire, Magister’s Terrace, Murder Row, The Den of Nalorakk, Maisara Caverns, Blinding Vale, Voidscar Arena, and Nexus-Point Xenas. Windrunner Spire, located on the Western shore of Eversoong Woods, explores the haunted legacy of the Windrunner family. Players will have to help Lirath, the only brother to the more famous Winderunner sisters; he's a spirit who just wants his home to be free of the many restless spirits that now call it home. </p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight's endgame includes three raids at launch: Voidspire, the heart of Xal’atath's power, guarded by six fearsome bosses; the Dreamrift, where players will hunt an undreamt god that never should have been, and the March on Quel’danas, where players will face Belo’ren, a Void-corrupted phoenix, in this two-boss raid. </p>



<p>The expansion also adds the Prey System, an opt-in bounty hunting system led by Astalor Bloodsworn in Silvermoon City's Murder Row. Players will hunt targets like Magister Sunbreaker, High Vindicator Vureem, and Executor Kaenius, picking between three difficulty tiers: Normal, Hard, Nightmare. Higher difficulties incorporate torments to add personal afflictions like time-limited kills or lethal spirits.</p>



<p>One of the brand new things revealed today is the Arcantina, a cozy, cross-faction tavern serving as a quest hub and social space. It offers respite from the war against the Void and even access to new adventures. Blizzard said familiar characters would show up, giving quests that will send players worldwide to search for relics from the long-forgotten past.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="World of Warcraft: Midnight Alpha - Housing and Neighborhood Tour" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WrAC7_Syo_g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The long-awaited Housing system will allow players full customization with interiors and exteriors. Architectural styles available at launch include Orc, Human, Blood Elf, and Night Elf. An Advanced editing mode allows rotation, scaling, and floating of décor, and many housing items can be dyed to achieve the desired look. More Housing rewards are tied to many facets of core gameplay, including achievements (even from past content exploits), crafting, vendors, and events. What's particularly interesting is that players can choose to either join a public Neighborhood or a private Neighborhood. The latter are also further split into Guild Neighborhoods, which scale to fit the Guild roster, and Charter Neighboorhods, which cap at 50 homes. The developers have even prepared Neighborhood-wide monthly Endeavors that can unlock themed decorations and community rewards. Early access to the Housing system will start on December 2 for those users who pre-ordered the expansion.</p>



<p>Demon Hunters will be able to select a new spec, Devourer, a Void-powered mid-range DPS with a summonable Void Scythe. Their abilities include Voidblade, Hungering Slash, Void Ray, and Collapsing Star. Metamorphosis and Reap mechanics allow for high burst damage. In addition, Void Elves can now be Demon Hunters, too.</p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight will also update the MMORPG with several quality of life, Player versus Player and user interface enhancements, such as: </p>



<ul>
<li>Transmog overhauled with slot-based looks and auto outfit swapping.</li>



<li>Apex Talents: powerful multi-point capstones in the talent trees.</li>



<li>PvP additions: Slayer’s Rise (an instanced epic battleground inspired by others like Alterac Valley and Isle of Conquest) and an open world PVP area) and Training Grounds (formerly known as the brawl “Comp Stomp,” now a permanent fixture to PVP battlegrounds with Silvershard Mines and Battle for Gilneas available).</li>



<li>New player experience enhancements: fast-track to Dragonflight and lorewalking.</li>



<li>Combat assistant, cooldown manager, profession streamlining, and more.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The spooky season is here and it’s packed with a terrifying number of new game releases. October is always a busy month but this year, it feels even more overwhelming than usual. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, the latest prestige open-world blockbuster from Sony, kicks things off this week while the team behind <em>Shovel Knight</em> wraps up the month with <em>Mina the Hollower</em>, their teeny, tiny, cozy homage to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>, debuting on Halloween. Trick or treat? Why not both!</p> <p>In between, we’re getting the return of franchises with a lot to prove in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, and <em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em>, as well as other big sequels in&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. And don’t lose track of some of the top-wishlisted games on Steam coming in October, including <em>Little Nightmares 3</em> and <em>Arc Raiders</em>. It’s felt like there are too many games for a while now. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-26/the-video-game-industry-has-a-problem-there-are-too-many-games">That’s a problem for the video game industry,</a> but it offers a bounty of riches (and choice paralysis) for players this month.</p>

              <p><span>Because </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228"><span>raising prices for its console wasn’t enough</span></a><span>, Xbox is also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604"><span>raising the price of its Xbox Game Pass subscription</span></a><span> by a whopping 50 percent. The service, which gives people access to a large library of games for a monthly fee, has long been considered one of the best deals in gaming, especially for people who don’t want to buy dozens of games a year. You could theoretically just subscribe to Game Pass and have something new to play every month as games rotate in and out of its catalog. Well, today Microsoft announced it would be raising the price for the Ultimate tier from $20 to $30 a month.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Along with the hefty price increase, the Ultimate tier is getting a lot of new games and perks, including the Ubisoft+ catalog and a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>crew membership that gives you battle pass access and in-game currency every month. The other tiers are also going up in price, and will now include cloud gaming access and an expanded library. The PC Game Pass package, however, is going up from $12 to $16.50 with no new perks. Xbox </span><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/"><span>frames this</span></a><span> as a move toward flexibility and choice, but ultimately, Game Pass’ claim to fame has always been its affordability, and now that its price is going up, the internet has feelings and jokes loaded up.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">When I said i wanted the 360 era back, I didn't mean $360 a year.</p> <p>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1973395774709891226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">From the people that brought you the $650 five-year-old Xbox Series X and the $1000 handheld gaming PC, comes…</p> <p>$30 per month for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate!
