            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/14/24244073/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-review-capcom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><p>Capcom’s<em> Ace Attorney Investigations</em> <em>Collection</em>, the spinoffs to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18306762/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-remastered-review-xbox-ps4-switch">the popular if wildly legally inaccurate <em>Ace Attorney</em> series</a>, are finally out. The two-game collection includes a long-awaited gift for <em>Ace Attorney</em> diehards: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180987/eureka">the official Western release of <em>Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit</em></a>. And though <em>Investigations </em>suffers from gameplay issues that run counter to the spirit of the overall series, the characters and story make the collection a must-have for any <em>Ace Attorney</em> fan.</p></div><p>Though there are two games in the collection, I’m going to focus exclusively on <em>Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>. Despite getting a Japanese release on the DS in 2011, the game never officially made it to the West until now. <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em> puts you in the cravat of prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, Phoenix Wright’s childhood friend, opposing counsel, and, if you subscribe to certain parts of the fandom, longtime lover. (Not me, though, I’m firmly a Gumshoe / Edgeworth girlie.)</p><p>The game plays similarly to <em>Ace Attorney</em>. Somebody gets murdered, somebody innocent gets accused, and Edgeworth must investigate crime scenes for clues. Once the necessary information has been gathered, Edgeworth interrogates people, pointing out contradictions in their testimony with evidence to eventually determine someone’s guilt or innocence.</p><div><p>I often visited the game’s bonus content just to rewatch all the outrageous, “Oh no, I’ve been found out!” animations</p></div><p>In <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em>, the characters are wonderfully colorful, and it’s always a treat to watch them fall apart whenever Edgeworth discovers their lies. I often visited the game’s bonus content just to rewatch all the outrageous, “Oh no, I’ve been found out!” animations.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption>“Oh no, I’ve been found out!”</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Capcom</cite></p></div><p>Because <em>Ace Attorney Investigations</em> is a spinoff series, you don’t need any knowledge of the main games to understand what’s going on. But if you do, oh man, are you rewarded. I was geeking out playing a case that has a massive — and I mean <em>massive </em>— impact not only on the events of the first <em>Ace Attorney</em> game but also on Miles Edgeworth’s entire reason for being.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the game’s story and characters are just as charming as they are in the main series, <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em> sets itself apart with its unique gameplay features, both of which are a bit lacking. New in <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit </em>are the Mind Chess and Logic minigames. The Logic game requires putting together two pieces of information found during an investigation to create new clues. During an investigation at a prison, Edgeworth learns that a critical piece of evidence — a key — has gone missing. He also knows that a metal detector went off in the vicinity of the prison’s alligator enclosure. (Listen, in any <em>Ace Attorney</em> game, things can get very... <em>quirky.</em>) You very literally smash those two pieces of information together to deduce that the alligator swallowed the key. Armed with new information, the game can progress.</p><div><figcaption>An example of the Logic mini-game in Ace Attorney.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Capcom</cite></p></div><p>Completing Logic games is exceedingly easy, demanding none of the deductive puzzle-solving skills that make <em>Ace Attorney</em> games so enjoyable. They’re so simple that they’re actually a waste of time. It’s as though the developers needed to add something to make this game distinct from the main series but couldn’t figure out anything interesting, so they came up with what is essentially evidence gathering with superfluous steps.&nbsp;</p><p>Mind Chess, however, suffers from the exact opposite problem. It’s a worthwhile gameplay addition, but the logic required to beat it is completely impenetrable. In Mind Chess, a subject has a piece of information they don’t want to give up, and Edgeworth must pick from a rotating selection of dialogue options to wear them down until they spill the beans.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with Mind Chess is that, unlike anywhere else in the game, you’re not using evidence to pick apart false statements. Rather, you’re trying to read and respond to an opponent’s… <em>vibes</em>? If you pick a dialogue option that doesn’t jive with your opponent’s emotions, you fail. The game does try to help you out with clues. In one case, Edgeworth notes that a mentally weak opponent will clam up if I pick aggressive options, so when they inevitably got all weepy on me, I correctly remained silent. However, those clues didn’t work in every situation, leaving me floundering. I lost that game of Mind Chess because I once again stayed quiet when that weepy opponent got even more weepy.</p><p>The great thing about both <em>Ace Attorney</em> series is that I’m rewarded for being thorough. I feel like a genius when I catch someone in a lie because I took the time to learn everything about every piece of evidence, which often involves noticing the tiniest or most cleverly obscured detail. And when I’m wrong, it’s not difficult to revisit my case files to find what I missed.&nbsp;</p><p>Guessing until you get to the right answer is the antithesis of that — no brain power, just button mashing. And since Mind Chess relies on what the player can somehow intuit (from a bunch of pixels, no less!), instead of what they concretely know, I wound up guessing in every instance. I might as well have been playing <em>Cookie Clicker</em>.</p><p>But suffering through Mind Chess is well worth the clues you get to solve the game’s greater mysteries. In the main <em>Ace Attorney</em> series, most cases aren’t too closely related, and if they are, the connections are incidental. An important character from one case will show up as a brief cameo in another, or one murder might have minor implications for a later one. But <em>Prosecutor’s Gambit</em> is the first time I’ve seen every single case and every single character (even the dead ones!) have a direct and major impact on the game’s climax.</p><p>All of those connections did muddy the story and create a voluminous record of evidence that was difficult to sift through. But when I finally uncovered the grand mastermind, my body did that slow transition from relaxed and reclined to straight and alert. It was exactly like a scene in a murder mystery when the detective happens upon the one perfect clue that cracks the case, something that playing every <em>Ace Attorney</em> game should feel like.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Do you fondly remember coming home from school in 2006, sitting down with your Xbox 360 controller in hand, and attempting to save a few survivors in the original Dead Rising? I was starting high school, and games like Dead Rising helped make those early days bearable. But here we are, nearly two decades later, with Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. Here is everything we know about Dead Rising Deluxe remaster!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">What is Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster? </h2>



<p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, as its name suggests, is a full-blown remaster of the original story of Frank West and the Willamette shopping mall overrun by zombies. As a photojournalist, you’ll infiltrate the mall in search of a story but stay to help uncover the mystery of the zombie apocalypse and help save as many survivors as possible. </p>



<p>But that’s the more serious aspect of the game. While in the mall, you can dress up in whacky outfits, including cocktail dresses and lego-like helmets, wield outrageous weapons, and snap photos of obscene situations to earn PP, which allows you to level up your skills and become a more formidable survivor.</p>



<p>This version of the game features brand-new controls, better graphics, quality-of-life tweaks, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-achievements-and-how-to-unlock-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new achievements to unlock</a>!</p>

We’re the voice of the PlayStation community, offering passionate, in-depth coverage and insight into the world of Sony. Our goal is simple: to keep you informed, engaged, and part of the conversation surrounding all things PlayStation.</em></p><p>Launching at an <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/09/ps5-pro-announced-costs-usd700-and-out-in-november" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">astonishing $700 on 7th November</a>, the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/tags/ps5-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS5 Pro</a> already faces significant scrutiny from fans: an enormous 89% of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Square</a> enthusiasts deemed the mid-gen machine “too expensive” <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/talking-point-is-ps5-pro-way-too-expensive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a poll</a> this week. Sony now faces the unenviable task of convincing its most engaged consumers that the console is worth the investment. But with many feeling the PS5 generation has yet to really get started, the PS5 Pro’s problems appear to go beyond price.</p><p>This was perhaps best evidenced by Lead System Architect Mark Cerny’s decision to spotlight <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/last_of_us_part_ii_remastered" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Last of Us: Part 2 Remastered</a> during his PS5 Pro presentation – a re-released version of a PS4 game from 2020, albeit an undoubtedly handsome one. While it’s good to know the game will run at an unflinching 60fps in its full 4K fidelity mode on Sony’s new supercharged system, there are few who will feel the astronomical $700 price point is justified by an enhanced last-gen title.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/13/push-square-ps5pro-poll-1726227275980.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>89% of Push Square readers think PS5 Pro is too expensive. Do you agree?</figcaption></figure></output><p>Cerny, to his credit, did highlight some improvements to full-blown PS5 exclusives like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvels_spider-man_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a>, but the broader sentiment remains that the base PS5 has yet to flex its full potential. Tentpole first-party titles like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/pc/god_of_war_ragnarok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">God of War Ragnarok</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/horizon_forbidden_west" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gran_turismo_7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gran Turismo 7</a> all look and play great on the PS5, but they’re also available on the PS4, raising questions about whether they’re even stretching the capabilities of Sony’s base hardware to begin with.</p><p>An extended cross-gen period, which has continued to see titles release across both the PS5 and PS4, has left early adopters feeling short-changed, as they expected the PS5’s power to be fully explored much sooner. Older consoles are ordinarily left behind within one or two years, but bloated development budgets and pandemic-induced stock shortages have meant that last-gen systems remain very relevant today. We’re fast approaching the PS5’s fourth anniversary, and yet many major titles continue to be developed with the decade-old PS4 in mind, including upcoming releases like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>How can [PS5 Pro's] expensive existence be justified when games are still being built with last-gen machines in mind?</p></div><p>All of this puts the PS5 Pro’s value proposition in a precarious position: how can its expensive existence be justified when games are still being built with last-gen machines in mind? Among the PlayStation-obsessed audience on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Square</a>, just <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/poll-are-you-sold-on-ps5-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9% of users say</a> they are willing to purchase the supercharged system at launch – a dramatic decrease from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2016/09/poll_will_you_be_buying_a_ps4_pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 24% who wanted the PS4 Pro</a> at the time of its announcement.</p><p>While <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l3si5ht5be23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">industry data</a> states PS4 Pro only accounted for around 13% of the PS4’s overall install base, it was generally more optimistically received. The timing of the system’s release coincided with an upswing in 4K television adoption, making the promise of improvements to existing 1080p content more tantalising. Furthermore, Sony had long left behind the PS3 at the time of the PS4 Pro’s unveiling, with acclaimed exclusives like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/bloodborne" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloodborne</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/uncharted_4_a_thiefs_end" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</a> already under its umbrella, and anticipated adventures like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/horizon_zero_dawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> on the, well, <em>horizon</em>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Game Enhanced for PS5 Pro So Far</h3></div></output><p>The unfortunate reality is that we’re deep into the generation now and we’re yet to see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2023/12/naughty-dog-has-more-than-one-ambitious-ps5-single-player-game-on-the-way" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what’s next from the likes of Naughty Dog</a>. Development cycles have extended to such a degree that we may only get one true native PS5 title from the first-party favourite – a marked change from the PS3 era, where it released the entire <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/uncharted_legacy_of_thieves_collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncharted</a> trilogy and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/last_of_us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Last of Us</a> in a single console cycle.</p><p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GTA 6</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvels_wolverine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel’s Wolverine</a> will be expected to test current-gen hardware next year, but they’re just two upcoming examples in a generation that’s been unusually slow to get started. Those who podded out for the PS5 in 2020 won’t have expected to wait this long for titles that truly stretch the capabilities of their consoles, and that makes the PS5 Pro’s existence feel all the more unnecessary.</p><p>Sony will argue that PS5 Pro is simply about giving players flexibility, and the option to experience higher fidelity graphics and smoother frame rates if they prefer. But it’s clear, at least in the aftermath of the console’s announcement, that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/poll-would-you-buy-ps5-pro-if-it-was-cheaper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>fans don’t feel like their existing systems have been tested yet</u></a>. And that means the PS5 Pro still has plenty left to prove – even <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/poll-are-you-sold-on-ps5-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beyond its eye-watering price point</a>.</p><p><em>Sammy Barker is the Editor of </em><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Square</a><em>.

<p>"This is a post that I was hoping to not have to write, but Evening Star has been swept up in the same turbulence that has affected so many of our peers in the games industry for the last year and a half," added CEO Dave Padilla on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thedavepadilla_this-was-a-post-that-i-was-hoping-to-not-activity-7240439416752594944-FW_i/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

If you have room on your project for some best in class developers who shipped a critically beloved console title, then look no further than these amazing game devs."</p>

Please don't hesitate to reach out if there are any opportunities that you would like to share with these folks, or if you would like a reference for them."</p>
<p>For those keeping track, with one quarter still to go, 2024 has seen almost 13,000 developers and publishers lose their jobs. Most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">Microsoft laid off a further 650 Xbox staff on Thursday</a>, though no games have been cancelled or studios have been closed this time.</p>
<p>The layoffs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">follow the 1900 people who lost their jobs at the company in January</a> this year.

			<p>The long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of the PS5 Pro proved to be highly controversial due to Sony's pricing choice. Whereas the PS4 Pro launched at the same price as the base PS4 ($399), the PS5 Pro is $300 pricier than the base PS5, surprising fans and analysts alike (although the latter group still <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-at-700-is-for-superfans-could-sell-13-15-million-in-total-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believes</a> it'll sell as well as the PS4 Pro in the end).</p>
<p>Some gamers have started wondering if they wouldn't be better off simply buying a brand-new PC. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3zS2aUa3qQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to IGN</a>, though, Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter said a PC with similar capabilities would probably cost 'a fair bit more'. He also compared the PS5 Pro GPU to the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070.</p>
<p><em>Probably a fair bit more. I mean, for the GPU you're going to need, if you consider the holistic view of all of the different components, the enhanced ray tracing (no AMD GPU has that at the moment), the machine learning block (no AMD GPU has that), it's almost like essentially an NVIDIA style feature set but made by AMD, and the closest equivalent GPU you'll be looking at would be the RTX 4070. The RTX 4060 is quite close to the base PlayStation 5 (factoring out machine learning and ray tracing), so you're looking at a 4070. I looked on Amazon yesterday and the cheapest one of those is $540. Beyond that, you've got to get a CPU, a motherboard, memory, power supply, case, and 2 TB SSD, so the costs are going to ramp up.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Then you have your mitigating factors, which is that you aren't paying however many dollars per year for the glorious honor of being able to play online and have cloud saves, so you've got to kind of amortize costs over the year to get a proper idea of what the actual comparison is. I do think maybe though we might be slightly missing the point because if you consider what the PS5 Pro is, it's a machine that's designed - I don't think it's for new owners, it's for people that have got a PlayStation 5 but they've got the disposable income to have a better PlayStation 5, and I think that these guys are going to have an existing library of PS4 and PS5 titles and to make the jump out of the PlayStation ecosystem and into the PC ecosystem then you've got to leave those titles behind your entire library that you might have amassed over, like, 10 years.</em></p>
<p>The latter point made by Leadbetter is particularly relevant, I believe. Sony isn't trying to get PC gamers to abandon their beloved platform for a new PlayStation console—it is mostly asking existing PlayStation fans to upgrade to a better, faster version of the PS5. Whether they will manage to achieve the same level of success as the PS4 Pro (which sold around 20% of the total PS4 units) despite the high price remains to be seen.</p>

            <p>Nearly a decade after its first announcement, Ubisoft's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a> movie has finally finished filming.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-years-in-development-hell-ubisofts-watch-dogs-movie-finally-begins-shooting">The commencement of filming back in July</a> was revealed with a set photo with the caption: "Lights_Camera_Action.exe".</p>
<p>The end was celebrated in a similar way, only this time the set photo was accompanied by the text: "run film_wrapped.exe(#watchdogsmovie.mp4) … &gt;Filming complete!"</p>

<p>As Tom summarised for us when filming kicked off in the summer, Ubisoft has kept details of the film's plot close to its chest, and for years there was little movement on its plans to adapt its hacking-focused high-tech open-world franchise for the big screen.</p>
<p>But, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-watch-dogs-is-the-latest-game-series-to-get-the-live-action-movie-treatment">things appeared to finally get moving with a report via Deadline</a> that the project would be helmed by director Mathieu Turi (currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-plague-tale-is-being-turned-into-a-tv-series">adapting A Plague Tale for television</a>), working from a screenplay by Christie LeBlanc - the writer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s 2021 French sci-fi thriller Oxygen. It's thought to star Talk to Me actor Sophie Wilde and Hunger Games prequel movie star Tom Blyth.</p> <div>

<p>It's unclear whether this Watch Dogs film will be an original tale or based on any of the three main Watch Dogs games released so far: the gritty Chicago-set original starring gruff hacker Aiden Pearce, the sunnier San Francisco-set sequel starring the youthful Marcus Holloway, or the grim post-Brexit London-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs-legion">Watch Dogs Legion</a>, launched in 2020.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>So… the PS5 Pro became a thing this week, and I think the reaction to it has been pretty unanimous. We’ve got a couple months before its launch in November, at which point it will be fascinating to see how it sells. As with so many things on the internet, a blend of echo chambers and angry vocal minorities can really skew the reality of a situation, so Sony will be optimistic that it sells just as well as the PS4 Pro – reportedly around 15 million units through its lifespan.</p>
<p>That’s the biggest headline, but what else has happened this week in gaming?</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>Now then, what have you all been playing?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman</strong> has been lured in to grab Astro Bot at launch price by all the rave reviews it’s had. He’s also been playing 60 Parsecs, and enjoying it even more than 60 Seconds, and chipping away at odds and ends in Dreams.</li>
<li><strong>MrYd’s</strong> added Lego Star Wars to his playlist, but strangely chose to start with Episode 1. He’s also been lugging around Sir Ian Livingstone’s book and dealing with signed art prints.</li>
<li><strong>Andrewww’s</strong> really doubting that he’ll manage to finish Horizon: Forbidden West before it leaves PS Plus next Tuesday, especially with little gaming time this weekend. Still, he thinks it’s “an excellent game with very good quest stories.”</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead!</p>
