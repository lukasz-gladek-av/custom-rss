The newest version of Razer’s top-end wired keyboard supports 8,000Hz polling (both upstream and downstream), and it’s got new analog optical switches designed to minimize interference and prioritize speed. Razer claims it put a big emphasis on typing feel and sound this time, using dense foam layers and pre-lubed switches like in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23836326/razer-blackwidow-v4-75-mechanical-keyboard-hot-swappable-switches">BlackWidow V4</a>.</p><p>While foam and lube are staples of the enthusiast mechanical keyboard community, the new Huntsman is not hot-swappable. The switches are soldered and the chassis is built more for durability than tinkering with mods.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Everyone should own a quality Bluetooth speaker. They’re wonderful for so many situations whether you’re heading to a park with some friends or just getting some chores done around the house by yourself. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5060/">The JBL Clip 5 is perfect for any time you’d find yourself reaching for a Bluetooth speaker plus, right now, Amazon has it on sale for 25% off.</a> That brings the price down by $20 from $80. You’ll only have to pay $60 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5060/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Loud and Powerful Sound</h2>
<p>This JBL portable speaker has been made to produce clear sound with a booming bass wherever you bring it with you — and you can bring it anywhere. It’s IP67 waterproof and dustproof meaning you can take it to the pool or even the beach without worrying about it getting damaged. Heck, that’s where this thing shines. It’s engineered with an exterior combining fabric and rubber to make it durable. It will have no issue withstanding the elements or getting banged up a bit.</p>
<p>The JBL Clip 5 gets its name from having a carabiner clip integrated into its design (and being the fifth generation version of the model). the speaker is already portable because of its size, but the clip makes it even easier to take along with you. Just clip int onto your bag or belt loop. Then once you’re where you need to be, the clip comes in handy to adhere it in place like to the back of you beach charge or onto a kayak.</p>



<p>Any potable speaker worth its weight in gold is going to need solid battery life. It’s not much use if the thing dies just a few songs in. The JBL Clip 5 is able to provide you with up to 12 hours of listening time on just a single charge. If still proves to not be enough, you can turn on Playtime Boost which can prioritize power, getting you up to three additional hours out of it for a total of 15. That should hopefully be enough for you to take on the day and then some.</p>
<p>What’s fun about JBL speakers are they generally are available in a ton of cool colors and patterns. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5060/">The JBL Clip 5 is no exception on that part. You can still with the more traditional options such as the all black or all white, or you can choose to go a bit funkier.</a> Along with black and white, you also have a choice of black with orange, pink with blue, sand with green, pink, blue, purple, red, as well as “squad” which is a camouflage pattern.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-update-redsec-season-1-download-free-ea-ps5-steam-2000639598</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%98s-biggest-update-and-its-free-battle-royale-mode-are-now-live.1336945/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today is a big day for<em> Battlefield 6</em>, EA’s recently released online military shooter. This is the day that <em>BF6</em>‘s first massive update goes live across all platforms, bringing a ton of changes and fixes to the game. It’s also when season one of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> goes live, turning the shooter into a true live-service game. And on top of all that, Tuesday is when EA launches <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s free-to-play battle royale mode, <em>Redsec</em>.</p> <p>On October 28, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1983190078353449368"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s 1.1.1.0 update</a> went live across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-challenges-grind-injector-30-kills-change-season-one-update-ea-2000638854">Battlefield Studios previously released the full patch notes</a> for this big update last week, which you can find at the bottom of this post if you want all the nitty-gritty details. But the big changes worth highlighting include improvements to movement, less annoying weapon bloom, improvements to lighting and visibility, and a load of UI tweaks to help make it easier to understand what’s happening while playing.</p>

 <p>This is also the update that moves EA’s popular FPS into its live-service era, with the launch of season one and the first part of the new season, Rogue Ops. <em>Battlefield 6</em> now features a tiered battle pass with various challenges to complete and rewards to unlock. Rogue Ops also adds Blackwell Fields, new weapons, and a very awesome armored APC that can heal soldiers riding in the back. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">While I’m not sold on Blackwell Fields being a new classic <em>Battlefield</em> map</a>, I’m still happy to have a new location to play on, and glad that I might not have to play New Sobek City as much. Season one of <em>BF6</em> will feature two more parts that will arrive in future updates, with November bringing the next chunk of content, including another new map that I got to play recently and really enjoyed.</p>

 <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s battle royale mode is available now</h2>  <p>Also launched on Tuesday is <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-leak-nintendo-direct-september-ff9-remaster-2000622058"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s battle royale mode</a>. <em>Redsec </em>is both a part of <em>Battlefield 6</em> and also a fully separate game that can be freely downloaded on all platforms where <em>BF6</em> is available. If you’ve already updated <em>Battlefield 6</em>, you can go to the game’s settings and under system, you’ll find the install/uninstall section. This will let you download <em>Redsec</em> and its optional high-res textures.</p>

 <p>But you don’t need to own<em> Battlefield 6</em> to play Redsec. You can also just search for “Redsec” on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, EA App, or Steam, and it <em>should</em> be available to download for free. This will let you play <em>Redsec</em> (duh) and a few other competitive modes connected to the battle royale, but this isn’t <em>Battlefield 6.</em> You won’t be able to play Conquest or Rush with <em>BF6</em> players or friends. It’s just <em>Redsec</em> and its various modes/versions. And yes, <em>Redsec</em>, like <em>Battlefield 6</em>, is completely cross-platform and supports cross-progression as well.</p> <p>We’ll have to wait and see how <em>Redsec</em> turns out. Is this EA’s answer to Activision’s dominant <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone"><em>Call of Duty Warzone</em></a>, or will <em>Redsec </em>flop? I’m not sure, but I’m excited to at least hop into <em>Redsec</em> and find out if <em>Battlefield 6</em> makes for a good battle royale experience. Anyway, here are the full patch notes for this new season of <em>Battlefield 6:&nbsp;</em></p> <p data-block="true" data-editor="b1rd8" data-offset-key="cpdav-0-0"> <h3

<p>Battlefield 6 Season 1 is here, and that means the arrival of new maps, modes, weapons, and the battle royale platform known as REDSEC. It also means that the game’s first Battle Pass is here, and as you probably predicted, it’s split into <strong>two tiers</strong>. In this guide, I’ll help you figure out if the Battlefield 6 <strong>BF Pro </strong>Battle Pass is worth your money.</p>



<p>The Battlefield Pro Battle Pass will set you back £21.99 (or your local equivalent), and the content found within will last for <strong>12 weeks</strong>. Let’s figure out if it’s worth your time, effort, and money to invest in the rewards found in the BF Pro Battle Pass in Battlefield 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-comes-with-the-battlefield-pro-battle-pass">What Comes With the Battlefield Pro Battle Pass?</h2>



<p>REDSEC might be free to access, but if you want to get the most from <a href="https://amzn.to/47BLy9s">Battlefield 6</a>, you’ll need to get a Battle Pass. There are two variants: Standard and Battlefield Pro. The former costs 1,100 Battlefield Coins (£8.99 or your local equivalent), but the BF Pro Battle Pass can only be bought with cold, hard cash.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter how many BF Coins you have; you can’t use them to buy the BF Pro Battle Pass, but the rewards in the Pro Pass are <strong>much greater</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you get for investing in the Battlefield Pro Battle Pass:</p>

<p>It all begins with five instant unlocks, including the new GGH-22 pistol (modelled on the Glock 22). Your 25 free tier skips will enable you to power through almost the entire first section of the Battle Pass – ‘Rogue Operators’. This puts you <strong>one step away </strong>from the new SOR-300SC carbine.</p>



<p>In the Instant Unlock section (for both Battle Pass and BF Pro users), you’ll get <strong>twelve items </strong>immediately, including four new operators, two weapon packages, a knife skin, a parachute skin, calling cards, and XP boosters.</p>

<p>There’s a tasty reward at the end of each section in the Battle Pass:</p>

<li>Pacific Ghosts</li>
</ul>



<p>And then you hit the <strong>Ultimate </strong>tiers, and finally the <strong>Prestige </strong>tiers.</p>



<p>Here’s the final reward in each portion of the Battlefield 6 Battle Pass.</p>



<h3 id="h-rogue-operators-forest-sentry">Rogue Operators – Forest Sentry</h3>

<p>If you don’t like the current path you’re on or want to target different rewards, you can switch paths at any time, making headway towards other rewards in different channels.</p>



<p>Only once you’ve unlocked everything can you access Ultimate and Prestige rewards. Here are the final rewards in those channels:</p>



<h3 id="h-ultimate-spiteful-mirage">Ultimate – Spiteful Mirage</h3>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-prestige-battlefield-coins">Prestige – Battlefield Coins</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>With stacks of exclusive rewards, challenges, unlocks, and the chunky experience boost being set aside for BF Pro subscribers, I think it’s more than worth the money. However, if you’re not going to invest a lot of time in Battlefield 6, then perhaps the standard edition is for you.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that you can unlock enough BF Coins in one full Battle Pass to purchase <strong>the next </strong>Battle Pass, so bear that in mind.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>From Star Trek’s endless stream of inexplicable anomalies, to the eye-gouging horrors of Event Horizon and Warhammer 40,000’s Warp, and even relatively well-meaning beings that are utterly incomprehensible to the human mind, I’m honestly quite happy not going to space. It just seems like quite a bad time, all around, but in What The Stars Forgot, it’s utterly necessary for a research vessel filled with brave souls to explore and face countless unknowable mysteries.</p>
<p><iframe title="WHAT THE STARS FORGOT REVEAL  - Developer Interview and Airlock Games Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/spNBJ3Eaw_k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Humankind has become a space-faring race, but it seems we’re utterly alone in the galaxy, until an anomalous signal was detected at the Legasov Nebula, leading to Earth’s governments to sanction a scientific expedition to explore. A cutting edge ship was created with fold-drive technology powering its space flight, and a crew of our very best (and a bunch of more OK support staff as well). And then there’s you, the quantum AI dubbed as SNPAI – geddit? –&nbsp;who gets to play a bit of an all-seeing HAL 9000 role, just hopefully less evil.</p>


<p>What awaits in the furthest reaches of space aren’t pleasure planets and friendly life form discoveries, but an endless string of sci-fi horrors and anomalies that need to be investigated and resolved. Your job is to oversee the ship’s operations, assign shift patterns as efficiently as possible, divert staff to tackle crises and dynamic events, and find the path to the next sector of space.</p>


<p>What’s immediately striking is the retro aesthetic, with this game feeling every bit the SNES JRPG thanks to the blue gradients behind so much of the UI, and pixel art characters running around. The ship is arrayed out in front of you, like someone cut off the outer hull of the Red Dwarf, with the command bridge at one end, and all the expected med bay, brig, science, shuttle bay and more. But there’s a nice self-sustaining element as well, as there’s a chicken coop, grain growing, and a Silent Running-like park for crew to go and relax in.</p>
<p>But the running of this ship is constantly upended by those anomalies, with the demo taking a scripted path through a bunch of what could happen in the full game. To start off, a maintenance panel has caught fire and needs immediate attention, grabbing a pair of available crew members, they’re seriously unqualified for the job and…. well, they blow up. Let’s remember to try and assign well-qualified crew in future, OK?</p>
<p>Then the seriously odd things start to happen. The chickens start exploding, leaving bloody messes throughout the coop, so you race to send agriculture experts to diagnose the issue, before Science can take over to cook up a vaccine, and then to manufacturing to produce the cure. And just when you think that was resolved, half the crew just ups and disappears!</p>

<p>It’s a good thing you brought a few spares along with you, because you’ve got three shifts of staffing to fill the available slots. All your crew has a five star rating in 11 categories, making them suited to comms, engineering, cooking, leadership, manufacturing and more. Shuffling them around to fill vacant slots is fairly easy, but when you want to have the most competent crew as possible, it’s could be the case that you sacrifice a four star rating in one category just to get a two or a three slot filled elsewhere. I’d love to see the UI for this overhauled a bit, giving a bit more of a spreadsheet feel for a wider overview of the crew or more than a single category filter, because you can easily get stuck in the weeds bouncing back and forth between rooms and shifts.</p>
<p>All of the procedurally generated crew will have hidden talents as well, potentially making them better or worse suited to certain tasks, and having potential to grow and level up over time. Maybe they’re secret wannabe cultists, or cannibalism curious, though? I guess that’s what the airlock is for –&nbsp;this room’s cell design being especially dark, with just a sandwich of force fields between the interior and the vacuum of space.</p>

<p>The final anomaly for the demo comes as a mysterious energy being appears in the shuttle bay and starts to feed off the shuttles. Rushing to send scientists to investigate, it quickly becomes clear that this is a direct existential threat as the creature is drawn to the energy of the Fold Drive itself. The quick reaction chance is to manufacture a fake Fold Drive and vent it into outer space. This, however, doesn’t exactly go to plan, and ends up not mattering as more of these beings appear and blow up the ship.</p>
<p>I’m fascinated to see how this game comes together, being created by a industry veterans Justin Fischer and Brock Feldman, who founded Airlock Games to escape the abstracted roles that upper management lead them to. That’s putting them very hands on in a lot of areas of the game –&nbsp;Justin is composing the music, making sound effects and writing dialogue, for example. There’s great potential and adaptability from this small scale, of course, and so there’s the possibility that the ship’s design and layout could be put in the hands of players, with synergies between departments and how they’re staffed.</p>
<p>I do really like the tone and overarching direction of What The Stars Forgot, blending more eldritch horrors into its FTL and Star Trek-inspired adventure. With four sectors to navigate in a single playthrough, I’m keen to see just how weird this game can get.</p>
<p>And as <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/airlock-games/what-the-stars-forgot-retro-sci-fi-horror-management-sim?ref=discovery&amp;term=airlock%20games&amp;total_hits=3&amp;category_id=35">the game goes live on Kickstarter today</a>, Airlock Games is looking to move quickly, with an early access build put into the hands of backers in December and a 1.0 launch expected in March. With such an intriguing blend of ideas and inspirations, we’re going to keep our eyes on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Mere days before the highly anticipated release of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span>—a DLC and Kickstarter stretch goal turned mammoth sequel to one of the most impactful games of the 2010s–the lead developers behind the game, William Gibson and Ari Pellen, broke their near-monastic vow of silence and explained the reason for the game’s long absence from the public eye. After years of no communication, during which many assumed the long-delayed game was suffering through development hell, the pair revealed the exact opposite.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk"><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i></a><span>, they explained that </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>only took so long because the team had been </span><i><span>having fun</span></i><span> making the game. There was no behind-the-scenes catastrophe. No drama or rift between the members of the relatively small development team in Adelaide or the dozens of contractors who helped Team Cherry bring </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>across the finish line. There was no meddling from the various publishers that, at one point or another, seemed to vie for the team’s favor and the ability to promote the titanic sequel at one or several showcases. It turned out that </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>was just a really intense, and really prolonged, labor of love, a rarity in an industry that has only grown smaller and colder in the time the game’s taken to gestate.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A funny thing happened during that self-imposed, years-long radio silence: </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>became </span><i><span>the </span></i><span>most wildly anticipated game of the generation, outside of only the next </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span>. Through little more than effusive word-of-mouth around its predecessor and a </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/21/hollow-knight-silksong-feels-wildly-different-and-incredibly-familiar-e3-2019"><span>few rock-solid previews</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> came entirely undone from reality and entered the harrowed halls of gaming legend. For years, players would champ at the bit in livestream chats in which they endlessly screamed “</span><i><span>SILKSONG</span></i><span>???” to no avail.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>At last though, on September 4, 2025, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>arrived, and with its arrival came the teardown of a long-held fantasy. Finally, we were able to see, hear, and feel the game in its entirety for ourselves, as it actually exists. Evaluate it for what it was rather than what we wanted it to be. This cherished thing that so many, across the game’s developers and its many fans, had poured an immense measure of love into for all these years.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>So, is </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>everything that I, a self-professed </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>sicko, wanted? Does it live up to </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/i-spent-all-weekend-playing-hollow-knight-silksong-and-im-totally-enthralled-but-nothing-could-completely-live-up-to-the-hype-after-so-many-years/"><span>the hype</span></a><span>? Does it reinvent the Metroidvania? Is it a cultural reset? Is it </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/goty-2025-silksong-clair-obscur-difficulty/?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=68c466d11a96e10001d09c87&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky"><span>too hard</span></a><span>? Was it worth the wait? Is it </span><i><span>fun</span></i><span>?</span></p> <h2>Act I</h2> <p><span>Well, what </span><i><span>should </span></i><span>a game of </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s magnitude be? To understand that, I think you first have to get what </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> was.</span></p>

 <p><span>In 2018, </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> came to the Nintendo Switch. I could wax poetic about how much the experience meant to me and how thoroughly it rewired parts of my brain. How much of my own taste clicked into place while combing the depths of Hallownest, the collapsed bug kingdom in which the first game takes place. How in touch it felt with my own anxieties. How beautiful it felt despite the collapse, barbarity, and ruin that it invited players into.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/v5e_ghRxYs8"><span>now thoroughly memed final encounter</span></a><span> against the game’s true villain, a deity-like figure known as the Radiance that at first disguises itself as the sun, has not only given me my desktop wallpaper, but also, in its hero’s resistance and determination, offered me a model of absolute defiance. The weirdos, adventurers, and screwballs tucked away in the darkest corners of Hallownest have time and time again embodied the virtues of diversity and acceptance that I live my life by. Quirrel, one of those very same oddballs, is one of my favorite characters of all time, and his odyssey through Hallownest is one of my very favorite threads of the whole adventure.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639593" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639593"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639593">©Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Of course, it’s hard to talk about that first game without mentioning its spectacular cadre of boss fights either, which goes well beyond that final confrontation I mentioned. While much continues to be made of the series’ difficulty, especially with the release of </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>, I’ve hardly ever seen the games as ones driven by a merciless bloodlust that tests the players at every turn. Don’t get me wrong, many a </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> boss has stumped me, but I’ve rarely thought of these fights as particularly grueling. They’re more…rhythmic. I’ve written before about how I think </span><a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hollow-knight-silksong/silksong-reminds-us-that-theres-room-for-tough-games"><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s combat can feel balletic</span></a><span> and, well, </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> was my first dance instructor. Through its rigorous gauntlets and tutelage, including the game’s now renowned bouts against the Mantis Lords, Watcher Knights, and Troupe Master Grimm to name a few, I learned my marks and how to hit them with something resembling grace and finesse.</span></p> <p><span>And as a reward for diving in headfirst and drinking so deeply of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>‘s waters, I was granted the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ITtPPE-pXE"><span>keys to Hallownest</span></a><span>, one of the most thoroughly realized settings any work has ever spirited me away to. It’s a well-worn trope at this point to marvel at its construction and level of detail, but the City of Tears moves me so deeply that I </span><i><span>must </span></i><span>always invoke its quiet majesty. The city’s defining quality, outside of its lavish and stately skyline, is the rain. Despite being underground, a crack in the ceiling above it–a strong but subtle metaphor among </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>‘s numerous elements that echo with greater meaning–invites the pristine waters of an underground lake, casting a pallid blue light over the decaying city and drenching it in a never-ending rainfall as if trying to wash away its sins.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Though it never occurs in the game, I think about the day that crack rips the sky above the City of Tears wide open. In a rapturous moment, the lake it holds up will appear to the city’s precious few survivors like the ocean coming down on their heads, and in an instant, it’ll swallow the city whole.</span></p>

 <p><span>This, and so much more, is the precedent set forth by </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>. It is the legacy of that game, and it only grows with each passing year. Suffice to say, it is a hell of a thing to live up to, and a tough–some might even say impossible–act to follow and build atop. But that’s what </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>sets out to do. And I tell you what, it makes a tremendous attempt, even if some cracks begin to form in the foundation under the sheer weight of it all.</span></p> <h2>Act II</h2> <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>largely continues </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>‘s exemplary work. It once again casts players as a diminutive but fearsome warrior critter, though this time as the first game’s deuteragonist–and sometimes rival–Hornet. Much like the Knight of the previous title, Hornet is driven to Pharloom, </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s similarly haunted kingdom, by forces greater than herself. Along her journey, she learns of a similar corruption to the one that threatened Hallownest before–</span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>does make clear it is a successor that follows after</span> <span>the events of the first </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>. And just like the Knight, Hornet befriends many oddball (and adorable) bugs, fells terrible foes left and right, discovers many secret passages, and uncovers the </span><a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hollow-knight-silksong/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-explained-religious-themes"><span>unflinching cruelty of this doomed, yet beautiful setting</span></a><span> she’s now forced to save. You’d be forgiven for thinking </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>was a “lazy” sequel given these familiar parameters and beats, but the comparisons (outside of the game’s visuals and atmosphere) mostly end there.</span></p>

  <p><span>That’s because </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>knows its playing the hits–which its developers workshopped in </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> and then sharpened here–and then spends much of the rest of its runtime constantly fucking with the foundation in ingenious, and often dastardly, ways. Like </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s inverted narrative–in which Hornet climbs from the depths of the kingdom as opposed to the Knight’s descent into the abyss–the game’s hostile design delights in toying with your expectations. Hunter’s March and Bilewater, two of the new locales nestled in Pharloom’s expanse (a word I do not use lightly in this game’s case), are now infamous for the way that they jostle the player and refuse to allow them the </span><a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hollow-knight-silksong/theres-no-place-for-serenity-in-hollow-knight-silksong"><span>time and space for complacency</span></a><span>, but could you believe they’re only the tip of the iceberg?</span></p> <p><span>Later sequences, like a rad-as-hell prison escape and an icy climb against the clock, prove out how exciting it is that </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>, as a core principle, kind of fucking hates the player. In </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, like in most Metroidvania fare, it’s enthralling to grow more powerful and open up doors that you were previously locked out of. </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>recognizes this, but slows that progression to a relative crawl and regularly forces Hornet, and the player, on their backfoot. The result is a tangibly scrappier game that is less and less decided by arbitrary numbers and levels and has more to do with what I can only describe as achieving a level of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXTKa48-36Q"><span>drift compatibility</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>This antagonism bleeds into several of the pain points and criticisms that have been levied at the game, such as </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-silksong-drags-them-into-the-spotlight-again-have-boss-runbacks-had-their-day"><span>punitive and demoralizing runbacks</span></a><span> to several bosses, especially one to a certain fight in a sandblasted region ripped straight out of Hell. And yes, it also extends to </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s several–and I do mean </span><i><span>several</span></i><span>–wave-based gauntlets, as well as its sometimes oppressive (not to mention optional) third act, both of which feel like exhaustive trials by fire. But I’ve gotta admit, I’ve learned to love this game throwing the whole damn book at me. For the most part. It keeps me on my toes.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639596"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639596">©Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><span>If </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is guilty of anything, it is knowing what the player expects to find at nearly every twist and turn and preempting them, sometimes with a new form of obstacle or gag, and trusting them to overcome these regular tests. This surely must be the mark of well-learned students of the medium and form, and makes the hackneyed turn of phrase “a love letter to the genre” into something resembling a more concrete argument. Since being released, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>has been accused of being a pretty unforgiving game for many of the above reasons and more. If you ask me, though, what it really is pretty damn playful. Playful and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-zelda-inspiration-too-on-rails-1851653126"><span>trusting</span></a><span> of your ability to pick up the game and triumph over anything it throws at you, especially with the arsenal of tools and movement abilities bestowed upon you, as well as Hornet’s natural grace.</span></p> <p><span>Reader, I hooted (I never hoot) at the </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/silksong-hunters-march-bench/"><span>fakeout bench trap in Hunter’s March</span></a><span>. I jumped in my seat at my triumph over the gauntlet in High Halls and hardly regretted the hours I spent chipping away at it. The climb up Mount Fay falls </span><i><span>just </span></i><span>shy of </span><i><span>Celeste</span></i><span>-level platforming in my eyes, and the Deep Docks? Well, they’re never boring. And with time, these lessons all taught me to dance through the Blasted Steps unscathed by any of the man-eating sandworms that occupy it. By the time I confronted The Last Judge for the final time, I emerged free of any burns, like only the warrior-princess Hornet could.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Uptown Girl, but make it haunting."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Team Cherry</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Metroidvania</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Gorgeous hand-drawn world filled with thrilling encounters and challenging level design around every corner, and driven by an all-time great platforming heroine.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Less cohesive than its predecessor in narrative and worldbuilding due to excess.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC, PS5, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2 (Played on), Nintendo Switch</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date: </p>                 <p>September 4, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>About 73 hours, completing the entirety of the game's main story (including an optional third act), as well as most sidequests and optional bosses, and acquiring most collectibles in the game. Still only at 86 percent completion.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>relishes in a kind of defiance that I admire. Sequels, especially video game sequels, are often bigger than their predecessors, a sin which </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is guilty of, but they’re rarely more frictional. And because </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>zigs where others would zag, it has a personality that I think is rare to come across in sequels, which are so often by-the-numbers. It’s got bite and verve, just like its sharp and commanding protagonist. It’s headstrong, and its architects–Team Cherry itself–feel like a friendly rival I’m in competition with, and that back-and-forth has consistently motivated me to push back and push further. Playing </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>feels like being in conversation with it, and with every session–with every talk–I regularly felt like I was learning more than I would playing a game perfectly content with playing it safe.</span></p> <p><span>And the thing is, </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s heights are </span><i><span>largely </span></i><span>worth these long talks and toils, but that steadfast attitude and hardheadedness only get it so far.</span></p>

 <h2>Act III</h2> <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is an exceptionally well-constructed game up to the end of its first act, filled with rousing fights against spectacular bosses that test your mettle early on, as well as locales that tease the imagination while simultaneously sating that thirst for adventure that the first game so thoroughly quenched. But it’s really in the game’s second act, which sees Hornet exploring the intricacies of the Citadel—a brass city and holy place at the very top of Pharloom—that it explodes and starts building the connective tissue that binds the entirety of this enormous kingdom together.</span></p> <p><span>Remember how I invoked the City of Tears from </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>earlier? How much I loved the depth of it, not only as a setting but because of the simple and powerful metaphor accomplished by linking it to Blue Lake above it? </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>’s vistas enthrall me to no end, and its visuals are no doubt more varied than those of its predecessor, but it fails to tell stories as succinct or as impactful as that first game did.</span></p>

 <p><span>To its credit, there are places where </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>rises to the occasion. Greymoor, a downtrodden village that sits squarely beneath the Citadel (and also boasts a rainy disposition) plays a familiar tune. That and the intended route of the Pilgrimage on which so many bugs find themselves reveal a lot about Pharloom and its people while saying very little. But by and large, I found looser connections between regions, fewer storytelling nuggets and pocket-sized narratives, and less opportunity for my own curiosity to thrive.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> still yields so much to see, and there are inarguably more nooks and crannies than ever to explore in Pharloom, but Hallownest’s elegant and understated mystique is absent here, and it is instead replaced by a labyrinthine behemoth–complete with </span><i><span>many </span></i><span>proverbial Minotaurs–though one that instills in you the pressure of obligatory completionism rather than the liberating sense of adventure.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639601" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639601"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639601">©Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At this point in my own experience with it, the sheer excess of </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>began to weigh on the game, my own interest in it, and the world which Team Cherry had so immaculately constructed. Its cast of characters dwarfs that of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, but less of them stand out among the rest of the noise here. Shakra, the game’s recurring map maker and traveling warrior, is always a joy to interact with, and following her narrative thread to its end provided an emotionally satisfying resolution I’m grateful to have seen to its end, but she’s one of the game’s exceptions in this regard. By comparison, there are numerous threads I can remember following in </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, like the stories of Quirrel and Cloth, as well as boss characters like the Traitor Lord and Soul Master, all of which provided narrative bows with which to wrap up and package the small, impactful vignettes across Hallownest.</span></p> <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>seems interested in turning some of these interactions and asides into a more concrete facet of the series, but they almost seem lost in the expanded scope of the game. For example, job boards filled with side-quests called “Wishes” seem like they’d provide ample opportunities to expand on characters in explicit ways—</span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>preferred the </span><i><span>Elden Ring </span></i><span>approach of loosely threaded emergent narratives—but they mostly amount to busy work and chores which fortify pockets of community around Pharloom, but rarely dive deeper into the make-up of these towns and their bug denizens.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>What stings is that underneath it all, there are some truly awesome things tucked away in </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>, a game whose depth in places frequently, yes, awed me. Awesome encounters and sequences that continued to test me right up to the very end, threads which tied the two games together, and glimpses at the world outside of the </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> series’ haunted kingdoms that I would love to see explored further down the line. But it does also feel at times like a sequel made for players with an eye towards awe and spectacle rather than profundity.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe that weight I’m referring to, the one that threatens to undo </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>at times, has less to do with literal bloat from the game’s prolonged development (though it has surely manifested in this way) and more to do with the impossible burden placed on </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>to be</span><span> the most incredible game ever. I reckon that when Team Cherry first released </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, they’d no idea the ripples it would make and the legacy it’d establish. And it’s impossible to separate what </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>wound up being–a fork-tongued middle finger of a game that nobly aims to avoid being a standard, conventional sequel but also feels stretched in places to meet the expectations of a </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>game–from the reputation it built up in its time outside the limelight.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Love breathed life into </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>all those years ago, transforming a would-be expansion into a sprawling title whose development was cultivated over many years with great care and attention, which makes it all the more ironic that over the course of that development, so much of what made </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>special to begin with feels diminished here. That very love pushes </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>to be a rich experience, one that makes you work to love it and prefers to shock rather than lull you with awe. At some point though, the former gives way to the latter, and underneath that weight, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>begins to crack. Its enormity hides these fractures well, but they’re still there. And maybe, just maybe, one day, like the City of Tears, that crushing weight will collapse the foundation and swallow it whole.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568]]></content:encoded>

A PlayStation 5 version is also in development.</p><p>“We have polished the game and added necessary core features with many updates during Early Access to create a fun, light extraction dungeon crawler,” said director Sejun Go in a press release. “These improvements, combined with the addition of new Stalkers and a brand-new map, will make Season 1 the most engaging and enjoyable experience that players have been waiting for.”</p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>During Early Access, Dungeon Stalkers underwent a rapid pace of updates based on community feedback. The team introduced new enemies, raid bosses, legendary gear, and additional dungeons, while also improving balance, killcam, solo ranking, controller support, reconnect functionality, and many other features. These updates culminate in the full 1.0 release, which officially kicks off a new season today.</p><p><strong>What’s New in 1.0</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Stalker Kazimorde</strong> – A legendary officer of the Tania Kingdom and a warrior known as the “Flash Hawk.” Kazimorde is a melee warrior who wields twin blades with expertise, boasting overwhelming DPS through fast normal attacks and combo attacks. He continuously attacks enemies with an attack tempo 20-30% faster than other Stalkers.</li><li><strong>Mansion of Desire Dungeon</strong> – The manor of a noble aristocratic family from Asion has been swallowed into a rift of curses, becoming the “Mansion of Desire.” Within this rift, the manor retains its antique and luxurious appearance, yet exudes an eerie atmosphere, offering a new exploration experience distinct from the existing “Prison Dungeon.”</li><li><strong>Insurance System: Scavenger Contract</strong> – Introducing “Scavenger,” a new NPC designed to alleviate the burden of equipment loss in Competitive Mode. By paying a small amount of Gold and entering into a contract with the Scavenger before entering Competitive (Solo, Trio) mode, you can recover your equipment if you fail to escape the dungeon.</li><li><strong>Profile Customization System</strong> – A profile system will be added, allowing you to customize your profile card.

Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Super Mario World director Takashi Tezuka discussed how the Nintendo mascot can live on for decades and decades to come in a recent book.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hell-constantly-evolve-nintendo-creators-discuss-if-mario-can-reach-100-years/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a> reported on and transcribed a new Nintendo Museum book focusing on Mario's 40th anniversary. In it, Miyamoto and Tezuka--alongside other developers--are asked about the plumber remaining a cultural icon in 2085. "One might think it would be a miracle if Mario was still here after 100 years, since we make things while not knowing when our players may get bored with them," Tezuka said.</p>

            <p>The Game Music Festival returns to London next year with individual orchestral concerts for the music from Diablo, Hades 1 and 2, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3">Persona 3</a>-5, and composer Hitoshi Sakimoto, who wrote the music for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xii">Final Fantasy 12</a> (among many other games).</p>
<p>The concerts take place in a couple of locations - the Royal Festival Hall and Fairfield Halls - and will be spread throughout June 2026. The precise running order is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>6th June – The Infernal Symphony featuring music from the Diablo franchise (Royal Festival Hall)</li>
<li>13th June – The Colors of Harmony: Hitoshi Sakimoto 40th Anniversary Celebration (Fairfield Halls)</li>
<li>19th June - An evening with Troy Baker &amp; Austin Wintory (Fairfield Halls)</li>
<li>27th June – Ballads of the Underworld featuring music from Hades &amp; Hades II (Royal Festival Hall)</li>
<li>27th June – Persona Grooves featuring music from Persona 3, 4, 5 (Royal Festival Hall)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://gamemusic.net/">Tickets for a few of the concerts are live already</a>. The Diablo tickets start from £57, which is a good gauge for what the other Royal Festival Hall concerts will cost, though they aren't on sale yet; and the two Fairfield Halls concerts have tickets from £55.</p><p>I went to the Game Music Festival's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-baldurs-gate-3-victory-tour-has-been-extraordinary-but-feels-like-its-finally-coming-to-an-end">unforgettable Baldur's Gate 3 orchestral concert</a> last year and enjoyed it immensely. A full and sumptuous Philharmonia Orchestra brought Borislav Slavov's score to life with passion, and Slavov made a teary appearance on the stage to thank players for their support. Also in the audience were numerous members of the Larian development team and actors from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> cast, including Raphael actor Andrew Wincott, who took to the stage during an encore to perform the character's iconic 'Mortal Lives' boss fight song. The audience - which more resembled a raucous crowd at this point - went wild. It was electrifying.</p>
<p>Earlier that day there had also been a rendition of music from The Last of Us by composer and performer Gustavo Santaolalla, which our Dom watched and was greatly moved by. These concerts were very good last year, then, so there's every chance this new batch will be too.</p>

			<p>The fantasy farm-life sim filled with wiggly squidgy slime creatures is back. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/slime-rancher-2">Slime Rancher 2</a>, players join Beatrix LeBeau on her latest adventure on the mysterious Rainbow Island. But can this ambitious sequel recapture the magic of the innovative original game?</p>
<p><iframe title="Slime Rancher 2 - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZIiUWODikw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One can’t review Slime Rancher 2 without giving an honourable mention to the key characters of the game: the slimes. These cheeky balls of goop are brimming with squishy, adorable charm. There’s a vast assortment of slimes to discover, from your common-or-garden Pink Slimes and rabbit-style Cotton Slimes to the more elusive Golden Slimes and Lucky Slimes. Plus, after consuming each other’s poops – I’m sorry, I mean “plorts” – the slimes mutate into a combo creature called a Largo Slime which contains both Slime’s features and produces double the plorts. Somehow these bulbous creatures manage to be even more endearing than the normal slimes. Particularly when you slurp them onto the end of your vacpack and their charming little smile fills your screen!</p>


<p>Like with all collectible cuties, you’ll wanna catch ‘em all. But to do this, you’re going to have to spend a lot of time exploring. An awful lot of time! If you’re a fan of exploration in games, the intrigue of what you can discover when you’re away from the ranch will keep you going for some time, with an extensive array of resources to unearth, strange slime foodstuffs to obtain, new locations on Rainbow Island to uncover and more. That said, some of the map unlocks are particularly tricky to find and you’ll end up getting very turned around and a bit bewildered as to where you are and where you’re going.&nbsp;Thankfully with the charming cartoon visuals exploding with vivid colours, all this exploration remains a joy to undertake.</p>


<p>And after a long meander across Rainbow Island, it’s always heart-warming to return to the happy, smiling faces of your ranch slimes bouncing around in their corrals. The farming aspect of the game can be good fun, but also rather time consuming. The more slimes you farm, the more long-winded the farming becomes. Running back and forth collecting and distributing food for them to eat, gathering the resultant plorts 30 or 40 at a time, and dispensing them in the plort market or refinery gets monotonous very quickly. The corral upgrades, once you can afford them, keep the process moving, but somehow seem to add yet more to-ing and fro-ing.</p>
<p>This time sink isn’t helped much by the utilities, warp tech and vacpack upgrades. I don’t mean the upgrades themselves, but rather the grind to unlock them. They take a tonne of resources to unlock – that’s more getting lost on Rainbow Island, then – and don’t often supply you with a helpful solution to cross these ranching or exploration barriers.</p>

<p>Between the laborious farming tasks and getting obscenely discombobulated on Rainbow Island, there’s very little time to actually advance the narrative of the game. In fact, it took me a while to work out that there even was a narrative! &nbsp;After 16 hours of gameplay I still hadn’t managed to find the “Grey Labyrinth” location to progress the storyline to any satisfying degree. There are so many technologies and utilities to obtain before you can get anywhere, which in turn all involve you having to spend ages collecting a mass of different resources, that after a while, it all starts to feel a bit too much like hard work. There are so many barriers to narrative progression that one wonders why it was included at all.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Slime Rancher 2 is filled with charm, joy and adorable creatures, but the fun doesn’t translate to every aspect of the gameplay. In seeking to expand and add content to the game, the developers have made what should have been an effortlessly delightful experience a somewhat monotonous one.	</p></div>

<p>"It’s a given that Super Mario will constantly evolve"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="885a84dfd21f9"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Wonder" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/885a84dfd21f9/super-mario-bros-wonder.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's incredible to think how much <strong>Super Mario</strong> has evolved since those early days back in the '80s.</p>
<p>Starting as a simple, albeit incredibly intuitive 2D platformer, Mario has since developed the ability to fly, shoot water from F.L.U.D.D, traverse the literal depths of space, and transform into completely different characters via an anthropomorphic hat known as 'Cappy'.</p>
<p>But of course, if Mario is to reach his 100th anniversary, he'll need to evolve even more. And that's exactly what his creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, believes he'll do.</p>
<p>Speaking via an interview in a special Nintendo Museum book to celebrate Super Mario's 40th anniversary (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hell-constantly-evolve-nintendo-creators-discuss-if-mario-can-reach-100-years/">VGC</a>), Miyamoto, alongside Takashi Tezuka, Koji Kondo, and Toshihiko Nakago, says that Mario "will constantly evolve by incorporating new digital technology" in an effort to reach that lofty 100th anniversary. Furthermore, despite branching out into new mediums, Miyamoto believes Mario's true appeal lies in the interactivity that games provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now we’re working in visual fields like movies, but I want to make sure we keep it interactive and digital. As long as we don’t forget Mario’s prime point – running and jumping – as we add new things, I think Mario will be with us for a long time to come.</p>
<p>“Nintendo takes on unique challenges, and if a new technology is interesting, I believe that by incorporating that technology, we can make that fun expand and grow-like rolling up snow for a snowman. So I hope that you will continue to stick with us.”</p>

<p>Tezuka expands on this by stressing the need to keep players from getting bored while playing Mario games, stating that he's "always thinking of how to keep it so that something like that doesn’t happen so that people keep playing".</p>
<p>And just in case you needed a bit of reassurance, Tezuka finishes by stating "We’ll continue to make Mario games for a long time", so that's good to know.</p>

			<p>Wrekcreation, the sandbox open-world arcade racing game from Three Fields Entertainment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">a studio founded by former Criterion developers</a> who worked on the Burnout series, is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Published by THQ Nordic, Wreckreation gives players the freedom to create whatever kinds of tracks they want, from the kinds of things you'd only expect to see in <a href="https://wccftech.com/hot-wheels-unleashed-one-million/">Hot Wheels Unleashed</a> to something super realistic if that's more your speed, and race the wide variety of vehicles on them to your heart's content.</p>



<p>With more than 400 square kilometres of space to create tracks in and absolutely wreck your cars, along with 16 radio stations and the ability to mix game modes, weather and atmosphere effects, and of course, the cars themselves, there's more than enough to dig your heels into as you slam on the gas.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Wreckreation | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ru9Nn-ZGjjg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>What makes Wreckreation feel like a complete sandbox is the fact that you don't have to stop and jump into a separate mode to switch between driving and racing around to creating tracks. Have an idea for a new layer of track to add or a new ramp, obstacle, or basically any other kind of addition? Press a button and add it right there.</p>



<p>It definitely looks like the kind of game where you'll have to make your own fun, but as it stands, Wreckreation also seems to give you every tool you might want to do so when it comes to having mindless fun racing around and smashing cars.</p>



<p>Wreckreation is available now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S for $39.99/€39.99.</p>

              <p>Sure, you can use your regular laptop for gaming, but those machines won’t really give you the immersive experience you’re hoping for. Even the supposedly powerful machines can struggle when it comes to demanding titles, which is why if you want to game seriously or maybe even work on creative tasks, you need hardware that’s specifically built for this.</p>
<p>Asus makes some of the best options out there, and right now, you don’t have to break the bank to grab one.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5058/"> Currently, the Asus TUF F16 Gaming laptop is going for just $1,660, thanks to a 54% discount on its $3,599 list price.</a> <strong>That’s a rare discount on this 2025 model, but it doesn’t end here</strong>. The bundle also includes an accessory box with a whole bunch of essentials to help you get started – for absolutely free. This is one of the biggest drops we’ve seen on a high-performance gaming laptop this year, but we don’t expect the discount to last long. Snag it up before the retailer pushes the price back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5058/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brilliant, Immersive Graphics, Paired With a Fast Processor</h2>
<p>Asus has packed the machine with Intel’s latest 14th Gen i7-14650HX processor that can clock up to 5.2GHz. This ultra-fast processor is paired with 32GB of DDR5 RAM that keeps slowdowns at bay, even when you’re playing heavier titles or working with resource-intensive applications. There’s a 1TB SSD for storage, so housing all your essentials won’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Graphics are handled by the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 GPU. Expect better frame rates, real-time ray tracing, and sharper visuals for an immersive experience. The 16-inch FHD+ IPS display takes the visual experience even further with a 165Hz refresh rate, Adaptive-Sync, and 100% sRGB color gamut that brings content to life.</p>



<p>Best of all, unlike most powerful gaming laptops out there, this machine stays quiet and cool while working. It features dual Arc Flow fans, full-width heat sinks, and built-in dust filters that make sure you enjoy consistent performance even during intense sessions. Connectivity-wise, you get Thunderbolt 4, USB-C 3.2, three USB-A ports, an HDMI 2.1 output, RJ45 Ethernet, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5058/">The free accessory bundle includes a gaming mouse, an RGB mechanical feel gaming keyboard, a six-pack cable organizer, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed</a>. That’s all you need to get started right away! But again, just be sure to grab the offer before it expires for good.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today marks a monumental moment for the saga of video games: it is the 20th anniversary of the release of Strangelite’s <em>Starship Troopers</em> PC game. On October 28, 2005, the world received a truly terrible game based on a truly excellent film, a concept that modern audiences couldn’t even hope to understand. A phenomenon I truly miss. What ever happened to the wildly incongruous video game adaptations of action movies?</p> <p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, every Hollywood action outing would receive a tie-in video game. Publishers would have a side-scrolling platformer or 2D action game ready to accompany any major movie, no matter how utterly inappropriate or gloriously irrelevant it might be. And no, we’re not talking about some obscure, backwater companies you’ve never heard of—we’re talking the biggest names in the industry. Thus it was that in 1989 you could visit your local gaming store and pick up a copy of Activision’s <em>Die Hard</em>, developed by&nbsp;<em>Tribes</em> legends Dynamix, or the abysmal NES release <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em> made by [double-checks notes] Rare.</p>

 <p>These tie-ins weren’t exactly famous for sticking particularly closely to the films on which they were based. While the <em>Die Hard</em> I mention above is very much set in Nakatomi Plaza, another version was made for PC Engine and TurboGrafx-16 that, incredibly, has you battling through jungles and rivers to reach the Nakatomi building in scenes that would feel more at home in a game set during the Vietnam war. More normally, however, these games were primarily about stripping out all nuance, subtlety, and subversion to create a straight-faced action game.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639579"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639579">© Ocean / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <p>Who can forget Ocean Software’s 1988 Amiga tie-in <em>RoboCop</em>, for instance, a surprisingly great side-scrolling action game ported from an arcade machine release? A beloved game it might have deservedly been, but it’s perhaps fair to say it might have somewhat missed the satirical elements of Paul Verhoeven ‘s film. Or perhaps the best example of all time: 2004’s <em>Fight Club,</em> released for PS2 and Xbox. And yes, that’s right, 2004. You aren’t losing your mind, David Fincher’s deeply subversive and satirical film was released in 1999, and this—wait for it—<em>fighting game</em> came out a full five years later. Was it, too, a treatise on the self-destructive psyche of male violence? No, it was not. It was a game about the actual fight club, the men beating the shit out of each other, and had you winning fights to rise up the ranks, until you’re eventually able to unlock Limp Bizkit’s Fred Durst as a playable character. I’m not making that up. It took an anti-capitalist, anti-violence film and said, “I like the bit where the man punched the other man.”</p>

 <p>There are obviously a squillion examples of truly horrendous movie tie-ins, like the notorious <em>E.T.</em> disaster or 2003’s&nbsp;<em>Charlie’s Angels</em> flop, but my favorite examples are always the ones that just woefully miss the point of their subject matter. And that’s why 2005’s&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers&nbsp;</em>has such a fond place in my heart.</p>

 <p>Once again, no, you aren’t slipping loose from time. Paul Verhoeven’s wonderful&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272"><em>Starship Troopers</em></a> was released to theaters in 1997, a full eight years before Empire Interactive released this outstandingly terrible video game tie-in. The anti-war film certainly was, and still is, willfully misunderstood. That’s not because there’s any ambiguity, but because a lot of people aren’t very clever, misunderstanding its loudly telegraphed satire as a sincere representation of militaristic campaigning, seeing its excoriating portrayal of the modern military’s fascistic core as some sort of enthusiastic thumbs up for Nazism. Whether furious because they thought it was endorsing fascism, or delighted to think it was, people failed to understand this film from impressively diametric positions. (We can put aside the much-debated nature of the book on which the film mostly wasn’t based, given Verhoeven’s vision was clearly distinct and—given his childhood in Nazi-occupied Holland—not exactly in favor of the obvious baddies.)</p>

  <p>But the film isn’t exactly a work of subtlety. From its gruesomely silly “WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?” propaganda commercials to its sequences directly spoofing movies like <em>Platoon</em> and <em>Full Metal Jacket</em>,&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em> wears its furious satire on its sleeve. Verhoeven’s genius in films like this and&nbsp;<em>RoboCop</em> (heck, even&nbsp;<em>Total Recall</em> if you look beyond the cheesy veneer) isn’t delivered quietly, but rather with unavoidable brutality. Which is all to say, no, this was never a film about brave Americans fighting off the cruel bug armies. Can you sense the foreshadowing?</p>

 <p>My favorite thing about the&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em> PC game was the way it would lock up my PC, forcing hard reboots. This offered merciful little moments between having to play the game for the review I was writing at the time. Created by a British studio called Strangelite (who would go on to be bought by Rebellion and folded into the teams developing the <em>Sniper Elite</em> games), the game made its failure to comprehend its source material apparent before you’d even taken it out of the box. “Hesperus, a planet perilously close to Earth, has fallen to the bug menace,” it stated, ensuring you knew that a) it wasn’t going to try to recreate the events of the movie, and b) woefully didn’t realize that the Bugs never were a “menace.” That was kinda the point.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639575" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639575"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639575">© Empire Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game, a first-person shooter, was meant to be about taking on vast hordes of the arachnoid Bugs, desperately fighting to survive against the odds. Although those odds would often turn in your favor when all the dozens of identical enemies would choose to attack a nearby rock instead of you, kindly standing still while you shot them all in the side. It was a spectacular clusterfuck of atrocious graphics, dismal load times, lines of voice dialogue overlapping each other incoherently, and then to really drive home how bad this all was, super low-quality clips of the movie played at you to point out what it wasn’t portraying. (This reminds me of an utterly awful movie you hopefully never saw called <em>Carrie 2: The Rage</em>, that frequently included clips of Brian De Palma’s 1976 masterpiece to make sure you had constant context for just how outrageously terrible this sequel really was.)</p> <p>It sucked. That’s the point I’m trying to make.&nbsp;<em>Really</em> sucked. And you know what? I kind of miss that, a bit.</p>

 <p>Of late, we keep getting movie/TV tie-ins—albeit often years or decades later—that are really good! Games like 2023’s&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-new-game-2023-review-shooter-rpg-pc-1851000568"><em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em></a>, and 2022’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review-tribute-game-dotemu-multi-1849077972"><em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em></a>, that embrace the point of the source material in a winsome fashion. Which is brilliant, and bring it on! But there’s definitely a part of me that wishes 2025 could have seen a side-scrolling beat ’em up based on <em>One Battle After Another</em>, or a <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em> platform game about collecting microphones. Where’s my egregiously misguided <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> third-person action game that tries to recreate major scenes from the film through minigames? We didn’t even get a top-down racing sim based on&nbsp;<em>F1 The Movie</em>.</p> <p>So happy 20th birthday,&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em>, you colossal pile of shit. You were one of the last of your kind.</p>

<p>Talking about the most unexpected collaborations, a Borderlands 4 x PGA Tour 2K25 crossover is happening tomorrow. </p>



<p>Borderlands 4 has had a highly successful launch, becoming the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-was-the-best-selling-game-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game</a> in its first month. However, to keep the hype going, the developers will keep adding more content and doing some crossovers as well. And the first crossover has been announced —it’s with another 2K title. </p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-x-pga-tour-2k25-post-teases-new-content-for-the-game">Borderlands 4 x PGA Tour 2K25 Post Teases New Content for the Game</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/borderlands-4-confirms-pga-tour-2k25-crossover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameRant</a>, the official confirmation about the Borderlands 4 and PGA Tour 2K25 crossover comes from the latter’s official <a href="https://x.com/PGATOUR2K/status/1982858198425235500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The official post, however, doesn’t provide any concrete information about the content of this crossover. The only thing confirmed is the release date for the collaboration, set for Wednesday, October 29, 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even though no information about the crossover has been revealed, players can make some predictions based on the image in the announcement post. First things first, it seems like PGA Tour 2K25 players will get their hands on a Psycho skin. On top of that, the character is seen holding a golf club, which includes some form of cybernetic enhancement. Lastly, if the background is a hint, then a new golf course inspired by Kairos might be on the cards as well.</p>



<p>However, this is just speculation based on the teaser image; none of the details have been officially confirmed by the developers. </p>



<p>In other news, a new Borderlands 4 Vault Hunter has been revealed as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-borderlands-4-vault-hunter-revealed-as-part-of-first-dlc-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of the first DLC</a>. Additionally, NBA 2K26 has become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game</a> in the United States.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts (EA) employees are reportedly frustrated and even mocking the company internally over its push to use more AI in its development and other areas of work.</p>



<p>According to a new report from Business Insider, higher-ups at EA have<strong> “spent the past year urging its nearly 15,000&nbsp;employees to use AI for just about everything.”</strong> This includes anything from code to concept art to even <strong>“scripting conversations with direct reports about sensitive topics such as pay and promotions.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-employees-are-worried-about-their-jobs">Employees Are Worried About Their Jobs</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Employees who spoke anonymously</a> to the outlet say that they are encouraged to use the in-house chatbot called “ReefGPT”, despite it producing “flawed code and other so-called hallucinations that they need to correct.” Those on the creative side, like character and level design, say that they are expected to train the AI software on their own created work. It’s led to a belief and frustration that these decisions will ultimately lead to the company no longer needing that type of talent, with layoffs to come.</p>



<p>Even one former employee, a senior QA staffer at Respawn, believes that AI was at least partly to blame for his job loss this year. He told the outlet that AI was <strong>“able to perform a key part of his job — reviewing and summarizing feedback from hundreds of play testers.”</strong></p>



<p>This mandate within EA to use AI has even led to mocking among employees. One meme sent within the company Slack, according to Business Insider, depicts the following:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>A meme posted last month to a Slack channel for employees at Electronic Arts shows a cartoon man asking a trio of CEOs what they want. They answer in unison: “AI!” Then the man asks, “AI to do what?” The CEOs reply, “We don’t know!” The man follows, “When do we want it?” The CEOs cheer again: “Right now!” Dozens of the video-game company’s staff responded with crying laughing emojis.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>EA declined to comment to Business Insider for the story. They also haven’t responded to Insider Gaming’s request for comment. Should any public statement be made, it will be added to this story.</p>

Under this new ownership, I feel I cannot maintain a direct association to the company. I also truly believe that they benefit more from my early access content than I do, and I think that stepping away is the strongest action I can take against the sale."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">She continued: "This situation is a nightmare for our community. Nobody supports this sale, and it is putting creators in a very difficult position. They have built their entire career and livelihood over a game that they have no control over. I ask that you please not harass other Sims creators over their decisions regarding the game and the creator network. I am very fortunate to be in a position where I can make a choice like this, but not everyone has that ability. I don't truly don't believe there is a 'right' answer here, and everyone is still trying to figure out their next steps."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sims closed on writing: "I'm really, really distraught over this sale, and I know that many of you are as well.

It is the first Halo game ever to launch on a PlayStation console, and cements Microsoft’s position as a multiplatform video game developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The U.S. administration then doubled down on the Halo AI images, with the Department of Homeland Security using Halo to promote the Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s website (ICE).</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Finishing this fight. <a href="https://t.co/6Ezq9NUqMq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6Ezq9NUqMq</a></p>— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) <a href="https://twitter.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The social media posts have sparked a vociferous response from Halo fans, which led to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1ohjpkg/white_house_twitter_posts_donald_trump_is_johns/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Halo subreddit changing its enforcement rules</a>. Mods usually remove any posts containing “politics and AI slop,” but such was the desire to discuss the tweets, they made an exception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft, however, has so far remained silent on the issue. The company is yet to issue IGN a statement, but a representative told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/us-government-uses-halo-images-in-a-call-to-destroy-immigration-microsoft-declines-to-comment/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a> that "Microsoft does not have anything to share on this matter."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is in contrast to The Pokémon Company’s position. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this">It formally responded</a> to the use of Pokémon TV hero Ash Ketchum and the series' theme tune by the Department of Homeland Security as part of a video showing people being arrested and handcuffed by law enforcement agents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand," The Pokémon Company International said in a statement shared with IGN. "Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is, can Microsoft do anything about Trump and his administration using Halo for promotion? Many fans had suggested The Pokémon Company should defend its intellectual property by launching legal action. But the corporation's former legal chief told IGN at the time that he "wouldn't touch this."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/gettyimages-697897968-1761659255144.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Trump listens to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella during an American Technology Council roundtable at the White House on June 19, 2017.

"First, think of how little you see [The Pokémon Company International]'s name in the press. They are INSANELY publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Second, many of their execs in the USA are on green cards," he continued. "Even if I was still at the company I wouldn't touch this, and I'm the most trigger-happy CLO [Chief Legal Officer] I've ever met. This will blow over in a couple of days and they'll be happy to let it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Trump administration has form when it comes to using AI images to promote the President. In May, Trump sparked a backlash from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope. The picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, was released as Catholics mourned the death of Pope Francis and prepared to choose the next pontiff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The White House has also released AI images of Trump as Superman and as a Star Wars Jedi. And when the Department of Homeland Security used South Park to promote ICE, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/us-homeland-security-uses-south-park-to-promote-ice-south-park-trolls-trump-in-response-wait-so-we-are-relevant">South Park trolled Trump in response, saying: “wait, so we ARE relevant?”</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

The server itself is described as a "bit of a mix" between minigames, free roaming, and role-playing, and has a "fully fleshed out" inventory system that permits players to earn money in-game and spend it on a "wide variety of different things like housing, weapons, vehicles, and items."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for if there'll ever be an official follow up? Dan Houser, Rockstar Games co-founder and the writer behind the studio's biggest games, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/grand-theft-auto"><u>Grand Theft Auto</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption"><u>Red Dead Redemption</u></a> series, recently sat down for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ign-in-conversation-with-dan-houser-at-la-comic-con-2025"><u>an exclusive interview with IGN</u></a>, revealing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-just-cant-do-all-the-projects-you-want-rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-says-bully-2-didnt-happen-due-to-bandwidth-issues"><u>Bully 2</u> didn't happen because of "bandwidth issues."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bully — also known as Canis Canem Edit in some parts of the world — was a humorous action game that put players in the role of high school outcast Jimmy while attending a pretentious private school.

                <p>It's been nearly 20 years since Rockstar Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bully/" data-ref-id="5000-24303">Bully</a> came out, and while there's no word of a sequel, the next best thing may have dropped: a mod that introduces online multiplayer to the high school action sim.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-may-not-have-bully-2-but-this-fan-made-bully-online-mod-may-be-the-next-best-thing" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported by IGN</a>, a group of modders has finally revealed Bully Online. Led by YouTuber, developer, and "massive Bully fan," SWEGTA, the project has been a long time coming, but is inching ever closer to an early-access launch in December 2025 for those who <a href="https://ko-fi.com/bullyonline" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">support the team on Ko-Fi</a>. At the time of this writing, it appears the developers have received at least 76 Ko-Fis.</p><p>What is Bully Online, though? According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J0_BnWKvEA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the YouTube video's description</a>, the mod "allows you and your friends to play minigames, role-play, compete in racing, fend off against NPCs, and much more." SWEGTA described it in greater detail in the nearly nine-minute video below, stating that it's a "mix between minigames, free-roaming, and role-playing." There's a "fully fleshed-out inventory system," letting you earn money in-game to spend on Bully goodies from items to housing to vehicles. It sounds like the online modes of other Rockstar games, such as GTA Online and RDR Online.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J0_BnWKvEA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2J0_BnWKvEA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you do support the project on Ko-Fi for $8 (either as a one-time donation or a monthly subscription), you get additional perks alongside early access in December. This includes behind-the-scenes content (like developer commentary), a blue player nametag to denote your specialness, an in-game camera to save and share up to 10 photos, priority server queue to get in more quickly, and a Discord role and access to an exclusive text channel to yap with the development team behind the mod.</p><p>This is all well and good, and a welcome addition to a franchise beloved by many, but what about Bully 2? Well, you never say never, but you certainly say "wait a while," as, according to Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-vp-talks-gta-6-explains-why-bully-2-never-happened/1100-6535080/" data-ref-id="1100-6535080">a sequel never materialized due to bandwidth</a>.</p><p>"If you've got a small lead creative team and a small senior leadership crew, you just can't do all the projects you want," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/GdAYM7QNIOA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Houser told IGN at LA Comic Con in September 2025</a>. "With certainly how we're structuring it, [we were] trying to do two projects with a very fairly small team, and just really trying to think through that. 'How can we do that and keep them both moving?'"</p>
