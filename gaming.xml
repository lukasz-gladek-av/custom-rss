<p>The full patch notes were shared on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-switch-parental-cont/id1190074407">Apple App Store</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Nintendo Switch Parental Controls Ver. 2.3.0 (10th Dec 2025)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added "Dark Mode." The app's display will automatically switch according to your smart device's settings.</li>
<li>"Extend Daily Play-Time Limit" now includes "1 hour," in addition to the 5-, 15-, and 30-min. options.</li>
<li>"Detailed Bedtime Settings" now allows daily customisation of the time that play is allowed to begin each day of the week.</li>

		<p>CorgiSpace has been revealed by Canabalt creator Adam “Atomic” Saltsman, a collection of original Pico-8 sized games that have “short legs” on purpose. It’s available now from Steam and itch.io.</p>
<p><iframe title="CorgiSpace | Out Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RaH_5CDT7Vo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having been at Finji for a good long while and helped create larger games such as Night in the Woods and Tunic, Adam Atomic felt like getting back to smaller experiences, and started to create little quirky games based off quick and funny ideas.</p>
<p>There’s more than a dozen games in the collection, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rat Dreams – a soulslike where you have to dodge roll everywhere</li>
<li>Dust Settlers – a tetris-like where you’re terraforming planets</li>
<li>Skeleton Gelatin – a metroidvania with no upgrades or jumping</li>
<li>Prince of Prussia – a game where you’re stabbing Nazis, but in a fun way</li>
<li>Vampire vs. Pope Army</li>
<li>Dust Bunny – Eat all the dust</li>
<li>Dermis – Shoot asteroid and save the Moon</li>
</ul>
<p>And plenty more beyond that.</p>

<p>You should be able to explore each game in under an hour, but some of them with –&nbsp;<em>gasp –&nbsp;</em>save your progress!</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/10/scramble-knights-royale-blends-classic-zelda-with-a-bit-of-battle-royale/</link>
            <guid>1378861</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Funktronic Labs has revealed Scramble Knights Royale, a game that essentially blends together the Zelda-like adventure genre with the battle royale.</p>
<p><iframe title="Scramble Knights Royale - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMWryL7--F0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game start you off with a steam boat that chuffs around the battle island, and when you choose to depart, you’ll surf on the back of a turtle to make it to land. From there, you’ll do all the Zelda-like things of grabbing loot, delving into dungeons and fighting bosses. That rewards you with better gear, secondary abilities, blacksmith upgrades and more.</p>
<p>It will eventually come to a head where you face off against the other players that have done the same in other parts of the world. Will you have grabbed enough upgrades and abilities to beat them?</p>
<p>Scramble Knights Royale has a claymation art style to go with the top-down view of the world, which looks delightful. The game is obviously online, but there’s also local split-screen, so you can team up on the same system. That’s pretty neat!</p>

<p>The game is still deep in development, but if this piqued your interest, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379350/Scramble_Knights_Royale/">ask to join the Steam Playtest</a> from its store page.</p>

            <p>
I am most certainly the kind of sucker that has few complaints about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> being split into multiple parts. Those are my guys! I love my grumpy idiot all too realistic looking Cloud, I think Midgar being so well realised helps to justify the splitting of the game, and as maximalist as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Rebirth</a> is, there's a quality to it I can't help but admire, even with its many flaws. Keeping things fresh is still something necessary in dividing the game up though, and in a recent interview, director Naoki Hamaguchi spoke of how he's trying to do that with the as-of-yet untitled third part.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://x.com/JulienChieze/status/1997995919128559623">YouTube Julien Chièze</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-reached-a-stage-where-its-finally-starting-to-match-the-vision-i-had-for-it-director-teases-and-the-new-experience-is-almost-complete/">GamesRadar</a>), Hamaguchi noted that first of all, he "never intended to make a three-part series that would offer the same kind of experience each time. For the first game, the goal was to define what a remake actually is, and in the second title we added an open-world dimension to expand the scale of the experience." When it comes to the third game, the director noted the need to "implement a new experience and a new scale. And in that evolution, one of the key words is 'Highwind.'"
</p>
<p>
Hamaguchi went on to explain that the "new experience the game will offer is almost complete," heading into the fleshing out phase. The entire game has even apparently hit a point where it's "starting" to match the director's vision, though very politely asks all of us to wait a tad longer for it, with the promise of more info coming "soon."
</p>
<p>
Whether that's Geoff's Night of Ads and a Few Statues soon, or Random Thursday in February soon, I haven't the foggiest. Mostly the question is whether us PC lot will be getting it the same time as everyone else. Square Enix did undergo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-might-not-wait-so-long-for-the-next-ff7-remake-as-square-enix-plan-to-win-over-pc-users-with-aggressive-shift-away-from-console-exclusives">quite a big internal shift within the last year</a>, outlining its intention for more multiplatform releases, so fingers crossed the gap won't be too wide.

</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Light Up The Town Is The Perfect Cozy Christmas Lights Simulator]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/light-up-the-town-cozy-christmas-holiday-lights-simulator-steam-demo-review-2000652213</link>
            <guid>1378852</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I love this time of year. Cozy weather. Tasty cookies and warm cocoa. <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-still-hasnt-taken-down-its-christmas-decorations-1841522397">Festive events in games</a>. And of course, all the <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-ai-christmas-ad-deleted-comments-removed-bad-2000651791">Christmas</a> lights hanging on houses, businesses, and elsewhere. In particular, I have a soft spot for all the colorful lights that get hung up during December. They just look so magical at night and fill me with nostalgic feelings. What can I say? I’m a sucker for plastic lights.</p> <p>So when I randomly discovered <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419910/Light_Up_The_Town/"><em>Light Up the Town</em></a>, a newly released cozy indie game all about decorating a wintry small town with Christmas lights, I immediately installed it and happily discovered a wonderful holiday treat that I can’t stop playing.</p>

  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419910/Light_Up_The_Town/">Out now on Steam, <em>Light Up the Town</em></a> has a super simple premise. You play as a young anthropomorphized ferret named Bean who is going through some stuff. His father, in an effort to lift his spirits, asks Bean to follow in his own footsteps and handle lighting up the entire small Colorado town of Bellflower. If he does this, he’ll get a new bike for Christmas. There’s more going on, but I’ll leave that for you to discover on your own. The narrative isn’t bad at all, but it’s not why you should play <em>Light Up the Town</em>. The real reason is that decorating this snow-covered town with various Christmas lights and decorations is sublime.</p>

 <p>In real life, putting up lights across multiple buildings, roofs, and interiors can be a hassle of tangled cables, extension cords, and broken bulbs. <em>Light Up the Town</em> doesn’t include any of that. Instead, you are able to fling strings of lights in different colors and shapes across large distances like a Christmas Jedi. You can also undo your actions and cut light strings whenever you want, letting you create massively long or incredibly short strings of light. Also, don’t worry about plugs or running cords. Lights just work, regardless of where you put them. Is this realistic? Nope! And I love it. It’s all the joy of hanging lights up and making a home glow without the hassle or headaches the process can create in the real world.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652227"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652227">©Meadow Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Light Up the Town’</em>s decorating controls are finicky at times, but mostly work great and let you quickly cover areas in lights and other decorations, like presents, candy canes, and more. I recommend playing in first-person mode, but regardless of what view you pick, the end result of putting up all these lights is always magical. The lighting in this game is phenomenal and changes based on how you decorate. Cover a house in just a few white lights? The glow will be softer and dimmer. Fill a room with 20 strings of red and green lights? You’ll create a vibrant Christmas rave. As you hang up lights, look for coins to collect. These can be spent at stores to unlock more varieties of lights and new decoration items.</p> <p>Each time I stepped back after putting up lights for an hour or so, I’d find myself lingering the same way I do in real life when spotting Christmas lights at night. <em>Light Up the Town</em> truly nails the festive and cozy vibes of a cold, dark night in December filled with thousands of tiny bright lights in the snow. For fans of the holiday season, put on your favorite festive songs, make a hot beverage, grab a blanket, and then dive into <em>Light Up the Town.</em>&nbsp;Just set a timer so you don’t spend your whole night decorating.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals has been confirmed to show up at the 2025 Game Awards. Season 5.5 is right around the corner, and there’s plenty that could be revealed for the game’s future. </p>



<p>The latest playable character for Marvel Rivals has just been teased, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-showcases-rogues-vanguard-moves-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rogue is set to join the fray</a>. It’s the third consecutive season that a new vanguard has been added into the mix, but that doesn’t stop fans from wanting to know more about the future of the franchise.</p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-will-be-at-the-game-awards">Marvel Rivals Will Be At The Game Awards</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The announcement came directly from Geoff Keighley, who shared a promotional image featuring Jeff the Land Shark sitting in a theatre seat marked with both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-statue-mystery-possibly-solved-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-unveils-new-gacha-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> branding. The artwork is loaded with personality, featuring Blade looking unimpressed in the background, Emma Frost sitting casually beside Jeff, and Gambit and Rogue sharing a kiss behind them—a playful nod to both the game’s tone and its growing roster.</p>







<p>What Marvel Rivals will actually showcase remains a mystery. Keighley’s only caption was a teasing “Tomorrow,” leaving fans to speculate wildly. The safest bet is a deeper look at the upcoming Season 5.5, but given NetEase’s recent momentum, it wouldn’t be surprising if they have a bigger reveal planned.</p>



<p>Fans will have to tune in to the Game Awards live to find out the truth for themselves. Do you have any theories about how Marvel Rivals could showcase at the Game Awards?

            <guid>1378843</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yep, I found a way to save $15 on Pokémon Legends: Z-A and the Mega Dimension DLC just as the expansion drops, proper legend I am. Not just that, but Woot has gone mad with discounting loads of First Party Nintendo Switch games, many of which have Switch 2 upgrades. More on that below.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've also been on the lookout for stocking fillers, and Tomy's Club Mocchi Mocchi Plushies are just awesome. There's a few Mario, Sonic and TMNT ones discounted across the web at the moment, so don't miss those.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Happy Cyberpunk 2077 5th anniversary! There's some very cool colaborations releasing for it too thanks to CD PROJEKT RED, Viture, Corsair and of course Secretlab put their Cyberpunk 2077 Titan Evo Gaming Chair in their holiday sale. Happy days, let's get into it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh yeah, and Skyrim came out for the millionth time on a new console, so turn that Nintendo Switch 2 on:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Allpowers R600 299Wh LiFePO4 Power Station</h2><div id="230488" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Allpowers R600 299Wh LiFePO4 Power Station with 100W Solar Panel</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Allpowers is the most popular power station on brand on AliExpress for good reason: it's generally less expensive than other brands while offering the same features. Even the least expensive power station - the compact R600 - boasts a LiFePO4 battery that lasts at least 10 years before you even need to start worrying about battery degradation. Other features include both AC outlets and USB ports, solar panel hookups, and smart app functionaliy. All of the power stations listed include a 5 year warranty and have plenty of reviews commenting on the responsiveness of their customer service. If you're looking to get the highest capacity at the lowest price possible, Allpowers is legit.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Legends: Z-A + Mega Dimension DLC</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Haven't played Legends Z-A yet? Well I can save you some money on Switch 1 and 2. Kick things off with the Woot deals on the region free copy for $44.99. If you're playing on Switch 1, just buy the Mega Dimension DLC for $29.99 and you're fixed up for $74.98.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Switch 2 owners, you'll need to also buy the Switch 2 upgrade pack for $9.99, which brings the total price to $84.98. That's a $15 Switch 1 or Switch 2 savings, you're welcome!</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Skyrim: Anniversary on Switch 2</h2></p><div><div id="233532" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Digital Code: Free upgrade to Nintendo Switch 2</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim | Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><div id="233533" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Digital code upgrade: Only for owners of standard Skyrim for Nintendo Switch</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim | Anniversary Upgrade</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd love to say that I found a magical way to knock some money off getting Skyrim for the 15th time, but it would require you to already have the game. Here's how it works, if you have Skyrim Anniversary for Switch 1 already, the Switch 2 upgrade is free. If you have the base version of Skyrim, you need to get the $19.99 Anniversary upgrade that will include upgrading to Nintendo Switch 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't have it at all, it seems the only way to get hold of Skyrim Anniversary on Switch 2 currently is buying the full fat digital code. Nintendo Online and all retailers are rocking that $69.99 price tag, so make of that what you will.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly it's still 30 FPS even when docked but it's a night and day difference when it comes to sharp and crisp visuals in a portable form factor. So if you're on Switch 2 and don't have a gaming PC handheld, you'll get a ridiculous amount of mileage from it!</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Woot Nintendo Switch Game Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've got some gaps in your backlog for Nintendo Switch games you've missed, now's the time to top your shelves up. There's plenty of games here with Switch 2 upgrades also, and a lot are either free or included with Nintendo Switch Online. Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild are big ones, with their Switch 2 enhancements locked behind a $10 pass per game or included in Nintendo Switch Online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has practically been remade thanks to a free Nintendo Switch 2 update, although I don't think Game Freak would have got away with a paid update thanks to the goodwill lost on S&amp;Vs Switch 1 performance issues. We now get a smooth 60 FPS which clocks at 4K when docked, more Pokémon appear on screen and it's a pleasure to play. The dull textures still remain, but it's the fix we were looking for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games like Super Mario Wonder will be getting new content and a Switch 2 performance / visual upgrade in January also. Other games will generally run and load a little better, so it's well worth having a look through and checking which titles you're missing.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Club Mocchi Mocchi Plushie Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomy actually came up with a product to rival Squishmallows when it comes to feathersoft huggage plushies, and I'm a big fan of Mocchi Moochi. It's rare you see discounts this good on them, plus you can pretend you're tucking Super Sonic into bed when you get up in the morning, just expect your bed to set on fire in the process. Sorry, it's still a bargain though!</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Cyberpunk 2077 5th Anniversary Gear</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've only gone and found the perfect setup for playing Cyberpunk 2077 on PC! Let's start with Secretlabs  TITAN Evo Cyberpunk 2077 edition, which matches the box art perfectly and represents Johnny Silverhands band logo, "Samurai" on the back cover. Awesome right? Both the regular and XL models are on offer, that goes for accessories too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">VITURE and CD Projekt RED have teamed up to bring the most savage set of XR glasses i've ever seen. Limited to 100,000 units, these bad boys project a 152-inch virtual display at 120hz with 1,500 nits of brightness. That's all packed into Sony's latest MicroOLED panels, one for each eye. Forget a gaming monitor or TV, this is a one-stop solution for Street Kids, Corpo and Nomads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Corsair have shown up and killed it too thanks to a new mechanical keyboard, wireless mouse and massive cloth gaming mouse pad. You can get all three at a discount for $269.99, or you can buy them seperatley. If you can I'd go for the bundle and save nearly $50, but these aren't just gimmicks budget products, they're based on the below Corsair products:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>MM300 2XL Anti-Fray Cloth Gaming Mouse Pad</li><li>K65 Plus Keyboard</li><li>M75 Wireless Mouse</li></ul><p id="nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World">Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="80e0ff81-3606-4105-a4f2-43697c5c3b1d" id="233411"><div id="233411" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Amazon going in and out of stock, still in stock at Walmart</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This deal is priced the same as a solo Nintendo Switch 2 console, making Super Mario World a free pack-in game over at Walmart. Amazon seems to be going in and out of stock right now, but regardless it's the same price there too.</p></div><p id="x-arcade-arcade2tv-xr"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR">X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR</h2></p><div catalogid="80e0ff81-3606-4105-a4f2-43697c5c3b1d" id="233511"><div id="233511" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Integrated Meta Quest 2/3 Functionality and works on all consoles / PC</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At a generous $205 off, this is a cracking one-stop-shop arcade gaming solution. Want to hook it up to your current gen consoles to play Smash Bros on? Sorted. Want to make your own Meme Arcade setup with a mini PC or Raspberry PI? Sorted. It's two player and complete with authentic feeling arcade buttons and sticks, roller balls and room for upgrades such as a soundbar, pinball haptics and more. This takes the pain out of making a cabinet or spending a fortune on one and allows players to plug and play like you would a normal controller.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Elgato Streaming Gear Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gold brand in streaming and content creation is Elgato, and there's plenty of its high-end gear on sale here such as the power-streamer Stream Deck XL down to $204.99 to one of the best budget-focused condenser microphone options in the $84.99 Wave Neo. Even the Facecam Mk.2 has been knocked down to $126.34, allowing streamers to stop worrying about mirrorless XLR camera setups and have a quality wcamera solution that plug and play. And who doesn't want an Elgato prompter for a marked down $228.99?</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Excentric Christmas Gift Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I thought i'd have a bit of fun today with some cool Christmas or White Rabbit gift ideas with some brilliant discounts. I've already touched on Sony InZone wireless earbuds, but they really are the best all-rounder earbuds i've tried in recent memory, and the included USB-C dongle fits in the charger case and is ideal for connecting to PC and PlayStation 5. And they're $42.99 off, bargain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Saving over $100 on a 300W Kareoke machine with an included 10.1" tablet and wireless microphones is a cracking deal too. Ikario has RGB lighting and hooks up to YouTube or Karaoke app via WiFi for absolute endless banter for house parties this holiday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative might not be the front and center of PC audio like it used to be, but it haven't lost its eye for quality. $69.99 for a soundbar and subwoofer combo is an awesome shout for a gaming setup or smaller home theatre setups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've spotted a loved one forever filming themselves for TikToks or video calling to their friends, the Maono wireless lavalier microphone is USB-C compatible and clips to a users clothes for a pro sound wherever they are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stationary cameras are great for keeping an eye on a room in general, but cats and dogs don't like staying still. Enabot EBO Rola PetPal provides 2.5k video and allows owners to roll about the house to check what their pets are really up too. Attachable feeders and cat toys allow for owners to interact with their pets more than ever before and is a great gift for the craszy cat person in your life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been using the HOZO NeoBlade for a while now whilst cleaning up my 3D prints and creative projects. It's an ultrasonic knife that can take different microblades and is rechargable. This bit of kit just makes cutting jobs miles easier of toucher materials with acrylic, PLA, wood and softer metals. I use it to cut supports off my prints and clean up projects, and I can't go back to regular scalpels and blades. Plus this bundle is $10 off and you get a self healing A3 matt.</p><p id="new-switch-2-games-this-holiday"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="New Switch 2 Games This Holiday">Switch 2 Games Releasing This Holiday</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">December is stacked for Nintendo Switch 2. We gave Metroid Prime 4: Beyond a solid 8/10 for nailing the Prime vibe whilst introducing some interesting mechanics and a pseudo open-world sandbox to explore. Considering how long we've been waiting for it, Metroid 4 is a solid comeback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC drops on Wednesday, which adds a post-game story, brand new Mega Evolutions and new mechanics such as an alternative dimension Lumioise City and Pokémon hitting over the long-standing level 100 mechanic. Insane. </p><p id="audible-holiday-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Audible Holiday Sale">Audible Holiday Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fancy knocking a $14.95 per month subscription to 99 cents for three months? That's what's on offer for Amazon Prime members right now, which can easily be cancelled down before the discount dries if you don't want to continue, win-win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst Audible Plus, the cheaper membership tier, has 10,000 audiobooks to listen too, Premium Plus has 500,000. Premium Plus members get to pick an audiobook to keep in their library indefinitely too, with 30% off purchasable Audiobooks. Usually this crops up as a free 30-day trial, and these trials are only for new subscribers, so this is the best deal you're going to get.</p><p id="mega-evolution-booster-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Evolution Booster Box">Mega Evolution Booster Box</h2></p><div catalogid="80e0ff81-3606-4105-a4f2-43697c5c3b1d" id="233437"><div id="233437" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Evolution Booster Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not often Amazon gets their Pokémon TCG products down to market value, but here we are. Yes, you can save $6.99 at TCGPlayer if you're not bothered about waiting a few days for delivery, but many would argue the extra $6.99 is worth getting it in your hands quicker with 1-day Amazon Prime delivery. The choice is yours but both sites have this at or near market value right now, which is great for one of the box in-demand Pokémon TCG sets right now.</p></div><p id="secret-lab-holiday-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Secret Lab Holiday Sale">Secretlab Holiday Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no secret that Secretlab is one of the most premium gaming chairs and brands available right now, and the brand tax is real. But straight off the heels of Black Friday, Secretlab have dropped their Christmas Holiday Sale across all the favorites. The super premium Titan Evo Nanogen Edition features a Secretlab-exclusive NanGen Hybrid Leathette seat covering and NanoFoam Composite cushioning for one of the best feeling gaming chairs on the market,</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the budget-minded Titan Evo Lite has premium features and coldfoam cusioning to make sure you're comfortable all day working and all night gaming. They even do an erganomic recliner add on now, featuring multiple angles of support to keep your legs comfortable for different posture types.</p><p id="alienware-and-lenovo-gaming-pc-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Alienware and Lenovo Gaming PC Deals">Alienware and Lenovo Gaming PC Deals</h2></p><div><div id="233436" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lenovo LOQ AMD Ryzen 7 8745HX RTX 5060 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)</h3></p></div><div id="233428" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Area-51 Intel Core Ultra 7 265 RTX 5090 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)</h3></p></div><div id="233429" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Area-51 Intel Core Ultra 9 285K RTX 5090 Gaming PC</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to get carried away with mad specifications on gaming PCs, and if you can afford it that's awesome. But builds like Lenovo's LOQ RTX 5060Ti build has a cracking budget price of $949.99 after using the discount code "<strong>EXTRAFIVE</strong>", capable of DLSS 4 upscaling and the latest Nvidia AI frame generation. The Ryzen 7 8745HX CPU backs up the 5060 Ti well, making this a lean and mean 1080p gaming monster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of the two Alienware builds, i'd save the money and go for the Intel Core Ultra 7 265 build. Both of these builds are going to kill it when it comes to high frame rate 4K gaming, and I simply don't think the extra $350 is worth it for the extra gains of a Core Ultra 9 285K CPU. Of course it's faster and better, but I think the $3,899.99 build is far better value for money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Someone has calculated exactly how many hours of recorded dialogue there are in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, a task so unnecessarily large that even Larian Studios hadn't done it before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/baldurs-gate-3-fan-discovers-the-game-has-nearly-237-hours-of-spoken-dialogue-in-it-and-a-whopping-14-hours-are-narrator-amelia-tylers-alone-though-astarion-gives-her-a-run-for-her-money/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by PC Gamer</a>, Everwhite-moonlight <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1830hh3fNYewVBdqTFRfjL6wvRfGp6DEIZFY_6BbLsOk/edit?gid=1474580599#gid=1474580599" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">put together a spreadsheet</a> breaking down all the dialogue in the game: who spoke it, how long the dialogue is, even how many files they speak in.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This survey results in some interesting facts surfacing: it's unsurprising that the narrator, Amelia Tyler, has the most dialogue at 14 hours, 43 minutes, and 55 seconds. Behind her, though, is Astarion, voiced by Neil Newbon, with 13 hours, six minutes, and 23 seconds. And behind him is Shadowheart, with 12 hours, 25 minutes, and 26 seconds. The smallest amount of dialogue is a many-way tie between numerous NPCs that all have only one second of dialogue, including four different Mind Flayer NPCs. In total, the game contains 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds of spoken voice lines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every voice actor is catalogued in here, including small lines by random NPCs and even cut dialogue. One mystery that's arisen, per Everwhite-moonlight, is who exactly voices which Giant Rat NPC in the game. "There are four instances of a character named 'Giant Rat,' and there are four actors credited to have played 'Giant Rat.' I have separated the Giant Rat UIDs and could tell they are played by four different people, but I don't know which one is which." Those actors are Akbar Kurtha, Joseph Capp, Leemore Marrett Jr., and Sean Baker. Now we just have to sort out which actor is which rat.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Baldur's Gate 3 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another fun bit that's surfaced from this is that Larian Studios actually didn't know how much dialogue, time-wise, was in the game. On Twitter/X, Larian boss Swen Vincke shared the news about the finding, saying, "We weren’t really keeping track which I think was for the better."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke did, however, know the word count of the game's script, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3s-collective-dialogue-has-triple-the-word-count-of-the-lord-of-the-rings-larian-reveals">as we learned back in 2024</a>, saying that Baldur's Gate 3 has triple the word count of The Lord of the Rings, and its cutscene runtime is twice as long as HBO's Game of Thrones. Holy moly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For lovers of Baldur's Gate 3's particular brand of delightful wordiness, it might be worth tuning into The Game Awards tomorrow, as Larian <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-think-we-know-what-geoff-keighleys-weird-desert-statue-is-teasing">seems to be teasing a brand new Divinity game</a> for reveal at the show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you hadn’t already heard, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-mysterious-the-game-awards-statue-reportedly-isnt-teasing-the-elder-scrolls-6-diablo-or-god-of-war-so-what-is-it-teasing">a weird, spiky monolith in the Mojave Desert</a>. Adorned with a massive eye-like orb and a legion of demonic creatures, it’s a hint at something due to be revealed as part of The Game Awards 2025. And, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-think-we-know-what-geoff-keighleys-weird-desert-statue-is-teasing">the registration of a few new trademarks</a>, it seems like we already have the answer as to what it is: a brand new game from Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios called “Divinity”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are one of the millions of players who first learned of Larian through the gargantuan success of Baldur’s Gate 3, then the word Divinity may not mean much to you. Fans of the studio, however, will tell you that BG3’s success is rooted in Divinity, a series of six games that Larian worked on almost exclusively between 2002 and 2017. <em><strong>If</strong></em> this monolith and trademark leak really do point towards Divinity, then the Belgian studio is returning to its original fantasy universe… and likely bringing a whole new fanbase along with it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If such a currently-very-much-hypothetical game would mark your first foray into the Divinity universe, then you may want a quick primer on what to expect. Let us be your guide to Divinity, and be the first to (very pre-emptively) say…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Welcome to Rivellon</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-blogroll-1765383245117.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like how Baldur’s Gate takes place in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons setting of the Forgotten Realms, Divinity has its own rich, original setting: the world of Rivellon. There are broad similarities between the two; both are rooted in Tolkienesque fantasy tropes, with classically styled medieval landscapes and locations. There are multiple races; like in D&amp;D, you can expect to meet humans, elves, dwarves, lizard-like beings, and the living dead. Magic is commonplace in Rivellon, although sorcery is considered more dangerous and is more heavily regulated there than it is on D&amp;D’s Sword Coast.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Baldur’s Gate, Divinity also features a number of more esoteric elements, from steampunk to sci-fi and beyond, that make its world a little quirkier than the lands explored in more traditional fantasy like The Lord of the Rings. Rivellon can also often be a very silly place, and the influence of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels has frequently been felt in Divinity’s writing. In fact, Terry’s daughter, Rhianna Pratchett, even wrote a tie-in novella for the second game. But that’s not to say Rivellon is frivolous – there’s a deep vein of fascinating lore that has been mined over the series’ six installments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Rivellon is the stage for stories similar to those you enjoyed in Baldur’s Gate 3, but is beholden only to Larian’s rules, rather than those set by the owners of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Wizards of the Coast. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Divinity?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-2-1765383400580.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Divinity is an RPG series, but its evolution has been far from usual. Take a quick look at each of the six games, and you’ll find at least four different approaches. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divine-divinity">Divine Divinity</a>, the very first game in the series, and its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/beyond-divinity">Beyond Divinity</a>, are Diablo-influenced action RPGs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-ii-ego-draconis">Divinity 2: Ego Draconis</a>, meanwhile, is a third-person RPG that feels a <em>little </em>closer to the likes of Dragon Age and The Witcher. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-dragon-commander">Divinity: Dragon Commander</a> is a <em>slightly</em> Total War-flavoured strategy game, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-original-sin">Original Sin</a> duology – the most recent games in the series – are classic-style RPGs that bear the most resemblance to Baldur’s Gate 3. Larian has experimented wildly over the years, and so there’s no clear indication as to what format the next game in the series will use (although considering the success of Baldur’s Gate 3, the sensible bet would be on something similar).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another unusual element is its approach to the timeline. While Rivellon does have a coherent history and storylines that are threaded across the series, each game is set years (sometimes even centuries) apart, meaning each one is something of a standalone experience. Similar to how Baldur's Gate 3 demands no experience of the series but has plenty of nods to the two earlier games, you can play Divinity: Original Sin 2 without any experience of its predecessors. I suspect any future game in the series would continue this tradition, especially since Larian now has a legion of new fans who are unfamiliar with the studio’s previous work. If the leaked trademark is to be believed, this new project is simply called “Divinity” – a name that has likely been chosen since it comes with no suggestion that you need to have played multiple other games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Does “Divinity” Mean?  </h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-logo-1765383966045.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The new Divinity logo, trademarked ahead of The Game Awards 2025.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Divinity’s name is drawn from its foundational lore. Thousands of years before the events of Divine Divinity, the first game in the series, Rivellon’s ruling body, the Council of Seven, sacrificed themselves to defend the realm from evil wizards. The “Divine Order” was established in remembrance and assigned to pass on their knowledge to the next generations.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the events of Divine Divinity, a prophecy tells of a messiah who will protect Rivellon from the next existential threat, a demon called Chaos. That messiah, it turns out, is you, and you ascend to become Lucian the Divine – a character that goes on to make appearances in Divinity 2: Ego Draconis and Divinity: Original Sin 2. The concept of the Divine is frequently explored in the stories, although it’s not the central focus of each and every game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Similar is Divinity to Baldur’s Gate 3?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-os2-screen-1765383448435.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the series has changed so much over its lifetime, most of the Divinity series is actually pretty different from what Larian created with Baldur’s Gate 3. However, the Original Sin duology is very clearly the blueprint for BG3. These are isometric RPGs set across multiple regions, with tactical turn-based combat and a similar “hands-off” approach to quest design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While both are worth playing, Original Sin 2 is by far the most accomplished, both in terms of gameplay depth and narrative strength. It is where Larian pioneered the “origin story” characters that would later become the heroes of Baldur’s Gate 3, and Rivellon’s answer to the likes of Astarion, Gale, and Shadowheart are just as brilliantly written. It’s also the game in which the studio established “tags”, the system that provides character-specific dialogue options to help you better roleplay your specific race or class. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the Original Sin duology’s most lauded system is its elemental effects – cast a rain spell to make something wet, and then use a lightning ability to conduct electricity through that sodden surface. Tip over an oil barrel to create a puddle, and then shoot a flaming arrow into it to create a blaze. Stab an enemy, freeze their blood, and watch them slip on their own icy innards. Much of this elemental interplay made it into Baldur’s Gate 3, but it’s much more pronounced in Original Sin. Expect at least a quarter of your battles to result in arena-wide bonfires. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Play the Divinity Games in Order</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-dragon-commander-1765383513679.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned, the timeline gaps that separate the Divinity games mean there are no strictly <em>direct</em> sequels, and you can more or less play them in any order you choose. If you’ve played Baldur’s Gate 3 and are looking to learn more about Divinity, I’d only truly recommend playing Original Sin 2, which is widely regarded as the best in the series. Initially a PC exclusive, it is now available on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and even iPad. But if you really do want to delve into the lore and explore the entire timeline, this is how you’d need to tackle the series:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity: Dragon Commander (2013)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A grand strategy game set thousands of years prior to the events of the RPGs.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity: Original Sin (2014)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A CRPG with turn-based combat, set 1000 years before the original game, focused on a pair of “Source Hunters” tracking down dangerous magic users.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divine Divinity (2002)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A Diablo-like ARPG that chronicles the ascension of Lucian the Divine.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Beyond Divinity (2004)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The ARPG sequel to Divine Divinity, set 20 years later, tells the story of one of Lucian’s servants, who has been soulbound to an evil Death Knight. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity: Original Sin 2 (2017)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A CRPG that’s a sequel to Original Sin in terms of game design, but takes place after the original two games and deals with an outbreak of “Voidwoken” monsters in Rivellon. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity 2: Ego Draconis (2009)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A 3D action RPG set decades after Lucian’s ascension, during an era when the Divine’s adoptive son has become a tyrant, in which you play as a knight who can transform into a dragon.  </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-divinity-larian-studios-baldurs-gate-3]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>v<strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Big Hops</em> is a 3D platformer, action adventure with deep movement, fresh frog-tongue gameplay, where you can grow veggies to build paths forward!</p><p>You’ll play as Hop, a young frog who’s been kidnapped from home by a trickster spirit called Diss. He has a mysterious, important mission and needs your help, but you just want to get back to your family… After a bit of searching, a wiry old Raccoon offers to build you a way home if you can find a few Airship Parts. To build your Airship, you’ll need to:</p><ul><li>Infiltrate the Gulley Gang’s Hideout at the edge of a vast Red Desert.</li><li>Become a Bucko and save DrillCO’s Rigs Workers out on the Open Ocean.</li><li>Sneak past <a title="Games > Haven [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/haven">Haven</a> cultists by spelunking under a Shattered Mountain.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Each World offers a self contained story. You’ll meet a huge cast of characters, learn the conflicts of each world, and hopefully find some way to help. Will that help be altruistic or is it all selfish to get those sweet, sweet Airship Parts? Why did Diss really kidnap you? What’s the purpose behind the Dark Drips he keeps asking you to collect? And if you collect them all, will Diss really let you go home?</p><p>You’ll need to play for yourself to answer all these questions, so consider backing to help us finish BIG HOPS strong! Next let’s talk about gameplay.</p><p>Character designs by Steven Sugar (background designer for <em>Steven Universe</em> and <em>Owl House</em>).</p><p><strong>Frog Parkour</strong></p><p>Movement is king in <em>Big Hops</em> and our kit goes deep. You can roll, dive, crouch jump, wall run, free climb, swim, belly slide, walk tightropes, pole swing, grind rails, ride minecarts and more. Everyone knows a great platformer starts with a great player controller and Hops’ stacks up against the best-of-the-best.</p><p>You’ll feel inspiration from <em>Mario</em>, <em>Sonic Adventure,</em> <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Hat in Time</em>, and more. And that’s all just Hop’s basic moveset—-from there we’ve added a ton of froggy flavor and ways to build your own paths forward.</p><p><strong>Tongue Gameplay</strong></p><p>The core-mechanic in <em>Big Hops</em> is Hop’s versatile frog tongue! It’s cute, goofy, and adds a surprising amount of freshness to this action-puzzle-platformer</p><p>Your tongue is how you interact. Use your tongue to pull items to your hands, hookshot up walls, and tongue-swing your way to ridiculous speeds.</p><p>Doors, switches, corks, plungers, flowers, flingers, levers, and lick-picking are all quick work thanks to Hop’s tongue. You’ll keep finding novel, goofy tongue interactions even over 10 hours into your playthrough.</p><p><strong>Veggie Creativity</strong></p><p>Deep movement and tongue-gameplay give BIG HOPS legs and a fresh flavor, but the real magic is using powerful Veggies to build your own paths through levels</p><p>You’ll find new types of Veggies as you explore and each has a unique effect when you throw it down in the world. Let’s look at some examples:</p><ul><li>Mushrooms become bounce pads to help clear hard jumps.</li><li>Acorns can grow vines around walls and ceilings to help you climb farther.</li><li>Balloons make temporary platforms and can stack to get serious height.</li><li>Oil Balls create hookshot points you can bounce off without losing speed.</li><li>Apples let you place your own tongue swinging points anywhere.</li><li>Cacti launch tightropes you can use to cross big gaps.</li></ul><p>Since you can only hold one item at a time, Hop has a handy Backpack! As you play, you’ll discover new Veggies and unlock more Backpack Slots to store them. You can open the Backpack any time, and using it in a stressful moment will slow down time so you can plan your next moves.</p><p><strong>Collectibles</strong></p><p>Collectibles are a genre staple and there are lots in BIG HOPS! We’ve worked hard to give them all gameplay uses, so you never feel like you’re just checking off boxes</p><ul><li>Earn Dark Drips to help with Diss’ mysterious mission and unlock secrets.</li><li>Collect Dark Bits to earn gameplay modifying Trinkets for your backpack.</li><li>Buy Veggies and upgrade your Backpack, Wallet, and more at Drilson’s Depot.</li><li>Buy outfits, hats, and dyes to customize Hop’s look at Odette’s Outfitters.</li><li>Find and Identify real Bugs to fill your collection in Bugsy’s Conservatory.</li><li>Uncover Blueprints to build totally normal and not-at-all busted Gadgets.</li><li>Find <a title="Games > Mixtape [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mixtape">Mixtape</a>s to play on in-game on your Boombox or Hop-man.</li></ul><p>Equipping Trinkets means decorating your Backpack!</p><p><strong>Big Adventure</strong></p><p>Something we’re proud of is how many different areas there are in <em>Big Hops</em>. As you explore the four main Worlds (Forest, Desert, Ocean, and Mountain), expect a lot of surprising offshoots like the Boneyard, Bucko Cove, Hydro Plant, and Gulley Gang HQ. All these different places to explore really make it feel like you’re on a grand adventure!</p><p><strong>Inspirations</strong></p><p>I [Chris Wade] started <em>Big Hops</em> in 2019 (6 years ago!!!) with a single goal of modernizing the 3D platformer genre. The design trend at the time of giving players real freedom and creativity in games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Spelunky</em>, and <em>Rimworld</em> was so inspiring. Selfishly and jealously, I wanted to see emergent gameplay in my favorite genre.</p><p>Since then, <em>Big Hops</em> has become a maximalist game and taken on many more ideas and inspirations. Its mechanics, story, vibes, and humor draw on so many games and TV shows stretching back 40 years. <em>Mario</em> (<em>64</em>, <em>Odyssey</em>, <em>Sunshine</em>, and <em>Galaxy</em>) and <em>Zelda</em> (<em>Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Wind Waker</em>, and <em>Ocarina of Time</em>) have both been huge influences. We also spend a lot of time talking about <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, <em>Spelunky</em>, <em><a title="Series > Kingdom Hearts [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>, <em>Psychonauts</em>, <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, <em>Spongebob</em>, and <em>Steven Universe</em>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/big-hops-launches-january-12-2026-for-ps5-switch-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Welcome to <em>Beastro</em>! In this charming fusion of fantasy adventure, not all heroes wield swords… Some prefer the spoon. And, sometimes to save the world you’ve got to start with a really good meal.</p><p>Palo Pori is a beautiful and peaceful village of artisans and tastemakers. Beyond the village’s protective wall, darkness has begun to stir. Ravenous monsters have claimed the land and threaten to sink their teeth into this final morsel of hope and happiness.</p><p>Play as Panko, a young, talented chef, helping to run the local eatery. When Panko’s teacher goes missing, a mysterious visitor arrives with warnings of the dangers beyond the wall. It’s up to Panko to step up and take over the restaurant and tend to the ingredients and patrons. But that’s not all, Panko also finds himself serving the Caretakers, brave adventurers, sent to save the world. In this adventure, preserving peace starts in the kitchen!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>From Town to Table</strong></p><p>In Palo Pori, fresh is best! Gather ingredients and resources, care for animals and grow your own fruit and veg to build up your very own cozy town to table restaurant. Forage for wild herbs and unlock new seeds to grow to expand your meals.</p><p><strong>Serving Your Community</strong></p><p>Chop, flip, and sizzle your way through mouthwatering mini-games as you whip up delightful dishes for the townsfolk. Good food is always better with company, so work hard to improve your <a title="Genres > Cooking [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a> and experiment with ingredients, to keep your patrons happy.</p><p>Tailor your restaurant to the tastes of your community, develop new meals, progress your know how through a skill tree and adjust the decor to increase your restaurant’s appeal.</p><p><strong>Feed the Caretakers</strong></p><p>You’ll also need to feed the hungry Caretakers; these brave denizens of the land will venture out into the wilds to fight the ravenous monsters threatening the peace of Palo Pori. Each Caretaker hails from their own flavour region, affecting their own tastes and preferences: some like it bitter, some like it sweet and some are just looking to fulfil their craving of the day! Craft thoughtful meals and balance the flavour profiles to boost their spirits, sharpen their skills, and unlock new abilities. Because let’s face it… Who can save the world on an empty stomach?</p><p><strong>Delicious Deck Building</strong></p><p>Now it’s time to put your meal to the test! This is where taste meets tactics. The dishes you serve will build your Caretaker’s deck – each ingredient unlocking a card. And once they’ve eaten, they’ll venture into the wilds to fight the monsters. Upon their return, they’ll recount their journey and play out their battles through a charming puppet theatre sequence. They might even bring you back some MONSTEROUS ingredients from their ventures. Fight the monsters in turn-based deck building combat, inspired by traditional trick-taking card games. Outplay the monsters, by matching their flavour magic or neutralising it with a balancing card. Add an enhancing card to power up your moves! Your magic can turn the tables!</p><p>Utilize the unique effects of your ingredients to put your enemies to sleep, blow away their cards, and more, but watch out, you’re not the only one with special abilities. If you’re not paying attention, you might get burned.</p><p>In this food-based fantasy adventure, it’s time to give peas a chance! – Are you ready to get cooking?</p><p>Unlock the magic in food.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/beastro-adds-ps5-version-launches-in-spring-2026]]></content:encoded>

Over the course of 90-plus levels, Astro Bot makes brilliant use of the DualSense's adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, touch panel, gyro controls, and built-in speaker. From a mechanical perspective, Astro Bot is arguably the most inventive and playful 3D platformer ever made.</p><p>Astro Bot also doubles as a celebration of all things PlayStation. You'll meet little robots themed around other PlayStation heroes and heroines, including Ratchet, Rivet, Kratos, Atreus, Aloy, Nathan Drake, Sly Cooper, Jak, Crash Bandicoot, and many more. Some of the levels are even themed around different franchises and implement mechanics from those games.</p><p>Astro Bot earned a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/" data-ref-id="1900-6418277">9/10 in GameSpot's review</a> and won GOTY at last year's Game Awards.</p></div>                      </div><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D5SM3K4Q,B095T8C99C,B0F19GPDW3,B0C7WQRCPB,B08QFWWJ8K,B0BPMTJJ6D,B0CGXZQ4CD,B08XNRM6QN,B09SW6GCGL,B0CTVK7GBM,B0CJGPSXG4,B0CPYSPHR1,B0B3QWRQL8,B0CP4DCK45,B08FC5TTBF,B08QFPS48J,B09Z7JZW4P,B09RDRYF8L,B0CK4VWNYL,B0DX42RXMS,B0DD8TMP2Y,B0B61YDF5V,B09N848WMD,B08FC64CNF,B08JHQ4NBB,B0DWYP2PXP,B08QFZCGVJ,B098G34GBT,B08NX8F4W1&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Holiday 2025 Game Deals</a></h2><p>PlayStation's Holiday Sale features a bunch of other notable game deals, including <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Astro+Bot+Game+Deal+Restocked+At+Amazon+-+Get+The+PS5+Platformer+For+Best+Price+Yet&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-12-10+10%3A55%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-10+10%3A55%3A34&amp;fnarticle_id=6536386&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-games%2Fratchet-clank-rift-apart-ps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fastro-bot-playstation-5-best-exclusive-game-deal-holiday-2025%2F1100-6536386%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a> for $30, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F19GPDW3?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Death Stranding 2</a> for $50, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Astro+Bot+Game+Deal+Restocked+At+Amazon+-+Get+The+PS5+Platformer+For+Best+Price+Yet&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-12-10+10%3A55%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-10+10%3A55%3A34&amp;fnarticle_id=6536386&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGod-of-War-Ragnar-k-Standard-Edition-Playstation-5-Physical%2F1336533270%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fastro-bot-playstation-5-best-exclusive-game-deal-holiday-2025%2F1100-6536386%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">God of War: Ragnarok</a> for only $20, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7WQRCPB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> for $30.

Despite being Sandfall's first game, the narrative-driven, turn-based RPG quickly entered the pantheon of all-time greatest RPGs, earning nearly universal critical acclaim for its artistry, story, and espousal of mechanics and themes typically associated with Japanese RPGs.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Now, Sandfall Interactive stands poised to make The Game Awards history. Last month, the studio broke The Game Awards' record for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-nominees-ranked-by-how-many-nominations-they-received/2900-7267/" data-ref-id="2900-7267">most award nominations</a>, earning a whopping 13, including Game of the Year. Earlier this year, I spoke with the studio's creative director, Guillaume Broche, who said the team was in "disbelief" about how the game has been received; it stands to reason that this sentiment has only grown with the game's tremendous success.</p><p dir="ltr">Broche also shared a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, explaining how there were "a lot of arguments" about the game's ending, why the team opted for minimal user interface, and how many people are still unaware of the game's biggest inspiration.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Firstly, I'd love to know: What is the atmosphere of the studio following the </strong><strong>game's tremendous success?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Broche: </strong>I think a lot of us are still in disbelief with how the game’s launched and how fans have embraced it. Every day we say to each other, "Is this real?" or, "Can you believe that?" when we see another milestone reached or that our favorite game developer or studio reached out and congratulated us. It's all really overwhelming in a way, and we’re super grateful for everyone for their faith and support.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>As I played through Expedition 33, it felt to me like the team took a "less is more" approach to creating the game. There are few UI elements on the screen and oftentimes, the character's expressions and what they don't say are just as impactful as what they do. That said, I'd like to hear in your own words about your design philosophies and principles, if you could elaborate on them.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We always wanted to tell a story that felt realistic and grounded. Of course, we have fantasy elements in the story, but at its core it’s a fundamentally human story. And in that story we wanted to have subtle, realistic interactions and emotions--which is why there’s a certain "less is more" feeling, like you say. It just makes the game feel more "real" in our eyes, or at least easier to engage with and relate to. Not every interaction in real life is a perfectly written, theatrical conversation--sometimes it’s just a look, or subtle moments of quietness, that have the most impact.</p><p dir="ltr">For the UI, we also wanted to have that same grounded approach to exploration. We trust the player to find their way through our levels, to understand our systems, and to engage with the world in the way we intended. We took some inspirations from games we grew up with in that sense, avoiding bloating our game with systems and designs that ultimately don’t improve the main game experience.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I've found that Clair Obscur is phenomenal in working within shades of grey and every character feels deeply human. As such, reflecting on the game's ethics and big decisions are both interesting and challenging. Do you believe there truly is a true or "good" ending to the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">That’s something we've had a lot of arguments about in the team too! I think your reaction to the endings, and which one is the "good" ending, is super subjective and related to your own personal experiences in real life. And I think that’s a strength of our writing and story--kudos to our Lead Writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, and our amazing mocap and voice actors for their performances--sometimes there is no clear "good" or "bad" choice in life that everyone will be happy with, and living within the grey, and those complex choices, are what makes us real people. Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Many sites have been quick to note Legend of Dragoon, the Final Fantasy series, and even From Software titles as games that Clair Obscur has seemingly drawn inspiration from, but are there any other works that inspired you that you want to talk about?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Actually, I didn’t play Legend of Dragoon before coming up with the QTEs (quick-time events) during skills. I learnt later that a game did something similar! There are also other inspirations like the Persona series, but also action games like Devil May Cry and Nier.</p><p dir="ltr">One major inspiration is a French novel called La Horde du Contrevent. It tells the story of a group of explorers--or an expedition--travelling across the world to find the source of the supernatural wind that sweeps across the world. Their tale, and the human stories of the team and their discoveries as they travel the world, were also an inspiration for us as we developed a story of our own expeditioners traveling across the world. I’d recommend that anyone who’s a fan of our story picks up this book, but I don’t think it’s been translated into English fully since it’s so densely written with so much nuance in the French language. So I guess maybe fans should learn French, and then read the novel!</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Whether Clair Obscur will break the record currently held by The Last of Us: Part II and take home more than seven awards from The Game Awards remains to be seen. However, with 13 nominations and a Game of the Year award on the line, it's certainly worth tuning in to see what happens. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-game-awards/" data-ref-id="5000-616839">The Game Awards</a> airs tomorrow, December 11, at 9:30 PM ET / 6:30 PM PT.</p>

            <p>The Game Awards may be one of the biggest events of the year, but I have just as much excitement from the indie event that precedes it, Day of the Devs. Seeing such innovative games from a wide range of indie developers makes me optimistic about the future of the industry, and this year was no exception. If you missed the latest showcase, here's a recap of every game shown in order of appearance.</p>

		<p>Triangle Wave turned up to Day of the Devs with a trailer for Stretchmancer, their overly flexible puzzle game that will have you stretching, pushing, squishy, pushing and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="STRETCHMANCER - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jm-P_ptCB2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>(This is the announcement trailer from earlier this year)</p>
<p>As you try to save the world from the Claustro Empire, you’ll be using your unique ability to morph the world around you to escape prison and go on a bit of a puzzle-solving rampage. You’ve got two forms of this ability, the right hand pushing things and the left hand pulling them, stretching and squashing, and potentially doing both at the same time.</p>
<p>The game started off as a Ludum Dare game jam title, but is now being grown into a full sized title with publisher Offbrand Games. The title is still in the prototyping phase, such as exploring how water might fill shrinking spaces. It’s no surprise that Triangle Wave has created a custom game engine to handle all of this.</p>

<p>Definitely one to keep an eye on!</p>

I am not someone that thinks you can be therapied out of any kind of mental anguish. Life just doesn't work that way! Sure, it can be a helpful tool, but sometimes you need to pick up a sledgehammer, go back to your hometown that is filled with robots, and smash it all down. Or, at least that's the argument that Virtue and a Sledgehammer makes, the latest game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-red-strings-club">The Red Strings Club</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-cosmic-wheel-sisterhood">The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood</a> developer Deconstructeam.
</p>
<p>
In Virtue and a Sledgehammer, as described above, instead of being like most people who undergo therapy to get help, you chose the brave option, a sledgehammer. This hometown I mentioned is specifically "haunted by the android ghosts of your digitized neighbours," which is a line so electric I personally don't need much more convincing. But then comes the smashing.

As shown in the reveal trailer, that is a lot of what you do in this otherwise narrative exploration game. Not much actual gameplay was shown off, but what is shown is you, the protagonist, swinging around a big ass sledgehemmer, destroying buildings and robots galore. I don't even know if these are the violent, evil kind of robots. In one shot a group of them move towards you, but I can't tell if that's to hurt you or not. In another, a pair of them sit peacefully on a bench in the woods.
</p><p>
The hints and whispers of surreality do wonders for me too, not to mention the low-poly style that isn't trying to emulate games from the 2000s backwards, instead prioritising art direction above technical fidelity. I imagine this'll be one to keep an eye out for if you're into story thinky games like 1000xRESIST and Kentucky Route 0. I certainly will be!

              <p><em>All You Need Is Kill</em> is a Japanese “light novel” by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, published in 2004, that became the basis for the surprisingly excellent Tom Cruise sci-fi flick <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>. It’s now receiving a much more faithful anime adaptation from director Kenichiro Akimoto, coming out next month, and the first trailer is <em>breathtaking</em>.</p> <p>I need to confess: To my own detriment, I am not an anime guy. It’s a massive gap in my cultural awareness and personal entertainment, and I deserve all your ire. However, from the opening frames of the <em>All You Need Is Kill</em> trailer, I was hooked. This film looks stunning.</p>

  <p>The time loop novel told the story of Keiji Kiriya, who had recently joined the United Defense Force to help battle an alien race called the Mimics. The war is not going well, and like so many, Keiji appears to be killed on his very first mission. Except, for some reason, he wakes up to find himself back at the start of the same day, <em>Groundhog Day</em> style. This time loop allows Keiji to become an ever-more-skillful soldier, as well as recognize that fellow soldier Rita Vrataski is also trapped in the same loop.</p>

 <p>This movie, however, flips the script, focusing on Rita’s perspective of the events, where we see her early experiences of the time loop as she’s repeatedly killed by a giant alien flower, and her eventual discovery of Keiji’s involvement. It’s due to release in Japan on January 9, and then come to the U.S. by January 16, distributed by GKIDS, the company that released&nbsp;<em>The Boy and the Heron</em> in 2024.</p>

 <p>I’m so taken by the mix of media in the trailer, especially the incredibly brief and extraordinary use of the first-person perspective when Rita wakes for the first time. It looks compelling, and early word is that a screening at the French Annecy International Animation Film Festival went down very well.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I think it might be time for yet another rewatch of&nbsp;<em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="0fe7749d0966c"><a title="RE Villains 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0fe7749d0966c/re-villains-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Warning: this article contains scenes of explicit spoilers.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> launches on the Switch 2 in just under three months, but even now, the game is heavily shrouded in mystery (well, a little less so after the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/leon-kennedy-is-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-via-psn-store-image">accidental reveal of Leon</a>).</p>
<p>Judging from the trailers so far, one of the biggest draws of this new title is the inclusion of Raccoon City, the primary location of the original trilogy, and a town now in ruins following a calculated nuclear explosion.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that Raccoon’s return is to partially evoke a sense of nostalgia with long-time fans, but there also needs to be a legitimate reason as to why the series is going back to its roots. What evil is lurking in the decimated ruins? What secrets can still be unearthed? And who is behind what will no doubt prove to be a deadly new viral threat?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067twnlju&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>That last question is going to be particularly crucial, as the series has, in my opinion, suffered from a severe villain problem since the death of Albert Wesker in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_5">Resident Evil 5</a>. Ever since Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar fired two rockets at the slick-haired scoundrel while he was <strong>*checks notes*</strong> floundering in a pool of lava, it seems Capcom has struggled to settle on a new, enduring antagonist.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6f7c1a63d53ab"><a title="RE Villains 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6f7c1a63d53ab/re-villains-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Things got off to a rocky start with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_revelations">Revelations</a> in 2012, during which it was revealed that Morgan Lansdale was the architect behind the game’s events. Remember him? No, no one else does either.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a> launched the same year and featured dual antagonists: Derek C. Simmons and Carla Radames, the latter of which had mutated to become an exact replica of Ada Wong. While the game certainly dumped a healthy load of exposition on you to explain Simmons and Radames' roles, you’d be forgiven for thinking that their presence was a mere afterthought from Capcom. They added nothing of substance to the story, and Simmons in particular felt like the most generic evil-doer in the series’ history. A poor showing, indeed.</p>
<p>There was a glimmer of hope with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_revelations_2">Revelations 2</a>, which introduced Alex Wesker to the series. As the sister of Albert, Alex demonstrated a similar sense of mystique and menace, even if some of her lines were ripped straight from her sibling. Alas, it wasn’t to be, with Alex mutating into a grotesque monster and winding up on the receiving end of yet another rocket launcher. Like brother, like sister, I suppose.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil VII</a>, the Baker Family proved to be a solid set of villains that genuinely stoked fear in my heart as I roamed about their dilapidated estate. Yet as the story would eventually reveal, the Bakers were merely pawns acting under the influence of Eveline, a bioweapon presenting itself as a young girl who just wants a family to call her own. Cool, I guess?</p>
<figure data-uuid="043876a6c220b"><a title="RE Villains 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/043876a6c220b/re-villains-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, it’s an interesting hook, but it hardly leaves much room for development. And, much like previous titles, Eveline is dispatched at the end of the game, proving to be yet another disposable ‘monster of the week’ villain. I’m sensing a bit of a pattern here.</p>
<p>Finally, we have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village</a>. Oh boy. This one introduced Mother Miranda as the primary antagonist, a cult leader who, in an effort to revive her lost daughter, infected the local populous with 'Mold' and — because Capcom simply <em>has</em> to tie everything back to Umbrella — supposedly mentored Oswell E. Spencer, the company’s founder.</p>
<p>Okay! That sounds pretty neat actually, right? Well, no, because RE Village put far too much focus on Miranda’s assistants: the Four Lords of the Village. Chief of these was Lady Dimitrescu, who gained so much popularity in the weeks and months leading up to release that Capcom focused almost all of its marketing efforts on her. Surely that means that she’ll take over as the overarching villain of the franchise, right? Again, no. She dies very early in the game. <em>Poof</em>, gone.</p>
<p>As for Miranda, she — like every major villain since RE5 — perished at the hands of the protagonist at the end of the game. Since then, Capcom seems to have finally recognised the value in having a compelling villain, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/jill-chris-would-be-more-befitting-resident-evils-obsession-with-lady-d-is-getting-fans-riled-up">going right back to Lady Dimitrescu</a> to market Requiem, a game that, as far as we know, has absolutely nothing to do with the events of Village.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a7775a75dc2d6"><a title="RE Villains 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a7775a75dc2d6/re-villains-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something needs to change – we can’t just keep starting from fresh with every mainline entry. There’s a reason the original trilogy (and, by extension, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_code_veronica_x">Code Veronica</a>) remains so popular. There's a clear through line with those games; a shadowy organisation at the heart of the narrative with Umbrella, and an incredible villain with Albert Wesker, who returned stronger than ever in Code Veronica after being presumed dead.</p>
<p>So, can we expect something similar with Requiem? Is Lady Dimitrescu actually dead? Or is there yet another member of the Wesker family waiting in the wings? The pre-release footage so far has focused quite heavily on what fans are referring to as 'The Hooded Man', and it seems clear that Capcom is keen to keep the real identity of this mysterious figure a complete secret for the time being.</p>
<p>Whatever the potential solution, Capcom needs to not only make us care about the events of Requiem, but keep us excited for the future of the series after the credits roll. If we get yet another disposable mastermind who bites the dust in the last act, I'm not sure how much longer I can stay invested.</p>

			<p>After two of the games included in December 2025's list of PS Plus Extra and Premium games <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-on-connait-les-tetes-daffiche-des-ajouts-de-decembre-2025-60803">joining the game catalog leaked early</a>, PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-december-assassins-creed-mirage-wo-long-fallen-dynasty-skate-story-and-more/">now officially confirmed</a> all ten of the games coming to PlayStation Plus for subscribers at the Extra and Premium tiers.</p>



<p>There are three big headlining titles for the month, one of them being a day-one release that is actually already available for Extra and Premium subscribers. That game is, of course, Sam Eng's Skate Story, which puts you in the Vans of a demon made of glass and pain who must skate through Hell to try and eat the Moon. It's a fever dream of a story if there ever was one, and it's one of the more exciting indies to end off 2025.</p>



<p>The other two big headlining games are <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">2023's Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>, which were also the two games that leaked courtesy of Dealabs. As for the rest of the games joining the catalog, other notable titles include <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/granblue-fantasy-relink-exceeding-expectations/">Granblue Fantasy: Relink</a>, Lego Horizon Adventures (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-five-games-december-2025-lego-horizon-adventures-neon-white/">which is also one of the PS Plus Essential games for the month</a>), and Planet Coaster 2.</p>

<p>PS Plus Premium subscribers only get one addition to the Classic's Game Catalog for the month of December, but at least it's a game that has no trouble standing out on its own, as Soulcaliber III is now available for Premium subscribers.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games coming to PS Plus Extra and Premium for December 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Assassin's Creed Mirage (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Skate Story (PS5)</li>



<li>Granblue Fantasy: ReLink (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Planet Coaster 2 (PS5)</li>



<li>Cat Quest III (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Lego Horizon Adventures (PS5)</li>



<li>Paw Patrol: Grand Prix (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Paw Patrol World (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Soulcaliber III (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PlayStation Premium subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The other notable inclusion for what PS Plus subscribers are getting in December 2025 is a credit for the Sony Pictures Core store. The number of credits you receive will depend on which tier you are subscribed to, though PlayStation does not make it clear how many credits PS Plus Extra and Premium members get, or if PS Plus Essential subscribers get any credits at all.</p>



<p>The promotion also claims to only come as part of a purchase for a 12-month PS Plus subscription (any tier), though it doesn't clarify if this offer is available to those already subscribed to an annual plan. The promotion is active from December 11, 2025, to January 12, 2026, so perhaps more information will become clear once it's live. Hopefully, the offer is available to all subscribers, regardless of when they purchased their subscription.</p>
