            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-map-kanto-region-post-apocalypse-leak-2000650529</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Ever since The Pokémon Company </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331"><span>announced </span><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia</span></i></a><span>, the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span>-style life sim game has seemed a little off. Your character is helping rebuild a small town so Pokémon can live there, but the space is filled with desecrated buildings, and humans are nowhere to be found. Fans have been speculating that the cozy game might not be so cozy after all, and that it may take place in a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalypse-snorlax-pikachu-fuschia-2000644400"><span>post-apocalyptic version of the Kanto region</span></a><span> from the original </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games. Now, a leak may have confirmed this.</span></p> <p><span>A leaked map outlines the status of Kanto in </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>, with descriptions for each “area,” named after the cities and towns that once stood there. A translation posted by Pokémon leak account Centro Leaks describes these desolate areas, and each of them sounds like they’ve succumbed to the elements. Fuschia city, which fans have speculated might be the first area shown in most of </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>‘s trailers, is said to be “dried up and unfertilized fieldland.” Vermillion City, which was once occupied by Lt. Surge’s electric gym and a harbor city for ships to arrive and depart from, is roughly translated as a “constant raining electrical harbor.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The rest of the descriptions sure do make it sound like humanity has been gone for a long time. Saffron City’s metropolitan area is “covered with plants,” Pewter City has been “abandoned” and is covered in rocks, and Lavender Town’s Pokémon Tower is now “rotten” but believed to reach heaven.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokópia is post-apocalyptic Kanto CONFIRMED!</p> <p>➡️ Base game areas:<br>Area 1 – Fuscha Area – Dried up and unfertilized fieldland<br>Area 2 – Vermillion Area – Constant raining electrical harbor<br>Area 3 – Pewter Area – An abandoned mine covered by rocks<br>Area 4 – Saffron Area – Bunch of… <a href="https://t.co/JPySgYGnBW">https://t.co/JPySgYGnBW</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1996007165002199320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Just how much </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>will reckon with this remains to be seen, but the environment isn’t the only indicator that something terrible happened in Kanto in this game. The game includes </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-pikachu-pale-form-peakychu-white-2000644025"><span>new forms for Pikachu, Snorlax, and Smeargle</span></a><span> that have elements to their character design that imply a lot of time has passed since they last interacted with humans. I’m really curious to see how deep this game goes into its tragic “what if” storyline when it comes to Switch 2 on March 5.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-goes-full-clearance-on-its-graphics-cards-as-the-geforce-rtx-5070-drops-to-a-new-record-low-2000650188</link>
            <guid>1372969</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Those looking to game better or push some creative boundaries this holiday season; we’ve got good news. The top-rated ASUS GeForce RTX 5070 just hit its lowest price ever, and it’s even better than what it dipped to during Black Friday!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/">This graphics card sits at $710, but you can currently grab it for just $570 at Amazon, after the retailer took 20% off its price</a>. The deal is open to all shoppers, and there are no delivery charges to worry about. Even better, this isn’t one of those complicated-to-score discounts. You don’t need to enter any complicated coupon codes or follow long checkout steps to grab the discount. Just throw it in your cart, and the offer applies automatically. The only thing to note is that the retailer has marked the deal as a fast-selling one. That means the stock, or the drop itself, is only going to be around for a short time, and it won’t be long before we see them wrap up. It’s better to act now if you don’t want to run into last-minute disappointments later on.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Visuals, Even Better Performance</h2>
<p>RTX is the most advanced platform for full ray tracing and neural rendering tech that completely upgrades the way you work and play. The graphics card is powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture and DLSS 4, featuring fifth-gen tensor cores for better AI performance, latest streaming multiprocessors that are optimized for neutral shader, and fourth-gen ray tracing cores specifically built for mega geometry. DLSS4 uses AI to boost FPS, reduce latency, and make the overall image quality top-notch, while the Blackwell architecture makes cinematic quality visuals at unbelievable speeds possible.</p>
<p>The 2.5 slot design of the card offers better build compatibility while maintaining cooling performance, regardless of how intense things get. Cooling mechanism includes a premium phase-change GPU thermal pad that softens under heat to fill the gaps between the GPU and thermal module effectively, resulting in superior thermal conductivity and better heat dissipation throughout your sessions. The axial-tech fans come with longer blades, alongside a barrier ring to increase the downward air pressure, while the 0db tech stops the fans automatically when the temperature of the GPU goes 50 degrees. The latter makes it easy to focus on light tasks without any distracting sound, and puts the fans back to work at 55 degrees when things start to heat up. You can also switch between Quiet and Performance BIOS profiles manually; the former offers a calmer operation, while the latter maximizes performance for resource-intensive tasks.</p>



<p>The card comes with a GPU guard that applies adhesive to secure all four corners of the GPU to keep it firmly in place. Dual-ball bearings are designed to last up to twice as long as sleeve bearings, while the protective backplate does a good job of keeping the components safe from external damage. What’s more, the Tuning tool makes overclocking, cooling control, and monitoring the performance of your card a breeze. It even comes with MuseTree, which is an AI-powered image-generation app that gives the creative inside you a boost by letting you create images, manage ideas, and unlock new inspirations as you go.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/">You can now grab the graphics card for just $570, after an impressive $140 discount on its retail price of $710.</a> This makes the upgrade much more affordable, but only for a short time. Don’t miss out on the chance to grab it for less, as this is one of the lowest prices we have seen the card drop to.</p>

<p>Black Ops 7, the latest Call of Duty title released on November 14, 2025, wasn’t able to make the same impact as previous instalments in the franchise.

However, things don’t seem too bad, as it dominated the PS5 store last month. </p>

We’re looking forward to making it worth your while on March 12!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Thunderful Games:</p><blockquote><p>Uncover the sinister secrets of Phoenix Corporation, through the eyes of its own creation, R.E.A.C.H. – an AI trapped in a human body against its will. In an alternate 1980s America reshaped by nuclear catastrophe, Phoenix-City has become one of the Corporation’s strongholds – a haven for corruption where outlaws thrive and human life is traded like currency. Step into the role of R.E.A.C.H., expose the Corporation’s hidden agenda, and uncover the purpose behind your creation.</p><p><em>REPLACED</em> is a 2.5D cinematic action platformer wrapped in an intense cyberpunk thriller narrative. Run, climb, and fight through crumbling districts, industrial wastelands, and neon-lit alleys with fluid movement and fast, responsive combat. Chain precise melee strikes with satisfying ranged attacks to take down enemies in high-intensity encounters while keeping the flow of exploration.</p><p>Explore themes of humanity, identity, and control through morally complex characters and the slow reveal of a world pushed to its limits. Feel it being brought to life with hand-crafted pixel art enhanced by modern visual effects, while a moody, synth-driven soundtrack sets the tone. <em>REPLACED</em> delivers a single-player journey that blends cinematic platforming, fast-paced action, and a tense cyberpunk thriller narrative. Immerse yourself in a world where every secret – and every life – has a price.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

Sega has broached the subject of AI following it latest earnings report, confirming its plans to leverage the technology in development as part of "efficiency improvements". However, it also says it intends to proceed "carefully" in order to identify "appropriate" uses.
</p>
<p>
The company shared its perspective during a Q&amp;A session coinciding with its Q2 earnings report, responding to a question inquiring if it would pursue larger projects or efficiency. "Rather than fully following the trend toward the large-scale development," its executives explained in an <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20251203_q2_major_QA_e.pdf">official translation</a>, "we will also pursue efficiency improvements, such as leveraging AI."
</p>
<p>
It also acknowledged the "strong resistance" AI adoption can face in "creative areas such as character creation", adding it intends to "proceed by carefully assessing appropriate use cases". It suggested one such area might include "streamlining the development processes" but did not elaborate further.
</p>
<p>
Sega is, of course, far from the only publisher to weigh in on AI in recent times, with some companies being less cautious than others. EA CEO Andrew Wilson, for instance, has boasted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">AI is "the very core of our business"</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick has taken a more measured approach, calling artificial intelligence an "oxymoron" and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-couldnt-be-made-by-ai-suggests-take-two-boss-there-is-no-creativity-that-can-exist-by-definition-in-any-ai-model">saying</a> "no creativity... can exist by definition in any AI model." Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/execs-pushing-ai-not-humane-creative-rockstar-co-founder-mad-cow-disease">compared the technology to "mad cow disease"</a>, describing the execs pushing it as "not the most humane or creative people".
</p><p>
Even so, a recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development. One of those studios - Let it Die: Inferno developer Supertrick Games - this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-inferno-developer-responds-to-generative-ai-controversy">faced the issue head on</a> after receiving significant criticism for its extensive use of generative AI.

<p>In the hardware charts, the Switch 2 stays firmly on top with an additional 97,677 units to its name, followed by the PS5 Digital Edition and the Switch OLED.</p>
<p>Things are so close between the PS5 and Switch 1 this week, that combining the SKU's for the two consoles only narrowly tips things in Sony's favour. The standard Switch, OLED and Lite come together for 35,327, while the three PS5 models sneak in with 35,786.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia launched its first RTX 50-series graphics cards earlier this year <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615768/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-drop-physx-support-32-bit">without support for PhysX</a>, the GPU-accelerated technology that let games realistically simulate shattering glass, moving liquids, smoke, fog, and more. Now, Nvidia is bringing back PhysX support for the RTX 50-series GPUs for top-played games like <em>Borderlands 2</em>, <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>, and <em>Batman: Arkham City</em>.</p><p>“We heard the feedback from the community, and with the launch of our new driver today, we are adding custom support for GeForce gamers’ most played PhysX-accelerated games, enabling full performance on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, in line with our existing PhysX support on prior-generation GPUs,” <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-geforce-game-ready-driver/">says Nvidia</a>.</p><p>PhysX was a big part of games like <em>Borderlands 2</em> and <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>, and it originally didn’t ship with Nvidia’s latest GPUs because the RTX 50-series dropped support for 32-bit CUDA support. That prevented these older games using PhysX from being GPU-accelerated on the latest Nvidia GPUs. Some titles like <em>Borderlands 2</em> dropped below 60fps, because the games were relying on a CPU to deliver PhysX effects.</p><p>Nvidia has now created “custom support” for top-played PhysX-accelerated games, but not all games are supported yet. Here’s the current list:</p><p><em>Alice: Madness Returns<br>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag<br>Batman: Arkham City<br>Batman: Arkham Origins<br>Borderlands 2<br>Mafia II<br>Metro 2033<br>Metro: Last Light<br>Mirror’s Edge</em></p><p>Nvidia says it’s also planning to support <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em> “in the first part of 2026,” but there’s no word on any additional games. PhysX was always limited to a handful of titles anyway, but <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rtx-50-series-gpus-have-dropped-support-for-32-bit-physx-many-older-pc-games-are-impacted-mirrors-edge-borderlands-etc.1111698/">Resetera forum</a> members have been tracking more than 40 games that have been affected by the removal of PhysX support on RTX 50-series GPUs. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that Nvidia will fully support all of these older PhysX games.</p><p>You can download Nvidia’s new Game Ready driver (591.44) over at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/">Nvidia’s website</a> or through the Nvidia app.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/838043/nvidia-rtx-50-series-physx-support-driver]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto 5 has been out for 12 years now, and the game is still going strong, all thanks to its online multiplayer mode. The game’s popularity remains high enough that it’s up for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-5-is-up-for-a-goty-award-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of the Year award in 2025</a>. As Rockstar keeps on bringing new content to the title, players are now eligible to claim some free GTA Online money. </p>

<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/gta-online-promotion-discord-free-money-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, GTA Online players can grab free $500,000 by linking their Rockstar and Discord accounts, no GTA+ subscription required. All you need to do is visit the linked accounts section on the Rockstar Games <a href="https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/settings/linkedaccounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> after signing in to your account. Here, you can link your Discord and Rockstar accounts. Once that is done, players will need to <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rockstargames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">join</a> the Rockstar Games Discord and claim the reward from the designated channel. The reward can then be redeemed when playing GTA Online next. </p>



<p>Before GTA+ came about, Rockstar would provide $500,000 each month for GTA Online through PlayStation Plus, and all you needed to do was go and claim the reward. Since the arrival of GTA+, that bonus is only reserved for subscribed members. Moreover, being a member of Rockstar’s subscription service also provides GTA Online to players for free, so you don’t even need to buy the base game. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-open-beta-launches-again-new-trailer/</link>
            <guid>1372912</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PIONER, an upcoming post-apocalyptic MMO, is back in open beta until December 9, giving GFA Games the chance to optimize it before the game’s ultimate release (in early access) on December 16. This new open beta phase coincides with the release of an all-new trailer showcasing the game’s setting, the ruined island of Tartarus.</p>



<p>PIONER comes from GFA Games, a Serbian studio, and it promises intense, end-of-the-world action in a Soviet-era setting that’s deeply reminiscent of games like STALKER and Fallout.</p>



<h2 id="h-pioner-launching-december-16-but-you-can-play-it-now">PIONER Launching December 16, But You Can Play It Now</h2>



<p>GFA Games’ PIONER is set to drop in just a couple of weeks, but if you want to play it now (exclusively on Steam), then you can simply install the open beta and give it a try.</p>



<p>PIONER is a little rough around the edges, but it’s launching in early access, so that can mostly be excused. It’s a very ambitious title that boasts an MMO, live-service operating model, a branching campaign, a PvPvE ecosystem, and sumptuous visuals.</p>



<p>The newest trailer offers a great look at the environments players will need to contend with when the game comes out on December 16:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PIONER - Mist" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G2nUqz-p1_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Fans of STALKER will notice the similarities between the two games. In PIONER, which was developed by some former STALKER devs, players must contend with anomalies that are made detectable by a scanner, and to defeat them, they can throw pieces of scrap metal into them to trigger them.</p>



<p>Sound familiar?</p>



<p>It’s a bit of a copy and paste, but there’s enough meat on the bones of PIONER for it to feel unique, and the game’s combat, customization, and freedom mechanics are all top-notch.</p>



<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re looking forward to PIONER being released.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced that it will publish an unannounced cooperative shooter in development at JJ Abrams' Bad Robot Games studio. The unannounced game is a "four-player, cooperative shooter" that's being directed by Left 4 Dead creator and designer Mike Booth, and it's set to launch on PlayStation 5 and PC sometime in the future.</p><p>JJ Abrams announced in 2018 that his film production company, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2018/06/07/jj-abrams-production-company-expands-to-bad-robot-games">Bad Robot, was expanding to create a video game studio called Bad Robot Games</a>. At the time, Bad Robot Games entered into a partnership with Chinese conglomerate Tencent for the venture, with Mortal Kombat publisher WB Games involved as a minority stakeholder, but it's unclear if those two companies are involved in this Booth-directed game.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're greatly impressed with the talent Bad Robot Games has assembled at their studio, and are thrilled to partner with them to help produce and publish their upcoming game," vice president and head of SIE 2P/3P Content Ventures and Strategic Initiatives Christian Svensson writes in a press release. "Their unique creative voice and passion for innovating across all forms of interactive entertainment perfectly aligns with SIE's mission to craft experiences that resonate deeply with players. We can't wait for gamers to step into the world they've been building."&nbsp;</p><p>Bad Robot Games is a division of Bad Robot, which is a movie production company behind the Mission: Impossible series, the Star Wars sequels, the 2010s Star Trek movies, and more. It is "a dedicated game studio working on new and existing transmedia franchises" and is fully remote.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you hope to see of Booth's cooperative shooter game?

			<p>Remember Bad Robot Games? The gaming studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/jj-abrams-tencent-bad-robot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded around seven and a half years ago</a> by Bad Robot's JJ Abrams, in partnership with Tencent. It was supposed to bring JJ Abrams' SPYJINX project, originally<a href="https://wccftech.com/jj-abrams-partners-chair-create-spyjinx-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> announced</a> a decade ago, to fruition. In April 2020, it seemed like <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-and-bad-robots-spyjinx-resurfaces-as-a-mobile-game-beta-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they were still working on it as a mobile game</a>, but the project was eventually quietly canceled.</p>



<p>Thankfully, that's not all Bad Robot Games was doing. In February 2021, former Left 4 Dead creator Michael S. (better known as Mike) Booth <a href="https://wccftech.com/bad-robot-games-is-working-on-an-awesome-coop-multiplayer-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that he had joined the team to create an outstanding cooperative multiplayer shooter game.</p>



<p>Today, Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2025/sie-partners-with-bad-robot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that it has signed on as a partner to produce and publish this title, which will be released for PC and PlayStation 5. Anna Sweet, CEO of Bad Robot Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Partnering with Sony Interactive Entertainment allows us to bring our new IP to life, with an expansive vision for this new universe. With the support of PlayStation, we hope to deliver a bold, innovative experience that is truly special for players. I could not be more excited that Mike Booth is at the creative helm, crafting a cooperative adventure that will lead to unforgettable moments with friends.</em></p>



<p>Christian Svensson, VP and Head of 2P/3P Content Ventures &amp; Strategic Initiatives at Sony Interactive Entertainment, added:</p>



<p><em>We’re greatly impressed with the talent Bad Robot Games has assembled at their studio, and are thrilled to partner with them to help produce and publish their upcoming game. Their unique creative voice and passion for innovating across all forms of interactive entertainment perfectly aligns with SIE’s mission to craft experiences that resonate deeply with players. We can’t wait for gamers to step into the world they’ve been building.</em></p>



<p>There are no further details, so the game's status is unclear. Still, Bad Robot Games has been working on it for a considerable amount of time, as outlined above. Hopefully, that means it won't be long until we can play it. </p>

			<p>This week's GeForce NOW Thursday reveals the full list of PC games being added to the cloud platform's library in December 2025. </p>



<p>One of these games is 2023's best-selling title by Avalanche Software, Hogwarts Legacy. Moreover, GeForce NOW users are finally getting access to the first Activision titles to be made available on Ubisoft+. As you might recall, part of the deal that unlocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-resctructures-activision-blizzard-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the sale of cloud gaming rights to Ubisoft</a>. Subscribers to Ubisoft+ Premium can now play games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy and the Spyro Reignited Trilogy on GFN, with more to be added later.</p>



<p>Today, NVIDIA kicks off the Half-Price Holiday sale. Premium GeForce NOW memberships are available now through December 50 (while supplies last) at 50% off for the first month for a limited time. Starting today, members can also link their Battle.net accounts directly to GFN for automatic single sign-on across all supported devices, making it easier to access Battle.net games via cloud.</p>

              <p><span>God, Nintendo can be an annoying company. Not 24 hours ago, I was writing about how it made </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-update-1-4-0-patch-notes-track-volume-2000650066"><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s music volume options a toggle</span></a><span> that only let you choose between “normal” and “louder,” and now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i></a> <span>is out today and has its own obnoxious music options for players to contend with. At least </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s nonsense came at no additional cost to you. </span><i><span>Metroid</span></i><span> has paywalled basic options and features behind $30 amiibo figures.</span></p> <p><span>One of the big additions to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>is an open-world hub space that Samus travels through on a super cool motorcycle. Unfortunately, this area is pretty lifeless, and you only really have the rattle and hum of Samus’ bike to accompany its desolate, isolating vibes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s some ambient music in the background, but it’s certainly not doing much to make these sections exciting. Some open-world games, like </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>, let you turn on a radio station while traveling to make driving segments more stimulating, but </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>has no such option…unless you buy the </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>Samus amiibo.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let me get this straight: If you pay $29.99 for the collectible Samus amiibo in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MetroidPrime4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MetroidPrime4</a>  you get to play/select music while driving the Vi-O-La bike in the otherwise quiet desert… In other words: They locked MUSIC while riding through a desert behind a $30 paywall… Am… <a href="https://t.co/qmFRbvdNhR">https://t.co/qmFRbvdNhR</a></p> <p>— Luke Stephens (@LukeStephens) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeStephens/status/1996340617497227440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The figure allows you to change the music while riding your motorcycle, and paywalling such a basic feature would be maddening if it weren’t also one of the most Nintendo-ass decisions the company could have made.

 <p><span>Amiibo figures, small figurines of characters that unlock things when you tap them on a Nintendo game system were first introduced in 2014 for the Wii U and 3DS, and have always come with bonus in-game rewards that were, often items or cosmetics.

That one won’t let you change the music; instead, it will let you change the motorcycle’s color and see how much you’ve traveled on your chopper. Good thing these things look pretty on a shelf. I’m trying to imagine what would happen if any other company charged $30 for baseline functionality. It probably wouldn’t go well!</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bad-robot-games-sony-four-player-shooter-left-4-dead/</link>
            <guid>1372864</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed the imminent arrival of a new four-player, cooperative shooter from Bad Robot Games, the gaming division of JJ Abrams’ Bad Robot. The title is being directed by Mike Booth, best known for leading the charge on Left 4 Dead, one of the best games in the genre and a cult classic.</p>



<p>The game was revealed as being in development for PlayStation 5 and PC, and while details are scarce at present, more will be revealed soon.</p>







<h2 id="h-mike-booth-is-back-in-the-studio-and-cooking">Mike Booth is Back in the Studio and Cooking</h2>



<p>In September, we covered the news that Mike Booth, the creator and designer of Left 4 Dead, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/left-4-dead-coded-shooter-coming-from-game-creator/">was developing a new shooter</a> ‘built on the foundations of what made L4D special.’</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed a partnership with Bad Robot Games that will serve as the creative pathway for that game to come to life.</p>



<p>On Reddit, Booth wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m Mike Booth (creator of Left 4 Dead), and I’m excited to share that I’m working on a brand new project —a 4-player co-op shooter built on the foundations of what made L4D special.</p>



<p>If you enjoyed the teamwork, tension, and replayability of my past games, you’ll probably find this one interesting. It expands on the co-op formula in ways I’ve wanted to explore for a long time.</p>



<p>We’re still in the early stages of development, but we’re opening up playtests to a limited number of players. If you’re interested in joining us on this next adventure and helping shape the game early on, we’d love to have you involved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2025/sie-partners-with-bad-robot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new press release</a> on the Sony Interactive site, it was explained by Anna Sweet, CEO of Bad Robot Games:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Partnering with Sony Interactive Entertainment allows us to bring our new IP to life, with an expansive vision for this new universe.</p>



<p>With the support of PlayStation, we hope to deliver a bold, innovative experience that is truly special for players. I could not be more excited that Mike Booth is at the creative helm, crafting a cooperative adventure that will lead to unforgettable moments with friends.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 remain two of the most beloved zombie shooters ever released. They’re still popular today and are being kept alive by an extensive modding community that never ceases to innovate and optimise the game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/banjo-kazooie-mumbomania-is-a-playstation-only-game-playable-in-dreams/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Moon Studios’ William Butkevicius has used their free time productively to create a whole new Banjo-Kazooie game for PlayStation owners on PS4 and PS5. It comes with a couple of minor caveats: It’s not an official Banjo-Kazooie game, and you need to own a copy of Dreams.</p>



<p>It boggles the mind that there hasn’t been a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/banjo-kazooie-co-creator-gregg-mayles-resigning-rare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banjo-Kazooie</a> game in nearly 20 years. 2008’s Nuts &amp; Bolts remains the final BK game to see the light of day, and if you’ve got a hankering for a new release, a talented developer might have you jumping around the room.</p>







<h2 id="h-a-new-banjo-kazooie-game-on-playstation-sort-of">A New Banjo-Kazooie Game On PlayStation, Sort Of</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It looks like the real thing. Credit to Eupholace</figcaption></figure>



<p>William Butkevicius is a level designer at Moon Studios. They’ve been working on No Rest for the Wicked, but their spare time has involved a lot of ‘Dreams,’ it seems.</p>







<p>The PlayStation-exclusive title is considered one of the most sophisticated content generation games in the world, and the freedom and control you have to create your own levels and games in Dreams is nearly endless.</p>



<p>Butkevicius posted to X on December 3 with a fun message: “Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania is out NOW on Dreams for PS4/PS5!”</p>



<p>If you need convincing, there’s even a 1-minute and 43-second trailer showing off the game. It does indeed look like a deep Banjo-Kazooie game, and it looks terrific by every metric!</p>



<p>The way Banjo looks, the movement and mechanics, all the way down to the music—performed by <a href="https://x.com/thegamebrass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@thegamebrass</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Again, this is only for PlayStation owners, and you need to have a working copy of Dreams to play it. If you meet this criteria, this might be the closest you’ll ever get to a new Banjo-Kazooie title.</p>



<p>Is it about time the series makes a triumphant comeback? Would it be amazing to see Rare back at the helm?

<p>Roblox is now banned in Russia as it has been accused of distributing extremist materials and “LGBT propaganda”. </p>



<p>The popular gaming platform, Roblox, has been in the news recently for its age-estimation features, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-age-estimation-feature-users-concerned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some users concerned</a> about the requirement for children to upload photos of themselves to its AI tool. Now, Roblox is in the news again, for being banned in a country, accused of distributing extremist materials. </p>







<h2 id="h-roblox-negatively-impacts-the-spiritual-and-moral-development-of-children">Roblox Negatively Impacts the “Spiritual and Moral Development of Children”</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> report (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-banned-russia-lgbtq-propaganda-child-safety-measures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), access to Roblox has been blocked in Russia, with the country’s communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, stating that the platform was “rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children.” Russia is not the only country to block access to Roblox; Turkey also banned the title earlier last year over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-gets-banned-in-turkey-over-concerns-of-child-exploitation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concerns of child exploitation</a>. </p>



<p>A Roblox spokesperson’s response is also included in the report. The spokesperson states that they “respect the local laws and regulations in countries” where Roblox operates, and they believe the platform provides “a positive space for learning, creation, and meaningful connection for everyone.” They added that the platform has “a deep commitment to safety, and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform.”</p>







<p>In other news, there was a ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-roblox-shutting-down-roblox-ban-2025-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hoax campaign</a>‘ on social media and content platforms earlier this year claiming that Roblox would shut down in 2025.

The city of Wizarest has been cut off from the outside world for over a century, with its people living in isolation, stripped of their memories and surrounded by labyrinthine dungeons crawling with monsters. Claus discovers that his mentor and adoptive mother, the prodigal mage and alchemist, Giselle, has been missing since she went into the dungeons last month, and he vows to uncover the mystery behind her disappearance.</p><p>The citizens have been trying to navigate the dungeons for years but to no avail, and a century later, no exit has been found. It’s up to you, and the three artificial magical beings left to you by your mentor, Giselle, to explore the perilous dungeons, uncover the secrets behind the town’s and your own memory loss, and confront the force responsible for the world’s decay. Your friendly homunculus companions are able to absorb the souls of defeated monsters and evolve through “Anima Fusion”, allowing you to tailor your companions, changing their stats, abilities and appearance. Every decision you make throughout your adventure will affect your relationship with your companions, influence the storyline, and affect the outcome of the world’s fate, so choose your steps wisely!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
