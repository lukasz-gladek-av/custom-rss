			<p>Today, Eclipse Glow Games has shared an extended gameplay video of its exciting newly announced action/adventure game Tides of Annihilation. The video, published on IGN's YouTube channel, is embedded below. In the footage, we get to see a bit of exploration, some standard fighting, and a boss fight against the game's version of Mordred Pendragon.</p>
<p>It's clearly a work-in-progress build, but it shows a lot of promise, confirming what we already saw at Gamescom 2024 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-is-a-stunning-action-adventure-game-set-in-a-fantasy-london-inspired-by-arthurian-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported in this article</a>.</p>
<p>In the game, players will explore an alternate version of London that lies in ruins, following a surprise invasion from another realm. They'll step into this world as Gwendolyn, supposedly the city's last surviving inhabitant, as she navigates otherworldly foes and gains awesome powers of her own.</p>
<p>Throughout Tides of Annihilation, Gwendolyn will be able to summon over ten legendary knights (picking two at a time). They were inspired by Arthurian myths, bringing unique skills and abilities that will allow players to craft their own fighting playstyles and combos. Such powers will be needed to face the gigantic knights that now roam ruined London. Players will get not only to fight them but also scale them, as they are practically levels of their own.</p>
<p>In this game, London isn't just devastated, it's also transformed. But there's also the fantasy realm of Avalon, where the supernatural is even more prevalent between ancient magic and legendary creatures. Throughout the journey, Gwendolyn will have to save her family, the city, and even reality itself.</p>

<p>The game is in development for PC and consoles with Unreal Engine 5, and the studio has already confirmed PS5 Pro support with ray tracing and 60FPS mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-patch-fixes-bugs-and-overhauls/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>GSC has published the 1.2 patch for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, releasing more than 1,700 bug fixes across all platforms. In a post accompanying the release, it was revealed that ‘all aspects of the game’ have been addressed, from AI and UI to weapon balancing and open-world exploration mechanics.</p>



<p>It’s one heck of a list, but that has become par for the course for GSC, which has worked tirelessly to optimise STALKER 2 since the game was released in December 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-major-update-1-2">Major Update 1.2</h2>



<p>One of the major areas addressed by GSC Game World in the 1.2 patch for STALKER 2 is the game’s AI engine and mechanics.</p>



<p>This update has swept the ‘A-Life’ ecosystem, with upgrades being applied to the accuracy, stealth, behaviour, and interactions of NPCs throughout The Zone. The team has also provided extended fixes and tweaks to the many mutants that roam this open-world title.</p>



<p>Many performance-based changes have been applied in the STALKER 2 1.2 patch, too. GSC has repaired some sequences that were causing FPS drops, and a major memory leak issue has been sorted out.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en/news/patch-1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full list of improvements</a> is nuts – GSC has considered every little detail in this major patch. For instance, the team has looked at everything from visual glitches occurring when NPCs <strong>smoke</strong> to the visual clarity of PDA models in low-light areas. The granularity is insane.</p>



<p>Hundreds of fixes have been applied to the full suite of missions – both major and minor – that players explore as they traverse the story of Heart of Chornobyl. In December, I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">gave STALKER 2 a glowing review</a> despite there being a few issues that surfaced in some of the missions I uncovered.</p>



<p>Patch 1.2 was more about fixes than it was about <strong>additions</strong>, so don’t expect there to be too many new things to uncover the next time you log into the game. GSC added some extra controller features, and there’s a new ‘night music theme’ that’ll play when you explore Zalissya. Plus, some new notes have been scattered around the open world, but that’s about it.</p>

From the “Yellow Turban Rebellion” to the climax of the “Battle of Chibi,” the story will transport players to the heart of an ancient China in turmoil. Through the eyes of a nameless hero, players will have to fight fiercely and make choices to restore peace, shape history to their own experience, battle enormous enemy armies, whilst navigating the chaos of the Three Kingdoms era.</p><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> delivers an overwhelming sense of realism on every battlefield, with the largest number of soldiers in the series’ history to date. Enemy soldiers attacking <a title="Genres > Co-Op [234 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a>ly are a formidable threat, and players will not only fight with their own skills but also charge forward with their allies into massive enemy armies, allowing for a sense of realism on the battlefield of unprecedented scale where thousands of soldiers will collide.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The protagonist of this title takes to the battlefield alongside the heroes of the Three Kingdoms, wiping out swarms of enemies with swords, fists and various other weapons. Travelling across the world map as they embark on their epic journey, players can suppress rebellions or choose to rescue government forces during “Missions,” overcome “Skirmishes,” and visit various locations where they will be able to buy weapons. Throughout their quest, players will also encounter a variety of characters familiar to the <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> franchise such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei. Depending on the bond forged, these characters can become travelling companions, or an enemy as players dive into the most aggressive 1 vs. 1,000 combat in series history!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Team Asobi's Astro Bot has dominated DICE Awards 2025 with five award wins:&nbsp;Outstanding Achievement in Animation, Outstanding Technical Achievement, Family Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Game Design, as well as the most coveted one, Game Of The Year.</p>
<p>It's another big victory for the platform game, which had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received the Game of the Year prize at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards</a> ceremony in December and <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-sweeps-at-new-york-game-awards-ceremony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the New York Game Awards</a> last month. So far, when taking in most outlets and organizations, Astro Bot has put itself far ahead of any other game released in 2024 when it comes to GOTY awards. <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-24-best-games-of-2024-and-most-anticipated-of-2025-from-staff-and-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here on Wccftech</a>, though, it only won the genre-specific award, whereas the overall Game of the Year went elsewhere.</p>
<p>On another note, the developers have just started releasing free new Astro Bot content. The Tick-Tock Shock level is already out, while four more levels will be rolled out according to the following schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feb 20: Thrust or Bust</li>
<li>Feb 27: Cock-A-Doodle-Doom</li>
<li>Mar 6: Hard to Bear</li>
<li>Mar 13: Armored Hardcore</li>
</ul>
<p>Team Asobi also confirmed that a PS5 Pro update for Astro Bot is on the way, allowing players to enjoy the game at 4K@60 frames per second.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the DICE Awards 2025 winners, Helldivers 2 won four prizes: Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition, Outstanding Achievement in Audio Design, Action Game of the Year, and Online Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which our staff voted as Wccftech's Game of the Year, won in the Outstanding Achievement in Character, Outstanding Achievement in Story, and Adventure Game of the Year categories.</p>
<p>Balatro developer LocalThunk also won three awards: Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement for an Independent Game, and Mobile Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong prevailed in the Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction category, while Metaphor: Refantazio won RPG of the Year.</p>
<p>For the individual award, Don Jones received the Lifetime Achievement Award, while former Insomniac founder and CEO Ted Price (who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/resistance-4-was-unsuccessfully-pitched-to-sony-a-while-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the cancellation of a Resistance 4 project) was officially inducted into the Hall of Fame.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/big-plans-for-rainbow-six-ubisoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rainbow Six Siege was released in 2015 and has been a stalwart figure in the first-person shooter space ever since. It’s a flagship title for Ubisoft, a live-service title with millions of fans and a booming esports ecosystem. It’s arguably one of the best games in the space that has proven time and again that it has the staying power to weather the ebbing and flowing of the wider industry.</p>



<p>This weekend, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-esports-eliminated-six-invitational-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Six Invitational</a>, a massive $3 million esports event, wraps up in Boston, Massachusetts. It’s expected that Ubisoft will make a grand reveal on the final day of the event – February 16 – outlining the future of Rainbow Six Siege.</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s Yves Guillemot has also alluded to big things being in store for the tactical shooter.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-consistency">Consistency</h2>



<p>Ubisoft might have struggled with other franchises in recent years, but Rainbow Six is going strong, thanks to Siege. This decade-old tactical shooter has solid player numbers and a pipeline of content updates that show no signs of ending.</p>



<p>I caught up with Ubisoft’s representatives a while back and it was suggested that the company has plans to carry Rainbow Six Siege to <strong>100 Operators </strong>in total before stopping. At the time of publishing, there are 74 Operators, and more are being added all the time.</p>



<p>Despite that note, people have claimed recently that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-2-reveal-si-2025-rumour/">Rainbow Six Siege 2</a> is on the horizon, but I feel that’s unlikely.</p>



<p>During a recent financial update, Ubisoft’s CEO, Yves Guillemot, touched on the future of Rainbow Six, suggesting that something mighty is in store for the franchise:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As you know, we are preparing a big launch for Assassin’s Creed Shadows in the short term. Next year, <strong>we’ll have big plans that will benefit Rainbow Six across all platforms, </strong>that’s focusing well, and that’s a key milestone in the gross plan for the company.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ubisoft has invested extensive time, effort, and money in Rainbow Six Siege. It’s not only a staple of the esports industry, but one of the most consistent shooters in the wider gaming market. It’s available on multiple platforms, has crossplay mechanics, stacks of maps, modes, and weapons, and it’s getting better with time.</p>



<p>Love it or hate it, Rainbow Six Siege is around for the long(er) haul, and more is coming.</p>

<p>Eclipse Glow Games has released an 11-minute gameplay walkthrough for Tides of Annihilation, which was unveiled this week at the State of Play showcase. Tides of Annihilation has been dubbed ‘Stellar Blade meets Elden Ring’, mostly by <strong>me</strong>. I was looped into the development of Tides of Annihilation last year and loved what I saw, and now it’s out there for everyone to admire.</p>



<p>It doesn’t have a release date, but when it drops, Tides of Annihilation will be available on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC platforms. </p>



<p>Check out the full gameplay walkthrough below.</p>

<h2 id="h-world-bending-battles">World-Bending Battles</h2>



<p>Tides of Annihilation is an innovative and impressive game that has a relatively unique story. It tells the tale of Gwendolyn, one of the last survivors of humanity and a warrior battling to push back dark, otherworldly forces. To do this, she’ll lean on the spectral powers of ancient knights of Arthurian mythology, fighting alongside them in clashes with immense bosses.</p>



<p>It’s set in an apocalyptic rendition of London, and all the landmarks are front and centre for all to see. In that respect, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-annihilation-revealed-by-eclipse-glow-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s quite like Stellar Blade</a>, and the female protagonist with her undeniable sword-based skills adds further credence to that comparison.</p>



<p>Here’s the 11-minute gameplay walkthrough from Tides of Annihilation:</p>

<p>Tides of Annihilation promises to be a challenging game, but when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-annihilation-interview-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I interviewed the developer</a>, I learned that there will be accessibility considerations made for gamers who want an easier experience. I also learned that there will be extensive customisation opportunities in the game, with players tweaking Gwendolyn’s hair, makeup, outfits, and skill loadouts.</p>

Delivering a total of 150W of power, it’s an absolute workhorse so it’ll have no trouble juicing up a power-hungry iPad or MacBook and your iPhone at the same time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with two or three devices plugged into this wall charger, an iPhone should still hit max charging speeds when connected to the charger’s USB-C port.

Since Apple invented MagSafe for a stronger, more reliable connection between a wireless charger to an iPhone 12 or later, the company's latest generation of MagSafe Charger is the best, most effective option for the iPhone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The MagSafe Charger features a sleek, slim hockey-puck design with a strong magnet that aligns with the back of the iPhone for charging. The powerful connection between the two devices means there shouldn’t be any problem when picking up the phone to answer calls or checking socials while charging. The durable, high-quality materials used in its build mean the charger can handle some wear and tear too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike other wireless chargers, which are often limited to 7.5W speeds when charging an iPhone, the Apple MagSafe Charger can reach up to 25W with a 30W or 35W USB-C power adapter. Unfortunately, that wall charger will need to be purchased separately. Still, this option offers excellent value, as it features Qi2 and Qi support – any device that has Qi charging can juice up wirelessly. </p></div><p id="best-battery-pack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best battery pack" id="magsafebatterypack">7.

Skip the hassle of cable management by grabbing the Anker MagGo Power Bank instead. Similar to the Apple MagSafe Charger, this battery pack is MagSafe-compatible for a secure, stable connection to the back of your phone. Just be prepared for it to add some bulk to your device. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a 10,000mAh capacity, the Anker MagGo Power Bank can juice up your iPhone about 1.5 times before needing to be recharged itself. Thanks to the MagSafe compatibility, iPhone charging speeds hit up to 15W. If faster charging is necessary, the battery pack can also connect to an iPhone via USB-C instead, delivering up to a 27W output.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what makes the MagGo Power Bank even more of a standout is the tiny smart display on its side. The TFT screen provides handy info on battery levels and charging times, and a little kickstand holds up your phone for easy viewing when charging. Not to mention the fun color options this battery pack comes in.  </p></div><p id="best-charging-cable"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best charging cable" id="ankerusbc">8.

For a cable-powered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-portable-charger"><u>portable charger</u></a>, the Mophie Powerstation Plus, remedies this problem. With it comes a 10,000mAh battery for an over a full extra charge to your phone. But what makes this power bank a real standout is the inclusion of built-in, durable USB-C and Lightning cables that tuck away neatly when not in use. It’s perfect for those constantly losing and tangling wires. Beyond those cables, an additional USB-C port is provided to juice up a third device. However, to enjoy up to 30W charging speeds from the USB-C or 20W from the Lightning cable, only one device can be charged at a time. That’s plenty of power for an iPhone or iPad. Just don’t expect to charge a MacBook. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the Mophie Powerstation Plus will be spending lots of time getting tossed in bags and pockets to take on the go, the solid aluminum frame and compact build are ideal. Four tiny indicator lights on the side of the power bank also let you know when it’s time for the battery itself to get juiced up. </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Razer Kishi Ultra – Photos</h3></div></output></p></div><p id="best-controller"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best controller" id="backboneone">10.

That’s coupled with higher-tier games coming to iOS like Assassin’s Creed Mirage and Resident Evil.

It connects directly to iPhone 16 and 15 models via USB-C for zero latency when you play, while the controller stretches, flanking the screen for a comfortable grip. On it comes full-size analog sticks, an 8-way D-pad, and hall-effect triggers. But the star of the show is the ultra-responsive and clicky Mecha-Tactile buttons. L4 and R4 buttons are also ready for some macro inputs. It's a major upgrade from just tapping away at the screen, and you can even use this controller away from your phone by connecting to a PC or iPad via USB-C. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Razer Nexus app makes it simple to tinker with the different buttons and controls. You can remap buttons, adjust dead zones, swap RGB lighting, and more. Unfortunately, using the Kishi Ultra with iOS is slightly more limited than with Android, so Sensa HD Haptics and Virtual Controller Mode aren’t available. Still, Razer makes it simple to access Apple Arcade, Steam Link, Xbox Game Pass, and PlayStation Remote Play, so you can get gaming quickly on your iPhone. </p></div><p id="best-portable-bluetooth-speaker"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best portable Bluetooth speaker" id="bosesoundflex">11.

On February 28th, AMD will get its chance to intercept with the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612375/amd-will-reveal-radeon-rx-9000-gpus-february-28th">in a streaming event it just announced today</a>. But Nvidia has now made its own wiggle room, delaying the launch of the RTX 5070 from February to March 5th, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F50-series%2Frtx-5070-family%2F" rel="sponsored">its product page reveals today</a>.</p><p>Nvidia will ship its $749 RTX 5070 Ti ahead of AMD’s event, though, on February 20th, a week from today.</p><p>AMD has telegraphed that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240173/amd-udna-gpu-ai-gaming-rdna-cdna-jack-huynh">won’t be competing</a> with Nvidia’s latest and greatest cards, so price is the one big lever that AMD can potentially pull in order to compete. (The AMD Radeon 9070 cards <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336246/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-rdna-4-fsr-4-ces-2025#:~:text=in%20a%20branding%20slide%20for%20RDNA%204%2C%20AMD%20appears%20to%20suggest%20the%209070%20series%20will%20offer%20similar%20performance%20to%20the%20Nvidia%20GeForce%20RTX%204070%20Ti%20and%20RTX%204070%20Super.">appeared to be targeting</a> Nvidia 4070 Ti and 4070 Super levels of performance, not necessarily higher.) But Nvidia, a company that can now make <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301811/nvidia-just-made-nearly-20-billion-in-pure-profit-in-a-single-quarter">$20 billion in pure profit in a single quarter</a>, could theoretically counter that if it feels it needs to, and now has more room to do so.</p><p>All that said, <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-reportedly-working-on-gaming-radeon-rx-9000-gpu-with-32gb-memory">there is a rumor</a> that AMD may be working on a more potent card than its already-announced RX 9070 and 9070 XT, one with 32GB of RAM. AMD gaming marketing boss <a href="https://x.com/AzorFrank/status/1890123828367601764">Frank Azor says</a> the 9070 XT won’t be a 32GB card, but did not address the larger rumor.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Stalker 2's much-anticipated 1.2 patch is here, and it continues where the last few 1.1 updates left off--and then some. According to its announcement on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/579378232238800945" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Stalker's 1.2 patch has more than 1,700 individual fixes and improvements, including a large number of bug fixes, NPC behavioral changes, revamped visuals, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">There are truly too many changes to go over here in detail, but some of the major ones include an overhaul to NPC shooting accuracy, with reduced wall penetration and better shot randomization. The update also revamps how the game's stealth works, gives some enemies (like the Controller) new abilities, and improves NPC behavior overall. It improves performance during certain sequences, and fixes dozens of major and minor issues that could affect main story and side quests. More than 450 improvements were made to the game's map and level design, including several sections where the player could get stuck, such as X-17 Lab.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 was generally praised for its atmosphere and unique presentation when it first released last year. However, many players and critics noted its many bugs. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review-in-the-zone/1900-6418320/">Stalker 2 review</a>, critic Richard Wakeling listed its "torrent of technical problems," but said that it's "difficult to not to fall under its enticing spell." With the introduction of this most recent patch and its predecessors, hopefully most of those bugs are a thing of the past. Stalker 2 is also available on Xbox Series X|S.</p>

Millions of Helldivers died liberating the autumnal planet from Terminid control beginning with  Operation Valiant Enclosure. Players only ever lost one battle there. But this week, it proved to be all for naught when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyCgEeXRZ5I&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyCgEeXRZ5I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Helldivers</em> dungeon master Joel</a></span> decided to make it the first pawn to fall in a much more sinister game.</p><p>But it’s not the first time a planet was destroyed in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Meridian was the first to fall, and not at the hands of outside forces. It was players who destroyed that planet last year by turning it into a black hole as a means toward eradicating a mutated Terminid Super Colony of their own unintentional making. It was the first example of Arrowhead Game Studios fundamentally altering its in-game cosmos in service of its grim military storytelling. And it’s not clear it was part of a grander plan. </p><p>Last weekend, players were given the Major Order to go contest the Illuminate’s control of the black hole, lest the aliens fuel it with dark energy for unknown purposes. “The Illuminate are now actively moving Meridia,” an in-game message informed players on February 8. “The Center of Science on Fenrir III can confirm: Meridia is in motion. The Dark Energy that the illuminate muster through their many invasions appears to be key. The Helldivers is [sic] now called upon to limit the Illuminate accumulation of this Dark Energy.”</p><p>It’s unclear how the black hole can be stopped but things will get very, very bad if it’s not. The anomaly is now on a collision course for Super Earth, with five other planets in the way. Plus, the more dark energy it accrues, the faster it moves. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ii9dlw/dark_energy_accumulation/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ii9dlw/dark_energy_accumulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Players had been tracking</a></span> it via in-game tools over the past week. How many more planets will fall before the Illuminate’s plan can be unraveled and halted? Or is Arrowhead planning to celebrate <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s one-year anniversary with a Super Earth showdown players have been waiting for?</p><p>Either way, it’s a testament to the game’s one-of-a-kind evolving online world that it feels like it’s building toward something despite all of the repetition and incremental progress. Players of the original <em>Helldivers</em> have won the Galactic War multiple times at this point, with each victory clearing the board ahead of a new campaign. I’m excited to see what Arrowhead’s long-term plans are with this sequel. It feels like <em>Helldivers 2</em> has room to continuing evolving, both mechanically and narratively, for years to come. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Josef Fares, the director of It Takes Two and the upcoming Split Fiction, said that Hazelight Studios will never make a live-service game.</p><p>"We will not have them, I do not believe in them," Fares said in an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-will-never-convince-us-to-make-a-live-service-game-it-takes-two-developer-says-after-suggestion-biowares-dragon-age-the-veilguard-should-have-been" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "I think [live service] is not the right way to go. I hope more and more [developers] focus on their passion and what they believe in."</p><p>Fares explained that he understands the financial pressures of having to make live-service games, but emphasized the need to not lose all focus on creativity. He believes that there should be a balance between the financial and creative aspects, as developers can't just ask for $100 million in funding and do whatever they want.</p><p><span>He pointed to the success Hazelight has seen as evidence that "trust[ing] in your vision" can still lead to a "big audience." Last year, Hazelight revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-takes-two-crosses-20-million-copies-sold-developer-teases-title-of-next-game/1100-6527240/" data-ref-id="1100-6527240">It Takes Two had surpassed 20 million copies sold</a>.</span></p><p><span>Other studios have recently followed the live-service trend to varying success. PlayStation started its </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-planning-to-invest-heavily-into-live-service-games-with-bungie-buyout/1100-6500131/" data-ref-id="1100-6500131">live-service initiative</a><span> several years ago. While </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">Helldivers 2 exceeded expectations</a><span>, games like </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-now-being-removed-from-psn-accounts/1100-6526385/" data-ref-id="1100-6526385">Concord failed to take off</a><span> and several games have been canceled, including </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer</a><span> game and reportedly a </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">God of War live-service one</a><span>.</span></p><p>Bungie veteran Joe Tung said that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-service-is-a-better-model-according-to-former-halo-and-destiny-developer/1100-6524513/" data-ref-id="1100-6524513">live-service model is better</a> than the traditional $60 box approach, as it helps developers consider what's best for players in the long-term. In a recent earnings call, Ubisoft said that it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/1100-6529497/" data-ref-id="1100-6529497">double down on both live-service games and open-world action adventure titles</a>.</p><p>Fares also recently discussed his thoughts about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-takes-two-and-split-fiction-director-shares-his-thoughts-on-ai/1100-6529493/" data-ref-id="1100-6529493">AI and its effects on the video game industry</a>, saying that it needs to learn how to work with AI and other emerging technologies.</p><p>Hazelight's previous game, It Takes Two, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2021-winners-revealed-it-takes-two-wins-game-of-the-year/1100-6498845/" data-ref-id="1100-6498845">won Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2021</a>. The studio's next game, Split Fiction, launches on March 6 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Like Hazelight's past projects, Split Fiction is a co-op adventure game and it follows two women named Zoe and Mio as they traverse through both fantasy and sci-fi-themed levels in order to survive.</p>
