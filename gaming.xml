            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-lays-off-90-of-project-sigil-staff<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The future is uncertain for Wizards of the Coast's dedicated virtual tabletop platform. It has recently been announced that the tabletop company has laid off 90% of employees working on Project Sigil, their Unreal-powered VTT dedicated to playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The Project Sigil Lay-Offs</h2>

<p>Andy Collins made the Project Sigil layoffs public via a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andy-collins-912a953_today-approximately-30-talented-developers-activity-7307907059092443137-SFhR/" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn post</a>. The post stated that more than 30 employees, himself included, were laid off from the team. Those employees made up 90% of the team dedicated to Project Sigil. Collins expressed his disappointment but reiterated that there are still people working on the project.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/project-sigil-town-map.jpg?itok=sR497zHd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/project-sigil-town-map.jpg?itok=UF3Ui36F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A recent report from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons/542716/wizards-sigil-vtt-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Polygon</a> corroborated these layoffs. The post includes an email from Dan Rawson, Senior Vice President of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and Hasbro Direct.</p>

<p>The email states that they are scaling back their plans for Project Sigil. It was originally imagined as a large, standalone game with "a distinct monetization path." But since that was deemed untenable, they have scaled back the development team accordingly. Rawson also confirms that the laid off employees will be receiving severance packages, career placement services, and internal opportunities.</p>

<p>The silver lining for consumers is that Sigil will be sticking around as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Beyond</a> feature. All materials developed for the project will be available at no additional cost to users. This means if you want to make a virtual miniature or your own battlemap using Sigil's software, it is just another tool in your virtual toolbelt. Assuming you have a premium subscription to the platform, of course.</p>

<p>Collins is a long-time employee of Wizards of the Coast. He joined the company in 1996 as an editor and designer in their R&amp;D division. His accolades include the sci-fi setting of Alternity, the d20 <em>Star Wars</em> TTRPG, a <em>Sage Advice</em> author on <em>Dragon Magazine</em>, and the revision team on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 3.5 Edition.</p>

Some of them are of course associated with cost [...] but what I see is also, over the last 10 years, we haven't seen a lot of disruption in terms of format and gameplay," he says.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-prioritizing-ai-workflows-enhanced-performance-and-expanded-platform-support-in-2025" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity prioritizing AI workflows, enhanced performance, and expanded platform support in 2025</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"While nothing is guaranteed.

The hope is that a few of those experiences will have debuted by the end of 2025, providing subscribers—all of whom can access the company's game roster at no extra cost—with a taste of what's to come.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[We want to give people] new ways to play and new ways to experience stories, by trying to blur the lines between linear and interactive.

We like to say we're uncomfortably excited," says Shroff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The familiar might be a title that leans on a big recognizable properties like Squid Game or a deal that brings a huge franchise like Grand Theft Auto to Netflix Games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/niantic-says-pokemon-go-location-data-wont-be-given-to-saudi-arabia-government/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Pokémon Go , along with the rest of Niantic’s games business, is soon to be under new ownership after it was sold to Scopely for $3.5 Billion. Now, in a new interview, Niantic—soon to be Scopely—senior product directory Michael Steranka has addressed a number of concerns some players have about the game’s acquisition, including Pokémon Go player location data and who has access to it.</p>



<p>Steranka sat down for an hour-long interview with Pokémon Go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS3HawhQy78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTuber TrainerTips</a> to talk about why the game was sold, what will change, the idea of in-game pop-up adds, and, yes, player location data being shared with the Saudi Arabian government.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Scopely is owned by Savvy Games Group. Savvy is a video game investment company and developer that is backed by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund. With the game being sold, some have posted to various social media channels worried about data getting back to the foreign government. Steranka says that players don’t have to worry about it.</p>



<p>“That all stays in the US,” Sternaka said regarding player location data and scanned locations. “It never leaves the country. And it’s not something that ever gets shared up with Savvy or otherwise. In fact, Scopely itself is sort of wholly owned and operated independently as well. So, there’s enough layers of separation there that you can trust all of your data stays within the servers in the United States and also, like I mentioned, we actually scrub all that data and get rid of it after its no longer needed to run the game.”</p>



<p>The scrubbing of the data comes from a revelation earlier in the same interview. Steranka says that “contrary to popular belief”, the company doesn’t store any player data “beyond what’s needed to actually operate the game.”</p>



<p>He added that all of the data will remain “fully encrypted and protected” in the same ways it has since the game first launched in 2016.</p>



<p>The rest of the interview is highly recommended as Steranka talks about how the game will grow after the sale, the level of involvement of The Pokémon Company, Remote Raids, and more.</p>

            <p>
Cult classic 90s point-and-click horror adventure I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is - in a slightly unexpected turn of events - making the jump from PC to PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch next Thursday, 27th March, courtesy of Nightdive Studios.
</p>
<p>
As well-read sorts will no doubt immediately recognise, I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is based on author Harlan Ellison's influential post-apocalyptic short story of the same name. Its point-and-click adaptation - developed by Cyberdreams and The Dreamers Guild - released in 1996, building on the original narrative using an extensive outline penned by Ellison himself.
</p>
<p>
As in the short story, I Have No Mouth's game adaptation focuses on the last five human survivors of an apocalypse orchestrated by a sadistic AI - all kept alive and tortured by that same artificial intelligence (here voiced by Ellison) for over a century. It follows each character's final trial and the personalised psychological torments inflicted upon them by the computer, each unfolding over its own chapter and playable in any order.

<p>
With freedom perhaps now finally in reach for each captive if they can satisfy the murderous AI's whims, players must confront story shaping moral dilemmas as the trials unfolds. That's alongside the kind of disturbing, provocative horror themes that helped set the game apart from its point-and-click contemporaries back in 1996 - themes that saw I Have No Mouth garner strong critical acclaim on release, despite it ultimately proving to be a comemrcial flop. 
</p>
<p>
I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream's console release is built on remaster specialist Nightdive Studios' earlier PC version, itself well over a decade old at this point. "Over the last couple of years," the studio explains in its announcement, "we've seen a lot of love for the original game and Harlan Ellison's short story across social media platforms... It only felt right that we helped make this title more accessible and further preserve its legacy."
</p>
<p>
And if that appeals, I Have No Mouth will be available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch when it launches next Thursday, 27th March.

<p>In Forever Skies, players return to Earth as a scientist to discover what caused the loss of humanity’s home and what has changed. Earth has suffered an ecological disaster that forced humans to build massive towers to escape the problems of the surface, but that was not enough leading to an exodus from the planet. As the scientist you will pick through the ruins to find lost technology and repurpose it, as well as find ways to create food, and survive against Earth’s new inhabitants. Players will be living on airship that can be upgraded and customised, acting as the base of operations for the scientist.</p>
<p>You can get Forever Skies on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/">Steam in Early Access</a> now, and the game can be pre-ordered on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-pl/concept/10004499/">PlayStation store.</a></p>

		<p>Developer Twirlbound and Saber Interactive have confirmed a release date for the lighthearted action adventure The Knightling, with the date set as August 25th. The Knightling will be available for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch. The game’s story puts players in the shoes of The Knightling, a knight in training, whose mentor Sir Lionstone has disappeared.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Knightling – Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukI149d4r9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In The Knightling, players will be tasked with exploring the land of Clessia to find Sir Lionstone, armed with a magical shield to face all dangers. Clessia is a land filled with monsters and bandits that will do what they can to stop you, as well as a load of puzzles that will uncover long lost secrets of the world. All of this will hopefully lead you to find Sir Lionstone, and restore some order to the world.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/the-knightling-is-set-to-be-a-fantastical-shield-bearing-indie-hit/">The Knightling is set to be a fantastical shield-bearing indie hit</a></h2>
<p>In our The Knightling preview, Dom said, <em>“I love the look of The Knightling. It’s clear, it’s characterful and there’s just something adorable about the Knightling’s big eyes and the chunky world. The audio definitely helps with the atmosphere too, from the mumbled words everyone utters to the ebbs and peaks of the orchestral soundtrack. It creates a fantastical world with an economy of design that’s refreshing, but it’s nonetheless utterly beguiling, despite the simplicity. I am massively excited to play more of The Knightling – it’s light-hearted, action packed, and full of character, and a change in pace to the glossy Unreal Engine 5 open worlds elsewhere. This gorgeous landscape is also yours to explore, with&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/">a demo available on Steam right now</a>.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/a-grand-unified-theory-of-suits-and-suits-la/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>If you are remaking <em>Suits</em>, as <em>Suits LA </em>is attempting to do to increasingly poor results each week, the first question to answer is: which <em>Suits </em>are you remaking?&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of its run, <em>Suits </em>was many shows. That variety and capacity for reinvention helped it become an unexpectedly beloved streaming hit, but also contributed to an unevenness that likely kept it from becoming <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2013/07/suits-usa-network-season-three-review.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>a respected TV classic</u></a>. It was a romantic melodrama that never wanted its audience to fear for a second that its central couples would not end up together. It was a slightly grating buddy comedy, where every character was fluent in the movie and TV references from the bro canon. At its worst <em>Suits </em>was like being locked in a fraternity common room during pledge week. It was a silly law drama where corporate and criminal law work much like science and engineering in <em>Star Trek</em>: there was no legal position so dire where a problem could not be solved by a blue folder passed across a table followed by a character saying something like, “Does this mean what I think it does?”</p><p>At its peak, though, <em>Suits </em>was a show about ethics versus ambition, decency versus duty. These tensions were initially embodied by its main character, legal super-mind and fraudulent Harvard grad Mike Ross, and the mentors and foils that surrounded him at his high-powered corporate litigation firm. A poor college flameout who wanted to do good by serving the law, Mike’s idealism was juxtaposed with his mentor Harvey Specter’s ruthless devotion to victory and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZm7NIrmk5s&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">material reward</a>. Mike’s emotional streak was contrasted with Harvey’s mentor and Mike’s boss, Jessica Pearson, who always had to take a more detached view as the head of the firm. Finally, Mike’s poverty and lack of status was contrasted with his sometimes nemesis Louis Litt, whose fawning credentialism and vast insecurity drove his toxic ambition.&nbsp;</p><p>More interesting than those conflicts, however, was one the show never fully reckoned with. Before anything else, <em>Suits </em>was a show about loyalty. And loyalty, <em>Suits </em>demonstrated across nine seasons, is where corruption often begins.</p><p>It’s there from the start: Mike Ross’s life was derailed in part because he gave his loyalty to a bad friend. When Harvey invests in Mike despite the fact Mike never got a law degree, he becomes deeply loyal and attached to Mike, and that increasingly compromises not just him but everyone around him. Forced to choose between exposing Mike or protecting Harvey and the law firm they all work for, slowly every member of the cast becomes party to Mike and Harvey’s lie. By the middle of the show’s run, there were times when you could easily have made the case that everyone involved should be barred from practicing law and maybe half of them should go to jail, and yet <em>Suits </em>was always there making their mutual corruption look high-minded. Character are constantly pledging some version of, “If anyone wants to get to you, they’ll have to go through me, and I’m not backing down from a fight.” Which sounds awesome until you remember that everyone is basically guilty of even worse than what they’re being accused of, and ultimately they want to keep their really nice jobs and their growing personal fortunes.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Harvey Specter and Mike Ross in the first episode of Suits</span></figcaption></figure><p>For a while, <em>Suits </em>presents Mike as someone who is trying to use the law to do good, in contrast to Harvey’s combativeness on behalf of rich and frequently evil clients. But Patrick J. Adams plays Mike with a nasty, childish streak that never quite meshes with his appeals to morality and justice. At time the mask comes off completely, like when he meets a nurses’ union rep at his grandmother’s care facility. To explain why she’s threatening a strike, she shows Mike all the off-the-book extra care nurses give patients like Mike’s grandma… and Mike uses that info to get the nurses in legal jeopardy for breaking care protocols, forcing the union to accept the contract the hospital chain was offering. Unsurprisingly, some members of the audience <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/suits/comments/17grsks/i_really_hated_that_head_nurse/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>were on Mike and Harvey’s side here</u></a>, illustrating the degree to which <em>Suits </em>places its audience on the side of the rich and powerful.</p><p>What makes Mike tolerable as a character is that <em>Harvey</em> loves him, and via Harvey the show treats Mike as a difficult little brother and not a toxic autodidact. That judgment counts for a lot because as the show goes on, despite its original design, <em>Harvey </em>emerged as its moral center.</p><p>The world of <em>Suits </em>is mostly filled with lousy people serving lousy causes, and those people are the ones with the money that give you access to lives of comfort, luxury and excitement. Harvey is an unapologetic sell-out, but what’s compelling about him is watching him negotiate the terms of that sale. It includes his talent and energy as a legal mercenary, but it does not include his integrity or that of the people around him. When the latter move into conflict with the interests of a case or a client, Harvey turns on a dime. And in that framing, Harvey becomes relatable as the kind of boss, coworker, or person that many of us wish we had in our lives, or were ourselves. Someone who places the best parts of his character off-limits from work, from the judgment of others, and from his own ambition. It’s a seductive fantasy: that you can prosper in a fallen world working in service to the devil and yet keep him from your own shoulders.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Real Suitors see this and get excited.</span></figcaption></figure><p>It is not really a tenable moral position and this eventually doomed <em>Suits </em>to a stale formula of meaningless wars of office politics waged between the wealthy retainers of the growing oligarchy. Ultimately the contradiction was resolved with Mike’s exit from the show to go to Seattle to start a very different law practice than he and Harvey worked at. When it was time for <em>Suits </em>to end its run, Harvey and his intrepid secretary-turned-wife Donna left New York to join Mike and his wife, Rachel. They were all going to become wealthy Atticus Finches, just out of frame.</p><p>The show was well into anticlimax by that point, but before it tied everything up in marriage knots, it had produced at least one tremendous season of television and a few great ones. It managed that by asking what integrity meant in a setting where friendships, political alliances, professional obligations, and career goals were constantly reconfiguring themselves and exerting tension in new and interesting directions.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Suits LA</em>, after three episodes, is struggling mightily to recapture any of this. In many ways it feels like a continuation of where the show left off in its struggling final season, with a new cast going through the motions of <em>Suits </em>plotlines without any of the history or relationships stakes that made them interesting.</p>

Those games were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/UmCLtRhifgg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/UmCLtRhifgg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2D and level based</a></span>. <em>Zombieville USA 3D </em>is, as the name implies, in 3D and is much bigger, featuring a large cartoon town overrun with deadly zombies. You start with a single pistol and survive as long as you can while racking up cash. When you die, you return to a hub, have the chance to spend your money to buy permeant upgrades, and then return to the fray. </p><p>It’s a simple formula found in plenty of other roguelike games, and <em>Zombieville USA 3D</em> doesn’t really shake any of this up in a major way. Instead, the small team behind it have focused entirely on making a really, really good version of this kind of game with slick visuals and satisfying action. A big reason the combat feels so good is because of excellent feedback via energetic animations. Everything you do, from walking and running to shooting and hacking or smashing enemies to bits looks great thanks to a slick art style and snappy animations that have a nice bounce to them.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1hybgzc/comment/m6g1zxb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1hybgzc/comment/m6g1zxb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the game’s lead developer on Reddit</a></span>, who has mostly worked as a VFX artist and animator, the idea is that these “juicy” and “extra” visuals will help <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> stand out among all the other games on Steam. And, in my case at least, it worked. When I was scrolling through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-sale-deep-discounts-doom-undertale-spring-sale-pc-1851769776&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-sale-deep-discounts-doom-undertale-spring-sale-pc-1851769776">Steam’s Spring Sale</a></span>, I randomly spotted this game in the “Under $10” section and its art and animation immediately made me click to see more. A few hours later I had played a ton of <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> on both my PC and my Steam Deck.</p><p>On Steam Deck I recommend knocking the visual settings down to medium and locking the FPS to 60 to get more battery life and a very stable experience. Once I did that,<em> Zombieville 3D USA </em>played perfectly on Valve’s portable PC. On my desktop PC, though, <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> looks even better with raytracing and high-resolution options.</p><p>Regardless of how you play it, <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> is a fantastic little indie zombie shooter that even supports online co-op. It demonstrates that a successful game doesn’t have to be massive or completely reinvent the wheel. Sometimes, all you have to do is perfectly nail a simple gameplay loop and make sure your game looks cool as heck and you’ll end up with something special that catches people’s eyes. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801520/Zombieville_USA_3D/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801520/Zombieville_USA_3D/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> is currently available on Steam for $8</a></span>.

He’s the leader of the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE which is trying to save the world from the Shinra megacorporation that is destroying the planet. He’s also a no-nonsense activist known to give a rousing speech or two when the going gets tough. Unlike Sephiroth, he gets right to the heart of what he’s trying to say, doesn’t bloviate about why bad things are actually good, and speaks to real issues with the kinda gusto you need to change the world. If somebody speaks with clarity in favor of the common good, you can probably put it as a caption under Barret’s face and I would believe it to be a genuine screenshot from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a></span>.</p><figure id="" data-id="427b5f6e3181cb9dadd4e13a2ef62e45" data-recommend-id="image://427b5f6e3181cb9dadd4e13a2ef62e45" data-format="png" data-width="737" data-height="738" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Bluesky post that shows Barret with a speech bubble above a separate post that reads &quot;“I can’t believe they are damaging Elon musks private property”  Why can’t you believe this.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/19/wreckfest-2-early-access-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a> was a game that, for some reason, sailed past me like a detached tyre flying in slow motion in a spectacular crash in an action movie. I loved the idea, the crash-happy ethos behind it, but despite owning it on multiple platforms, I only ever dipped a toe in for one or two races. Thankfully time has given me another chance to experience this crash-happy racer with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2PCl64qnng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As it heads into Steam Early Access, Wreckfest 2 is a fairly limited package to start with. In a faint echo of the initial early access release of the first game, there’s four tracks – two race tracks, one oval and demolition derby arena, and a greybox test arena with big ramps and funky flippers – four cars, and support for both solo play and online multiplayer with up to 24 drivers. There’s no career, and just those core modes, but that’s more than enough to give a feel for what Wreckfest 2 offers…. which is more Wreckfest.</p>


<p>Dropping into a quick race is just plain old fun, once you get over that innate desire to actually win. With 24 cars crammed onto these circuits, bobbling and bouncing over bumps in the dirt tracks, the inherently loose suspension of the muscle cars imitations doing little to really help you in an off-road setting, contact is inevitable. Heck, it’s encouraged. Smash into the side, rear-end or T-bone another car and the game will pin a few points on your race suit as a reward.</p>


<p>You might think that’s a great way to get ahead – just use the other cars to help you brake! – but it’s a delicate balance. If another driver keeps their foot in as you nudge their rear corner, turning them off the racing line and forcing you to go with them. Not ideal. There’s plenty times in a race where a car will end up sideways, with an angry traffic jam of competitors all pushing them along, and the chaos is engineered with the way tracks loop back around and cross over themselves, with two-way traffic adding high speed peril. It’s easy to come off worse in contact, or just as disadvantages, that it makes it all the sweeter when you do manage to tap a rival just so and spin them out without losing momentum yourself.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you have the destruction derby mode, where the whole point is to crash into other cars, racking up points for high speed collisions and dealing damage to other cars with the aim of getting the final blow to empty their health bar. Every crash is a double-edged sword, though. Sure, you’ll dish out damage, but you’ll take it yourself, quickly wrecking your vehicle, slowing you down and making you vulnerable. Once you’re wiped out, you’ll spawn again with a fresh car and get to rampage some more until time runs out.</p>
<p>They’re the two bread and butter modes of Wreckfest, and they’re just as good here. Bugbear has built this within their new ROMU engine that enhances the demolition physics and dynamic simulation.</p>

		</div>

<p>There’s a point of comparison from original to sequel with the inclusion of the Savolax Sandpit track. More than a decade on from its first creation, Bugbear has been able to increase the fidelity a bunch, reprofiling the trackside quarry cliffs, putting far more trees in the densely wooded sidings, giving it a much hazier tone on a cloudy day, and with much better looking dust that’s kicked up as you race. It’s a nice uplift alongside the new Scrapyard track, which raced through a dusty scrapyard that’s filled with heaps of cars.</p>
<p>And then there’s the destruction, which just ups the nuance of what’s wrought upon the cars in the game. There’s still a leaning toward deformation before parts come off, and car suspensions are necessarily incredibly tough, just so that the cars keep on working after one or two prangs, but it really doesn’t take too much before the engine has been compressed to just be an office fan, while doors and bonnets flap about in the wind.</p>
<p>At this point in time, fans of the original are probably best served by actually continuing to play the original, but if you know that Wreckfest 2 will be a part of your racing game future and want to get in at the earliest possible point to see it develop, then the Steam Early Access release might just be for you. It is distinctly limited right now, little more than a demo or technical test, but there’s plenty for fans to look forward to in the months ahead.</p>

While some reports have indicated that Prime Minister Ishiba hit out at Ubisoft’s Feudal Japan-set game and its maker Ubisoft over concerns about its depictions of shrines, the truth is less controversial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN ran the question and answer via our colleagues at IGN Japan to get not only an accurate translation but some context that helps us understand what’s actually happening here. IGN has also asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For background, Ubisoft has apologized a number of times in the run up to Shadows’ much-delayed launch over aspects of the game and its marketing that upset some within Japan.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some expressed frustration with inaccuracies in the game's depiction of Feudal Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern"><u>leading the development team to issue an apology</u></a> and say the game is not intended to be a factual representation of history but instead "a compelling, historical fiction."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft also emphasised its collaboration with external consultants and historians, but "despite these sustained efforts, we acknowledge that some elements in our promotional materials have caused concern within the Japanese community," Ubisoft said. "For this, we sincerely apologize."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concern was also raised when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission"><u>the developer used a flag from a Japanese historical re-enactment group</u></a> in artwork for Assassin's Creed Shadows without permission.

Torii gates are found close to religious shrines all over Japan to indicate a boundary separating the human world and the sacred. The one-legged Torii gate has significant meaning of its own, however, as one can famously be found at the Sannō Shrine in Nagasaki, located 900 metres from the hypocenter of the World War 2 atomic bomb which killed upwards of 60,000 people.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With all this in mind, Ubisoft is launching Assassin’s Creed Shadows with a degree of controversy not only in Japan, but with some western fans concerned about its depiction of the country.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.webtv.sangiin.go.jp/webtv/detail.php?sid=8374" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assassin’s Creed Shadows question was asked by Japanese politician and member of the House of Councillors of Japan, Hiroyuki Kada</a>. Kada, who will campaign for re-election this summer, said:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I fear that allowing players to attack and destroy real-world locations in the game without permission could encourage similar behavior in real life. Shrine officials and local residents are also worried about this. Of course, freedom of expression must be respected, but acts that demean local cultures should be avoided.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Minister Ishiba responded:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How to address this legally is something we need to discuss with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Defacing a shrine is out of the question - it is an insult to the nation itself. When the Self-Defense Forces were deployed to Samawah, Iraq, we ensured they studied Islamic customs beforehand. Respecting the culture and religion of a country is fundamental, and we must make it clear that we will not simply accept acts that disregard them.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/19/gettyimages-2203514070-1742400968639.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Shigeru Ishiba, the Prime Minister of Japan, responded to a question about Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those are accurate translations of the exchange, but what’s the context surrounding them? Our colleagues at IGN Japan helped us understand the situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What needs to be understood here is that Japan has seen record numbers of overseas visitors in the wake of the country reopening its borders after the pandemic and the lure of the weak yen. In this government budget meeting the politician Hiroyuki Kada twinned his complaints against Shadows with the controversial subject of what he called “over tourism” and an attendant perceived rise in vandalism and graffiti in Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His argument is that if players are able to deface a temple or harm individuals with a katana in the game, they may be inspired to do it in real life when they visit Japan, similar to the age-old argument that Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto inspire copycat violence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba responded that if such actions were taken in real life, he would oppose them, but the “if” is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. His comments were aimed at theoretical real-life copycat actions rather than at the game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The shrine being defaced in Shadows gameplay videos online is Itatehyozu Shrine in Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, which is within Kada’s constituency. He said that he has consulted with representatives of the shrine who say that Ubisoft did not seek their permission to show the shrine and use its name in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Masaki Ogushi (Vice Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry) responded that government agencies will work together to handle matters “if the shrine seeks consultation,”, that again is a big if, and anyway, in a work of artistic expression Ubisoft would probably be clear legally to use the shrine anyway under the Constitution of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Responses from both ministers were vague at best and seem unlikely to result in any particular action, especially as Ubisoft appears to have addressed these concerns proactively with a day-one patch – showing they may be more sensitive to the feelings of Japanese citizens than Kada gave them credit for.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">News of this day-one patch emerged in Japan this morning, but has yet to be confirmed by Ubisoft’s western operation.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> creative director Johan Pilestedt has slammed the current spate of video games industry layoffs as "unnecessarily brutal" and said that companies needed to learn lessons to avoid the same painful cycle of "death and rebirth" in future. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking today at GDC 2025, in a session attended by Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Pilestedt put the blame for layoffs on the decisions made by company bosses that they should chase industry trends such as yet more battle royales, just because a big few have become successful. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Pilestedt continued, the video game industry needed to take more risks and simply make a wider variety of games to cater to the medium's ever-growing audience. That such widespread layoffs were happening despite more people playing games overall was "ridiculous", Pilestedt commented.
</p>
<p>
"The games industry is caught in a vicious circle of death and rebirth," he said. "Every so often we lay off thousands of people suddenly, and then nobody understands why, and I think it's just because we converge.
</p>
<p>
"We will always go through the cycles of death and rebirth, but now that cycle is unnecessarily brutal because we don't diversify enough. We need to make more types of games because people are playing more than ever and still we are unable to stay in business. It's ridiculous.
</p>
<blockquote>"People are playing more than ever and still we are unable to stay in business. It's ridiculous."</blockquote>
<p>
"If everybody stopped making battle royales and made [different] games we wouldn't be in this position."
</p>
<p>
While the majority of video game workers losing jobs were those on development teams, the people calling the shots on which projects were getting greenlit were the ones deciding to "play it safe" by following trends, Pilestedt continued.
</p>
<p>
"A lot of publishers - I'm sorry, my dear publisher friends - try to play it safe by taking safe bets," Pilestedt said. "But one thing that I can guarantee is that those safe bets are a death sentence for the studios that try to make it.
</p>
<p>
"We are in the business of taking risks, and if you don't take risks, we're never gonna be able to achieve success. Few people believed that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> would amount to anything,  and yet here we are."
</p>
<p>
Earlier in the same talk, Pilestedt shared his thoughts on game design, and said that "experiences need to be spiky" in order to stand out. 
</p>
<p>
"Game design is about experiences," Pilestedt noted. "If you balance out all the chaos, you make an uninteresting game. Balance is the polishing of an experience... but if you smoothen that out too much, it will just be bland."
</p>
<p>
Too many games were trying to please too many people, in other words, or make something too similar to something else that has come before. 
</p>
<p>
"You can't overtake if you stay in the same lane," Pilestedt continued, "making a game 10 percent better than something [that already exists].
</p>
<p>
"I love Escape From Tarkov, but if I were to make Escape from Tarkov that's a little bit [more] my preference, I would just be making Escape from Tarkov. And I would not be able to compete because people would rather play Escape from Tarkov than play <em>my</em> Escape from Tarkov.
</p>
<blockquote>"Unfortunately everybody was chasing after the battle royales."</blockquote>
<p>
"We have a convergence problem in the games industry. Minecraft is doing well. Battle royale is doing well. Live-service is the big next thing. All the developers move into the same position to compete for the same niche. 
</p>
<p>
"And what happens? Lots of unsatisfied players are saying, 'Well, what about my needs? I want to play some games and I have lots of money to spare.' Unfortunately everybody was chasing after the battle royales."
</p>
<p>
Concluding his session, Pilestedt challenged the games industry to "take more risks" in order to "avoid mass failures" from chasing trends.
</p>
<p>
"Make your games according to your studio's foundation and style," he said. "Don't copy others instead, think about what you wanna make and take a gamble on it."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-creative-director-takes-sabbatical-promises-to-start-arrowheads-next-game-on-return">Pilestedt announced he would be taking a sabbatical after working for 11 years on the Helldivers series</a>, but would start developer Arrowhead's next game on his return. The sci-fi shooter has been a huge success for publisher PlayStation, with more 12m copies sold in three months and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">Helldivers movie now on the way</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/crosswind-is-an-upcoming-f2p-pirate-survival-mmo-in-development-for-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, developer Crosswind Crew has announced an eponymous free-to-play pirate survival MMO game in development for PC. Just like you'd expect, Crosswind is set in the year '17XX', right in the middle of the Golden Age of Piracy. It is in this setting that players will take the role of a freelance captain who has just been betrayed and is stranded after a job gone wrong. The game starts as a relatively familiar tale of survival and revenge but eventually expands into a larger conflict with empires, pirate clans, and even mysterious dark forces. Driven by real-life characters and supernatural forces alike, the story unfolds in an epic battle against an unspoken ancient evil.</p>
<p>The game reportedly offers a comprehensive survival experience. Players will explore vibrant, diverse biomes to gather resources and then unleash creativity in building and crafting, turning their initial shelter into a fully functioning outpost. It's also possible to recruit and expand the crew to speed up harvesting and production. The combat features a vast arsenal of melee weapons and firearms, allowing players to&nbsp;parry and dodge enemy attacks and use a variety of strikes to succeed.</p>
<p>Of course, being a game about the Golden Age of Piracy, the adventures in Crosswind take place on land as well as on sea. From their ship, players may bombard coastal forts from afar, close in, and engage the defenders in hand-to-hand combat. There are various ships, such as nimble cutters, versatile frigates, huge galleons, and more. Singing sea shanties and boarding enemy ships are both available, too. The MMO features include playing with friends, engaging in faction rivalries as well as endgame PvE and PvP activities, including challenging boss fights. Players may trade, raid, and build their own pirate empire.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crosswind: Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlBldJrHQMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you've been intrigued by the description and trailer, the developers are running a playtest right now, featuring the first story arc worth 30-40 hours of gameplay, three biomes, three new playable ships and one merchant ship, ground and naval combat, and an early prototype for the Tortuga social hub. You can request access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041230/Crosswind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>

Remember how it felt in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> when you discovered a <a href="https://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Wooden+Shield">shield</a> and learned that it existed purely to shame and humiliate returning <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> players who are over-reliant on blocking? Do you remember reading those awful, judging, fourth-wall-besmirching words, “Shields are nice, but not if they engender passivity”? Well, The Knightling is the opposite of that feeling. It’s a bouncy, breezy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> platformer in which you are a novice chevalier equipped with a circular, gear-toothed shield he uses for absolutely everything. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can slide down hills on it! You can hurl it like Captain America! Like hurling his shield, I mean, not like hurling Captain America. You can use it as a parachute! You can even parry and block with it, though that feels like copping out. Not since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-brew-barons-is-a-sumptuous-ghibli-inspired-flight-sim-thats-also-a-brewing-sim-for-some-reason">The Brew Barons</a> have I witnessed such commitment to a bit. If you’re similarly enthused, you’ll be delighted to hear that developers Twirlbound and publisher Saber Interactive have just slapped a release date on the thing - 28th August. Here’s a trailer.

<p>
The story here is that you’re searching for your mentor, a famous knight called Sir Lionstone, who’s gone AWOL while a-questing in the realm of Clesseia. That’s his shield you’re doing doughnuts with. It’s made of Callyrium, which sounds like a Ratchet &amp; Clank version of Vibranium. Is the shield upgradeable in the manner of most video game weapons? I’m not sure, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/">the Steam page</a> does mention upgrades of some kind.
</p>
<p>
The trailer announcement accompanies an updated demo. It expands the previous demo’s Outskirt area to include ”the seldom-visited, secluded woods in the far corner of the realm known as the Cornered Bosk.” Somebody should get FromSoftware boss Hidetaka Miyazaki to play that demo and ask him if he still thinks shields “engender passivity”. Let’s see you surf through a meadow on an effing Moonlight Greatsword, Miyazaki. Let’s see you turn a Kirkhammer into a glider.

If you've reached far enough on the free version of the battle pass you'll be collecting the in-game currency, Chrono Tokens. 400 Chrono Tokens can currently get you the Peni Parker Blue Tarantula or Scarlet Witch Emporium Matron skins from the battle pass pages, and these change each season. If you're playing the game's ranked mode, reaching gold by the end of the season will also get you the Invisible Woman Blood Shield and Human Torch Blood Blaze skins. There are more skins to be redeemed if you've purchased the Luxury Battle Pass, too.</p><p>Finally, Marvel Rivals events come and go, and sometimes these provide free skins too. The current Midnight Features event has the Groot Carved Traveler skin if you complete all of the investigations during the time the event is active. The Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event, similarly, makes the Black Widow Mrs. Barnes skin available for progression.</p>
