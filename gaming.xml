            <p>There seem to be an infinite number of video game showcase streams these days, each one promising to be full of exciting indie games. Whatever my feelings about the entertainment value of these streams, I can't deny I watch all of them, or that they introduce me to games I might have otherwise missed.
</p>
<p>Next on the calendar is the Convegence games showcase on September 26th, which is a new event that - hey, what a twist - promises to feature exciting indie games. It does have some recognisable publishers onboard, including Secret Mode, Thunderful, and Kepler, among others.

<p>Thunderful are best known for the SteamWorld games, while Secret Mode published Still Wakes The Deep and A Little To The Left and Kepler are the folks behind the recent Flintlock: The Siege Of Dawn and Cat Quest 3 and the upcoming Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Other publishers with games in the showcase include Fireshine Games, Yogscast Games, Miju Games and The Arcade Crew, at least some of which I've heard of.
</p>
<p>The show will be hosted by the YouTubers and Twitch streamers ESO Danny, Dexbonus and Wanderbots, if those names mean anything to you. Dexbonus is the only streamer I have ever watched regularly, which means I get to feel marginally less out of touch than normal.
</p>
<p>I find most showcase streams blur together into a grey goo of badly scripted trailer intros, and that I can't remember most of the games featured minutes after the stream ends. I will remember one or two games, however, and anytime I've spoken to a developer about the efficacy of such streams, they've all pointed to spikes in Steam Wishlist numbers after being included. That means I should probably put my rain away and just watch the parade.
</p>
<p>The Convergence games showcase will be streamed on September 26th at 12pm PST/8pm BST via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@convergence_gs">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Convergence_GS">Twitch</a>, and the other usual places. There's more details <a href="https://www.convergenceshowcase.com/">on the official site</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Drama Studios, the developers behind the hyper-realistic first-person shooter Unrecord has announced that it’s raised $2.5 million in seed funding. </p>



<p>The French studio says that money will be used to improve its “core development team”. With a larger team, the company will work to bring the game to a “solid demo state” for players to experience. </p>

<iframe title="UNRECORD Trailer 4K (New Photorealistic Body Cam Game 2024)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/otu_iFTivQw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Unrecord debuted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tactical-shooter-unrecorded-offers-unprecedented-fps-immersion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to viral success</a> when people first saw a gameplay trailer that looked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-unrecord-gameplay-footage-fake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a little too realistic</a> to be a game. Since then, the team at Drama has been working on the game while securing funding.</p>



<p>As far as the funding goes, most comes from The Games Fund. Despite getting interest from other publishers, the studio went with the VC due to their “aligned values and vision for the games industry”. </p>



<p>Drama will look for publishing and “strategic partnership opportunities” are the game gets to the aforementioned demo state.</p>



<p>Unrecord is a tactical shooter that plays out from the perspective of an officer’s body camera.</p>



<p>“The storyline in Unrecord can be compared to a detective novel or a thriller,” Drama Studios says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2381520/Unrecord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the game’s Steam page</a>. “The player will have to investigate several criminal cases and confront a diverse cast of characters.”</p>

GameSpot has reached out to the Flappy Bird Foundation for clarification, but it seems that players will get a taste of the game sometime near the end of 2024, before the game officially launches on browsers and mobile devices in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">"Flappy Bird will return to a variety of platforms, including web browsers and new dedicated apps planned in 2025 for iOS and Android, with other platforms to be announced," read a press release from the Flappy Bird Foundation, suggesting players may even see a console launch at some point.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Flappy Bird launched in May 2013 for iOS and January 2014 for Android, but was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-flappy-bird/1100-6417647/" data-ref-id="1100-6417647">removed from both Google Play and the App Store</a> on February 10, 2014, after its creator, Vietnamese game developer Dong Nguyen, became overwhelmed by the popularity of the game--and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lananhnguyen/2014/02/11/exclusive-flappy-bird-creator-dong-nguyen-says-app-gone-forever-because-it-was-an-addictive-product/" rel="nofollow ">its addictive nature</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Given the fact that the fan-founded Flappy Bird Foundation has acquired the rights to the game, one would think that Nguyen might have made a bit of money from the sale, but that doesn't appear to be the case. It appears that <a href="https://x.com/samnchiet/status/1834246569857634352" rel="nofollow ">the trademark for Flappy Bird was considered abandoned</a>, which may have allowed the creators of the reboot to get their hands on the IP for free, though the details remain unclear. GameSpot has reached out to the Flappy Bird foundation for comments regarding the acquisition of the trademark.</p><p dir="ltr">Nguyen has yet to make a statement on the game's 2025 revival, but Michael Roberts--the chief creative behind the return of the game--seems ecstatic to be helming the return of the game, which includes a number of new gameplay features, like new game modes, characters, progression, and "massive multiplayer challenges for the world to flap together."</p><p dir="ltr">"We are beyond excited to be bringing back Flappy Bird and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come," Roberts said of the game's return. "We have big plans for our little Bird!"</p>

However, it should be noted that <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> is currently in early access, and has a lot of additional free content planned, as developer Chibig continues to work on it, so that’s almost certain to change (at least somewhat) over time. For now, though, what you can expect from the game.</p><h2 id="h455"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em>?</h2><p>If your goal is to simply see the credits roll in <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> in its early access form, without tracking down collectibles or completing optional deliveries, it’s likely to take you a brisk <strong>three to four hours</strong>.</p><p>Doing everything currently available in the game won’t add a <em>huge </em>amount of time, either, as the optional content in <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> is currently somewhat limited. Those aforementioned collectibles and optional deliveries will only add an extra hour or two for most.</p><h2 id="h456"><a id=""></a>What’s on the way for <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em>?</h2><figure id="" data-id="9fcc5a0f427ffb2badfe9bd31e216b32" data-recommend-id="image://9fcc5a0f427ffb2badfe9bd31e216b32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mika delivers a letter to a lady, stood underneath a shelter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mika delivers a letter to a lady, stood underneath a shelter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Chibig / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9fcc5a0f427ffb2badfe9bd31e216b32" data-recommend-id="image://9fcc5a0f427ffb2badfe9bd31e216b32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mika delivers a letter to a lady, stood underneath a shelter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Developer Chibig has plans for a lot more content over the coming months, so it’s clear the team is planning to beef things up in the long term. In 2024, Chibig has at least two free updates planned, and there’s likely to be even more well beyond that.</p><p>An October update will include two new mini-games: Churro Express, and Kitties, which will task Mika with delivering churros and rescuing some kittens, respectively. Although hopefully not at the same time. Imagine the mess in the fur. Completing these will grant in-game rewards, so it should provide a good reason to dive back in.</p><p>Meanwhile, a December update will include a fishing mini-game and the introduction of dungeons for Mika to explore. There’s not a lot of information about these available at this time, but they sound like exciting additions to the game that should increase playtime by a reasonable amount.</p><p>As of right now, however, there’s not a lot of meat on the bones of this cutesy platforming adventure, but it’s clear there’s plenty to come. In the meantime, if you’re just looking for a quick dopamine hit, <em>Mika and the Witch’s Mountain</em> might be just what you need.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony’s big PlayStation-celebrating platformer is out now on PlayStation 5 and despite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150">some glaring omissions</a></span>, it’s a delightful game worth playing. It’s especially rewarding if you’re a long-time PlayStation fan who has played a lot of the company’s games over the past 30 years.</p><p>If your experience with PlayStation is a little spotty, you might not recognize all the cameos and references scattered throughout its levels. So, if you’re looking to brush up on some of the lesser-known Sony games after seeing these characters in <em>Astro Bot</em>, here are a few recommendations that you can play on your PS5 right now.</p></div></div><div><p>Back in 2015, Media Molecule completely retooled <em>Tearaway</em>, an incredible Vita-exclusive platformer based entirely around the handheld’s built-in tech, to make it work on a PlayStation 4 controller. <em>Tearaway </em>was an underappreciated gem, as it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-playstation-vita-the-kotaku-review-5884517&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-playstation-vita-the-kotaku-review-5884517">on a handheld console that only a few million people bought</a></span>, so it made sense for Sony to port it to the PS4. Media Molecule went the extra mile with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01607_00-TEARAWAYUNFOLDED&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01607_00-TEARAWAYUNFOLDED" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tearaway Unfolded</em></a></span> and remade most of it to accommodate the DualShock 4, such as pressing the touchpad causing platforms to bounce and give you some extra air time or the light bar illuminating dark areas. <em>Tearaway Unfolded</em> is a wonderful, joyous game that feels almost like a precursor to <em>Astro Bot</em>. It has a lot of the same design philosophies that make them both fun platformers and a technical showcase for their respective controllers. </p></div><div><p>Speaking of games that deserved a bigger audience than the Vita could offer, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01130_00-GRAVITYRUSHHD000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01130_00-GRAVITYRUSHHD000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gravity Rush</em></a></span> and its sequel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA03694_00-GRAVITYRUSH20000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA03694_00-GRAVITYRUSH20000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gravity Rush 2</em></a></span> are some of the most underrated games from that era. These open-world action games star Kat, a young woman who has the ability to shift gravity, allowing her to “fall” across long distances. She can use the momentum to unleash devastating kicks against her enemies. <em>Gravity Rush </em>can be a bit disorienting, but there’s nothing like using Kat’s powers to send yourself barreling through an environment. Traversal has always been one of the biggest barriers for me in open-world games, because if it’s not fun to move through a space, I don’t care how big it is. <em>Gravity Rush </em>has such a simple, exhilarating answer to this question that it remains an old favorite of mine.</p></div><div><p>You will not get me to write about older PlayStation gems without me writing about <em>Sly Cooper</em>. Sucker Punch’s heist platformers are still some of the breeziest, most innovative mascot platformers to grace a PlayStation console, and yet Sony cannot be bothered to greenlight a fifth one and resolve <em>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</em>’s cliffhanger. The original game is available <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA21300_00-SCUS971980000000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA21300_00-SCUS971980000000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as a PS2 classic</a></span>, but the rest of the games are only playable through streaming and a PlayStation Plus subscription. <em>Sly Cooper and the Thievius Racoonus</em> game is still a lot of fun, but the sequels are where Sucker Punch got into the groove. <em>Sly 2 </em>and <em>3 </em>added new playable characters with different skill sets that really made you feel like you were setting up a big heist. God, I miss the Cooper Gang every day. You, too, can be filled with the endless torment of knowing a fifth game isn’t in development right now.</p></div><div><p> I’m genuinely surprised Sony hasn’t greenlit a third <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA05289_00-UCUS987020000001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA05289_00-UCUS987020000001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Parappa the Rapper</em></a></span><em> </em>game. Both the original rhythm game and its sequel are available on modern platformers, but Sony hasn’t put out a new one since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01555_00-SCUS971670000001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01555_00-SCUS971670000001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Parappa the Rapper 2</em></a></span><em> </em>in 2001. The hip-hop rhythm games star the titular dog rapper as he lays down bars during the most mundane life events. Learning to drive a car? Rap about it. Get your first part-time job? Rap with a frog who sounds a lot like Shaggy. <em>Parappa the Rapper 2 </em>goes even more off the rails, but the charm is still there and the songs are all bangers. </p></div><div><p> I got a copy of Sony Cambridge’s <em>MediEvil</em> with my first PlayStation for Christmas 1998. I spent much of my kindergarten year thinking the game was terrifying, only to find out in adulthood the hack-and-slash game is goofy-as-hell and primed for a spooky season replay. It stars Sir Daniel Fortesque, a reanimated soldier who comes back from the dead to become a hero after actually being an embarrassing failure. In 2019, Sony and Other Ocean Interactive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/medievil/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/medievil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remade the game for PlayStation 4</a></span>, and while the game still feels a little dated by modern standards, it’s still a really fun look into an era of PlayStation’s past that Sony doesn’t seem interested in recapturing anymore. </p></div><div><p>Some of the most acclaimed games we’re talking about here are Team Ico’s. <em>Astro Bot</em> has references to <em>Ico</em>, <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, and <em>The Last Guardian</em>, but only the latter two are playable on PlayStation 5 right now. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/shadow-of-the-colossus/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/shadow-of-the-colossus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Shadow of the Colossus </em>got a full-blown remake</a></span> in 2018 and, after years of development hell, The<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-last-guardian/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-last-guardian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em> Last Guardian</em></a></span><em> </em>made its way to PS4 in 2016. Team Ico’s work is often defined by slightly clunky gameplay, offset by immaculate, artful stories. <em>The Last Guardian </em>is a shining example of a game that frustrated me to play but absolutely won me over in the end because its final moments are incredible. Team Ico may be gone alongside the rest of Japan Studio, but much of the team still remains under director Fumito Ueda’s new studio genDESIGN. Here’s hoping whatever they put out next is just as magical.</p></div><div><p>Tragically, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-order-1886-ps4-sale-ready-at-dawn-closure-1851617233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-order-1886-ps4-sale-ready-at-dawn-closure-1851617233"><em>The Order: 1886</em></a></span><em> </em>isn’t represented in <em>Astro Bot</em>, but it <em>was</em> in the previous game <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>. Developer Ready At Dawn was recently shut down by its corporate owners at Meta, and it was just another reminder of that studio’s potential. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA00785_00-TO1886GAME000000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA00785_00-TO1886GAME000000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Order: 1886</em></a></span><em> </em>isn’t the best cover shooter to grace a PlayStation, but it had a really fascinating steampunk alt-history world that could have been the foundation for a great series. If things had gone a little differently, we could have seen sequels throughout the PlayStation 4 era. It’s a shame, but the game still has a lot of great moments worth checking out.</p></div><div><p>Y’all want one more underrated handheld game that made its way to consoles for the road? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA06171_00-UCUS987110000001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA06171_00-UCUS987110000001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Patapon</em></a></span> spawned a trilogy of rhythm games for the PlayStation Portable that were so well-loved they ended up mashed together with <em>God of War</em> on a <em>PlayStation All-Stars </em>stage. Thankfully, they haven’t been entirely lost as Sony leaves handheld gaming behind, as the first game and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA07321_00-UCES011770000001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA07321_00-UCES011770000001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its sequel</a></span> were remastered for PlayStation 4 and 5. Real shame they stopped there and didn’t also bring <em>Patapon 3 </em>to consoles.</p></div><div><p>Last on our list of PlayStation gems to go back to is the <em>Ape Escape </em>series. The first two games and the<em> Academy</em> and <em>On the Loose </em>spin-offs <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/search/ape%20escape&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/search/ape%20escape" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are all playable on your PS5</a></span>. If you’re too young to have played the PlayStation classics and were wondering what the first tribute level in <em>Astro Bot </em>was all about, it was an elaborate reference to these platformers. The series has been on ice since 2010, so it’s nice to see Sony at least acknowledge it in <em>Astro Bot</em>. </p><hr><p>Looking back at a lot of these games is bittersweet given the state of PlayStation’s first-party games right now. The PS5 has been mostly defined by carnage for PlayStation Studios between <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-shutdown-playstation-offline-delisted-store-1851638956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutdown-playstation-offline-delisted-store-1851638956">cancelations</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">studio closures</a></span>, so looking back at some of the more experimental and original games the company used to bring out feels bad. You, too can get nostalgic about what once was by looking at all those characters in <em>Astro Bot</em>, I guess.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After a tumultuous year, Unity has made the decision to cancel its runtime fee requirements. The decision comes, Unity says, after “deep consultation” both internally and externally.</p>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on the company’s website</a>, CEO and president Matt Bromberg said that the runtime fee went against Unity’s overall mission of “democratizing game development”.</p>



<p>“However, we can’t pursue that mission in conflict with our customers; at its heart, it must be a partnership built on trust,” Bromberg said. “I’ve been able to connect with many of you over the last three months, and I’ve heard time and time again that you want a strong Unity, and understand that price increases are a necessary part of what enables us to invest in moving gaming forward.”</p>



<p>He continued: “We want to deliver value at a fair price in the right way so that you will continue to feel comfortable building your business over the long term with Unity as your partner.”</p>



<p>Back in 2023, Unity announced plans to charge developers a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-to-charge-game-devs-per-game-install/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fee for games</a> after certain installation thresholds, seemingly punishing successful games. They made some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-apologizes-again-announces-major-changes-to-runtime-fee-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes to the fee after initial backlash</a>, but still kept it in some way. Now, 12 months later, the company says its all going away.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-unity-is-doing-instead-of-runtime-fees">What Unity Is Doing Instead Of Runtime Fees?</h2>



<p>With this latest change, Unity is “reverting” the its seat-based subscription model for “all gaming customers, including those who adopt Unity 6”.</p>



<p>The plans and tiers are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unity Personal License: </strong>Will remain free, and have a revenue and funding ceiling for $200,000. The “Made with Unity” splash screen becomes optional with Unity 6</li>



<li><strong>Unity Pro</strong>: Starting January 1, 2025, subscription price will be $2,200 per year, per sit. Unity Pro is required of those with more than $200,000 in annual revenue and funding.</li>



<li><strong>Unity Enterprise:</strong> Starting January 1, 2025, a 25% subscription price increase will go into effect. Unity Enterprise is required for customers with over $25 million of annual revenue and funding. Unity Enterprise prices come via custom packages due to the nature of customers with these plans having “unique needs”.</li>
</ul>



<p>“From this point forward, it’s our intention to revert to a more traditional cycle of considering any potential price increases only on an annual basis,” Bromberg said.</p>

            <p>
Tony Hawk has revealed he's "been talking to Activision again" about the Pro Skater series ahead of its 25th anniversary this September.
</p>
<p>
The original Tony Hawk Pro Skater debuted on 29th September 1999, and would go on to receive four further numbered entries - alongside dozens of spin-offs - culminating in 2020's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2020-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-activisions-game-of-the-generation">critically acclaimed</a> (and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-fastest-selling-game-in-franchise-history">record-breaking</a>) remake of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 &amp; 2.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, plans to give Pro Skater 3 &amp; 4 a similar remake treatment were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-confirms-thps34-planned-until-studio-absorbed-into-blizzard">reportedly scrapped</a> after Activision made the decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-studio-vicarious-visions-has-been-merged-into-blizzard">merge developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard</a> - so it could serve as a support studio for the Diablo franchise and other titles.

<p>
But now, it seems "something" Pro Skater related is on the horizon. Speaking on YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIEpU0EF0XI">Mythical Kitchen</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tony-hawk-claims-he-is-talking-to-activision-again/">VGC</a>), Hawks recently revealed, "I've been talking to Activision again - which is insanely exciting - we're working on something."
</p>
<p>
Hawk wouldn't elaborate on the "something" planned for the series' 25th anniversary, but added, "I wish I could tell you more". He did, though, tease that whatever it ends up being, "It will be something the fans will truly appreciate." Beyond that, all we know is Activision <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-pro-skater-fans-are-excited-after-this-social-media-refresh">recently freshened up its Tony Hawk social media pages</a> ahead of the series' birthday jamboree.

When Hawk previously spoke of the cancelled Pro Skater 3 &amp; 4 remakes, he admitted, "I wish there was some way to bring it back," adding, "When all the dust settles maybe we'll sort it out." Might the project have been quietly revived for the series' 25th anniversary since then? Perhaps, as much as that's probably just wishful thinking, or maybe it's been turned into an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a>. Either way, with 29th September looming, it shouldn't be long before we find out more.

            <p>Earlier today, Nic covered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-families-is-out-of-beta-letting-you-share-games-with-up-to-five-others">the full release of Steam Families</a>, a feature which makes it easier for families to share a game library and for parents to manage kids' purchases and playtime on the digital storefront. It's a neat improvement over the old system.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can't think about anything other than the Steam Families logo, which is pictured above and is clearly a shocked, possibly aghast face. Or so I thought at first. The more I stare at it, the more it seems to reveal.

<p>I mean, you see it too, right?

<p>I mentioned this in the RPS Treehouse, and everyone on the team saw something different. Ollie saw not a moustache but a stream of tears running down the face. "I haven't watched much of Evangelion but I feel this is a child sitting in the cockpit of a mech that is also a horrific chimera of both their parents," offered Nic.
</p>
<p>I went back and looked again. And - wait. It's a crab juggling.

<p>I asked Edwin and he said he sees Sam Fisher, hanging upside down, three glowing green lights waiting to strike.

<p>All graphic designers know that logos must be studied carefully before they are released to the public. First, does it accidentally contain a swastika? Second, can it easily be turned into genitalia? Check it thoroughly. Look at all the the negative space. Then check it again. I think the the Steam Families logo has successfully avoided such pitfalls. 
</p>
<p>Yet it's clearly a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test">rorschach test</a>. Look closer at its idyllic family. What do you see?

<p>It was there all along. It's a sad Sonic.

We can’t guarantee an easy time here. We can’t even guarantee a <em>good</em> time here. But we’ll tell you everything we know, regardless.</p><h2 id="h267"><a id=""></a><strong>Preparation</strong></h2><p>Given just how extensively these two fights can absolutely fuck you up, preparation is a number one priority, because while there’s leeway in most boss fights to figure out how to fight your own way and still win, this is a very different story, and there’s certain things every player should consider before you even think of walking up those stairs.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>High Vigor is nice, but you’re gonna need as much raw defensive power as possible here. That’s less about softening blows, more about narrowly avoiding getting one-shotted if you take a hit. The Dragoncrest Shield Talisman can help, as can the Verdigris Discus Talisman for tanks, though, you’re gonna want to keep a medium roll, especially for the second part of this.</li><li>If you fully completed their quests, and they aren’t, uh, downstairs from the boss room, Thollier and Ansbach will be available as NPC summons for this fight. However, tempting as it may be to have all the help you can get, bringing them both in will jack up the boss’s HP. As you’ll learn, you do not want this fight to drag on longer than it has to. In fact, most builds may just want to roll with a fully upgraded Mimic Tear and nobody else.</li><li>You’ll want as much resistance to Holy damage as possible for the second part of this. Some armors will be better than others, and in a fight where two hits can kill you regardless, you can take the tradeoff in other stats. There is, however, one specific item you want to bring for this that will help the most: The Golden Braid, found in the Shaman Village in the Hinterlands. Not only does it feel like it was specifically made for this fight, but if you’ve been paying close enough attention, it’s a rather huge—and incredibly sad—piece of the lore puzzle.</li><li>For Tanks in particular, either mix a Wondrous Physick flask that raises your max stamina and regenerates it faster, or equip the Two-Headed Turtle Talisman. Your stamina’s about to take a beatdown.</li><li>Yes, this is the fight where Miquella’s Broken Rune comes into play, but as we’ll get into, the amount of time needed to use it may not, ultimately, be worth it. Still, if you don’t have faith in your dodge timing, it’s good to have it at the ready.</li><li>In an ideal world, your Scadutree Blessing level is over 13, your Revered Ashes over 8.</li><li>For weapons and spells: Bring anything that can inflict Bleeding, Scarlet Rot, or Frostbite. Bleeding is ideal, though, since building that up strips a big chunk of health off in one shot, usually enough to immediately trigger the next stage of the fight, and anything you can do to not get in an endurance match is a blessing.</li><li>Speaking of: prayer probably wouldn’t be the worst idea.</li></ul><p>Now then. Here we go.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler Warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler Warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h268"><a id=""></a><strong>Promised Consort Radahn Abilities</strong></h2><p>Hello again, friend of a friend. Now you know why you had to kill Radahn’s crazy, horse-abusing form first before you could even get into the DLC. Sorry to tell you though, Starscourge Radahn is small-time compared to his fully resurrected form. He’ll give you a good example right away, since the first thing Radahn does is launch himself at you with a spinning cyclone move which, for the vast majority of builds, is an immediate one-hit kill.</p><p>If you survive that, then it’s time for a swordfight. That’s not good news. Radahn’s Greatswords are the size of trees, and although his strikes can come in combinations of two to five, even with a tank build, every hit puts a massive dent in your stamina, and even if a Spirit Ash or summon manages to distract him, he can turn around on a dime mid-combo. That’s to say nothing of Radahn managing to land a clean hit, which can easily put you in critical condition. He’s got a couple of extra tricks up his sleeve on top of that. He can perform a somersault strike once or twice in a row. His four-hit combo ends with an overhead swing that buries his blades in the ground, with area-of-effect damage when he pulls the blades out. There’s a two-hit uppercut combo with the two blades that juggles you into the air if the first swing hits, and smashes you back down with the second. That’s also, typically, instant death.</p><p>On the magical side of things, aside from pulling out that spinning cyclone attack if he gets too far away from you, he can enchant his blades with gravity magic, leap in the air, taking chunks of the ground with him, and fire them at you as projectiles. There’s a two-hit combo that creates a bloody rift that hangs in front of Radahn and explodes in a few seconds. That explosion can inflict bleeding on you. And hey, just for old time’s sake, he’ll do a version of Starcaller Cry, except the gravity pull now does continuous sapping damage, and the explosion spawns deadly barbs that can wipe you out in two seconds.</p><h2 id="h269"><a id=""></a><strong>Promised Consort Radahn Strategy</strong></h2><p>So, the big good news is, after FromSoft dropped that 1.14 patch, Radahn is a little kinder and gentler than before, but we’re talking the difference between getting hit by a train versus getting hit by a Jeep. At least one of those scenarios, the driver can slow down a little, and that’s exactly what FromSoft did to Dahnny Boy, compared to the unholy terror he was before. Thanks, Miyazaki.</p><p>There’s some more tiny good news for you: You only need to get Promised Consort Radahn down to about 70 percent health. Of course, the problem is getting even 30 percent of the man’s health down in the most brutal, relentless fight in the entire game. Seriously, once Radahn is in range, he will have his foot on your neck. Just about everything he does will wear down your stamina, your life bar, or both. Extending yourself to do damage is a risk every single time. As such, there isn’t so much a consistent winning strategy for Radahn so much as telling you how to deal with each of his attacks, and you have to make the call on how best to capitalize, and lucking out with his attack patterns plays just as big a role as sheer skill here.</p><p>The only other good news is that, if you listened to me with the Preparations section, if you can inflict one of the three status effects on him fast enough, this fight can be over a lot quicker than anticipated. Your Spirit Ash can help if used wisely, and I reiterate that the Mimic Tear is your best friend with this, just because having two of you doing the same damage in the same way can speed this up. I repeat: you don’t want this to turn into an endurance match. The HP boost Radahn gets from bringing Ansbach or Thollier into this will do just that, which is why you bring them in at your own risk.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="e13a3d21990cf7256fcab17ef19efc57" data-recommend-id="image://e13a3d21990cf7256fcab17ef19efc57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mighty Radahn has a yawn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mighty Radahn has a yawn." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e13a3d21990cf7256fcab17ef19efc57" data-recommend-id="image://e13a3d21990cf7256fcab17ef19efc57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mighty Radahn has a yawn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here’s the thing, though: The most effective use of the Mimic in this fight requires a mental adjustment. See, most of the time using the Mimic or a summon, its job is to distract the boss while you sneak up behind and do the real damage. It’s the other way around here. You, personally, can adjust and deal with Radahn’s attack patterns on the fly. The Mimic cannot. And as such, your job is actually to pull aggro on <em>yourself</em> as much as possible, partially so your helpers can get some damage in, but mostly with the hopes of keeping your friends alive (and, ideally, with more than half health) for the second stage of this fight. You’ll see why later.</p><p>With those in mind, let’s go over seven different ways Radahn’s gonna try and fuck your shit up.</p><p>1) When you walk in, you’ll have a few seconds to call in your Mimic Tear before he comes at you with the world’s biggest Psycho Crusher. You can roll through that fairly easily once you see him leave the ground, but his next hit is coming the second he recovers.</p><p>2) Sword combos: By now, shieldless folks should have pretty decent common sense when it comes to rolling through combination strikes, and Radahn’s are big, but nearly all of them leave him open just long enough for a single hit. If you’re not a spell user, you’ll want to roll like you’re trying to get around his back. You won’t get there unless your Spirit Ash gets his attention, but it will get you out of harm’s way as long as you time it right. These are the source of your best openings to do damage or heal, however. There’s a fast two-hit combo where Radahn crosses his blades back and forth. Dodge forward on the second hit, and he’ll stand there in a crossed-arms pose for a second. His three-hit can come at any time. It’s dodgeable and blockable, but his follow-up might not be, and dodging or blocking it can leave you low on stamina.</p><p>His four-hit combo (single-blade right, dual blades to the left, followed by overhead slam) is the easiest to telegraph, but the AOE on Radahn pulling his swords out of the ground after the final hit has a bigger hitbox than you might expect for anyone trying to stay close. For shielded players, however, this bit is truly his best opening. After blocking the dual-bladed right-to-left strike of that combo, roll around the overhead smash to get clear. If you’re ambitious, close enough, or have the stamina and poise for it, though, you can block the AOE, and guard counter it. He runs with this combo quite a lot, typically, so it’s not out of the realm of possibility to punish him for it enough that you stagger him. Now, that’s pretty dope if you can make it happen, but fair warning that ripostes don’t even knock him on his back. He’ll be coming for you with a vengeance the second he gets off his knee, ripostes cost stamina, and you need every ounce of that you can get . As with everything we’ve been laying out, make a judgment call there.</p><p>3) There’s a sweet spot of distance away where Radahn will simply lurch towards you. That’s a prime moment for magic users to strike, but anything that locks you into a cast is a danger.</p><p>4) The first strike of his Bloodflame attack leaves a bloody slit in the air. Unshielded players, roll directly backwards twice; once to dodge the second slash, again to get out of range of the explosion. Shielded players, roll left and directly forward. That’ll buy you a hot second to do what you want to do, but then your shield needs to be up and ready for the next problem.</p><p>5) The somersault attack: Another potential opening with a big telegraph, however, assume every time he’s gonna flip twice and you’ll never be surprised. If he only does it once, no harm no foul. If he does it twice, your second roll gives you a few seconds to act.</p><p>6) The leaping debris attack: The dangerous part actually isn’t the projectiles (though, yeah, if they hit, they do a shitload of damage), but the windup. Radahn will stick his blades in the ground, enchanting them with gravity magic, but there’s a big delay between that and his takeoff. It’s roughly two seconds, but you might take the hit on that a couple of times before you get it perfect. The takeoff does do a chunk of damage, but if you survived it, don’t worry about anything else except the debris Radahn will fire down at you. When he’s up in the air, run directly left or right at full speed and leap over the projectiles when they get close. That attack puts Radahn down quite a distance away from you, which gives you a few seconds of reliable recovery time. He’ll typically close that distance either by walking you down, or with another spinning cyclone attack. Without the pressing need to call a Spirit Ash, though, dodging through his landing on that attack gives you an opening of a couple of seconds.</p><p>7) Starcaller Cry: Chances are pretty good, unless you’re halfway across the arena, you’re taking damage from the initial gravity pull. The second you get control back, however, roll twice backwards to avoid the spikes. Probably the hardest of Radahn’s single attacks to avoid, but, as long as you’re not immediately at the epicenter when he strikes the ground, it’s easy to duck out of range. He’s got a couple of seconds recovery time after, as well.</p><p>If you’re diligent, and able to capitalize on any and every fleeting gasp for air Radahn gives you, you’ll get him down to the 70 percent sweet spot. And from there, things will get <em>so much worse</em>.</p><h2 id="h270"><a id=""></a><strong>Radahn, Consort of Miquella Abilities</strong></h2><p>After Miquella enters the chat, it’s a whole new ballgame. Radahn keeps all of his abilities from the Promised Consort phase, except most of them now leave pools of Holy magic in their wake. “Ah, but you didn’t say all of them,” you say, hopefully, desperately. You’re right, after firing the debris attack, he’ll fly across the field at you directly with four afterimage strikes—all of which do heavy damage if even one of them lands unshielded—and his four-hit combo now ends in a giant shower of deadly Holy light. It’s not all of ‘em, <em>really</em>.</p><p>And then there’s the new shit. Radahn will typically start this stage of the fight with his new widespread area-of-effect attack by floating into the air, setting the entire field alight with exploding pillars of Holy magic. He can now teleport around the area before striking with a combo. If you’re at a distance, he can fire the same magical waves as the candelabra-wielding magicians wandering around the Abyssal Woods/Enir-Ilim. He has a standalone afterimage rushing attack which will hit multiple times and strip the life out of you if any one of them lands. The timing on Starcaller Cry changes a bit, with more of a delay after the initial pull, the initial rise of spikes doing less damage, but he’ll follow that up with an illusory strike which ends with a final Starcaller Cry that does a shitload more damage. Radahn also has a rather benign grab attack; if it lands the first time, Miquella places a crown of light over your head, and will very kindly ask you to surrender. If the grab lands a second time, though, you actually will.</p><p>And lastly, there’s Radahn’s nuclear option: Once he’s down to about 25 to 30 percent health, Radahn will take off from the field like a rocket, and after about seven seconds, he’ll crash back down like he’s trying to kill the dinosaurs. To the surprise of no one, it’s instant death if you’re caught anywhere in range of that.</p><h2 id="h271"><a id=""></a><strong>Radahn, Consort of Miquella Strategy</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="a8e843c6f2b2249ca5aaca332bb7f53b" data-recommend-id="image://a8e843c6f2b2249ca5aaca332bb7f53b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maybe he's just sad?

Well, if that didn’t work, I’m very sorry, you’re actually gonna have to try to kill this asshole. And as before, all we can really do is tell you how to deal with this slew of new problems.</p><p>As mentioned, 90 percent of the time, Radahn will start off with the floating area-of-effect explosions. Anyway, if you’re fast, you might actually be able to run out of range of the explosions, but given how unpredictable Radahn is at a distance, this may not be the best option. You’re actually better off getting closer. If you tilt the camera down a bit, you can see where the light shafts will strike, and have a pretty good chance of avoiding them. Even if you do take a hit the first time he does it, though, it does less damage than it will the rest of the fight. That’s especially true if you’ve got the Golden Braid. Thanks, Marika. If you’re close enough, you and/or your Mimic Tear might be able to land a hit or two as he’s rising before you need to start worrying about explosions.</p><p>With enough Holy protection, Tanks have a pretty decent chance of still going toe-to-toe with Radahn the same way they did in his first form, but now you have to square with the fact that your health will be getting chipped away every time Radahn swings on you along with the normal, debilitating stamina damage. If you were sturdy enough to withstand the normal combos, you’re gonna need to learn to roll somewhere in the middle of them. The upside for daredevils, however, is that every single normal sword combo now gives you an opportunity to guard counter the Holy magic at the end of it. Again, extremely good stamina/health management come into play here, but if you’re smart, aggressive, and fortified enough, this can be a wild-ass fight that’s over faster than you think.</p><p>Related to that: Unless you’re using a Greatshield, Radahn will rip through any other shield like toilet paper. So if you’ve gotta get intimate with anything less, be smart. Rolls are still the order of the day, and for the fully unshielded, roll in the opposite direction of any of Radahn’s swipes (e.g., if his sword’s slicing left to right, roll left) unless Radahn goes for his overhead slam at the end of a combo. The final attack of that covers a sizable area, but it also seems to leave Radahn open a little longer. Roll out of range for that, then get back in his face to take advantage.</p><p>For the new Starcaller Cry, dodge it as normal, but after the initial set of spikes come up, wait for the third illusory Radahn to come down before dodging again, then watch for the final strike into the ground. There’s a very odd delay timing on this. Be careful.</p><p>And then the grab attack: So, this is a weird one right here. It’s easy to telegraph, just look for the white sparks right over Radahn’s heart, and dodge literally any direction. If he misses, you can punish him with a hit. Hell, more often than not, if it’s still alive, the grab gets your Spirit Ash more than it gets you, and even if it does, it’s a perfect time to recover, buff yourself, even leaves a brief couple of seconds after Radahn lets go where he’s vulnerable for a couple of hits. Still, it’s a concern just because Radahn likes to use it after long combo strings and moments where you think you might have a couple of seconds to heal up. So, you still want to respect it like anything else. And yes, if you do get marked, here’s the moment you’ve been waiting for: Miquella’s Great Rune is the only thing that can remove the debuff. That said, using it does leave you vulnerable for a few seconds, seconds that you probably won’t get many of during this fight, especially when dodging the grab is so much easier. Oh, and it’s up to you if you’re willing to blow a run, but if Miquella does get the second grab, the instant death is <em>wild</em>, and it also gets you the Let Us Go Together gesture.</p><p>For the afterimage add-on to the debris attack, keep running left or right after you jump the debris, and dodge the afterimages in the same direction. If you’re gonna use anything other than a Greatshield, block the fourth hit only.</p><p>The ground-based illusory rush attack can be deadly, but if it’s dodged, there’s a three second opening where Radahn is a bit of a distance away from you. He’ll be too far away for melee users, but magic can get him good, and right then is a great time for a shot off your flask.</p><p>How about the nuclear attack? If you’re quick, and can see the tell fast enough (Radahn will stop dead in his tracks, there’s a hollow lightning-strikey noise, he’ll kneel, then glow for a second), you can get two to three hits in before the initial takeoff. Once Radahn takes to the stratosphere, though, you need to pick a direction, and make like Usain Bolt. Run. Like. Hell. You will have about seven seconds before Armageddon time, and if you’re still alive when it hits, start making your way back towards Radahn, recovering along the way if need be. Don’t worry, he’s got a long recovery time too.</p><p>That last 20 percent of health is when things are at their most tense. If they were still alive at all, the bomb attack will absolutely kill your Spirit Ashes. Your resources will be low. And all it takes is one fuck up for Radahn to ruin a lot of work from the last few minutes. But keep calm, respect this man’s abilities no matter how low he is on juice, and we promise you, Radahn will die and stay dead this time.</p><p>When you’re done curling up in the fetal position or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIppGLul3Fk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIppGLul3Fk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">re-enacting that one scream from Predator</a></span>, you’ll notice you’ve collected half a million Runes, and the Remembrance of a God and a Lord, which can be turned in for either one of two variants of Radahn’s Greatsword–which cast the new Holy skills you saw during the fight–or the Light of Miquella Incantation which summons the pillars of Holy light explosions. If you want our recommendation: pick the Lord variant.</p><p>Once you’re ready, activate the Site of Grace, then interact with the little floating spark in the middle of the area to get the last word from Miquella.</p><p>And exhale.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s taken just two days <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since the announcement</a> of the PS5 Pro for scalpers to try and ruin things for everyone else. On Wednesday, it was noticed that the PS5 Disc Drive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-disc-drive-is-selling-out-after-ps5-pro-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was selling out at online retailers</a> like Best Buy and Amazon. Now, just another day later, scalpers are attempting to make profit on the PS5 Disc Drive requirement.</p>



<p>If you want to play physical discs on your PS5 Pro, you need the external disc drive. While it normally costs $79.99, scalpers have already <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_nkw=ps5+disc+drive&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_sop=10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taken to eBay</a> to try and extort players for extra price.</p>



<p>Some have listed the drive for as much as $200 + shipping. Others are lower, but still too high at $120. All of it being done in an attempt to convince people that this is the only way to get one of the drives.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Will it work? Unlikely. A source at Sony who spoke on the condition of anonymity tells Insider Gaming that the company expects to have no issues with supply of the PS5 Pro or the disc drive moving forward as the launch of the new console approaches and passes.</p>



<p>As of writing, you can still get the drive at PS Direct, GameStop, and Walmart.</p>



<p>What do you think of scalpers trying to sell the PS5 disc drive for profit? Let us know in the comments or join the discussion in our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new community forum</a>!</p>

			<p>At Gamescom 2024, I checked out the highly anticipated medieval RPG Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and interviewed Martin Klima, Executive Producer at Warhorse Studios. The full interview will go live soon, but in the meantime, here's an excerpt related to the game's technology.</p>
<p><em><strong>I know that you've kept the CryENGINE. Did you consider any other engine early on?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>When we finished KCD, we looked at the technology we were using and considered our options. However, we decided that keeping CryENGINE made the most sense for us because we spent a lot of time customizing it for our needs. I think we are very happy. I'm quite proud of the performance we have now. We put a lot of effort into improving the performance since that can influence the perception of the game, and we wanted to have a smoother experience.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Did you get the latest version from Crytek or are you still using your own from the first installment?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We are working closely with Crytek, so we have access to the latest version of the engine. Of course, we also wanted to keep our customization from KCD 1. In the end, although the engine that we have is not quite the same engine that Crytek uses for Hunt: Showdown, it is very close.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Do you support hardware ray tracing and/or multiple upscalers in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We support upscaling tech, both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR. We are not using hardware ray tracing; CryENGINE has very good software ray tracing.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I remember the first Kingdom Come Deliverance to be quite heavy on PCs.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>It was. There were a lot of things that we were doing just by brute force, and I think this additional time we had in the development for this sequel allowed us to optimize a lot, parallelize, and utilize CPUs better. Of course, hardware is faster now, and the consoles have more memory and better performance.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Will the game run at 60 FPS on consoles?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is not finished yet, so we're still working on it, but 60FPS is not out of reach for us.</em></p>
<p>After Gamescom, I followed up with Warhorse PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling, who confirmed that the software ray tracing mentioned by Klima is actually an improved version of SVOGI, which stands for Sparse Voxel Octree Global Illumination. SVOGI was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-gets-svogi-onoff-comparison-performance-hit-is-minimal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> in the first Kingdom Come Deliverance game and in a few other CryENGINE-powered titles like War of Rights and SNOW. I also got confirmation that SVOGI will be available on consoles, too, for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>
<p>The game is slated to launch next year on February 11. Meanwhile, check out Chris's recent<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> hands-on preview.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/jackbox-naughty-pack-director-warren-arnold-discusses-game-development-and</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jackbox-naughty-pack-director-discusses-game-development-creating-an-opt-in-environment.979440/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/jackbox-naughty-pack-director-warren-arnold-discusses-game-development-and<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ff1e915c-de04-42ef-9c0c-9096efac6357" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-naughty-pack-review-spicier-but-not-too-crass"><em>Jackbox Naughty Pack</em></a> is now available with three new M-rated titles; <em>Fakin' It All Night Long, Dirty Drawful, </em>and <em>Let Me Finish</em>. Ahead of the game's release we had a chance to talk with Warren Arnold, director of <em>Let Me Finish</em>, to learn about the game's pitch process, what the day to day of Jackbox development is like, and how they found the right balance of 'Naughty' without ruining anyone's night.</p>
<p>Arnold has been with Jackbox Games since <em>You Don't Know Jack</em> for Facebook, which he wrote for as a contract worker. "Once we started doing <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em> I came back full-time and wrote very heavily on <em>You Don't Know Jack</em> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="660ebb7e-b4c1-4b5c-a009-7d4663b03fab" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/quiplash-review-perfect-you-your-friends-or-strangers-internet"><em>Quiplash</em></a>, after that I was hired on full time and since then they can't get rid of me."</p>
<h2>How Where's The Butt became <em>Let Me Finish</em></h2>
<p>Arnold began our conversation by explaining the origins of <em>Let Me Finish</em>. "It was pitched by our lead editorial Rammel [Chan], and it had us all giggling from the start. The original title was 'Where's The Butt?' The first image he put up had a mailbox that had very rounded parts and it said, 'Where's The Butt?'"</p>

<p>"It was one of those things where the second he asked it in your mind you're just like, 'Well there's only one butt on this mailbox so how is this going to be a game?' but everybody circled something different and had very big opinions about why everyone else was wrong."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When we have people being very wound up, we know we're onto something."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arnold likened the success that they immediately felt internally to the same driving mechanic of a game like <em>Quiplash</em> where "[Jackbox Games] should be able to put something up there and your mind is already putting things together." The players should be getting excited to have the chance to talk about their answer.</p>
<p>A new feature to <em>Let Me Finish</em> that hasn't been part of previous Jackbox titles is the ability to Jump-In. This lets players who aren't part of the main head-to-head debate offer their own answer to the prompt.</p>
<p>Arnold explained that the evolution of this mechanic came from playing the game originally as a one-on-one and having other members of the team continuously adding their own thoughts on the prompt. Since then, it changed the team's mentality in terms of the game's design.</p>
<p>"If a player says they want to do something then we need to listen," Arnold said. "We tried different versions of making it a free-for-all, but that doesn't have quite enough structure. We gave it a lot of room to breath and found what's the best version of this."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/let-me-finish-house-public-hair_0.jpg?itok=Lva082sZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/let-me-finish-house-public-hair_0.jpg?itok=jAiIMPBD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Part of what influenced the final form of this game was that the team wanted to create something that would appeal to the competitive players who would play to win, and to appeal to those who want to "draw cruel stuff and make your joke." Arnold also laughed as he admitted that the latter is more his play style anyway.</p>
<h2>The Development Cycle of a <em>Jackbox </em>Game</h2>
<p>Knowing that Jackbox Games have been creating a <em>Party Pack</em> a year, most with 4+ games available, I was interested to hear what the development cycle looked like.</p>
<p>"Most of the time when you're trying to crack the nut, it's a lot of, 'I don't know what I got done this week, but my brain is exhausted.'" Arnold explained further that it came down to a lot of planning and anticipating the desires of their audience. "As a player what do I want? How can I accentuate what's working about the game and elevate your experience."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What's a very simple and elegant way to make sure you're engaged, you know what we're asking of you, and you can do this fun thing that you couldn't just do at your own house."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the writing of the prompts and the aim for the M-rating, I was interested to know how they found the balance between prompts that would add more kick than a regular Jackbox game but not enough spice to be uncomfortable.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jackbox-naughty-pack-let-me-finish_0.jpg?itok=cLupbgoJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jackbox-naughty-pack-let-me-finish_0.jpg?itok=HBIAwycN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"Yeah, that's tricky," Arnold began. "Sometimes it is 'you know it when you know it.' One thing we've always tried to do at Jackbox is if you write a prompt, you don't want anyone to say, 'Oh man, that really ruined my night.' So we really try to have open ears internally and externally."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Everybody has their own experiences so we just want to be compassionate to that, at the same time we also know we need to make something fun and silly."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the <em>Jackbox Naughty Pack</em>, the project was an opt-in endeavor with an importance placed upon creating a safe space. Arnold even added that "you could also opt out. If this is going to places that you aren't comfortable with, A) we want to know why so we can take a different angle on it, or B) this is just your own personal choice and you've decided it's not for you. We just listened, that's the biggest thing we could do."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trying to find this balance between the rating and something "fun and silly," the team was looking for prompts and experiences where anyone could say, "That is a silly thing, it's also a mature thing, but we can all agree that that is a fun topic to explore. It's trying to find that middle part where everyone can say this is a great place to live and have your party."</p>
<h2>Design Meetings With No Ego</h2>
<p>Talking about the design team as a whole, Arnold commended the design team, highlighting just how great everyone has been coming to the table with ideas for the past 6-7 years.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jackbox-party-pack-games.jpg?itok=7xwQFaog 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jackbox-party-pack-games.jpg?itok=vKo5hUZL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Talking through these design meetings, Arnold was especially complimentary of the team's ability to not be discouraged if an idea isn't immediately picked up. "Everyone knows you're going to have way more ideas, so when something comes up and it fits, we are already able to acknowledge it. No one gets their feeling hurt."</p>
<p>"The design meeting are a lot of fun because we're usually talking about something that's pretty ridiculous. I'd liken it to Apollo 13 where we're trying to solve a problem but the thing we're trying to solve is probably about something's butt," Arnold relayed jokingly.</p>
<p>To wrap up our time, I wanted to know, in Arnold's experience, what is the secret to Jackbox Games' success and he was able to offer two thoughts. The first of which is the 'phones as a controller' gameplay style that they wouldn't be able to do half of their games without, but the other key aspect is how players are able to create memorable experiences and in-group jokes with their friends that stick around long after the game is over.</p>
<p>"We want you to be talking about a game years down the road," Arnold said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242937/unity-runtime-fee-cancelled-subscription-pricing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One year to the day since Unity announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development">its runtime fee pricing model</a>, the software developer <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">is canceling that program effective immediately</a>. “After extensive consultation with our games community and customers, we’ve decided to cancel the Runtime Fee,” said Unity CEO Matt Bromberg in the blog post announcing the news. Instead of the runtime fee, Unity will return to a per-seat subscription model.</p><p>Last year, Unity caused a stir within the game development community with a controversial update to its pricing model. Instead of charging developers a set monthly rate based on the number of users utilizing the software, it would implement a pay-per-download scheme that charged developers every time their game was downloaded. That meant instead of paying a flat, predictable rate to Unity, payouts could fluctuate, resulting in potentially higher fees.</p><p>This news caused a massive uproar in the game development community with developers voicing their frustration on social media. Developers argued that the pricing model was implemented without adequate warning, forcing them to either pay the new fees that can’t be adequately budgeted for or make a costly and time-consuming switch to new software. They also claimed the per-download model could be exploited by malicious actors to run up fees on developers they don’t like.</p><p>As a result, some developers publicly committed <a href="https://x.com/galvanicgames/status/1702416458095972427">to moving away from Unity</a> to other game development programs like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/21/23971394/gamemaker-free-indie-creator-licensing-fee-unity">GameMaker</a> and <a href="https://x.com/MegaCrit/status/1713793866779042272">Godot</a>. Meanwhile, a group of mobile developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/15/23875396/unity-mobile-developers-ad-monetization-tos-changes">boycotted Unity</a> by turning off ad monetization, freezing ad revenue payouts to the company.</p><p>Unity took several steps to quell developers’ ire. The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/22/23882768/unity-new-pricing-model-update">restructured the pricing model</a>, raising the threshold at which the per-download fee would kick in to $1 million across all tiers of products. Unity also added a new option that allows developers to choose how to pay: either a flat 2.5 percent revenue share or the amount calculated by the per-download pricing scheme. The company also held <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23889346/unity-pricing-model-fireside-chat-overview">a Q&amp;A with Unity Create president Marc Whitten</a> in which he apologized for the pricing model’s rollout. Just one month after the announcement, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/9/23910441/unity-ceo-president-john-riccitiello-out-retire">Unity CEO John Riccitiello retired</a> and earlier this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24186003/cruises-new-ceo-comes-from-the-world-of-gaming-and-tvs">Whitten left the company</a>.</p><p>This new pricing model returns Unity to a per-seat subscription model, but there’s a catch; starting on January 1st, 2025, pricing will go up for Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise tiers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unity-is-ditching-their-much-hated-runtime-fees-effective-immediately-a-year-after-they-infuriated-basically-every-game-developer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

        <p>Returning to a subscription model</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Unity is scrapping their controversial "runtime fees", effective immediately. They're reverting to the "seat-based subscription model" that funded the game creation tool previously. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"After deep consultation with our community, customers, and partners, we’ve made the decision to cancel the Runtime Fee for our games customers, effective immediately. Non-gaming Industry customers are not impacted by this modification," <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">says the announcement</a> from Unity CEO Matt Bromberg.
</p>
<p>"I’ve been able to connect with many of you over the last three months, and I’ve heard time and time again that you want a strong Unity, and understand that price increases are a necessary part of what enables us to invest in moving gaming forward. But those increases needn’t come in a novel and controversial new form. We want to deliver value at a fair price in the right way so that you will continue to feel comfortable building your business over the long term with Unity as your partner."
</p>
<p>While the runtime fees have been cancelled immediately, other changes will come with the launch of Unity 6 later this year. Unity Personal will remain free and the revenue cap, after which a fee must be paid, will double from $100,000 to $200,000, and in Unity 6 the "Made With Unity" splash screen will be optional. Unity Pro and Enterprise subscription pricing and revenue thresholds will change on January 1st, 2025.
</p>
<p>Unity's runtime fees charged developers money - typically around $0.20 - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unity-to-start-charging-some-developers-money-every-time-someone-new-installs-their-game">each time their game was installed, and applied retroactively to all games that used the engine</a>. That means that if you released a game using Unity five years ago, you would suddenly start incurring costs everytime a player installed the game. The tracking of installation figures would also be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unitys-per-install-fee-will-be-based-on-estimates-and-unity-may-not-spot-fraudulent-installs-in-advance">based on estimates, with limited ability to spot "fraudulent" installs</a>.
</p>
<p>The change was immediately controversial, with several developers such as Among Us creators Innersloth, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-devs-announce-plans-to-drop-unity-urge-players-to-protest-new-per-install-fees">planning on ditching the platform</a>. Nobody liked the fees, nobody liked their potential abuse, and nobody liked that Unity could change their terms retroactively - meaning there was no guarantee that, if you undertook the multi-year project of developing the game using the toolset, that you wouldn't end up paying far more than you expected because Unity had changed the rules in the interim.
</p>
<p>Unity <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unity-are-changing-how-their-heavily-criticised-runtime-fee-works">immediately started walking back or clarifying the changes</a>, by excluding Unity Personal from the fees and allowing developers using older versions of Unity to remain on their existing terms. These changes did little to quell developers' concerns.
</p>
<p>Not long afterwards, Unity CEO (and former EA CEO) John Riccitiello <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/9/23910441/unity-ceo-president-john-riccitiello-out-retire">retired, effective immediately</a>. Matt Bromberg was appointed Unity's new CEO in May of this year.
</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-ceo-matt-bromberg-says-runtime-fee-reversal-is-part-of-bid-to-become-a-fundamentally-different-company-">Game Developer</a>, Bromberg called the changes part of a plan to "become a fundamentally different company." Whether that's enough to win back developers' trust, I don't know. I wouldn't bet my business on it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The exceptional adventure game set in a small Rust Belt town is going to be available on PlayStation Plus’ Extra tier, which grants access to an expanded catalog of games that evolves by the month, on September 17. I think, given the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/night-in-the-woods/night-in-the-woods-five-years-old-and-timeless&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/night-in-the-woods/night-in-the-woods-five-years-old-and-timeless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">profound impact it has had on my life</a></span>, that it is one of the most essential games of the last decade, and there’s no reason you shouldn’t play it now.</p><p>Let me start off simply and benignly: <em>Night in the Woods </em>is my de facto fall game. I know you all feel the temperature cooling, and I’m already wearing my comfiest hoodies and sweaters indoors. Soon, the colors of the leaves will change, then they’ll fall from the trees, and before you know it, we’ll be layered up and taking picturesque park walks straight out of <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>. Never before, and never since, has a game made such wonderful use of the full autumnal palette as <em>Night in the Woods</em>. It is positively swimming in a rich swirl of brownish yellows and fiery oranges that’ll make you instinctively reach for a coat. As Mae, the game’s protagonist, walks up and down the streets of her hometown, she kicks up leaves everywhere she goes. The sky burns bright despite the obvious chill in the air, and the nights threaten to swallow people whole. In a word, it’s got an aura.</p><p><em>Night in the Woods </em>is also a source of immense comfort. I’ve always gravitated towards the fact that Mae’s unceremonious return to Possum Springs is brought on by a mental breakdown and her subsequently dropping out of college. When I played the game in 2017, Mae and I were both 20-year-olds feeling the growing pains of adulthood and our own steadily declining mental health. I wouldn’t drop out for another few years, but when I did, it was largely because of the same reasons: I needed peace of mind and some sense of normalcy in the midst of a personal crisis.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/night-in-the-woods-treats-depression-like-a-part-of-lif-1797400607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/night-in-the-woods-treats-depression-like-a-part-of-lif-1797400607">Mae is just like us</a></span>. She’s been chipped away at over the years, and feels defunct and broken in ways that countless loved ones have professed to me over late-night talks. She doesn’t feel she deserves much in this life, and yet she desperately wants more out of it than the hand she’s been dealt. She comes back to town to play hookie with old friends, catch up, and feel <em>something</em>. She has agonizing conversations with her parents, reflects on embarrassing stories from her teenage years, and can’t handle her booze when she’s in the throes of depression. She’s also hilarious, and part of me feels that humor comes from a place of insecurity. You know those jokes about how depressed people use humor to deflect and mask their sentiments? Yeah, Mae embodies that fully. She’s the most true-to-life protagonist I’ve ever encountered, and that’s gone a long way to making her one of my favorite characters ever.</p><p>Despite how sullen the material of <em>Night in the Woods </em>may sound, it’s rarely ever so plainly dour. <em>Night in the Woods </em>is broken up into various days across Mae’s stay in Possum Springs, and every one of them is an excuse to walk around, jump on rooftops, and spiral. There are tons of tough and entertaining conversations to have with people along the game’s critical path, but there are so many more pockets of nostalgic joy and catharsis along the way too, particularly at the end of certain days where you must prioritize hanging out with one of Mae’s closest friends, like Gregg, Bea, Angus, or even that weirdo Germ who lives...somewhere. There’s Mr. Chazokov, one of Mae’s former teachers, who lets her stargaze on his rooftop and teaches Mae about the history and legends associated with the constellations. There are baby rats to be saved and pretzels to be stolen. There are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/night-in-the-woods-rhythm-game-is-on-point-1792633078&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/night-in-the-woods-rhythm-game-is-on-point-1792633078">playable band practices</a></span> and a Halloween festival!</p><p>By the end of <em>Night in the Woods</em>, you will love the town of Possum Springs so much you’ll never want to leave. Maybe then you’ll also decorate your room with odds and ends lifted from the game, and consider etching it onto your own body, Iike I’m currently plotting to do. At the very least, it’ll live on your dashboard where you can consider returning to it whenever you need a dose of reality, a sprinkle of whimsy, a home away from home, or a reminder that it’s okay to not be okay. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-delivers-galaxys-underworld-far-better-than-solo-book-of-boba-fett<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Since we first visited a galaxy far, far away back in 1977, there have been a few glimpses at the universe’s dark underbelly – the “wretched hive of scum and villainy”. As early as A New Hope’s brief excursion to the Mos Eisley cantina for our first meeting with Han Solo, it was clear this was a galaxy filled with colourful characters who wouldn’t necessarily play by the rules. But while Star Wars projects like Solo and The Book of Boba Fett have spotlighted this infamous criminal underworld and its syndicates, it is only the franchise's latest video game that truly takes a deep, worthwhile dive into this murkier, darker corner of the universe. Star Wars Outlaws is filled with criminal enterprise, backstabbing, and syndicates vying for control, and does all this far more effectively than any other Star Wars movie or TV show to date. </p><p>Outlaws puts us in control of Kay Vess, a smuggler from Cantonica (the casino planet memorably explored in The Last Jedi.) From the game’s opening moments it is immediately obvious that this project is not overly tied into the wider plot of the Skywalker saga, telling a self-contained story with just the right amount of nods and cameos that service the story. It means Outlaws is free to dive deep into what makes Star Wars’ criminal underbelly tick.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Serving that goal is a reputation system that places importance on building relationships with the galaxy’s major syndicates on each of Outlaws’ five planets. On Kijimi, for example, Crimson Dawn is locked in a battle for control with the Ashiga Clan. Free to work for either of these syndicates, each job Kay chooses has a bearing on her standing with the group that hired her and, in turn, the people she turned down. Through this system we get a clear sense for which syndicate has the strongest presence on each planet and how Kay’s actions might help turn the tide. </p><p>The blend of existing planets like Kijimi, Catonica, and Tatooine, plus new planets like Toshara and Akiva, each have varying levels of urbanisation, Empire control, and syndicate activity, which all helps shows how the rise of the Rebel Alliance has left an opening for these criminal organisations to cash in on dwindling Imperial power. Even side activities like Sabbac, often played by shadowy sorts at secret underground tables, help flesh out the earthier side of the universe and show there is more to it than the lightsabers wielded by noble Jedi and dogfights performed by heroic pilots. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The rise of the Rebel Alliance has left an opening for these criminal organisations to cash in on dwindling Imperial power</p></div><p>Of course, such organisations aren’t new to Star Wars. Crime lord Jabba the Hutt was a major part of Return of the Jedi. The exploration of the Hutts' and their rival syndicates’ operations, though, had been much more superficial until Outlaws came along. George Lucas had once planned a TV series, Star Wars: Underworld, which would have explored the darker side of Coruscant, the galaxy’s capital, but the project failed to get off the ground. And so aside from the odd expanded universe novel, such as 1996’s Tales of the Bounty Hunters, it wasn’t until 2018’s Solo: A Star Wars Story that the franchise put criminals centre stage.</p><p>Unfortunately Solo scuppered a prime opportunity to explore a younger, rougher-around-the-edges Han Solo and his links to the underworld. Instead it was overly focused on box-ticking, showing us unnecessary formative moments like how Han met Chewbacca, Lando and got hold of the Millenium Falcon. The lightning-fast pace of Solo’s first half also meant there wasn’t a huge amount of time to dissect the state of the underworld during its timeline window between Episodes 3 and 4. While Han and Chewie do work with the Crimson Dawn syndicate as part of the story, we don’t find out much about the inner workings of its operation. A lot of the broader, potentially very interesting politics are instead relegated to simple asides, with Paul Bettany’s Dryden Vos – Crimson Dawn’s figurehead leader – only featuring in just a handful of scenes. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/12/solo-dryden-vos-1726135996615.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Solo: A Star Wars Story failed to properly explore Crimson Dawn and its leader, Dryden Vos.</figcaption></figure></output><p>A few years later The Book of Boba Fett, a seven-episode Disney+ TV series, presented a second opportunity for a live-action Star Wars project to really dive into the grit of the Star Wars universe. But, once again, while the show did explore the potentially interesting story of Boba Fett trying to inherit Jabba’s operations on Tatooine, it never quite came together in a way that delivered on its promise.  </p><p>Much of the opening half of the series was consumed by flashbacks, exploring what happened to Fett between his apparent death in Return of the Jedi and his return in The Mandalorian, rather than examining his place in the modern criminal underworld. What was set in the present came as a surprise to fans, who perhaps weren’t expecting so much of the show to focus on Fett’s relationship with the Tusken Raiders.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Boba Fett’s efforts to maintain power among the syndicates felt like a subplot in his own show.</p></div><p>When the show finally began to focus more on the politics of Tatooine’s power struggle, the attention oddly shifted to Din Djarin, filling in some of the gaps between seasons two and three of The Mandalorian. Losing almost two whole episodes to the lead from another show stifled the The Book of Boba Fett’s momentum and meant its focus was split. With cameos from Ahsoka Tano, Luke Skywalker and others, Boba Fett and Fennec Shand’s efforts to maintain power among the syndicates felt like a subplot in their own show. </p><p>Such a dismal result for Fett is only exacerbated by the fact that the fan-favourite bounty hunter was almost the star of his own crime movie, helmed by Logan director James Mangold. The project was “much more of a borderline R-rated, single planet spaghetti Western,” Mangold explained during an episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw22PXyXXd0&amp;ab_channel=JoshHorowitz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Happy Sad Confused podcast</a>. It’s a description that suggests a more interesting avenue than the one the show went down, one that may well have taken a deeper dive into Fett’s earlier years and time as a ruthless bounty hunter. Sadly the project was cancelled in the wake of Solo’s poor box office results. </p><p>With these multiple failed or disappointing TV shows and movies, it has been the job of Star Wars Outlaws to finally deliver on the galaxy’s darker, grimier underworld. Thankfully Outlaws takes concepts that have only been briefly explored in other live-action and animated projects and brings a fresh flavour to them, taking a far deeper dive into the universe’s more dubious characters and concepts. We get a proper feel for how the crime syndicates operate and the bearing each has for Kay and the central plot. It feels like a properly dangerous galaxy – a place where the wrong move could prove costly, and one without a single Jedi in sight to help. This feels like the Star Wars project we’ve been hoping for since Luke and Obi-Wan first set foot in the Mos Eisley cantina all those years ago. </p><p><em>Chris Connor is a coffee and whisky driven culture wordsmith, with work published at NME, Radio Times, Yahoo, and others. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Building your own park in the original Planet Coaster remains entertaining eight years later, something Frontier Developments hopes to build upon with new water park rides, improved visuals, and better construction tools.

Career Mode uses a ranking system that swaps the original Planet Coaster's star rankings for up to four medals, and clearing the initial 'Bronze' challenges is unsurprisingly easy. </p><p>This mission highlights the new water attractions well, which offer more excitement than the original game's log flumes. You can now set down pools and water slides wherever you like, adding some welcome variety. Slides always require a landing pool underneath them, or you can create a separate large pool for guests to use at their leisure. Just make sure you have enough lifeguards on duty. Surrounding them with lovely scenery increases a ride's prestige rating, though it's a slightly shallow approach as you can dump anything around those rides without consistent theming.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As someone who struggles with creating interesting custom creations, using pre-designed rides via the blueprints system over making your own is undoubtedly helpful. However, some noticeably fiddly gameplay mechanics hamper this. Connecting your theme park guests to each ride requires laying down paths, yet they don't always connect despite stopping right in front of a ride or theme park entrance. It's slightly frustrating as I can't tell what I'm doing wrong in these moments. Thankfully, new paving methods like drawing and stamping tools make the wider process more convenient.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Creating a park and letting things run isn't enough; you need staff and facilities, but wages and construction come at a cost. </p></div><p>Powering up rides needs a delicate balance as placing generators too close to an attraction can reduce the prestige, but placing them further away means the mechanic needs longer to reach them. Creating a park and letting things run isn't enough; you need staff and facilities, but wages and construction come at a cost. Still, rising to the challenge can feel rewarding, even if effectively spaced land development is not my specialty. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Watching these rides in action shows how closely the team paid attention to real-life rollercoaster designs, and that's particularly clear from the first-person camera. Instead of just watching from above like some omnipotent adrenaline-fuelled deity, you can swap perspectives and witness a ride unfold in either testing or while it's actively open. That's nothing new for the sequel, but seeing these rides in action has me itching to book Thorpe Park and Alton Towers tickets. How much care Frontier is giving Planet Coaster 2 is immediately clear. </p><p>I also enjoy how you can customize rollercoaster trains with additional designs, such as light bars on the side. Duplicating these across the entire set of trains at once is also helpful, keeping designs consistent while removing any potential tedium doing that for every individual cart would involve. An option to create custom trains and original mascots would be nice, though the existing choices on both aspects are still great.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Though Planet Coaster 2 doesn't completely flip the script, evolutionary gameplay changes and visual upgrades mean building your theme park feels better than ever. I hope Frontier will address my more minor frustrations, yet this hands-on session shows the potential of the upcoming amusement park sim. I'll be keen to check out more when Planet Coaster 2 launches on November 6 for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Valve has updated its old Steam Family Sharing program and replaced it with Steam Families, a new and improved way to share games across multiple accounts that is available now.</p><p dir="ltr">Steam Families allows up to six users to essentially link their accounts into one, with each user gaining access to all of the games on each of the linked accounts. Whereas the old Steam Family Sharing system (first introduced in 2013) required the owner of a game to be offline in order for those sharing the account to play, that isn't the case with Steam Families. Multiple users can access a family member's game library and play different games at the same time.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Each user will have their own save files and Steam achievements. However, in order to play the same game together, multiple users on the Steam Family will need a copy. Once two copies of the same game are accessible via the shared accounts, any two members of the Steam Family will be able to play.</p><p dir="ltr">Those looking to create a Steam Family will want to put some thought into it. While it is possible to leave a Steam family once you've joined, doing so comes with a one-year wait time before you are able to join another Steam Family, as well as a one-year wait before that slot in the Steam Family you left can be filled. The owner of the Steam Family can also kick out unwanted family members. If someone playing a game on your account gets banned, the owner of the game will be banned as well, so make sure everyone in your Steam Family is playing nice.</p><p dir="ltr">The new and improved Steam Families also comes with a plethora of Parental Control features, allowing parents to block off access to specific games, restrict certain content, set playtime limits, approve or deny requests from child accounts, and easily approve game purchases requested by child members.</p><p dir="ltr">To set up a Steam Family, find your Account Details on Steam, then click on the Family Management section. From there you can "Create a Family," invite members, and choose whether added members will be Adult or Child accounts. Invited users will then need to accept the Steam Family invitation to join.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve notes that not all games will support Family Sharing, as developers can opt out of the program. Some games, like those that require subscriptions, can't be shared between accounts.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want as many games as possible to be accessible via Family Sharing, but we realize some games might have special cases where this feature isn't feasible or doesn't give users a good experience," Valve writes in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110?emclan=103582791457287600&amp;emgid=4605582245626919823" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-naughty-pack-review-spicier-but-not-too-crass<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another year and another <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b0f7b9d1-a12c-4c8c-835f-34ef4ff66814" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-party-pack-10-review-decade-of-brilliance"><em>Jackbox Party Pack</em></a>. This one, <em>The Jackbox Naughty Pack</em>, is a collection of three games specifically designed with an M-rating in mind. This means more crass jokes and more explicit sexual humor. How much does an M-rating really contribute to the tone of a game that is already filled with free-form comedy?</p>
<p><em>The Jackbox Naughty Pack</em> comes with three games, as opposed to the standard five games of a Party Pack. Two games are new editions of previously available titles, <em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em> and <em>Dirty Drawful</em>, and one game is a wholly new addition to the <em>Jackbox </em>stable of games, <em>Let Me Finish</em>.</p>
<p>Each game is intended for 3-8 players (though I don't think I'd ever recommend playing with three) and features using a browser-enabled device (Mobile phone, tablet, laptop, etc) as the controller letting you select prompts, draw silly images, and type in responses.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jackbox-naughty-pack-fakin-it-all-night-long-hot-tub_0.jpg?itok=d2tp-67W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jackbox-naughty-pack-fakin-it-all-night-long-hot-tub_0.jpg?itok=rOXEwQqi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The idea of having a mobile phone, a device that almost every person has access to, as a controller was an inspired idea over a decade ago when Fibbage first released and it's still an incredible way to allow all players, and even additional audience members to get in on the fun. So much of what makes these games enjoyable is the freedom of having your own screen.</p>
<h2><em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em></h2>
<p><em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em> is a social deduction game where you need to discover who among you is the Faker. Players are given tasks to complete, this might be to raise a number of fingers or point to a specific player, while the Faker is given a slightly different prompt or no prompt at all.</p>
<p>Players might be told to raise as many fingers as they need to unhook a bra, and if you look out across the room and see someone holding up a single finger it might seem suspicious. If the prompt is "Hold up as many fingers as the number of guaranteed booty calls in your phone" and a monogamous couple has a member hold up four fingers eyebrows may raise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fakin-it-all-night-long-bush-is-back.jpg?itok=zAQzT9gh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fakin-it-all-night-long-bush-is-back.jpg?itok=y_X2vlg2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How many fingers would you raise?</figcaption></figure><p>The aspect of <em>Fakin' It All Night Long, </em>as well as the original <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b4ae760-8c82-49a2-82d4-196d2e479e53" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-party-pack-3-review-would-you-like-to-play-game"><em>Fakin' It,</em></a> that makes them my favorite series is that this is a <em>Jackbox </em>game where the game facilitates interactions with one another, and it's not just players all watching what's happening on the screen. The game facilitates prompts and conversations with the players but doesn't get in the way of itself.</p>
<p>A new gameplay mode has been added as one of the sub-categories of games. In this mode, you'll be given a prompt and you'll get to respond with a single emoji. A prompt like "What are you most afraid of" might elicit emoji of skulls to represent death, spiders, or other fears, but if someone posts a raccoon emoji then they might just be your Faker. This is a fun mode, created as internet games like recognizing TV shows and movies based on emoji flood social media.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fakin-it-all-night-emojis.jpg?itok=VlDYHelx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fakin-it-all-night-emojis.jpg?itok=EARpWZ75 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Playing a few rounds of this led to my group learning a lot about each other, for better or worse, and led to some rolling laughter when one person was so obviously the faker with how their responses didn't align with their personalities.</p>
<p>Compared to the original Fakin' It the major difference is just that the topics used end up being that much more personal. You'll definitely learn a lot about people with this game, make sure it's a closer group of friends that you decide to play this with.</p>
<h2><em>Dirty Drawful</em></h2>
<p><em>Dirty Drawful</em> is the least changed of the games in the <em>Jackbox Naughty Pack</em>. It's just like the <em>Drawful </em>you know but now there will be more mature prompts. Some of the prompts I saw across my early games were "Loose Pill Pinata", "Butter Knifed My Damn Dong Off", "European Peen Contemplates Life", or "Baby Working The Mines."</p>

<p>Players get prompted to draw one of these insane ideas, and then others will guess what they are. At the end, all of the fake prompts and the real prompt will get shuffled together and every player needs to guess which one they believe is correct.</p>
<p>The biggest effect that these wilder prompts had on the game was that when a player posted something truly unhinged as one of their guesses there was less reason to doubt it was incorrect. In a normal game of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2220d1a6-c9b6-454f-96bb-292cc7ace7d4" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/drawful-2-review-you-dont-know-pablo"><em>Drawful </em></a>you can rule out anything that references genitals or lewd puns but you just can't do that here.</p>
<p>This is an easier game to share with friends who might enjoy sharing off-color jokes, but that you don't want to learn much more about them directly.</p>
<h2><em>Let Me Finish</em></h2>
<p><em>Let Me Finish</em> is the new game in the pack, where players are presented with a stock image and are asked to indicate something on it. You could be shown a series of screwdrivers and asked which one likes to be called daddy?</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/let-me-finish-house-public-hair.jpg?itok=--TtKHYE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/let-me-finish-house-public-hair.jpg?itok=KHDLLUuW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While every player submits their feedback on the image and prompt it's two players that go head to head presenting their response. Players will have a set amount of time to make a case for their argument, here's where people can let their presentation skills and improv chops fly as they try to convince the other players.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my conversation with <em>Let Me Finish</em> director Warren Arnold he actually shared that this game was originally called Where's the Butt? after the initial pitch was given of an image of a mailbox with the caption 'Where's the Butt?' prompting wildly different responses from those in the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once everyone has presented players will then vote on the best response. At this time other players can even jump in to tell the two players who presented, and whoever else might be around why they're wrong. I enjoyed this feature, but I could also definitely see a scenario where you're playing with someone who always wants their own thoughts heard might abuse it.</p>
<p><em>Let Me Finish</em> does an amazing job highlighting just how differently our minds all function. When presented with the exact same stimulus and criteria the places that we all go in our minds as humans is incredibly different.</p>

If players are shy, or aren't likely to speak up for their own silly opinion then it might be a bit harder to get this game off the ground.</p>
<h2><em>Jackbox Naughty Pack</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I was cautious going into this wondering just how well an R-Rated <em>Party Pack</em> would be but with the direct influence of spicier prompts leading to spicier jokes, and the indirect influence of crazier player responses fitting into the theme it's unmistakable that Jackbox Games has absolutely stuck the landing.</p>
<p><em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em> continues to be an incredible way to play a deduction party game against your friends where everyone gets to be a part of the action. <em>Dirty Drawful</em> creates a creative outlet for players to not only draw unhinged creations but also respond to them. <em>Let Me Finish</em> gives players a platform to offer their unrequested opinions on silly ideas and have a way to let out some antagonism in the spirit of good fun.</p>
<p>This might not be the <em>Party Pack</em> to play with your family at <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f0e3124d-2375-4674-91c2-64f67638d635" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-new-board-games-to-play-with-family-this-thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a>, but it's definitely one to share with your group chat.</p>
