		<p>Announced during the inaugural Galaxies Showcase, VOID Interactive has confirmed that their tactical FPS Ready or Note is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S this summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ready or Not – Console Reveal Trailer (PS5/Xbox Series X)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jW3zr1Jn5bM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in the fictional city of Los Sueños, a surge of crime across the city has led to the LSPD leaning more and more heavily on its SWAT teams to respond to everything from active bomb threats to suspects that have barricaded themselves in and hostage situations. Throughout the game, you need to employ authentic SWAT tactics, making use of equipment that SWAT teams utilise in the field, and with player customisation including armour, weapons, apparel and more.</p>
<p>At launch on console, Ready or Not will feature all the previous content released for PC, as well as some brand new levels in the Stories from Los Sueños free DLC update that is launching alongside the console version. This means that the game will have 20 missions that can be played solo or with online co-op for up to five players – and with full cross-play, you can join up with PC players as well.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Deluxe Edition will also bundle in the additional DLC season pass, with six levels already released in the Home Invasion DLC and Dark Waters DLC, and an unannounced DLC 3 also coming.</p>

<p>Ready or Not will sell for $49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99 with the base game, while a Day One Edition will bundle in an M32A1 Grenade launcher, MK-V Pistol and 590M Shotgun (these will be added free for PC owners of the game). The Deluxe Edition is $69.99 / £59.99 / €69.99/ £59.99, including the DLC pass and pre-order bonuses.</p>
<p>Seen as a spiritual success to the classic SWAT series, Ready or Not has been a big hit on PC, having first gone through Steam Early Access in 2021 and leading up to its full release in 2023. That hasn’t been without controversy, in part to the depiction of scenarios where you can easily draw parallels to real world events. This is always a difficult line that tactical shooter developers have to toe, though it’s worth noting that you are unambiguously playing as the good guys when compared to, say, the wanton, cartoonish violence of the Payday series, where your player criminals get barely a slap on the wrist for killing bystanders.</p>

But even after a week of paused sales and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/1jtkmhd/anyone_elses_new_blade_still_stuck_in_customs/">Reddit posts</a> discussing Blade 16 preorders getting held up in US Customs, however, Razer never responded to <em>The Verge’s</em> inquiries about what’s going on.</p><p>Now, some configurations of the 2025 Blade 16 have reappeared for US residents, though not all Blade laptops have returned to Razer’s US online store.</p><p>Before the sales pause, there were still 2024 Blade 16 models available, as well as preorders for the Blade 18.

The entry-level RTX 5070 Ti and flagship RTX 5090 configurations are only listed with “notify me” buttons.</p><p>And even more curious: the 5090 config is limited to 64GB of RAM and 4TB of storage for $4,899.99, but the review spec that Razer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/638930/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-gaming-laptop-impressions-price">sent us for testing</a> with 32GB / 1TB for $4,499.99 isn’t available.</p><div><p>What’s also still unavailable is any pricing on the new <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-pc-accessories%2Frazer-adjustable-laptop-stand" rel="sponsored">Razer Adjustable Laptop Stand</a>.

            <p>
Earlier this month <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/blizzard">Blizzard</a> outlined their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4s-2025-roadmap-outlines-upcoming-seasons-tweaks-and-ugh-collabs">plans</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> across 2025 that, notably, teased the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game would be getting a few collabs. They didn't mention what said collabs would be, just that they exist, to which I said "ugh", because, well, ugh, why does everything have to have collabs these days? The annoying thing is that Blizzard kind of nailed it with the first one, which just so happens to be with the iconic dark fantasy series <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Yes, the same Berserk that is essentially half the reason we have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, why Cloud has his giant buster sword, and why the dark knight role exists in Final Fantasy as a whole. The official Diablo Twitter (or Ex, or whatever) shared an animated teaser showing a very bald and bearded man wearing Berserk protagonist Guts' armour, swinging around his iconic sword too, but it didn't show off all that much more than that. My guess is that it'll be a cosmetic you can unlock at the very least, but perhaps there'll be some gameplay ramifications too.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
I'll still never be sold on collabs like these in games, they just feel like a cheap way to get people excited about Brand or Intellectual Property in a way that feels disingenuous. At the very least, Blizzard wasn't lying when they said that the collabs will feature "universes that complement its dark themes."
</p>
<p>
There's also no word on when the collab might be arriving in game, but it should be coming by July, as it's a part of the game's upcoming eighth season, Belial's Return. That kicks off April 29th, so you've got plenty of time to watch the beautiful original anime (and subsequently fulfill your destiny of complaining that the only animated follow-up it got were mediocre 3D efforts), and not so much time to read the original manga. Still worth a shot, I suppose.

By the end of the season, it’s revealed that the package delivery is just one piece in a plan to produce the deadly car combat tournament that made the <em>Twisted Metal </em>video games famous. We also find out that his long-lost sister Dollface (Tiana Okoye), who we’ll find out is named Krista in the second season, is the leader of a group of female vigilantes known as the Dolls. And that’s just the beginning of the newness coming to the second season.</p><p><em>IGN’</em>s latest <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/twisted-metal-season-2-peacock-plot-cast-release-date-photos-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/twisted-metal-season-2-peacock-plot-cast-release-date-photos-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital cover story</a></span> on the series reveals that the upcoming season will feature 12 episodes compared to the 10 from the first season, and will have the highly anticipated tournament take place throughout the latter half of the season. Mr. Grimm, one of only three characters to appear in every <em>Twisted Metal</em> game, will debut as the soul-stealing biker in the second season, and will be portrayed by Richard de Klerk. In addition to him, fans can expect the second season to introduce arguably the most recognizable character from the <em>Twisted Metal</em> games, the half-man, half-murder vehicle Axel, appearing in War Wheel form. Axel is famously known as the muscular man who rides around with two gigantic wheels on his arms. <em>Twisted Metal </em>showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith explained Axel was missing from the first season because they hadn’t yet figured out how to bring him to the live-action screen.</p><p> “How do you do a character that is literally a giant muscular man stuck between two gigantic wheels? You look at the design and you say, ‘How?’ And then after you ask why. And I think it was a challenge. Absolutely.” </p><p>Smith assures us that Axel will appear in the second season in a rig that looks more makeshift than futuristic, noting that this is a “1.0 version of Axel” that’s still being worked on by whoever created Axel in the show. As long as he’s rolling around causing mayhem with the rest of the contestants in the live-action <em>Twisted Metal </em>battle royale, we’ll be happy murder voyeurs when July 31 comes around. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We want to make players feel like both the star and the director of their own action movie, rewarding them with opportunities for creative takedowns by mastering the combo system and the environment, and showcasing their combos with dynamic camera angles to immerse them in the action.”</p><p><strong>Hardcore Mode</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The trailer also includes the first tease of <em>SPINE</em>‘s Hardcore mode. <em>SPINE</em>‘s cinematic twist on “no-hit” gameplay sees Redline wear sunglasses which will only remain intact if the player makes it through the game untouched by enemy attacks.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the new trailer below.

                <p>During this week's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6530837/" data-ref-id="1100-6530837">Mario Kart World-focused livestream</a>, Nintendo reiterated an important fact about the Switch 2 console bundle that comes with the game: It will only be available until Fall 2025. Nintendo originally announced the bundle's limited availability during the Switch 2 Direct earlier this month, but with preorder delays and controversy around game prices, this key detail has flown a bit under the radar.</p><p>Nintendo hasn't announced a firm cutoff date for the launch bundle, but the Fall 2025 stopping point for manufacturing could mean the bundle won't be on store shelves this holiday season. Granted, it's very possible that it will be a challenge to find the Switch 2, bundle or not, on store shelves in the US this year. Stock availability concerns have only increased in recent weeks due to the Trump administration's new tariffs.</p><p>Outside of reconfirming the limited availability for the bundle, Nintendo's 15-minute Mario Kart World livestream stayed clear of the Switch 2 console itself. We still don't know <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">when console preorders will be available in the US and Canada</a>, but Nintendo unveiled several exciting details about Mario Kart World, including the return of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battle-mode-is-back-in-mario-kart-world-two-minigames-confirmed/1100-6530930/" data-ref-id="1100-6530930">Battle Mode</a> and an in-depth look at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-how-eating-meals-and-unlocking-costumes-works/1100-6530926/" data-ref-id="1100-6530926">new costume and meal systems</a>.</p><p>Mario Kart World launches exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, the same day as the console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/void-interactives-ready-or-not-coming-to-consoles-in-summer-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>VOID Interactive's tactical FPS Ready or Not will be arriving on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles sometime this coming summer 2025, the studio announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>Ready or Not puts you in the boots of modern-day SWAT teams sent into hostile situations where you are trying not to pull the trigger as often as possible, and take culprits alive by following proper rules of engagement. Running in with your guns blazing is a fast track to mission failure, which is where the tactical side of Ready or Not's gameplay comes in.</p>
<p>First released in Early Access in December 2021, Ready or Not launched its full 1.0 version two years later in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-launches-out-of-early-access-adding-lots-of-missions-and-content/">December 2023</a>. Now, a little more than a year after that launch, it is nearly ready to make its console debut.</p>
<p>A new trailer for Ready or Not was shown during the Galaxies Showcase 2025 event, which you can see below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ready or Not – Console Reveal Trailer (PS5/Xbox Series X)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jW3zr1Jn5bM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>VOID Interactive has been on a long journey with Ready or Not, first announcing the game back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-swat/">2017</a>. It's also had its fair share of issues along the way, like being temporarily removed from Steam due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-was-temporarily-removed-from-steam-due-to-trademark-infringement/">trademark infringement</a> and the controversy surrounding a level in the game depicting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-top-selling-game-ready-or-not-has-its-devs-commenting-on-planned-school-shooting-level/">bomb threat at a school</a>, which prompted a <a href="https://x.com/VOIDInteractive/status/1474203773878816778">statement</a> from the development team.</p>
<p>Neither issue has stopped Ready or Not from achieving a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam across 180,000+ user reviews. It'll be interesting to see how console players take to it, and anyone interested can rush to their device to wishlist the game now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-direct-acknowledges-long-standing-meme-by-repeatedly-throwing-penguin-off-cliffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Mario Kart World Direct, we got a closer look at a number of new tracks, features, and racers, including Penguin. We've known Penguin was in the game since its reveal last week, but today's Direct decided to feature this blue cutie in a very meme-specific way...by repeatedly throwing him off cliffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This happened not once, but <em>twice</em> during the Direct, as fans have pointed out on social media. On one occasion, Penguin simply misjudges a curve and sails neatly off over an icy landscape:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Even Nintendo is deliberately dropping blue penguins off of icy ledges.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKartWorld?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKartWorld</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKartWorldDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKartWorldDirect</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nintendo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Nintendo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Switch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Switch2</a> <a href="https://t.co/0eMsUE24Jz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/0eMsUE24Jz</a></p>— Jonathan Leung (@VGMaps) <a href="https://twitter.com/VGMaps/status/1912876504939180190?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">But in a second, even more on the nose move, a Penguin in Free Roam drives straight off a cliff into the sea below while music from Super Mario 64 toodles away in the background:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">29 years later and we still chucking penguins off of cliffs like in Mario 64<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKartWorld?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKartWorld</a> <a href="https://t.co/7klPg5rZkM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7klPg5rZkM</a></p>— 🔥FireShadow64🔥(DROP THE PRICE) (@FireShadow64) <a href="https://twitter.com/FireShadow64/status/1912862828089770470?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If you're confused as to why this is noteworthy, allow me to draw your attention to a long-standing community meme of Penguin from Super Mario 64. In Super Mario 64, players discovered years ago that it was possible to collect a Power Star from Mother Penguin by returning Baby Penguin to her, then to take Baby Penguin after the star appears and take them away again...or even drop them off a cliff:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bit has been memed into fame for over a decade by the Mario community, so it's extremely funny to see Nintendo acknowledge it even if it's in a somewhat subtle, plausible-deniability kind of way. Is this a horrendous thing to do? Society still hasn't come down cleanly on one side or another of the Penguin-cliff debate. At least Mario Kart World gives Penguin a nice little water vehicle so they can just keep going once they've landed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Mario Kart Nintendo Direct wasn't exactly the font of new information many were hoping it would be, but we still got word on some interesting new stuff: more new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-direct-reveals-new-and-returning-courses-even-more-characters">characters, courses</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-coolest-new-features-explained-items-tricks-food-modes-and-more">items, and features</a>, as well as a close look (courtesy of Penguin and others) of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-free-roam-mode-is-an-open-world-road-trip-you-can-take-with-friends">new open world Free Roam</a> mode, which will let players drive around anywhere in the world without restraint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-direct-everything-announced-for-the-switch-2-launch-title">everything announced right here</a>.

During <a title="Genres > Rhythm [175 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rhythm">rhythm game</a>play, you only need two buttons: a button for up and a button for down. Simple to understand! The complicated part is doing it. Try not to get destroyed yourself.</p><p>Half the game is walking around and taking things at your own pace. The other half is trying to keep up with ours.</p><p>The pink-haired girl is Beat, and she is you, and you have a lot of things to worry about. The cops are everywhere, and they are mad at you for what feels like no good reason. Though it doesn’t help your case that you keep making friends with people that the cops are mad at for slightly better reasons. But what do I know?</p><p>Talk to people, help them out (or don’t, I’m not your mom!), play huge concerts, and punch cops. And then run away from the cops you punched. Also there are monsters or something. Not sure what’s going on there?!?!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>All of this culminates in massive setpieces where everything is at stake. The music got you here. It’ll get you through it.</p><p><em>UNBEATABLE</em>‘s full arcade mode is an entire game by itself with its own progression system and a full online component. There’s modifiers, tons of songs (with more to come!) and a whole challenge board to beat, with things to do that range from as simple as “beat a song on easy mode” to, one may presume, something as complicated as “solve an ancient riddle while skateboarding.” That’s not a real example.</p></blockquote><p><em>UNBEATABLE</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2240620/view/511829843667583107?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Demo Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="UNBEATABLE: GAMEPLAY TRAILER 2.0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XwKFOZeJukA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Normally, the spring Fortnite season would run until late May or early June, but Season 2 is wrapping up weeks earlier. But there's a very big reason for the change--more on that in a moment.</p><p dir="ltr">Even as we wait for Season 3, there's still some work to be done before we get there. The final part of Season 2's storyline quests is now active, and they'll lead us into another end-of-season story event like the titanic battle between <a href="https://youtu.be/wId1oLFboy8?si=Iy5iKSimdfek-lbx" rel="nofollow ">Shogun X and Daigo</a> we had in Season 1.</p><p dir="ltr">Once that's done, it'll be full speed ahead toward Season 3, which reportedly has a theme that's going to get a whole lot of folks excited.

But it seems as though Epic has learned some important lessons from the way the last Marvel season wore out its welcome so hard that the company had to pull most of the Marvel items from battle royale before the season ended--this Star Wars season will reportedly <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1904931354669691269" rel="nofollow ">last just a month</a>.

Given the rampant rumors, it's expected that this is when the upcoming Star Wars season will be officially announced.

If Star Wars season is indeed arriving in battle royale that day, it stands to reason the same thing will happen in Lego Fortnite Odyssey. Last year's Lego Pass (pictured above) included a Chewbacca skin and ushered in a major Star Wars storyline, and so it seems safe to assume that the next Lego Pass will include another Star Wars person, and that the Galactic Civil War will once again intrude upon your Lego Fortnite islands.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/drunkards-druggies-delinquents-pre-orders-now-open<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pre-orders are now live for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1183ce14-1675-44b1-af00-4d7855d7f06c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/chris-prynoski-talks-drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-how-420-joke-became" rel="nofollow"><em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em></a>. This light RPG experience is the tabletop game debut for Titmouse, the animation studio behind many beloved mature animated shows spanning both character dramas and crass comedies.</p>



<p>In an official press release, Titmouse announced pre-orders went live for <em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em> as part of the company celebrating their 25th anniversary. Copies of the game will begin shipping in late August ahead of a Fall 2025 retail release.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drunkards-druggies-delinquents-box-artwork.jpg?itok=MFEHnCka 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drunkards-druggies-delinquents-box-artwork.jpg?itok=rrkF4i18 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game was originally pitched as an April Fools Day gag, but became a passion project for Titmouse starting in 2023. The lead creators are company Founder Chris Prynoski and Chief Creative Officer Antonio Canobbio. The game is designed for 3-8 adult players and a single game can last roughly 1-3 hours.</p>

<p><em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em> is a blend of a light TTRPG, fantasy quest, party game, and collaborative trainwreck. Players take on the roles of unpredictable anti-heroes taking on increasingly absurd quests, leading to wild improvisation and escalating hilarity. The character classes include the Beerbarian, Weed Wraith, the Whiskey Wizard, and the Druid of the Flower.</p>

<p>The focus of the game isn't on strategy or victory, but on improv. Yes, you can get equipment for your character, and you do roll dice to resolve challenges. The twist is that if your character gets hurt, you have to drink or partake in whatever substance you have on hand. If you want a cleaner experience, these explicit prompts can be swapped out for drinking soda or doing dares.</p>

<p>This explicit style of game is in keeping with Titmouse's body of work. They are an award-winning animation studio whose work includes Mike Judge's <em>Beavis &amp; Butthead</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-trek-lower-decks-buffer-time-card-game-about-doing-starfleet-menial-tasks" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em></a>, Adult Swim's <em>The Venture Bros</em>, and Critical Role's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legend-of-vox-machina-season-4-confirmed-by-critical-role-and-prime-video-ahead-of-s3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em></a>.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon">Armored</a> Core is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> series that absolutely rips, and has done since its debut way back on the PS1. Technically us PC players only recently were graced with the ability to play something from the series with the release of Armored Core 6, but soon we'll have a couple more to mess around with. The only caveat is that it would be helpful if you could speak Japanese, as they're not getting an English language release.

<p>
You see, back in the early 2000s, Japan had some pretty advanced phones, some of which had cameras built in, internet access, GPS, and yes, even games. Some of them had whole ports of classic Final Fantasys, and there's even a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> spinoff that's exclusive to one of these phones (which is, legally speaking, unplayable to this day despite supposedly being canon). Amongst the numerous other series that got early mobile spinoffs - I'm talking <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>, Monster Hunter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a>, Persona - Armored Core also received a few entries too.

<p>
And, as announced by developer G-Mode, Armored Core Mobile Mission and its sequel Mobile Mission 2 are coming to Steam. The first one's actually due out soon, on April 30th, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3633410/GMODE_ARMORED_CORE_MOBILE_MISSION/">wishlist it on Steam</a>, but the second one doesn't have a release date just yet. Mobile mission is a top down shooter, but you can still customise your mech, and the second one actually lets you walk around its levels too. Honestly, really impressive stuff for the time.
</p>
<p>
Not only that, there's a couple of Shin Megami Tensei ports on the way too, if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> are more your thing. The first of them, Tokyo Requiem, was a completely original game for Japanese phones, whereas <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/20xx">20XX</a> was a prequel to Shin Megami Tensei 2. Neither have release dates just yet, but the latter is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3652460/GMODE_20XX/">wishlist on Steam</a> too.
</p>
<p>
Again, none of this will be playable in English, but I really love the work that G-Mode is putting into these releases. Their whole shtick is porting old Japanese phone games, not an easy feat given that some of them were exclusive to certain networks, so I'm chuffed to see them playable on modern hardware. Good motivation to finally start those Japanese lessons I reckon!

			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-ubisoft-is-developing-a-new-battle-royale-heavily-inspired-by-apex-legends/">Insider-Gaming</a>, Ubisoft has another live service game in development following its shutdown of XDefiant, which will be gone forever this coming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/">June 2025</a>.</p>
<p>The report claims that this game will be a battle royale and is currently in development under the codename "Scout. "One of Insider-Gaming's sources says that "<em>I think the goal is to capitalize on the player count of Apex dropping and them [Ubisoft higher-ups] thinking there's room in the market for another hero Battle Royale.</em>"</p>
<p>This, of course, isn't Ubisoft's first crack at adding another successful live service title to its portfolio. Rainbow Six is arguably the most significant live service success it has, but that's still a paid title, and not a free-to-play game. Ubisoft's track record is very different in terms of its free-to-play successes.</p>
<p>Out of its current free-to-play offerings, it is easy to imagine that Brawlhalla is the most successful, though Ubisoft's longest-running free-to-play game is the PC-only MMO sandbox Growtopia. Last year's summer release, Battle Core Arena, Rocksmith+, Roller Champions, Trackmania, and Rabbids Coding are also listed on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/games/free">Ubisoft's website</a> as part of its free-to-play lineup. If these games are doing amazingly well for Ubisoft, the company certainly isn't discussing those successes.</p>
<p>Of course, XDefiant used to be on that list, but it was long removed after last year's closing announcements. <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hyper-scape/">Hyper Scape</a> is another free-to-play title that, just like XDefiant, didn't last. Right now, it's difficult to see whatever this project Scout ends up becoming, having a different fate than either XDefiant or Hyper Scape.</p>
<p>Battle royales are also not the new, exciting genre they once were in the free-to-play, live service world. Sure, the biggest ones are still very popular. No one is dethroning Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, or PUBG anytime soon. If anything, you could argue that XDefiant's attempt at bringing back an old-school flavor of multiplayer was what had a better shot at breaking through the live service ceiling.</p>
<p>If Ubisoft had let the game run for at least a calendar year and supported it differently, XDefiant might have ended up on the rise after the drop-off from its launch success. If this rumored project makes it to PCs and consoles, we'll see if Ubisoft is willing to give it that chance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/snowbreak-containment-zone-update-adds-new-events-and-gameplay-enhancements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play 3D waifu sci-fi RPG shooter Snowbreak: Containment Zone just dropped its latest update, and it adds lots of new content. There are new characters, skins, gameplay modes, and even more on the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with Snowbreak, it’s a third-person RPG shooter on PC and mobile that takes place in a world where giant beings known as Titans suddenly appear in heavily populated areas. They cause untold destruction and leave a toxic substance known as Titagen in their wake. Leaders joined together to form the Heimdall Force, a paramilitary unit whose mission is to fight back against these Titans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as the Adjutant of the Heimdall Force, and your job is to recruit and lead a squad of female super soldiers. Known as Manifestations, these soldiers awakened to their powers after the first arrival of the Titans, and the strongest among them are even able to use Titagen in combat without the ill effects normally associated with it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/fight-1744401193210.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The story is told in chapters, with each chapter further broken down into stages. In each combat stage, you form a squad of three characters, each of whom have their own unique skills. You only control one character on the battlefield at a time, and using their skills drains energy, which slowly refills over time. So you need to strategically swap between each of your characters to make the best use of their abilities without fully draining their energy. As you progress, you can build relationships with members of your squad by giving them gifts or deploying them in combat. As their affinity for you grows, you’ll get to know them better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest update adds a new story scenario called Abyssal Dawn, which will have you investigating an incident with the two characters who are also new additions in the update: Nerida and Nita - Pulse.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/nerida-1744401232522.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nerida is self-demanding, often solitary, and can be stern with others but not to you. She likes sweet snacks, plushies, and ancient marine life models, and she’s obsessed with deep-sea documentaries and jellyfish care. She’s equipped with a Chaos-type assault rifle, and her role is the primary damage dealer of your squad. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She excels with both single-target and area-of-effect attacks and can build up the Internal Injury effect on enemies with both her Standard Skill and Ultimate, which summons a jellyfish that provides AoE damage buffs and stays on the field even if you switch to another character. You can then switch back to her to use her Standard Skill, which deals big burst damage by consuming the Internal Injury effect you’ve built up.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/nita-pulse-1744401268347.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nita - Pulse is casual yet perceptive, driven by money but protective of the vulnerable. While she’s on the battlefield, she keeps her eyes peeled for items of value and likes to pocket them, like Titagen objects. She wields a Thermal-type shotgun and brings a new QTE combat mechanic with her. Successfully chain QTE inputs together during her Standard Skill to deal increased damage, and if you fully complete the chain, she unleashes a final powerful strike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nita - Pulse is free to acquire for all players, available now by completing the Pulse Puzzles event. She’ll also be available for free as a login reward during the Nita’s Invitation event that starts May 1. If you participate in that event, you’ll also be able to earn Nita’s fully modified exclusive weapon, maxed Auctus Drive (her version of a Manifestation), and signature fixed-talent Logistics squad. So in one event, you can max out her full build at no cost.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/nitas-invitation-event-1744401305118.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re wondering what the Pulse Puzzles event is, that’s another new addition with the latest update. As the name implies, it’ll have you solve puzzles across various parts of the game. It’s a chance to relax and better understand Nita, and it will be permanently available, so you can do it at your own pace. To get to know Nita even more, there’s also a new interactable scene with her called Grove of Secrets that’s available from now until May 29.<br>
</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/nita-sylvan-spirit-1744401345665.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nita - Pulse and Nerida were both introduced alongside additional skins. Nita’s transforms her into a white-haired forest nymph, and Nerida’s features interchangeable parts, including footwear and stockings, similar to the customization options available for Vidya. But they’re not the only ones getting new looks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The update added new outfits for Katya, Fenny, and Bubu. Katya was introduced a year ago and is known for her unique appearance and characteristics. Fenny has been in the game since launch and become a fan favorite, and Bubu is a character from last year’s traditional-themed event.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/katya-1744401375399.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a new hide-and-seek gameplay mode called Let’s Go, Heimdall! for 15 players at a time, where three seekers try to find 12 hiders. On the horizon is the much-anticipated Emotional Purge mode, which adds cover-based shooting gameplay. It’ll first be available on April 28 and will be further refined in future updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in addition to her new costume, Bubu is also getting a new dorm room at your home base. That also adds new interactable furniture in the form of her Tranquil Desk Set.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/11/tranquil-desk-set-1744401487995.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Those are the highlights of this update, but there’s even more that’s been added. You’ll just have to play it to see it all. Snowbreak: Containment Zone is available to download for free right now on Steam, iOS, and Android, and it’s cross-platform, so your progress is shared across all platforms.
