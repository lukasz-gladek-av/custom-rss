            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-delay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Life Is Strange&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod has announced that upcoming narrative adventure&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>has been delayed out of 2024.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.actusnews.com/fr/dontnod/cp/2024/06/28/don_t-nod-optimizes-the-release-window-for-its-next-leading-game-for-lost-records-bloom-et-rage-and-don_t-nod-reports-on-its" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a press release</a>, Don't Nod says the game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-by-life-is-strange-devs-is-first-game-in-much-larger">announced during last year's Game Awards</a> and which was originally set to launch later this year, will now be arriving in early 2025 instead.</p>
<p>The studio says the decision comes after an "in-depth assessment of recent trends and developments in the industry", and that the delay has been put in place in order to ensure that&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>"has a successful launch".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-delayed-camcorder.jpg?itok=5xWsJDdR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-delayed-camcorder.jpg?itok=BPTkgfdq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>won't be arriving as soon as you might have hoped.</figcaption></figure><p>Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert says it's important for players to give both&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>and the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure&nbsp;</em>(which was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">during the Xbox show earlier this month</a>) "the space they need to be enjoyed" by players.</p>
<p>Guilbert says that he thinks the wait for&nbsp;<em>Lost Records&nbsp;</em>"will be worth it", so it sounds like the studio is confident in what it's created, even if it is going to take a couple more months to release.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, it's an upcoming narrative adventure game from the studio responsible for&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game revolves around a group of friends who spend an unforgettable summer together in 1995, but there's one problem: something happens during that summer that makes all of them "promise to never speak again", as the Steam page says.</p>

<p>If you've played&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>, you'll know what to expect: a game that's fairly light on gameplay but heavy on storytelling, atmosphere, and character. Fans of Don't Nod's other narrative work will likely love it.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902960/Lost_Records_Bloom__Rage/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lost-records-bloom-rage/9n3f1lw9hc6c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in early 2025.

			<p>Today, MMO fans finally have the pleasure of learning about Stars Reach, the next game envisioned by genre guru Raph Koster and his team at Playable Worlds, a studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/raph-koster-the-man-behind-ultima-online-and-star-wars-galaxies-is-back-doing-his-own-mmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> in late 2019. Koster was the Lead Designer on the seminal Ultima Online, the Creative Director on Star Wars Galaxies, and the Chief Creative Officer on EverQuest II.</p>
<p>For Stars Reach, Koster has returned to his sandbox roots with the power of today's technology. The developers at Playable Worlds have crafted a first-of-its-kind server architecture running partly on the cloud, which allows players to fully modify the universe. In turn, the worlds (yes, plural) will react. Water flows, creating natural currents. Forests can catch fire. Flora changes as heat and humidity change. Creatures migrate as food sources are depleted. This is a single, global, persistent universe that won't reset during downtime. The actions players take affect the landscape, are visible to all, and are permanent.</p>
<p>The game aims to allow players to build a home on the planet of their choice, an underground lava mining facility, an underwater dome farm, and an orbital starport, and these are just a few examples. You will be able to rule a planet as you see fit, and there will be even areas of space where PvP is enabled. Stars Reach also adopts a fully classless system, eschewing levels in favor of skill-based progression, which means you'll never be 'outleveled' when playing with a friend.</p>
<p>I was able to speak for nearly an hour with Raph Koster about virtually every aspect of Stars Reach that I could think of. The game's ambition is through the roof, as you'll see in the full transcript below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Raph's Vision for Stars Reach - Announcement Video 4k" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FoJUeNgTWBs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Let's start with the basics. What engine are you using?</strong></p>
<p>Unity.</p>
<p><strong>Are you aiming to eventually release this game on other platforms?</strong></p>
<p>We're focusing on the PC, but we have been doing work to prepare for other devices, including controller and touch-screen compatibility.</p>
<p><strong>You've said that the player's actions are permanent, but as I understand it, only as long as players are active on that planet. If they don't visit that planet anymore for any reason, the buildings will be lost or erased.</strong></p>
<p>We can decide whether or not to have the wormhole to a planet collapse based on not just the activity but whether or not players have stuff there. If there's a planet that people go to and they go and nobody builds here, let's just extract all the gold and diamonds, kill all the monsters and leave. That might be a planet that eventually goes away again.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of the setup of the universe, is Stars Reach somewhat realistic in that you have planets that have very different features? Or are they all Goldilocks (habitable) planets?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we are making them all Goldilocks. However, that is because long ago, an alien civilization terraformed this arm of the galaxy to make it suitable for their genetically engineered pets, which are humans. So they set up this arm of the galaxy for us in order to eventually let us spread across the galaxy. They have disappeared now, but we have been allowed off of our homeworlds by the robot servants that they left behind. That doesn't mean that all the planets are that similar. They can have different fauna, different flora, different gravity, different day and night, different temperature ranges, different seasons, different seasonal lengths, and different year lengths. Also, there's actually a lot of variety that can happen between the different planets, but we are not planning on starting out with planets with fully poisonous atmospheres. We can do that; we just aren't starting Stars Reach that way.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe in the future. In terms of size, are the planets going to be roughly the same size, or will there be any differences in that area?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we are looking at them all being the same size. Space areas will be bigger. The robot<br>
servitors do not allow you to colonize the entire planet. They basically created a force field dome and are restricting a portion of the planet and that's the part that the humans are allowed to visit.<br>
That's because they don't want us messing up the rest of the garden. They saw what we did<br>
to our home worlds. These areas, we are aiming for them to be village-sized. We are looking at zones about four kilometers on a side for planets. We'll see how big we get them; we want to push them as large as we can while preserving the idea that this is a game about a guild owning a planet, about a group of friends coming to own a planet, all of them connected in this galaxy. So they share an economy, trade, and all of that. but it isn't a game about the 10,000-person battle on a planet. It's a game about smaller groups and that is because we want to bring back that sense of community where people come to know each other, they know who their fellow planetary citizens, they establish those ties and friendships. It's not about building downtown Manhattan necessarily with millions of people crammed into a tiny space because that doesn't help build those sorts of friendships, and that is a really big part of what we are trying to do.</p>
<p><strong>Let's say that a lot of people want to go to a specific planet at the same time. Do you have some sort of instancing mechanism in place to prevent overcrowding on a single planet?</strong></p>
<p>We can do instancing, but we are actually trying to avoid it. We are avoiding phasing and all of<br>
those kinds of things because they are very gamey. What we are interested in is providing the sense of an alternate world, an alternate reality that you go into. What our tech allows us to do is have flash crowd support, so if there is an event or something and a lot of people are going to pile into a planet, we can handle a higher load than normal. That isn't the issue. But there could be queues within the galaxy. Like, if there are too many people currently orbiting this planet, then maybe the orbital space has gotten crowded.</p>
<p><strong>A space traffic jam.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Our entire galaxy is running on a simulation. It is not just voxels and it's not just Minecraft style. Every cubic meter has little AIs in it. When you see water flowing downhill, what you are seeing is little water AIs holding hands and walking down the hill. It is a level of simulation that has never been seen in a game like this before'.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You've claimed that players can reshape the environments in Stars Reach. Let's talk about that.</strong></p>
<p>Our entire galaxy is running on a simulation. It is not just voxels and it's not just Minecraft style. Every cubic meter has little AIs in it. When you see water flowing downhill, what you are seeing is little water AIs holding hands and walking down the hill. That is what is going on. We know the temperature and humidity for every cubic meter of the entire galaxy. Things can be in a liquid, solid, or gaseous state. If you take a heat ray and heat up that water, it is going to turn into steam, float away, then eventually condense, and fall back into a puddle someplace.</p>
<p>It is a level of simulation that has never been seen in a game like this before. That allows us to do all kinds of new gameplay. You can shoot and bring down a cliff onto your enemies. You can open up a lava pit and watch things fall in and die. You can grow individual trees they will be healthier or not based on the kind of soil that they are growing in. I'm sure there's even more that we haven't even thought of yet, but the stuff pervades the gameplay everywhere, and all of it is a hundred percent persistent. If somebody burns the forest down, it is burned down for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Does it grow back automatically, or do you have to do it on your own?</strong></p>
<p>There is a way to grow trees and they do grow back. Every tree that you saw in that video grew there. We didn't place them; they grew there. And if we just let it run, those forests would spread over the map. So we do let players regrow the forests and so on. In fact, every planet has a health bar. The reason why humans have left their home worlds is because we've ruined them with nuclear winters, global pandemics, and climate change. So, we are going out into the galaxy, and it is a second chance for us to do better.</p>
<p>One of the things that Stars Reach is about is saying to players that they are now in charge of this planet.&nbsp;Can you keep it alive? Can you do well with it? Can you manage it successfully? Are you going to strip mine it, drive all the creatures extinct, chop down every tree, and build a strip mall here? Or are you going to try to build a pastoral peaceful village? We leave that up to the player.</p>
<p>Of course, if you build it into a shopping mall, now you have a net import economy and will have to import all of the stuff you need from other planets. Every planet has different resources with different qualities on it. They all have different creatures with different AI behaviors, different appearances,&nbsp; different stats, and so on. Every planet is unique.</p>
<p><strong>So, players could potentially ruin the planet and turn it into an arid, lifeless landscape.</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of physics examples, something that just popped into my mind is that it would be cool if there was a way to boil water while your enemy is in there. But this leads me to ask whether there is going to be any sort of magic in the game. Or is it strictly science fiction?</strong></p>
<p>Our setting is science fantasy. There isn't magic, but there is the famous Arthur C. Clarke quote that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Well, the Old Ones, the ancient civilization that made humans, had that kind of tech. Their artifacts are out there.</p>
<p><strong>You briefly mentioned the economy earlier. How is it going to work? Are there systems to trade all across the galaxy via a unified auction house, or will players have to deal with local economies?</strong></p>
<p>It is a fully player-driven economy. The entire galaxy is in one economy. You absolutely have the means to trade, but we do not show you all of the goods in the galaxy in a single auction house. The game is too big for that. We want there to be price variation across the galaxy so that the gameplay is there of smuggling goods from one sector to another, of arbitrage, finding something selling cheap here and selling it for a higher price someplace else, of finding a region of space particularly rich in particular gases or resources and trying to not let out the secret that that's the place to go to get this stuff. We have a rule that people can move fairly quickly. We never want to block you from playing with your friends. So we let you teleport to your friends, actually, sort of Altered Carbon style. You download yourself into a clone local to them, and then after you have some fun and chat with them, you rewind back to where you were.</p>
<p>But the other side of the rule is goods move slowly. They can never teleport or be cloned that way. If you want to go out into an asteroid field and start blasting away at the asteroids to harvest the crystals, you are going to end up literally dragging them behind your ship in a bunch of mesh bags, almost like a 3D game of snake and the space spiders are going to be coming and stealing it off of your tail. You will have to smuggle it through the wormhole the slow way and get it to the planet that is its destination. Whereas, if you want to play with your friends, you can just get to them very quickly and easily, but you can only take the gear that you have on your tool belt.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things in the game economy that are meant to drive that kind of interdependent gameplay, from varying statistics on different planets to the ability for players to run shops on their planets. You can have a local auction house per planet and it can advertise to nearby areas.</p>
<p><strong>Could you place an NPC vendor at your own home for people to come and buy your stuff?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We do not yet have spaceships in, but people can fly around in their spacesuits engaging in space combat. All of our combat is actiony, but we do have homing bullets and lock-on for people who want to use a more traditional tab-targeting combat.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Okay, cool. You mentioned space, so let's discuss that. Let's say that you have to trade goods... Is there space combat?</strong></p>
<p>Everything that I described for the planets is the same. Space is simulated just like the ground is. If you want to build your home as a space station on an asteroid, you can do that. You can tunnel holes in the asteroid, go inside, and perhaps find alien creatures living there. Yes, there is space combat. We do not yet have spaceships in, but people can fly around in their spacesuits engaging in space combat. All of our combat is actiony, but we do have homing bullets and lock-on for people who want to use a more traditional tab-targeting combat; they can do that also. They both coexist within Stars Reach. Space gameplay is actually really important.</p>
<p><strong>How will spaceships work when they make it into the game?</strong></p>
<p>When you start out, we will be handy everyone a small single-seater spaceship.</p>
<p><strong>You put out some very interesting teases in the last 10 days. Among other things, you said 'What if monsters didn't always respawn in the same place'? I always thought that it was very boring for monsters to always be in the same place in games. Is it player-driven, like do you have to hunt them down to make them move, or will they just migrate off their own volition potentially as well?</strong></p>
<p>All of our creatures run AI like The Sims. They have needs, hunger, fears, and all of that. If the environment changes around them, they might migrate because they will move around to satisfy their needs. They do reproduce. We do allow players to drive them extinct. The game does fight against that because the Old Ones and the servitors are trying to maintain the populations of the creatures. That's part of the servitors' job. There are ways for players to defeat that, but I'm going to keep it a secret for now as to how exactly those systems work.</p>
<p><strong>You also said that they may invade you in your cities.</strong></p>
<p>That's right. Let's say that there is an infestation of ice wolves. They might only come out in the winter when it is cold because they only like the cold. If the population starts to explode because nothing is a predator of theirs and players aren't killing them, then they will reproduce and their territory will spread. And yeah, then they might invade your town. On the other hand, if you killed too many of them, you could drive them extinct on that planet. One step beyond that, we have xenobiology as a profession track in Stars Reach. If you gather the genetic samples from the ice<br>
wolves, you could bring them back from extinction, too.</p>
<p><strong>In the case of NPC invasion, will they be able to damage player-made buildings?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we don't have creatures damaging people's houses. But they'll certainly damage you!</p>
<p><strong>Another interesting tease was that you might get snowed in while at a tavern. Was that just a fun tidbit, or would there be a purpose in that sort of situation?</strong></p>
<p>Due to our simulation, if you walk into the lava, it is going to burn you. It might even catch you on fire. If you walk into water waste deep, you will slow down. If you are on the edge of an icy cliff, ice is slippery in our game. If you are walking through really wet dirt, it turns into mud, and you move more slowly. So yeah, if there is snow around you, your traversal will become more difficult. We are planning to have skills that allow players to learn how to do things like navigate snowy conditions, climb super slippery cliffs, and so on. In Stars Reach, players have tools like grav meshes so they can fly and grappling hooks so they can zip around the world. But yeah, getting snowed in can be a thing, and it will affect gameplay pretty dramatically because those ice wolves might not suffer any movement penalty on ice, but you do.</p>
<p><strong>So, the environment also affects combat in a way.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. Pretty significantly, in fact!</p>
<p><strong>Something else that you said a few days ago is that you could potentially write quests and create contracts for players. How does this system work? Could you write a full quest text, or is there just a basic framework?</strong></p>
<p>It is a contract system. Let's say that I am a crafter, and I have made a crate of high-quality rifles for a guild that is buying them. They have sent me the money, and I have now made the rifles, but they are far away. I can create a mission on the contract board, a job for another player to deliver these rifles to this planet's mailbox by this date. The reward money is held in escrow. You do have a deadline. If you don't do it in time, there is a penalty. You create these contracts for other people. We can also drop authored quests into that same system, but a huge amount of the point is to allow players to help drive the economy by creating contracts between themselves. These can involve delivering things, killing things, mapping areas, and so forth. There is a pretty wide array of things that you might need a contract for.</p>
<p><strong>Can the contract system be tied to PvP? Could you ask for a player or a player guild to be hunted down?</strong></p>
<p>It could, yes.</p>
<p><strong>We have talked about a lot of the sandbox content, but at some point, you have also mentioned potentially going into an underground alien laboratory. That sounded a lot like a dungeon. Are there traditional MMO-style dungeons in Stars Reach?</strong></p>
<p>Our procedural generation tech for the planets is capable of including handcrafted content into the planets, so we have the ability to insert things like crashed pirate ships, points of interest, alien labs, etc. into the maps when they are generated. All of these maps, by the way, they are not just random soup. They are the output of a toolchain where our designers define the important aspects. We need the canyons to be this wide that combat is fun. We need the mountains to have these kinds of slopes so that traversal is fun. We need this amount of space reserved for player housing and so on. It is a very sophisticated toolchain, and it can then insert that content in and that serves as the starting point. From that point forward, the simulation runs.</p>
<p><strong>Can players expect to be fighting big bosses if they want to?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, and I think an important thing for people to know is that we are not a game where you<br>
level up and get more hit points and gain power that way, so a big, tough boss is probably going to one-hit kill you. It is a very different feeling because it's a horizontal progression system. You advance through a skill tree progression where what you're doing is acquiring more capabilities.</p>
<p>Even though that boss might just stomp you with one foot, another player can just run up to you and one-touch revive you. The dynamics of combat are actually very different from traditional MMOs. It feels much more fluid and actiony and real-time than what I think people are used to. But yeah, there's absolutely huge bosses. They have different tactics. On every planet, the creatures come with different AI tactics. A lot of that stuff is generated along with the plane, so there is a lot of variety, and as you visit different worlds, you're going to have to relearn how to fight individual enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of combat, a lot of games in the MMO genre fall somewhere on the spectrum of the so-called Trinity (tank, DPS, healer/support). How does Stars Reach work in this regard?</strong></p>
<p>There are absolutely roles within combat, even though we are a profession-based skill tree system. Players can choose to specialize in the different professions. There are tracks for different kinds of combat tactics and so on. There are the usual kinds of things, like, I can learn how to stun enemies or blind them. There are things that come with our simulation. I can freeze them or set them on fire. A key thing here is I mentioned your tool belt earlier. You venture out from camps or cities<br>
with a loadout on your toolbelt and you only have the capabilities you take with you on that tool belt, and it is a fairly limited inventory. Right now, we let you take five different tools with you.</p>
<p>Those might be guns; they might be serving tools, crafting tools, harvesting tools, or whatever. But you have to make choices. Each of those tools has what we call special moves or capabilities that are associated with them. As you skill up, you get to decide what specials you take with you that you have attached to that tool. You end up with a hotbar of five tools and about ten specials, basically. There are some extra wrinkles to that. We have charged-up shots and a variety of other things like that. That is what your hot bar is like, so even if you learn a lot of different things while you are on an adventure, you are building a loadout for a specific role and there is that interdependence with party members. If you build a toolbar meant for a solo player, then you can go out and play solo. If you want to be essentially a DPS-type person, you build a toolbar full of DPS-type tools and moves and you go up that way, but that means you won't be able to do other things that you know how to do until you come back to camp or town and swap it out.</p>
<p><strong>Loadouts are swappable whenever you're not on an adventure, then?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, and these tools also have a socketing system. So you can actually custom design the way that your tools work as well.</p>
<p><strong>I'm guessing gear will be very important in Stars Reach. Do you have a rarity system?</strong></p>
<p>Everything in the game is crafted by players. Every piece of gear is customizable and has unique stats. So yes, the gear matters a lot. If you are a combatant, you depend on weaponsmiths for your<br>
weapons. Everything also can take damage and break. It might need repair. You might want to strip it and replace sockets in it. Those crafters, like the weaponsmiths, rely on the miners and the harvesters who bring them the materials. The miners rely on the people who map the planets and explore, and the explorers rely on the combatants. All these different ways to play are<br>
interrelated. We've set it all up in a large-scale economy, so yeah, gear matters a lot. If you venture out into different areas of the world, you're going to want to equip the right kind of gear for what you're doing.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Stars Reach Announcement Q&amp;A Video 4k" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7UzWbHa0bCY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Let's say you defeat one of those big bosses we talked about before. Will they drop just crafting materials rather than fully constructed items as in a traditional MMO?</strong></p>
<p>Mostly, we drop resources and materials. That said, the Old Ones and the servitors have left all kinds of technological components all over the place. Our creatures are smart enough to pick up interesting things and take them back to their lairs, so I wouldn't say that 100% of the loot is resources.</p>
<p><strong>One of the things that you mentioned in the video is that, just like in Star Wars Galaxies, there are many other professions, like Dancer. How do you plan to make them as fun as traditional professions?&nbsp; What kind of mechanics will there be, and do you have to sacrifice some of your combat proficiency to be a top-class performer, for instance?</strong></p>
<p>Stars Reach is, in many ways, the spiritual sequel to Star Wars Galaxies. We do have those kinds<br>
of things on our roadmap. We believe that peaceful play should matter just as much as the combat ways to play. We do not separate life skills into a separate track. If you want to be a player who plays entirely peacefully and never learns how to shoot a gun at all, that's fine. We think you should<br>
be rewarded by the game for doing that, be able to become wealthy and famous and progress that way.</p>
<p>We are currently looking at around 40 different professions that are spread across combat, social professions, entertainment professions, leadership, xenobiology, mapmaking, scouting and a wide area of crafting things. All of them are designed to provide either goods and services that matter elsewhere in the game, so every single one of them generates something that can result in you making money and getting progression.</p>
<p>You can learn all the skills in the game. You just can't have them all in practice at the same time. When you hit the cap on how many you can have in practice, you will have to start choosing which ones you keep active. If you want to reactivate something, it doesn't cost you anything but time. You don't need to re-level it or anything. You can just turn it back on. It will turn on after a certain amount of time in order to prevent people from cheating by just flipping everything instantly.</p>
<p>You can change your character over the course of a real-time week or something, but we let you basically fully respec your character. So yeah, you can learn everything, but you can't have all of it going at once. All the peaceful ways to play matter just as much and are on equal footing with the combat ways to play.</p>
<p><strong>It will be like relearning to ride a bike.</strong></p>
<p>That's exactly right. That's actually the logic we use.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Well, I might have a hundred more questions, but in the interest of time, I will narrow it down to a few more. When do you plan to open up Stars Reach for playtesting?</strong></p>
<p>We are starting limited testing with friends, family, and selected community members this Summer. If people are interested, they should wishlist us on Steam, sign up for our mailing list, and join our Discord because we will be starting to grab people out of the community sometime this Summer.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a roadmap for how long you plan to be in Pre-Alpha, Alpha, Beta, etc.?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>It is very dependent on testing, because you have to progress through the stages of testing and get the game right, which also means, of course, it's always dependent on money. But I would say we've got at least a year and a half of work to go.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to launch Stars Reach in early access?</strong></p>
<p>It's too early to talk about that.</p>
<p><strong>What about the business model?</strong></p>
<p>Business model-wise, we've currently modeled it out, not really inventing anything, just using standard business models from today. It will be free to play with a VIP subscription, which seems to be the standard. We are definitely avoiding any form of pay-to-win.</p>
<p><strong>Did you ever consider using Kickstarter or crowdfunding in general?</strong></p>
<p>Usually, people ask that more aggressively! We get asked, are you asking us for money? The<br>
answer to that is we are not asking you for money right now. We are announcing the game.</p>
<p><strong>How open are you to tweaking and modifying parts of Stars Reach based on the community's feedback?</strong></p>
<p>Very. The whole point behind announcing now while we are still in Pre-Alpha is so that players<br>
can collaborate with us on helping us make these systems what they can be, because we are making this game for players, not ourselves.</p>
<p>We have been very quiet until we could show the basics, show the innovation, show the new things we are doing. Now that we have all of that foundation in place, we are moving to an open development mode. Expect us to be blogging, posting videos and screenshots, showing things in development. Raw footage, all of that kind of thing, on a regular basis and involving the community in everything we do from here on out.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We have a lot of work to do still on the visuals and we know that. We are very upfront about that. There is lighting work, there's animation work. Our visual target is in the realm of Breath of the Wild, Genshin Impact, and Fortnite. That's kind of the area that we are aiming for. We are not there yet, but we are not done, and we are continuing to work on that.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Personally, if I may provide a piece of feedback, while I'm very excited about the feature set, I would say the visual style and animations still need a lot of work.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. All of that is still fairly early. In fact, when our website goes live, you'll even see an FAQ question there: are these visuals what it will be? We have a lot of work to do still on the visuals and we know that. We are very upfront about that. There is lighting work, there's animation work. There's a bunch of stuff we still need to do. With the general direction of the art style, we are not aiming for high realism. The instruction to the art department is to do to sci-fi what World of Warcraft did to fantasy, make it welcoming, colorful, and broadly appealing. High realism actually signals to the market that this is a game only for hardcore people, and that isn't really the game we are making. We want a game that you can jump in five minutes and have fun. Our visual target is in the realm of Breath of the Wild, Genshin Impact, and Fortnite. That's kind of the area that we are aiming for. We are not there yet, but we are not done, and we are continuing to work on that.</p>
<p>We also need to get the frame rate up. There's plenty of work left to be done. There's a few reasons why we aim for that kind of that target. There is an audience market reason, as I just said. Also, Because of the architecture, it actually is a lot harder and more expensive to do highly detailed textures and do full realism and also have a dynamic world. We make a trade-off choice between having a slightly more cartoony world and giving you flowing water, for example. We are putting our foot on the gameplay side. That's what we are doing. But we know that the graphics still need to get better for sure.</p>
<p><strong>I wanted to ask about the character creator and the number of races/species in Stars Reach.</strong></p>
<p>We are going to support a full morphing character creator, state-of-the-art, that lets you choose faces, height, weight, gender, expression, muscularity, all of those things that you expect. It's just not quite done yet. I'm not going to say how many player species are available because we are saving those back to do gradual reveals over time. There's several more than you have seen so far. But we are sticking to humanoids because we share all of the clothing and all of the gear works across all of the different choices. It lets us maximize that aspect of the economy.</p>
<p>It was actually a pillar for the game that all the characters should be cosplayable on a budget because we want to give that ability to players. We want to see them dressed up at Comic-Con and those conventions, so we stuck mostly to these fairly humanoid shapes.</p>
<p><strong>You're using <a href="https://wccftech.com/popul8-qa-how-generative-ai-can-solve-one-of-gamings-age-old-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Didimo</a>, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we're using them for the character customization. We have partnered with them pretty closely and have helped evolve their technology in order to support doing this at an MMO scale. They have been a wonderful partner.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about other uses of generative AI, like with NPCs? Is that something you'd be interested in adding to Stars Reach?</strong></p>
<p>As you know, the use of LLM and diffusion-style models is pretty controversial. Our game is built on AI. Obviously, the entire environment is AI, but it isn't LLM or diffusion-style AI. We currently do not use any of that in the game itself. This is much more a game about players taking most of the roles that NPCs usually do. That doesn't mean that there aren't any NPCs, but there are far more players in this game than there are NPCs, so that use case is not something that is really at the heart of what our game is.</p>
<p><strong>So there will be other NPCs in Stars Reach beyond the servitors you mentioned.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. There's a whole bunch of lore around not just the servitors, but also there are other genetic experiments that were created by the Old Ones that are out there. Various sorts of tentacle monster things that call themselves the Cornucopia. Expect to encounter more things.</p>
<p><strong>Raph, thank you a lot for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186549/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-summons-mimic-tear-difficulty-hard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="bXdhib"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a><em> </em>is already kicking players’ butts. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware">tough-as-nails DLC</a> takes a challenging game and makes it even more difficult. Players have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dlvwmy/miyazaki_is_laughing_at_our_optimized_builds/">making jokes</a> about how a character higher than level 500 and the strongest build in the game can get pulverized by a random creature in a field. Now that it’s out, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24186316/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-notes">FromSoftware has successfully solidified its reputation</a> for making difficult games yet again, but that’s not all. Players themselves and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24186312/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-difficulty-too-hard-git-gud">culture around FromSoftware games</a> can make playing <em>Elden Ring </em>even more difficult, since some players shame others for using <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/qtsyad/are_spirits_this_games_easy_mode/">certain items</a> or fighting styles. </p>
<p id="TBh79S">As FromSoftware developers have diversified the toolkits that players can use to beat their games’ many monsters, a subset of intense fans has responded by discussing which ways of beating the game are valid. Tools like the Mimic Tear Ashes can summon a duplicate of a player’s character to fight alongside them during a boss fight, or magical spells like Meteorite of Astel can fire a barrage of meteors against an enemy. These items exist within the regular base version of the game, but some people argue they can lessen specific challenges since they can be used from afar. Now, with the difficulty up even higher for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, prominent streamers and players on social media platforms like Reddit are taking to the platforms to discuss why it’s actually OK to use these tools — especially now that the DLC is even more difficult. </p>
<p id="HlQBca">Im_dontai, a streamer with more than <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/im_dontai">1.9 million followers on Twitch</a>, has been streaming the DLC since its release. In a clip, he pushed back on the larger culture of players who disapprove of using features like a magic build or the Mimic Tear and people complaining about the difficulty of the game. </p>

<p id="nbWeC2">“It’s because y’all are playing it the way that the internet is making you feel like you gotta play,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sukgumi/video/7383734081168608555">Imdontai said on a stream</a>. “Yo, no magic, no summons, no mimic, no armor. [...] The game is hard as hell, and I got my motherfucking Mimic by my side, bro. I’m playing how I want to play. I don’t care who calls me a bitch, and you shouldn’t either. Play the game how you want to play the game.” </p>

<p id="lm4IdG">The idea that <em>Elden Ring</em> should be played without summons originates prior to the release of that game and ties to a decade-plus-long conversation about difficulty in FromSoftware’s previous games. All modern FromSoftware games have included ways for players to get help with certain challenges, either by enlisting NPCs or other players to fight alongside them. <em>Elden Ring</em> also expanded much further upon the repertoire of fighting styles and magical powers available to players. Yet there are still some players who say that this isn’t the “right” way to play a FromSoftware game. If you had an issue beating a boss, magic and summons aren’t the answer. The proper response, according to die-hard fans, was to “git gud” and learn the proper patterns of attack for each boss without the need for magical ranged attacks, NPC summons, or (in the case of <em>Elden Ring</em>) spirit ashes. But now, players have their hands on the DLC, and it’s… well… really dang tough! So much so that it has sparked a larger conversation about the role of summons and other supports in the game. </p>

<p id="yeWzgA">Reddit user TheHessianHussar shared a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dmk313/to_everyone_still_not_using_summons/">post on Reddit</a> discussing summons that has been upvoted more than 11,000 times. “To everyone still not using summons.... Just do it. The game is literally balanced around them,” the user said. “I am myself an oldschool souls gamer and I was one of the people who refused to use summons, since I wanted to play the old way. The ‘ethical’ way I told myself. But let me tell you, they are no longer optional.”</p>
<p id="uOYahm">Commenters resonated with the general sentiment of pushing back against those who say you shouldn’t play the game with the additional support. One person responded by likening the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dmk313/comment/l9wm3yw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sentiment to</a> “low-self-esteem, insecure teenage bullshit,” and others said that people who don’t like players using summons can go “touch grace.” It’s not as if using sorcery and summons makes a difficult game that much easier; each player still has to learn how to fight each boss. Additionally, <em>Elden Ring</em> is largely a single-player game, and whether or not someone uses summons doesn’t impact other players.</p>
<p id="XIj40b">The Reddit post insinuated that you <em>need</em> summons to beat the DLC. That’s not exactly true, but maybe the time has come to simply let people play the game the way they want to. In cordial conversations about the idea of using no-summons runs in <em>Elden Ring</em>, some players have talked about how “rewarding” it can feel. Any way you play <em>Elden Ring</em>, whether you like it as a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22957071/elden-ring-torrent-ultimate-horse-companion">horse-girl simulator</a> or you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionsouls/comments/144eufw/my_elden_ring_fashion_gotos/">play it for the fashion</a>, the game can feel rewarding. You <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24184982/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-difficult-hard-boss">can even run away</a> and that’s still a valid way to deal with an overwhelming enemy! So now, at least some players are supporting each other — summons or not — in playing the game however each person wants to. </p>

  <p id="oZ88Ao"><small>This essay on </small><small><em>Devil in a Blue Dress </em></small><small>was originally posted in conjunction with the movie’s arrival on Netflix. It has been updated and reposted now that the film is leaving Netflix on July 1.</small></p>
<p id="16PYaG">One of the great mystery movies and neo-noirs of the late 20th century is leaving Netflix soon, featuring one of Denzel Washington’s finest roles. <em>Devil in a Blue Dress</em>, Carl Franklin’s adaptation of Walter Mosley’s excellent 1990 novel, is leaving the streaming service July 1. The movie is 100 minutes of atmospheric excellence. It’s tense when it needs to be, sexy when it wants to be, and always captivating. </p>
<p id="6jbmMp">In late 1940s Los Angeles, Denzel Washington is Ezekiel “Easy” Rawlins, a World War II veteran recently laid off and looking to make ends meet. When a friend introduces him to a private investigator looking to hand off a seemingly straightforward job — find a missing woman — Easy gets pulled into a web of conspiracies and deception, putting him in the crosshairs of some of the most powerful people in the city.</p>

<p id="G0JxLl">It’s a gripping story about postwar racial divisions in 1940s LA, and every element of the movie works in concert to create a complete picture of its main character and the world he inhabits. <em>Devil in a Blue Dress </em>fires on all cylinders, using every avenue available in cinema. Gorgeous cinematography, period-accurate production design, an evocative score, standout performances, sharp dialogue, and a whirlwind narrative all support and build on each other. There’s nothing extraneous in <em>Devil in a Blue Dress</em> — every single decision works together to create a larger whole.</p>
<p id="wLQZST">The film is particularly deft at displaying how Washington’s noir lead isn’t able to navigate the world in the same ways as white detectives in similar films, something Franklin was particularly interested in exploring within the movie.</p>
<p id="5oYCo8">“Obstacles are the key to drama,” <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/07/carl-franklin-interview-devil-in-a-blue-dress-and-denzel-washington.html">Franklin told Slate</a> in 2022, when the movie was added to the Criterion Collection. “If it was a Sam Spade character, you know there’s going to be the one cop who’s going to be cool with him, and the other cop is going to want to break his neck. In Easy’s case, both cops want to break his neck.” </p>

<p id="vuUZea">Easy is a rich role — a smart, caring man just trying to hold on to his life, serving the role of a detective without being part of the law enforcement system. Washington absolutely delivers on that role’s potential. He’s confident, calculating, effortlessly cool, and as sexy as he’s ever been. While Washington had already been nominated for three Oscars and won one (for <em>Glory</em>) by the time this movie came out, his star was still rising. It’s a joy to revisit that part of his career.</p>
<p id="IdN9cN">Washington’s striking performance is supported by excellent co-stars: Jennifer Beals gives a particularly alluring performance, and Washington has electric, instant chemistry with her and with Lisa Nicole Carson. Tom Sizemore oozes scuzziness<strong> </strong>as the duplicitous PI who hires Easy. And Don Cheadle steals the show in a minor role<strong> </strong>as Easy’s chaotic friend Mouse. Mouse is the kind of supporting role that allows for that, as the loudest, funniest guy in the room — and he won multiple critics’ awards for his performance.</p>

<p id="1zbJ5J">While <em>Devil in a Blue Dress </em>got positive reviews, it <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1817150977/weekend/">did not do very well at the box office</a>. Franklin <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/07/carl-franklin-interview-devil-in-a-blue-dress-and-denzel-washington.html">attributed that in part</a> to the release’s unfortunate proximity to the O.J. Simpson verdict announcement, which he feels complicated America’s feelings about a crime story ostensibly involving a Black man and a white woman. Franklin, who had previously directed the surprise-hit low-budget crime thriller <em>One False Move </em>starring Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton, never got to make another Easy Rawlins movie. He told Slate that Sony bought the rights to the first three books of the series, and the hope was to make it a franchise. (At the time, there were four books in the series. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Farewell-Amethystine-Walter-Mosley/dp/031649111X?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Farewell-Amethystine-Walter-Mosley/dp/031649111X?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23850768__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23850768__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">As of June 2024</a>, Mosley will have published 16 of them.) But <em>Devil in a Blue Dress</em>’ poor box-office performance stopped that plan right in its tracks. It’s a shame, because it’s easy to imagine how excellent a Washington/Franklin Easy Rawlins franchise could have been.</p>
<p id="95uind">If you end up falling for this movie too, the <a href="https://www.criterion.com/films/32355-devil-in-a-blue-dress">recent 4K release from Criterion</a> is well worth buying — it brings out Tak Fujimoto’s moody cinematography and the movie’s performances extremely well. But for now, check it out on Netflix while you can. It’s among <a href="https://www.polygon.com/21266801/best-movies-on-netflix">the best movies the service has to offer</a>. </p>
<p id="HlMVcS"><small><em>Devil in a Blue Dress </em></small><small>is leaving Netflix July 1.</small></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/is-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdree-too-difficult<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>FromSoftware has once again delivered a critical darling in Shadow of the Erdtree, its gargantuan DLC expansion for Elden Ring. But while it has received glowing adoration from professional critics, a not-insignificant slice of players have rallied against Shadow of the Erdtree’s difficulty. Perceiving its enemies and bosses to be so challenging that they make the game unfair, some fans have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-down-to-mixed-on-steam-as-players-complain-about-the-difficulty-and-performance">review bombed the DLC on Steam</a> and even <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-mods-have-begun-and-yes-most-make-it-easier">crafted mods for the PC version</a> that make the experience easier.</p><p>And so comes the inevitable question – is Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree too difficult? Has FromSoftware finally gone too far? The answer, at least according to the various journalists and Souls content creators I’ve spoken to, is no. However, the answer to Erdtree’s steep challenge lies in much more than that age-old, condescending advice of ‘git gud’. </p><h2>A Challenge Too Far? </h2><p>“I was surprised to see people passing judgement on the difficulty so quickly,” says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/vaatividya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VaatiVidya</a>, the YouTuber known for his meticulously researched <a href="https://youtu.be/DYDs_Inzkz4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FromSoft lore videos</a>, about the review bombing. “If you're up against something difficult, you need time to explore different areas or come up with a different strategy, and I think many critics were overlooking that.” </p><p>It’s easy to characterise some of that backlash as naivety. It is entirely unsurprising that Shadow of the Erdtree is difficult. Elden Ring is difficult, and so this DLC – locked behind two of the base game’s most challenging bosses – was bound to be a hurdle designed for the most dedicated fans. FromSoftware’s approach to DLC has always been to cater to those hardened players. In a list of the studio’s most punishing bosses, fearsome DLC foes such as Sister Friede, The Orphan of Kos, Ludwig The Holy Blade, and Darkeater Midir will all inevitably rise to the top. But it’s not just the bosses. Pushing forward through Dark Souls 3’s Ringed City and Bloodborne’s Fishing Hamlet is an uphill struggle thanks to tricky enemy placement and ‘mid-tier’ monstrosities that are practically bosses without ceremony. Such areas demand complete mastery of your abilities. There is no way to be ‘relaxed’ in FromSoftware’s expansions. By being more punishing than its parent game, Shadow of the Erdtree is merely following tradition. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There is something Elden Ring has that Dark Souls or Bloodborne never had, though: mass popularity. “I think the reality is that Elden Ring is the most successful game FromSoftware has ever released, and introduced literally millions of newcomers to the genre who’ve never played a FromSoftware game before,” says Matt Kim, IGN’s senior features editor. “Which means they’ve effectively dove straight into the hardest DLC the studio has ever produced. But there’s a progression here that they may have missed, with the Elden Ring DLC being harder than the Dark Souls 3 DLC, which was harder than the Bloodborne DLC which was harder than — you get my point."</p><p>Newcomers have been raised on what is the most approachable Souls-style game the developer has ever made – one with strong NPC allies available at beck and call, incredibly powerful magic and weapon skills, and an open structure that allows you to bypass bosses until you’re suitably ready. All this also exists in Shadow of the Erdtree, but so do the aforementioned increased difficulty traditions. And so fans have quickly discovered that the medieval superheroes they built and perfected, with stats stacked higher than skyscrapers thanks to countless hours spent grinding out runes, are now far from the devastating powerhouses they once were. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>By being more punishing than its parent game, Shadow of the Erdtree is merely following tradition. </p></div><p>“People have come up with builds that can shred [the base game’s] hardest bosses without breaking a sweat,” says Mitchell Saltzman, who <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">reviewed Shadow of the Erdtree for IGN</a>. “All of the weapons and talismans to complete those builds have been painstakingly mapped out and can be relatively easy to obtain, and there are rune farming spots that can skyrocket a player's level by the hundreds in just a handful of hours. So FromSoftware had to make this DLC difficult to account for all of the above.” </p><p>But while many a FromSoft veteran will have entered Shadow of the Erdtree with full understanding of this, they may have been surprised at just how quickly the height of that challenge smacks you in the face. When you stumble across the Western Nameless Mausoleum, the first optional location in Erdtree’s Land of Shadow, you’re forced into a fight with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Blackgaol_Knight">Blackgaol Knight</a> – a foe equally skilled at ranged and close combat. Inside his arena you are prohibited from summoning Spirit Ashes, Elden Ring’s NPC allies, and so you’re entirely on the backfoot. It’s like going back to level one all over again. And, in a way, you are. Progression works differently in this expansion. Your stat levels, earned over hundreds of hours by spending hard-earned runes, are… not exactly useless here, but less impactful. Instead, your ability to inflict and resist damage comes from Scadutree Fragments, a new collectible that increases your stats.</p><h2>A Blessing or a Curse?</h2><p>“A big part of the issue seems to be people not understanding the Scadutree Fragment mechanic, whereby your character gets stronger from the process of wide exploration,” explains VaatiVidya. </p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragment-locations-elden-ring-dlc">Scadutree Fragments</a> fit together to make Scadutree Blessings, which when used at a Site of Grace buff your character’s ability to both inflict and resist damage. The logic behind them makes a lot of sense: those aforementioned boss-shredding builds could steamroll through the DLC, bypassing the artistic intent of its many bosses and challenges. And so to ensure everyone experiences Shadow of the Erdtree as intended, FromSoft has put everyone back on a roughly even playing field from which only Scadutree Blessings will raise you up. In short: they made you start again from scratch. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“I think the Scadutree Blessing system is actually a pretty smart solution that allows Shadow of the Erdtree to be difficult right from the start, but also allow people to overcome that difficulty by doing the thing that Elden Ring has always been about: exploration, discovery, and being rewarded for your curiosity,” says Saltzman. “There are a ton of Scadutree Fragments that can be obtained right from the very start of the game, without even having to fight any of the big bosses that players seem to be getting stuck on.”</p><p>It is worth considering how that system impacts Elden Ring’s values of exploration and discovery, though. In the base game, simply playing is enough to acquire the runes needed to level up and become more powerful. But by locking increased stat power behind specific items located in specific places, Shadow of the Erdtree has arguably turned the entire experience into something of a scavenger hunt. The effect of this will vary depending on taste; for some, this further encourages exploration of a world that frequently rewards the curious. For others, it may turn any reward that isn’t a Scadutree Fragment into a disappointment, or even a waste of time.  </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’ve been getting a vibe check on people’s reactions to the DLC, and the one thing I keep seeing is people underestimating the impact of Scadutree Blessings. These make a MASSIVE difference and you CAN come back later. No, you don’t need to kill the lion or Rellana at the start. <a href="https://t.co/B6ZGivK1yh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/B6ZGivK1yh</a></p>— Iron Pineapple (@IronPineapple_) <a href="https://twitter.com/IronPineapple_/status/1804571725482311868?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Personally, I agree with Saltzman’s views on the Scadurtree Blessing. But while the system is certainly mechanically sound, it does function very differently to what players are used to. For those trained on not just Elden Ring but FromSoft’s historic reliance on traditional levelling, it may not be immediately clear just how vital to the experience the Scadutree Blessing truly is. A tool tip does explain that the blessing “bolsters the recipient’s abilities to deal and negate damage,” but – in FromSoft tradition – there’s little further information on the system to be found within the game itself. It’s been down to the <a href="https://x.com/IronPineapple_/status/1804571725482311868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-scadutree-blessings-are-the-answer-to-elden-ring-dlcs-difficulty">guides writers</a>, and even the <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1804630213562962043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bandai Namco X/Twitter account</a> to emphasise the Scadutree Blessing’s importance. It’s therefore  understandable that many people outside of those circles may have missed the very system designed to aid with Shadow of the Erdtree’s escalating difficulty. </p><h2>Beyond the Golden Path</h2><p>Another, less obvious contributor to Shadow of the Erdtree’s apparent difficulty is the community focus on boss fights. While these spectacular showdowns are Elden Ring’s centrepieces, it’s important to remember that they are the spine of the experience rather than the body. With so much discussion in the community around conquering each foe and getting closer to the final boss, it’s easy to be caught up in the need to speedrun through the chain of major fights. Down that path lies not just frustration, but a distraction away from a wider world that holds the many tools required to achieve an easier victory.</p><p>“I don’t enjoy spending four hours learning a boss,” says Daniel Krupa, IGN’s former <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@preparetotry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prepare to Try</a> loremaster and founder of the Souls-focussed YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RKG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RKG</a>. “I love exploring these worlds and piecing together the stories they tell, and I’ll do everything I can to make that easier. I’ll horde equipment, constantly reconfigure my Talismans, and over-level my weapons as quickly as I can. I still wouldn’t say I’m good at these games, but over the years, I’ve learned enough to survive.</p><p>“It’s what I always tell people who are interested in these games but put-off by the perceived difficulty,” he adds. “Yes, there’s no in-built ‘easy mode’ but you can make your experience far less punishing.”</p><p>“The online community has always been a huge help in this regard,” says VaatiVidya. “Making it clear how your build can be optimised, or telling you which things are overpowered. For example, the Mimic Tear summon, or the Blasphemous Blade. As the days go by, even more powerful things are being found in the DLC to make use of. If you're truly struggling, you can use these to move the difficulty level of the DLC more in line with your ideal level of challenge.”</p><h2>Remix and Retry</h2><p>Shadow of the Erdtree is full to bursting with a variety of exciting new weapons and talismans that can either boost your existing build or encourage a new one entirely. As a long-time Moonveil user with high intelligence and dexterity stats, I was delighted to discover the DLC features <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Carian_Sorcery_Sword">a thrusting sword</a> that can be used to <em>cast spells</em>. That’s a game changer, and has entirely altered my tactics when it comes to combat. But I know it won’t be a catch-all solution to every boss down the line, and that being open to experimentation is more valuable than ever in this expansion. </p><p>“I’ve got to the final boss,” says Krupa. “Yes, it’s tough – but I’m choosing not to suffer. I’ve always seen bosses in these games as problems to be solved, rather than gruelling challenges to overcome. So I’ll go explore the Cerulean Coast some more, and maybe I’ll find something that will help.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“I had a great experience against the final boss,” says VaatiVidya. “I had trouble, and so I switched up my build to incorporate a greatshield and Scarlet Rot [...] I like when bosses force you to switch up your strategy…however I wish an infinite source of Larval Tears could have been made available in the DLC, so people could have more freedom to test out different strategies.”</p><p>There are just 18 Larval Tears in Elden Ring – the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_Larval_Tear_Locations">item that allows you to reallocate your stats</a> – while Shadow of the Erdtree adds at least another nine. But that’s still a very limited number of times you can completely rebuild your character’s stats. It makes exploring other gameplay avenues a risky business. Sure, a new weapon may sound like the key to defeating a boss, but if respeccing your character to use it results in yet more defeat, then it’s a waste of precious resources. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I wish an infinite source of Larval Tears could have been made available in the DLC, so people could have more freedom to test out different strategies.</p></div><p>“They've made more Larval Tears available in the open world as they spawn at night time, which is great, but I personally would have loved if these could have respawned infinitely as a resource for players to make use of to overcome difficulty,” says VaatiVidya. Such a system would bring Elden Ring in line with other build craft-focused RPGs like Diablo 4, which allows for infinite reallocation of skill points and thus promotes freeform experimentation. It’s easy to see how Elden Ring could benefit from this, not just in regards to its difficulty, but in allowing players to experience its incredibly broad range of weapon types and approaches. </p><h2>Legitimate Concerns </h2><p>It’s clear that the key to success in Shadow of the Erdtree is the exact same as it was in its parent game: explore the world and the world will provide the answer. Elden Ring is not a boss rush, it is an open world game, and that structure is key to overcoming what can initially seem an overwhelming difficulty spike. </p><p>Despite this, everyone I’ve spoken to acknowledges just how challenging Shadow of the Erdtree is, especially in its later hours. “FromSoftware definitely skirts the line between fair and unfair with some of the later boss designs in particular,” wrote Saltzman in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">our review</a>, while Kim tells me that he thinks “FromSoftware pushed the envelope further in Shadow of the Erdtree, particularly with the final boss”. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Use the tools the game gives you, go explore, find Scadutree Fragments. You can do it. I believe in you.</p></div><p>That challenge scales with your New Game+ progress, too. If you’re on your second, third, perhaps even fourth or fifth run on the game, then your character will suffer more than those using a fresh save file. A future balance patch could potentially address this. “I've heard some complaints from a lot of people struggling on their NG+ characters, so I guess I could also see the effects of NG+ being toned down as it applies to the DLC areas,” VaatiVidya says.</p><p>There’s also the issue of Elden Ring’s performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aGwLmiWPGO0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> notes that, two-and-a-half years on from launch, the game still suffers from long-standing technical issues. Shadow of the Erdtree has come with no stability fixes. When perfect parries and desperate dodges are part of the game’s core fabric, an unstable frame rate is just as much the enemy as Messmer the Impaler. Without fixinging such long-standing performance woes on all platforms, FromSoftware is sadly leaving players vulnerable to frustrating defeats. These issues may not be an intentional increase in difficulty, but they can contribute all the same.</p><p>So far, there’s no indication that FromSoftware has any intention of reducing Shadow of the Erdtree’s difficulty. However, the studio has already responded to the playerbase: <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-first-patch-in-update-1122">in the DLC’s first update</a>, the buff provided by Scadutree Blessings has been increased for the first 10 you obtain. That’s half of the maximum blessing count. To balance this adjustment, the latter 10 will offer more gradual buffs, leading up to a slightly increased final blessing. The overall effect is that the initial areas of the DLC will feel more achievable, but the actual difficulty of the expansion overall remains the same. Of course, that additional level of ease will only be available if you actually engage with the Scadutree Blessings in the first place. Ignore that and you’ll still face the same issues that seemingly triggered the review bombing in the first place. </p><p>So, Shadow of the Erdtree is hard. We know it. You know it. FromSoftware knows it. As to if it’s too hard… well, that’s naturally a subjective topic. But from a purely design standpoint, the DLC’s approach continues in the lineage of both Elden Ring and its FromSoftware predecessors. </p><p>“It's not too hard,” concludes Satlzman. “Use the tools the game gives you, go explore, find Scadutree Fragments. You can do it. I believe in you.” </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

I outlined the fundamental problem facing game developers and publishers—the market is hugely overloaded with thousands of games, and players, statistically speaking, do not care about any new game. They won't even know about a game's very existence if it hasn't been heavily marketed. That's the grim reality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this "episode," I will discuss several factors shaping the gaming industry today and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The situation of gamers, who are becoming increasingly less forgiving and putting high pressure on publishers. I present some fundamental results of the market research we did on gamers as Try Evidence.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The emerging trend of publishers and investors becoming more cautious.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The industry's consolidation issue emphasizes that the economy (hopefully!) will be a driving force shaping the industry.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This article sheds a comprehensive light on today's market, leading to the last part of the series, which, in turn, touches upon opportunities and ideas on what to do and how to behave in such a challenging market.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Overloaded gamers"><span>Overloaded gamers</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like all consumers in an oversupplied environment, gamers are becoming increasingly choosy. Today, if you invest hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to get them to pay attention to your game, it still has a chance of success only if it is truly sensational. That is if it manages to defend itself against the increasingly exorbitant so-called points of parity - elements and features that a product must meet for its purchase to be even considered by consumers. For example, in a classic FPS game, there must be great shooting; the aiming must be precise, and&nbsp;the player must have a sense of firepower, recoil, etc. In a classic RPG, interesting quests must be&nbsp;consistent with the storyline, universe and, increasingly, unique side quests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unfortunately, today,&nbsp;we&nbsp;increasingly see that the level below which competing for gamers' hearts is difficult, and profitability is questionable, is 80 out of 100 in review aggregators.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's difficult for games rated between 70 and 80 points by the media to gain popularity, even if they are still considered good. And how many, even experienced developers today, can ensure a game landing with ratings above 80? Contrary to appearances, only a few. We frequently read about these teams, but it's important to note that they represent a small subset of the most commonly discussed groups. Meanwhile, players' expectations continue to rise, and&nbsp;the bar is getting higher and higher.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This&nbsp;means the need for another vast investment: in conceptualizing the game product, controlling its development, and its technical production. Every developer and publisher without a huge production budget today must make up for it with a competent team, wisely propose relevant innovations to players and positively surprise them, take care of the game's reception in the media from the beginning, build a community around it, etc. And, of course, count on the miracle of being noticed when the time of release comes, among thousands of other proposals for which the creators also followed these steps.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>We must also remember that today's gamer is a man with less and less time for individual activities, among which, in turn, there are more and more attractive leisure options.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How does a game have to present itself so that, first, it stands out among thousands of other games, and second, it encourages the consumer of culture to devote many hours just to it, not to watching movies, reading books, playing sports or other escapist hobbies, not to mention devoting time to family or daily obligations? Games compete not just with other games but with all entertainment in the broadest sense.</span></p><p>by Michał Dębek / Try Evidence CC BY-ND</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the research we at Try Evidence conducted in 2023, we asked gamers about other hobbies they regularly and most willingly indulge in. In the Polish part, nearly 60% of players watched movies or TV series - that's obvious. On the other hand, more than 40% also watched TV or read books! More than 1/3 enjoyed spending time shopping or playing on mobile devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>More interestingly, gamers who enjoy watching TV spend more time on TV in their average week than gaming, and playing on mobile consumes only a bit less time than playing on PCs/consoles.</span></span></p><p>by Michał Dębek / Try Evidence CC BY-ND</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This means that a game you've been producing for several years is also competing for the player's attention and time with other exciting activities from the player's perspective. In short, spending time with your game has to be more attractive than watching TV or streaming services.</span></p><p>by Michał Dębek / Try Evidence CC BY-ND</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is another severe challenge, especially for small studios. It will also become increasingly difficult because huge studios choose to fight for small niches in original ideas and unorthodox storytelling (see, for example, EA Originals). One friendly journalist put it this way: "Truly independent developers in this situation are not only fighting against AAA titles but also against 'AAA indies' that are backed by giga-corporations." In turn, these big games will increasingly take the form of never-ending stories, with many spin-offs, DLCs, etc., further consuming players' precious time and money.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Experienced marketers of large publishers know that it is much easier to succeed with even moderately successful games under a strong brand than with excellent games under a brand that has yet to be built.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, let's be honest – a player who sees an indie production often does not know they are looking at an indie game. A game is a game – it should be engaging, intriguing, operational on every device, and captivating. They expect&nbsp;AAA quality without realizing that the indie game being judged is not only separated by hundreds of additional positions of the world's best creators but also between, on average, 50-150 million dollars of production budget. Small developers and publishers have to come to terms with this.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Savvy publishers and investors"><span>Savvy publishers and investors</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By now, I'm sure almost all publishers and investors realize that financing underdeveloped games or investing in barely conceptualized games without strong brands and solid production facilities is fraught with huge risks. These risks steadily increase as the probability of success in such ventures dangerously moves towards zero.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>In 2023, Steam's turnover was $9 billion, but only ten games (!) accounted for more than 60%. This is despite nearly 15,000 games debuting on the platform that year. Over 50% of those games never earned more than $4,000, and over 2/3 didn't even reach $10,000 in revenue over their lifetime.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In contrast, in 2021, game purchases provided Activision Blizzard alone with $5.1 billion in revenue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To use the gold rush analogy: veins of gold do exist, but a select few reap them. Finding the next profitable venture requires courage, a budget, and much luck. Today, most investors and publishers tend to understand this and are more cautious in their investments than ever.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They carefully count every dollar, prefer proven intellectual property and create a climate of risk aversion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>To be considered seriously for funding nowadays, an indie studio should have a history, experience, a working prototype, a considerable wishlist, and an active community. All these factors are essential for the studio to establish its credibility.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This brings us back to the topic of marketing. In the current game development landscape, developers must thoroughly understand the market and at least have a reasonable marketing vision for their game. This is not only important for promoting the game in the target group but also for establishing credibility as a serious team in the eyes of publishers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While there's still room for exciting projects, new intellectual properties, and various gaming experiments, they must be grounded in market reality and thoroughly tested before anyone decides to invest in them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>It is crucial to give a reasonable answer supported by data when asked, "Why do you think this game will be successful?"</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Relying solely on historical sales data for similar games is no longer sufficient, as publishers now understand that past performance has limited predictive value. The gaming market is constantly changing, with several game launches changing the standards, which makes it difficult to estimate how gamers will behave in the future. To predict future gamer behavior, one needs to combine retrospective and historical data with prospective data derived from precise market research, usage and attitudes studies of gamers, and trend spotting.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Industry consolidation"><span>Industry consolidation</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I believe that the gaming industry is reforming and maturing as it undergoes a period of strict vetting for game ideas, production and publishing approaches, and financial assumptions, leading to a concentration in the long term. As one of my industry colleagues pointed out:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>"This process is likely to lead to a consolidation of the industry, similar to how the film industry consolidated in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, with a few major players emerging from a plethora of producers".</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These majors dominate the market and shape the industry's direction, much like Warner, Walt Disney, Universal, Columbia, and Paramount did in the film industry. This consolidation trend is happening again in the gaming industry, with the possibility of further expansion from giant Asian players like Tencent and NetEase. However, this may not necessarily have negative consequences for small studios. The larger entities are less agile, less willing to take risks, and less likely to enter small niches or change direction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>With the naked eye, you can see fewer fish from the bridge of a captain's tanker than through the window of a small fishing boat.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Small, well-organized, and well-structured marketing teams will still have a chance to coexist with industry giants.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the film industry, independent cinemas do not directly compete with multiplexes that screen blockbusters. Instead, indie movies and cinemas tackle unusual topics and controversial issues, use risky means of expression, present a unique sensibility, and target relatively small audiences that may not be attractive to giant studios and the mainstream. Similarly, in the gaming industry, smaller developers can propose unconventional and niche ideas that cater to specific audiences. However, they must know what they are doing, who and why their target audience is.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In our industry, numerous unconventional projects have delved into significantly niche topics, some of which have even succeeded. However, plenty of small developers still pitch their indie ideas as a combination of two or three AAA games, each of which has sold millions of copies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I think it will no longer be convincing to tell indie stories through the lens of AAA games and try to achieve grandiose productions with limited budgets and resources. This approach will naturally become outdated.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mid-range publishers and mid-sized developers are also likely to become a thing of the past. "Medium games" from medium-sized teams are often middling (i.e., rated around 75 in aggregators) and are looking for their imagined medium players. However, there is no such thing as an average player, so there is no demand for average games from average developers.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Reign of economics"><span>Reign of economics</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Representatives from traditional industries may consider it to be a cliché, but in game development, it's a daunting reality: the cornerstones of any new project are the budget, financial predictions, and the profit and loss Excel spreadsheet. Indeed, these elements are equally, if not more, vital than the industry's highly acclaimed artistic vision, its relentless energy, and its profound ambition.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The studios that survive in this industry's "small post-apo" will need to place greater stress than ever, not only on the uniqueness and sensibility of their games but also on the sound economic judgment of their production intentions and commercial plans.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A friend from the industry summed it up nicely: "If you spend five years making a non-AAA game, there is hardly any chance that the project will pay off. Many studios go bankrupt because they cannot develop a game that takes, say, two years and achieves an 80+ rating on aggregators." Moreover, game prices are not increasing. Gamers are waiting for discounts, which they are already very used to. In our lab interviews with gamers, we frequently hear that even if they like a game, they will not purchase it at full price because it will surely be discounted by a dozen or tens of percent soon. Moreover, the $19.90 price point will likely become increasingly popular for new game releases.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In recent years, many indie game developers have focused on creating larger, production-inflated, higher-quality games. They have been trying harder and harder to turn toward A+, AA, or so-called triple-I games. However, such projects are only profitable with tremendous promotional support.&nbsp;This has probably finally become obvious to most of the industry. In the future, AI may help speed up game production, allowing developers to create games faster and at a lower cost. But this could also lead to an influx of low-quality games flooding the market, making it more difficult for players to find valuable games among the masses of shovelware. As players are already overwhelmed with generic game clones, the impact of AI on game development could make the problem even worse.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our industry requires an army of professionals experienced in production organization, management economics, and data analytics. The time has come for game developers to create games not only based on creative ideas but also on financial data.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>We are about to witness a paradoxical situation in which game developers must invest more money to create unique gaming experiences for players while using less money to prove the return on investment.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studios that will survive must not only be ambitious and able to make a great game, or to build strong brands. They must also be financially responsible and well-organized and make decisions based on data gathered from international player surveys and continuous qualitative research, such as UX and mock reviews. As one of the producers friendly with me put it in a casual conversation: "From my perspective, the most difficult challenge in the coming years will not be to make a good game, but to make money from it; acquiring the right technologies or competencies is no longer as challenging as it once was. The quality of games is increasing, and many companies want to compete for the laurels of the best ones, but this drives up costs, which in turn raise the required break-even point for a project."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's possible that simple yet effective ideas, such as "back to simpler games," executed with a few people, will make a comeback. This is because money is expensive in our industry today, as mentioned in our discussions with investors and executive producers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">*</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the last part of this series, I'll present:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Excerpts from the market research focused on gamers that we performed as&nbsp;Try Evidence.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Opportunities and Ideas: "What to Do" (in this VUCA environment and challenging situation).</span></p></div></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>We’re coming to the end of this week’s heatwave in the UK, and there’s the blessed relief of cloud and wind compared to muggy, sunny heat. So much better!</p>
<p>Tempted as I have been to play PSVR 2 while sweating absolute buckets into an expensive bit of electronics, I have not done that. Instead I spooked it up with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/25/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review/">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a> – a handsome remaster, though one I felt could have been more ambitious – with the opening hours of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/26/steamworld-heist-2-preview-a-sequel-worth-diving-back-in-for/">SteamWorld Heist 2</a>, and a dash through classic Nintendo games with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/26/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-is-a-retro-speedrunning-paradise/">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</a>.</p>

<p>Also playing a SteamWorld game was <strong>Aran</strong>, who is approaching the end of SteamWorld Dig 2 and enjoying mining everything he can to power up. Alongside that, he’s also approaching the end of Assassin’s Creed Mirage, where he’s picked up most of the collectibles.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> and his partner have been hacking and slashing their way through Diablo 4 –&nbsp;“It’s surprisingly complex and menu filled for a game that is ostensibly about mashing the same few buttons again and again but we are getting the hang of it. Her Necromancer and my Druid are proving quite the dynamic duo, level 30 already!”</p>

<p>Incidentally, they are actually playing this as a romantic couple in their head-canon, though it’s more a great tragedy than a rom-com, because “they can never touch, the game insisting they pass through each other, like glitchy ghosts.”</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> wrapped up Death Stranding, but has mixed feelings on it: “Some really interesting and unique concepts at play with evocative visual design and world-building though the novelty gradually wore off, especially in those later chapters where Kojima insists on having you sit through lengthy cutscenes. Some of the more poignant moments were lost on me as certain plot details went over my head though – after sitting through multiple YouTube explainers – I ended up liking the story overall. Fascinated to see what’s planned for Death Stranding 2.”</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> handed in a pair of reviews for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/ea-sports-f1-24-review/">EA Sports F1 24</a> and for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review/">Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</a>, enjoying them both, while <strong>Steve</strong> stepped back two decades to play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/25/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-review/">Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</a> remaster which was just as fun as he remembered it being.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-special-launch-program<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're just a week or so away from&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>'s release, and ahead of the game's launch, developer HoYoverse has revealed some exciting new details about what you can expect from this latest project.</p>
<p>In a special pre-release livestream, HoYoverse revealed new information about&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>'s story, as well as some of the areas you'll get to explore and the Agents you'll get to recruit to your team.</p>
<p>First up, the developer went into detail regarding the game's setting.&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>takes place in a world that has been destroyed by mysterious anomalies known as Hollows, and it's these dark spots that players, who take the role of Proxies, will have to explore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-new-details-hollows.jpg?itok=c75FHO1Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-new-details-hollows.jpg?itok=N8Q6BIKG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>'s Hollows are no laughing matter.</figcaption></figure><p>Inside Hollows, you'll find mutated monsters called Ethereals, as well as a resource called Ether, which corrupts any living creature found within a Hollow (but which is also a critical part of hub city New Eridu's ability to thrive).</p>
<p>We also got a look at the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-by-genshin-honkai-developer-shows-minigames-stylish-action-combat">satisfying-looking combat</a>, which, like other HoYoverse games, will revolve around building a team of Agents who complement each other's skills.</p>
<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>will feature a parrying system that allows you to switch Agents in response to an enemy's attack, triggering an assist that deals extra damage. If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review-die-twice-by-sword">Sekiro</a>&nbsp;</em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stellar-blade-review-mother-sphere-knows-best"><i>Stellar Blade</i></a>, you'll be familiar with the mechanics here.</p>
<p>The livestream also showed off some of the areas you can look forward to exploring in HoYoverse's latest game, including the urban district of Lumina Square and the forward operational base of Scott Outpost.</p>

<p>Two new Agents, Lucy and Piper, were revealed during the stream, and they'll serve alongside the game's other Agents as recruitable characters for your squad.</p>
<p>What's more, HoYoverse also revealed a special redemption code to thank fans for watching the livestream.</p>
<p>Once&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>goes live on July 4th, inputting the code "ZZZFREE100" will get you 300 Polychromes, 30,000 Dennies, 2 Senior Investigator Logs, and 3 W-Engine Energy Modules. The code is valid until July 11th, so make sure you've used it before then!</p>
<p>That, of course, is in addition to the bonuses you can already receive just by checking out the game at launch, which you can see over on the official&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em><a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, it's the newest project from&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse. It's an action RPG with combat inspired by character action games like&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>, as well as a diverse <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-by-genshin-impact-developer-show-anbys-stylish-moves-in-spectacular">cast</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-by-genshin-impact-developer-showcases-catgirl-nekomata">characters</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-by-genshin-impact-developer-reveals-billy-kid-and-closed-beta-date">unlock and use</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warzone’s Original Map ‘Verdansk’ is Set to Return in 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warzone%E2%80%99s-original-map-%E2%80%98verdansk%E2%80%99-is-set-to-return-in-2025.914238/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Last night, several new rumors surfaced stating that Call of Duty Warzone’s original map ‘Verdansk’ has been delayed from its December 2024 target to “early 2025”.</p>



<p>The news came courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@BobNetworkUK</a> on Twitter, which Insider Gaming has been able to verify.</p>



<p>In December 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-map-verdansk-return-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> that Verdansk would return as the title’s main map during Black Ops 6. As reported, we couldn’t verify the exact release date of Verdansk but understood that the game was to follow Warzone’s traditional ‘main map’ release schedule and be released in December 2024 – a seemingly missed target. </p>



<p>Sources have since revealed that Verdansk was never actually intended to return to Warzone, despite the previous rumors. Instead, there was a massive pivot in late 2023 due to Fortnite OG. Fortnite OG saw the return of Fortnite’s original map, which saw the game have a gigantic resurgence of players and create the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-player-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest day ever in Fortnite history</a>, with 44.7 million players. Understandably, it’s a metric that Actviision wishes to replicate.</p>



<p>The pivot meant that Warzone’s 2024 mainline map, ‘Avalon’ (it’s unclear if that’s the final name), has been pushed back to 2025’s Call of Duty, codenamed ‘Saturn’. It’s understood that Avalon is nearly complete, but Activision is adamant to see a massive resurgence in players. In part, it could be because Call of Duty 2025 will already be leaning heavily into nostalgia with its multiplayer offering.</p>



<p>Officially, Activision has yet to comment on any of the rumors, but a few subtle remarks from marketing could suggest that information on Warzone could come at a much later date than usual. During the Black Ops 6 direct, it was announced that Call of Duty NEXT would feature the full reveal of Black Ops 6 multiplayer, whereas, in the past, they’ve also announced that the event will contain “the future of Warzone.” In addition, one developer during the direct asked production, “Am I allowed to talk about Warzone yet?”, in which a firm “no” can be heard from those behind the camera. Coincidence? I think not!</p>

            <link>https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-benefits-of-working-remotely-gi-sprint</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-benefits-of-working-remotely-gi-sprint.914232/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-benefits-of-working-remotely-gi-sprint<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>During the pandemic, studios quickly adapted to working remotely. This way of operating seems to have stuck, with many studios opting to stay fully remote rather than returning to the office.</p>
<p>Two developers that have adopted this way of work are Bossa Studios and FuturLab, both based in the UK with employees working remotely worldwide.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>for <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/events/gi-sprint-summer-2024">GI Sprint</a>, Bossa co-founder and CEO Henrique Olifiers and FuturLab head of production Toby Adam-Smith discuss the benefits of working remotely, and how teams can still maintain a creative and collaborative environment online rather than in an office.</p>
<section>
<ul>
<li><a href="#section-1">Adapting from office to remote working</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-2">Maintaining vision alignment</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-3">Efficiency of remote working</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-4">Importance of communicating clearly online</a></li>
</ul>
</section>
<h2 id="section-1">Adapting from office to remote working</h2>
<p>Adam-Smith notes that in an office setting, producers and managers would be able to notice small things during production such as "spotting something on a person's screen, or overhearing a conversation and being able to jump in [to] help or provide feedback."</p>
<blockquote>"So long as employees are empowered and understand shared visions and goals, they find the best way to work to achieve them"<p><cite>Toby Adam-Smith</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>"In this way, progress and issues would often be shared and raised organically regardless of your project or discipline," he says.</p>
<p>FuturLab has tried to find similar ways of implementing this sort of collaborative nature in remote work, and found that embracing an open environment online was the solution.</p>
<p>Adam-Smith suggested using communication channels such as Slack, and more recently Gather, to enable teams to share thoughts and ideas as they would've done in an office environment.</p>
<p>"Trust is so important with remote working, and we trust that our team shares our vision and goals, and make it everyone's responsibility to deliver on them," Adam-Smith explains.</p>
<p>"So long as employees are empowered and understand shared visions and goals, they find the best way to work to achieve them."</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Maintaining vision alignment</h2>
<p>Not being in one place to work as a team can affect vision alignment during development, which is something Olifiers has recognised since going fully remote. (Vision alignment is a challenge in itself that we <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/getting-your-game-vision-right-at-the-concept-stage-gi-sprint">tackled in a previous GI Sprint session with Graham McAllister</a>).</p>
<p>"If you're not careful, misalignment results in people working in silos and focusing on things that either aren't a priority, or not at the quality needed for release," he says, adding that it was easier to spot these issues in an office rather than a remote setting.</p>
<p>However, Olifiers says that Bossa has utilised a variety of different methods to combat this.</p>
<p>This includes workshopping ideas and features at the beginning of development which are revisited throughout, and asking player-centric questions such as, 'What is the feeling you want while playing this feature?' and 'What sense of accomplishment should the player have?'.</p>
<p>Bossa also breaks teams down into groups with differing skill sets, which it had in the office and has been transferred to Slack channels.</p>
<p>"It's improved communication, as the track record means things aren't missed if you've gone to make a coffee – It's more asynchronous and flexible," Olifiers explains.</p>
<p>"Work is actively encouraged to be shared in these channels. People can give feedback, calls can be started so several people can share screens and collaborate. Playtests take place in Discord with ease, which is simpler than gathering people in a meeting room and running the game."</p>
<p>Overall, workshopping and breaking teams down "reduces the chance of misalignment between people," Olifiers notes.</p>
<p>"This in turn reduces the likelihood of revisiting features, improves bug fixing time and ensures everyone rows in the same direction."</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Efficiency of remote working</h2>
<p>Working efficiently as a remote studio comes down to using the right tools. Olifiers highlights that workshops around a Miro board (or a similar virtual workspace app), play sessions via Discord, and using a project tracking app like Jira all helps streamline workload and keeps teams on top of what they're working on.</p>
<p>"It all collaborates to create a fairly seamless setup which unlocks efficiency if well managed and culturally aligned," he explains.</p>
<p>Olifiers says there are "natural advantages" to working remotely when it comes to productivity, such as being able to focus without distractions from an office environment. But that all depends on a "good set up at home, with separation from domestic life."</p>
<blockquote>"[Using the right tools can] create a fairly seamless setup which unlocks efficiency if well managed and culturally aligned"<p><cite>Henrique Olifiers</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>It's also worth acknowledging that it can be down to personal preferences, with some people finding remote working more difficult for their mental health, for instance.</p>
<p>Working remotely can also add benefits to life outside of work. Olifiers notes the removal of commute time, for instance.</p>
<p>"Family life improves, so does happiness and job satisfaction," he says. "All these contribute to a better balance, translating in more focus and efficiency."</p>
<p>For Olifiers, the key to unlocking this productivity is making communication the highest priority.</p>
<p>"When people understand the decisions that are made, and are pulling the right way, you build on a strong foundation," he explains. "Things unravel very quickly otherwise, and it's easier to happen when working remotely."</p>
<p>Adam-Smith agrees, adding that it's important to have collaborative meetings to maintain this efficiency. He uses art and design as an example, where people can draw over each other's work during meetings.</p>
<p>However, he does note that the focus that can come from working alone can lead to issues with the length of work days.</p>
<p>"It can be very isolating working alone and some people may not be able to stop themselves from working longer hours than they should be," he says. "Give people the benefit of the doubt, and if something goes wrong, try to stop yourself from thinking, 'This wouldn't have happened if we were all on-site."</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Importance of communicating clearly online</h2>
<p>For both studios, communication tools such as Slack, Discord, and Google Meet have become essential in conducting meetings online that are catered to the situation at hand.</p>
<p>Olifiers recommends keeping meetings short with clear agendas, with only relevant people in attendance. He advises that studio-wide meetings should involve the entire team to keep them up to date with what's going on during development.</p>
<p>Adam-Smith notes that it's essential for everyone to feel as though they have an opportunity to contribute.</p>
<p>"In larger meetings – virtual or otherwise – leads and senior leadership may spend more time in the spotlight, so try to keep the door open and encourage others to present work they're proud of or raise concerns," he says.</p>
<p>"While this is good practice for any studio, it's even more important when it's so easy for team members to go unnoticed outside of their immediate team."</p>
<p>Adam-Smith advises to ensure the team is working in an environment that "has the infrastructure and freedom for employees to talk to one another as often as they would like, then create as many opportunities to check in with one another as is reasonably appropriate."</p>
<p>Being open to new approaches and recommendations in communication from the team is equally as important, and FuturLab does this by running surveys.</p>
<blockquote>"Try to keep the door open [during larger meetings] and encourage others to present work they're proud of or raise concerns"<p><cite>Toby Adam-Smith</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>The studio also has a dedicated welfare manager to "drive social and wellbeing-focused communication" among the teams, and to help "break down barriers and connect members who historically may have only interacted while waiting for the kettle to boil."</p>
<p>Both Olifiers and Adam-Smith advocate for regular in-person meet-ups. Bossa has entire team meet-ups four to five times a year, alongside leadership meetings every six weeks, and individual teams getting together between bigger company meetings.</p>
<p>For Olifiers, in-person meetings are "key for strategic discussions, creative direction and overall creating bonds with people."</p>
<p>However, Adam-Smith says to be careful about making meet-ups mandatory, and to take travel time into account.</p>
<p>"If getting together is deemed essential, cover the costs of longer-distance travellers and enable them to commute during work hours," he says. "If you are getting together, the social element is as important as any meeting or discussion, so try to time it to have something to celebrate."</p>

            <p>A live-action Street Fighter movie is set to hit a screen near you in 2026.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-release-sony-1235933496/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the new film based on the fan-favourite fighting game is slated to release on 20th March 2026.</p>

<p>We knew a movie was coming - just a day after Legendary Entertainment announced it had secured the film and television rights to Capcom's Street Fighter series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-and-tv-rights-bought-by-legendary-entertainment">the company announced plans to create a new live-action movie</a> - but this is the first time production company Legendary, which is running the project alongside Capcom, has shared a release date.</p>
<p>Of course, this won't be the first time Street Fighter has been adapted for the big screen - the 1994 film Street Fighter attracted a star-studded cast with Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue, among others, but it bombed at the box office.</p>
<p>Then, in 2009, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li was released with Kirstin Kreuk in the title role, but that too flopped.</p>
<p>This won't be the only video game adaptation to grace the silver screen in 2026, by the way - the sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">The Super Mario Bros. Movie now has a firm 2026 release date</a>, too.</p>
<p>In a "this is Miyamoto" social post ahead of last week's Nintendo Direct, the Mario creator revealed the full release date for the animated film sequel will 3rd April 2026 in the US, 24th April 2026 in Japan, and "other countries and regions" during April 2026.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 is out now across PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-devs-community-manager-apologises-says-fans-continuously-getting-fed-false-hope-of-sequel<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The community manager for Days Gone developer Bend Studio has apologised to fans. The reason for this apology? Because they are "getting fed false hope and poor information by people looking for likes".</p>
<p>In a post on social media platform X, Kevin McAllister said this kind of behaviour is "not fair" to fans of Days Gone, who are eager to hear more news about more games in the series. This is something that is not on the cards.</p>
<p>While McAllister did not name any names in his post, earlier this week former studio director <a href="https://x.com/John_Garvin/status/1805083382327718080">John Garvin</a> said he had written Days Gone with a cliffhanger "with the full intention of there being a trilogy (NOT just a sequel)". This comment was subsequently picked up by fans and outlets.</p>

<p>"All these type of headlines originate from previous developers, which puts us in a bad position," McAllister continued in reply to another user. "Like I said, people need likes. Time to move on."</p>
<p>Garvin has long shared his disappointment that Days Gone was not better received by Sony and critics. In 2022, Garvin controversially stated the reason the game didn't receive universal acclaim was because of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-wasnt-a-hit-because-reviewers-were-too-woke-director-claims">"woke reviewers" and reviewers who "couldn't be bothered to actually play the game"</a>. Garvin also criticised the game's programmers, blaming "tech issues" such as "bugs, streaming and frame rate" for Days Gone's middling reception.</p>
<p>That same year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-director-says-local-studio-management-always-made-us-feel-like-it-was-a-big-disappointment">fellow Days Gone director Jeff Ross</a> said "local studio management always made us feel like it was a big disappointment", and called Sony's decision not to greenlight a sequel "weird".</p>
<p>Both Garvin and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-director-joins-tomb-raider-studio-crystal-dynamics">Ross have since moved on from Bend Studio</a> to persue other projects, though both still regularly post about Days Gone on their socials.</p> <div>

            <p>The makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> host a podcast every once in a while, in which the studio's developers chat about what's going on in the company. In the latest episode, they're discussing their (relatively new) Boston studio and how it's spearheading the as-yet-enigmatic sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. There's a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer's earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG's shortcomings. </p>
<p>"I see that we didn't push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance," said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  "Like, let's say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I'm like, we weren't far enough in '77. We thought that we were dystopian, but... we just touched the surface."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The general hope aired in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBpEDCZMvo">the podcast</a> is that, now that they have a studio in the US, the creators can make the sequel more true-to-life, and engage more deeply in some issues the first game didn't address. The planned sequel is internally called "Orion" and we don't know much about it yet, except that it has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-and-control-writer-joins-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">the lead writer of Control at its narrative helm</a>. </p>
<p>"I think the really cool thing about Cyberpunk - and the dystopian future that it has - is there's so much relevance to today, of megacorporations, of people on the fringes, you know, of people just being exploited resources, of the wealth gap, of all these things," said Dan Hernberg, Acting Executive Producer on the sequel.</p>
<p>"I think that Cyberpunk allows us to tell these stories in ways where... at the heart of it there's always relationships and people, but we're in a really broken world and that we can call out some of these things.</p>
<p>"I think for me that's what Cyberpunk is about, exploring those themes but in a very poignant way... and I think that's what we're going to try to do with project Orion. Really continue to lean into that..."</p>
<p>It isn't the only way in which the studio claims its new North American home will aid in creating a lifelike world for the sci-fi follow-up. They want to avoid another "manhole debacle".</p>
<p>"I mean, there's this interesting story after the release of Cyberpunk that blew up on Reddit at some point, and it's the manhole debacle," said Sasko. "I remember there was this post [with] the guy saying that there is this immersion-breaking bug in Cyberpunk... that the covers for manholes for a sewer were the manholes that you use normally in Europe, in Germany, for a pavement. Those are not manholes that you normally [use] in America on the streets."</p>
<p>It's a pretty minor fault, and it reminds me of recent comments by Dragon Age producer Mark Darrah, claiming that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blockbuster-games-are-in-the-grip-of-a-fidelity-death-cult-says-former-dragon-age-producer">blockbuster games are in the grip of a high-fidelity death cult</a> - an exhausting and unwinnable race to be more and more realistic. Personally, I like a broad range of art styles in the industry, and don't want to see games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review">opting for hyperrealism</a> disappearing. But we can forgive a manhole cover, surely.</p>
<p>As for homelessness in the US, that's a disaster visible to anyone who sets foot in the country, and won't be solved in an article about video games. It will likewise be a difficult issue to address within the context of an often ridiculous RPG world full of talking vending machines and routinely exploding heads. There's no reason to believe this issue will be a huge part of the sequel's storytelling, to be clear (Sasko doesn't mention it with that significant a tone). The intention may be as simple as including a greater number of homeless NPCs in the sequel. Whatever the case, it is at least something they are thinking about. And considering how closely everything about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lets-chat-about-the-cyberpunk-2077-demo">Cyberpunk 2077 was watched</a>, and how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trans-representation-in-cyberpunk-2077-matters-but-not-because-its-cyberpunk">fiercely it was interpreted</a>, it makes sense that the company may want to leverage the cultural sensibilities of its US employees in any way that may be helpful. </p>

  <p id="jfe1yl">Publisher Wizards of the Coast has spent the last few years targeting two very different segments of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mtg-magic-the-gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a><em> </em>audience. On the one hand, you have the multiplayer style of play called <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/28/21266763/magic-the-gathering-commander-origins-elder-dragon-highlander-alaska-menery">Commander</a>, arguably the game’s most popular <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23643684/magic-gathering-oathbreaker-format-announced">format</a>. On the other hand, you have the ambitious <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24071837/mtg-universes-beyond-two-per-year-lotr-final-fantasy-fallout">Universes Beyond</a> products, designed to turn the heads of lapsed fans and non-players alike with products that support multiple styles of play. Now the trading card game is returning to its roots with a new set called <em>Foundations</em>, a collection of cards and a curated play experience custom-built for newcomers.</p>
<p id="AW1uJb"><em>Foundations</em> launches on Nov. 15, and will have all the trappings of a mainline set release — that includes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23915789/mtg-draft-boosters-set-boosters-discontinued-what-is-a-play-booster">Play boosters</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23771472/mtg-lotr-collector-booster-box-prices">Collector boosters</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/21/21147560/magic-the-gathering-new-format-jumpstart-boosters">Jumpstart boosters</a>, and Bundles as well as all the same pre-release pomp and circumstance as any other new set of cards. But it will also feature two new-to-<em>Magic</em> products: a <em>Beginner Box</em> and a <em>Starter Collection</em>.</p>

<p id="WHgOSK">Wizards’ game design director Bryan Hawley told Polygon that the <em>Beginner Box</em> will include 10 packets with 20 cards inside each one, with two packets for each of <em>Magic</em>’s five colors of mana. Using a mix-and-match system originally designed for the Jumpstart product line, players will be able to combine and recombine those 10 packets into many different kinds of decks. At least some of those packets will be pre-shuffled, with the intent that players will first open and explore them alongside a detailed, step-by-step written tutorial.</p>
<p id="H2D3Rr">“One of the things that <em>Foundations</em> is really trying to do differently than any of our past attempts at an onboarding experience,” said Hawley, “is to really focus on that full pathway, [taking a new player from] <em>I am interested in Magic, but I don’t know anything!</em> up through <em>Oh, I’ve identified what I like to do and I’m going to do more of that!</em> So the <em>Beginner Box</em> is a significantly more built-out experience that has a lot more content [than previous <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/23766947/magic-the-gathering-tales-of-middle-earth-lotr-deck-analysis-building-photos">starter sets</a>]. You can play dozens of games straight from the box.”</p>

<p id="sIhdQD">Once players have mastered the <em>Foundations Beginner Box </em>of 200 cards, then they can move on to the <em>Starter Collection</em>. That 350-card box will help them to expand on the themes and techniques they’ve already discovered, while also serving to keep them well within the warm embrace of a kind of estuary — a place of calm that should remain stable even as multiple new sets of cards are released year after year.</p>
<p id="hH2ytm">That long-term stability is a new feature for <em>Magic</em> as a whole. When a new set of cards is released it only remains viable — that is, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmagic.wizards.com%2Fen%2Fformats&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24187331%2Fmtg-foundations-announcement-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23951372__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24187331/mtg-foundations-announcement-release-date-price&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23951372__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24187331/mtg-foundations-announcement-release-date-price&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">“legal” to play in certain formats</a> — for about three years. Hawley said that cards from the <em>Foundations</em> set will be legal to play until at least 2029, or nearly twice the usual length of time.</p>
<p id="inK96J">“Our hope and intention is that as long as the set continues doing its job,” Hawley said, “helping new players learn the game, get acclimated to the game, and find what they like about the game — <em>and </em>being that foundation for Standard in general — it will continue to remain Standard-legal.”</p>
<p id="3T3hx2"><em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em>’ <em>Beginner Box</em> will retail for $29.99, while the larger <em>Starter Collection</em> will cost $59.99. Expect more information from Wizards in the lead-up to the release this fall. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-developer-of-tribes-3-has-ditched-the-game-just-3-months-after-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The developer of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tribes-3-rivals">Tribes 3</a> has signaled plans to move on from the game after it failed to find an audience.</p><p>Tribes 3 launched in March on Steam <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tribes-3-rivals-early-access-review">billed as the triumphant return of the fast-paced multiplayer first-person shooter</a> series whose games were popular in the late 90s and early 2000s. But despite a ‘mostly positive’ Steam user review rating, player numbers were extremely low. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2687970/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, Tribes 3 hit a peak of 890 concurrent players on Valve’s platform upon launch, with just 26 concurrent players at the time of this article’s publication.</p><p>Developer Prophecy Games issued an <a href="https://www.tribes3rivals.com/news/tribes-3-player-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">update</a> to say neither Tribes 3 or its prior game, the already shuttered Starsiege Deadzone, saw enough success to justify the team’s continued focus. As a result, it’s giving those who’ve spent money in those games credits towards its upcoming fast-paced 3v3 sports shooter Ultra Strikers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“These credits are meant to give back to players who supported us in early development,” Prophecy Games said. “We’re doing our best to support Tribes 3 with limited updates (along with an upcoming discount sale to bring in more players), and plan to return to Starsiege Deadzone once the company has the resources, but unfortunately neither game had enough success yet to support the studio and can’t be our main development focus right now (as much as we love them).</p><p>“Thank you for your support. Going forward, we’ll continue to focus on updating existing games as much as we can, while creating new games players enjoy. We love making games, we love playing games, and thanks again for giving our games a shot and being part of the community!”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Unfortunately neither game had enough success yet to support the studio and can’t be our main development focus right now.</p></div><p>Over the last few weeks, even before the release of this latest statement, some Tribes 3 players had hit out at Prophecy Games for what they considered to be an "abandonment" of the game. Tribes 3, down to a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam for recent reviews, is not a free-to-play game, although it does feature various microtransactions.</p><p>One player with over 250 hours on Tribes 3 left a negative review that detailed a number of issues with the game and Prophecy’s management of it, hitting out at the lack of updates and various broken promises.</p><p>“Matches are largely against either extremely veteran players clinging to their last laughable hope that this game will somehow become something that the public cares about, or bots, so have fun either being completely stomped, or completely stomping the other team,” the Steam user said.</p><p>It’s a sad end to Tribes 3 after just three months of early access, and a potential death knell for the once-popular franchise. Prophecy Games will of course be pinning its hopes on Ultra Strikers, although after what happened to Tribes 3 it has work to do to win back player trust.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Don't Nod has pushed the launch of its upcoming new IP Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage in order to avoid clashing with the next instalment of Life Is Strange – which was originally developed by Don't Nod.</p>
<p>In a press release, the company said Lost Records had been delayed from a 'late 2024' window to 'early 2025' following "an in-depth assessment of recent trends and developments in the industry."</p>
<p>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, developed by Deck Nine and revisiting characters from the Don't Nod original, is currently set to release on October 29. Don't Nod said the delay to Lost Records should benefit both titles.</p>
<p>"We know that many of our fans are eagerly awaiting this game, just as they are the recently announced next installment of Life is Strange," said Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert. "Let's give both titles the space they need to be enjoyed by our players within the large community we have built.</p>
<p>"We firmly believe that the wait for Bloom &amp; Rage will be worth it. We look forward to sharing this new adventure, which we hope will become another memorable chapter in the Don't Nod universe."</p>
<p>Like Life Is Strange, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage is a narrative adventure that follows a group of teenagers caught up in a mystery involving supernatural elements.</p>

            <p>After half a decade in the wilderness, Alpha Protocol is back on Steam.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/34010/Alpha_Protocol/">Sega pulled Alpha Protocol from sale way back in 2019</a> due to the expiry of music rights, and whilst it returned to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-espionage-rpg-alpha-protocol-returns-to-pc-following-2019-licensing-drama">GOG back in March</a>, Obsidian's fan-favourite spy RPG was still curiously missing from Valve's storefront. Until now, that is.</p>

<p>Surprised? You're probably not alone. There doesn't seem to have been a formal announcement anywhere, and according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/34010/history/">SteamDB</a>, Alpha Protocol's Steam backend hadn't been touched for months until a flurry of changes in June signalled something was afoot.</p>
<p>Alpha Protocol sees you play as agent Michael Thorton, a "talented young agent cast out by his government". The only one with the information needed to prevent the obligatory international catastrophe, Thorton's forced to "cut himself off from the very people he is sworn to protect" – oo-er – and every choice and action you take will "ultimately transform the type of secret agent Micheal Thorton will become".</p>
<p>If that sounds intriguing, Alpha Protocol is currently available for 20 percent off the recommended retail Steam price.</p>
<p>"The legendary agent whose presence looms over Alpha Protocol's Michael Thornton isn't Bauer, Bourne or Bond - although the game is eager to invite all these comparisons," Donlan wrote in Eurogamers' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alpha-protocol-review">Alpha Protocol review</a> almost fifteen years ago.</p>
<p>"Obsidian has borrowed a lot from BioWare, a developer it's always had a close working relationship with, and at times Alpha Protocol can feel a little like a Mass Effect mod as much as an original game in its own right."</p>

            <p>I think I've written about it a bazillion times here on RPS, but I do think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> is a massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game that's a bit <em>too</em> large and in charge. I reached the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/n.com/i-have-reached-the-elden-ring-exhaustion-point">exhaustion point</a> once, and now the DLC's come out, I'm scared I'll reach it again despite the fact <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">I think it's very good</a>. It's interesting then, that FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki sees Elden Ring as "the limit" for FromSoftware in terms of project scale (cheers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Guardian</a> for the interview, and PCGamer for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/hidetaka-miyazaki-says-elden-ring-might-be-as-big-a-game-as-he-ever-wants-to-make-where-fromsoftware-is-right-now-in-terms-of-scale-i-would-say-elden-ring-is-really-the-limit/">the spot</a>). I think it's a great thing, personally.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In The Guardian's interview with Miyazaki, he says that Elden Ring is a "turning point" for FromSoftware, referencing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review">Armored Core VI</a> as an example of something a bit different from the company's Souls catalogue. "Where FromSoftware is right now, in terms of scale, I would say Elden Ring is really the limit," Miyazaki told the site. "We’ve tapped every resource and talent that we have access to… scaling it even bigger, I’d have my concerns." </p>
<p>What comes after Elden Ring then? Miyazaki says that he'd love to see up-and-coming developers within FromSoftware take the lead. "Perhaps having multiple projects is the next stage, where some of the other younger talent can have the opportunity to manage and direct game design for a smaller project."</p>
<p>I think Elden Ring and Shadow Of The Erdtree are brilliant, don't get me wrong. But I was worried that massive Soulsly open worlds were like, the <em>only</em> thing they'd do now since they've tasted so much critical and commercial success. It's a relief to know that they're actually thinking of scaling things back, and handing the reins to people with different ideas.</p>
<p>I doubt this is the end for Souls, which makes me happy! Gimme more games with bonfires and skeletons. But also, I'm glad they're looking to foster a culture of experimentation. Hey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-me-hankering-hankering-for-a-tenchu">how about Tenchu</a>? I know that turned into Sekiro eventually, but we could revisit it? Please. PLEASE.</p>

Again, we’ve heard nothing since, but we do know this game is set in Middle-earth and features the stories of The Hobbit and more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Tomb Raider Review Ever</h3></div></output><p>Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/amazon-games-christoph-hartmann-tomb-raider-lord-of-the-rings-1236046995/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Amazon Games chief Christoph Hartmann said a reveal for either game is not imminent, but is not long away. “It’s not going to be tomorrow, but it’s not too far away,” Hartmann said, before insisting Amazon Games is now “getting into a much more regular cadence of shipping games.”</p><p>“That’s all I’m allowed to tell you right now,” Hartmann added. “It’s all about quality. You don’t want to just be rushed out. That doesn’t work. It has to be triple-A quality, because the bar is so high.”</p><p>Amazon will be keen to capitalize on other Tomb Raider and The Lord of the Rings projects it has in the works by lining up the TV shows with the video games. Prime Video has confirmed a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-confirms-tomb-raider-series-for-prime-video-with-phoebe-waller-bridge-as-writer-and-executive-producer">Tomb Raider live-action series</a> with Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge in place as writer and executive producer, although it has yet to say when it will launch.

While that’s worked out well for the Fallout TV show, which is set after all the Fallout video games, Hartmann suggested Amazon’s plan for Tomb Raider is closer to Sony’s with its hugely successful Marvel’s Spider-Man games, which are separate to the Spider-Man movies.</p><p>“You see it with Tomb Raider, where we’re gonna have a Tomb Raider game coming and they’re doing a show,” Hartmann said. “And some people say, ‘Oh, will they be linked together?’ And I give them the example, look at Spider-Man. There’s amazing, amazing games. There’s great animated content, there’s great live-action, and everyone seems to be very happy with that.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/even-hardcore-audiences-love-dlc-when-its-done-right-opinion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Bethesda's $2.50 horse armour DLC for Oblivion turns 18 this year – a realisation which made me feel like I was about to spontaneously crumble to dust and be blown away on a breeze.</p>
<p>There's an entire generation of gamers to whom it would be very challenging to explain why the launch of this seemingly innocuous add-on was such a pivotal moment for the industry's development; why for the best part of a decade afterwards, an eye-roll and a snorted exclamation of "horse armour!" was a devastating put-down to almost any DLC plans.</p>
<p>Attitudes have undoubtedly softened over time, especially in younger cohorts who have grown up with most major games having paid-for add-ons of various types, but there is still a conventional wisdom which says that more "hardcore" consumers, and older consumers, really don't like paid-for DLC in general.</p>
<p>That's an oversimplification of the attitudes involved, but it's not entirely unfounded – at least, it's certainly in line with what we see in online discourse around game announcements. If you listen closely you can hear an audible groan rise from the server farms of Discord and Reddit whenever a game is announced alongside details of its add-on content season pass, as has been common practice for the best part of a decade now.</p>
<blockquote>The horse armour won, in the end.

</blockquote>
<p>The assertion made by the loudest detractors – and clearly believed by a not insignificant chunk of the audience – is that complete games are having parts sliced off them and repackaged as DLC, with the true, full game that we "should" have been getting at launch only eventually being sold as some kind of Game of the Year edition further down the line.</p>
<p>It's a narrative that tickles the two foundational prejudices of the internet's self-styled angry and/or bitter gamers – that publishers are greedy, and developers are lazy.</p>
<p>The robust and generally well-founded pushback to this narrative from developers is straightforward – that while they generally have ideas for DLC in mind before a game launches, it's not the case that content which actually exists has been cut out.</p>
<p>There are storylines and scenarios and concept art, yes, but actually building those sections of the game is a task that doesn't get properly underway until after the launch. There's a plan for future expansion, not a chunk of finished content being locked away by greedy business bosses.</p>
<p>An unfortunate wrinkle in the otherwise robust fabric of that counter-argument is that while this scenario is usually the case, there have undoubtedly been situations where DLC planning has been rather less pure-hearted – and it only takes a couple of cases of the DLC model being abused to convince some consumers that a giant business conspiracy to defraud gamers is unfolding behind every launch.</p>
<blockquote>I'm not sure any developer other than FromSoftware could get away with this kind of thing; the fact that they do, and to rapturous praise, is worth looking at</blockquote>
<p>Some high-profile games have launched in pretty awful states – very obviously lacking large amounts of planned content or features, with huge technical issues, and so on – but nonetheless accompanied their launches with expensive season passes and high-profile promotion of DLC roadmaps.</p>
<p>A few bad apples can spoil the whole barrel, and it doesn't take too many of those cases to make a certain segment of the audience – the more hardcore audience that's more plugged into these online discourses – sour on DLC as a broader concept.</p>
<p>Yet even at that, saying that these audiences don't like DLC is a vast over-simplification of a much more nuanced set of views. Case in point: Elden Ring's DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, is arguably the most talked-about game of the month, having earned soaring review scores and fantastic word-of-mouth from exactly the kind of hardcore audience who supposedly don't like DLC and paid add-ons.</p>
<p>By the conventional wisdom, this is an add-on that shouldn't even exist, let alone be so popular. Instead, it appears to have been crafted as a love-letter to the hardcore fans of an already pretty hardcore game; you need to have defeated an optional boss in Elden Ring who is tough to find, let alone defeat, even to access the new content.</p>
<p>I'm not sure any developer other than FromSoftware could get away with this kind of thing; the fact that they do, and to rapturous praise, is worth looking at.</p>
<p>Context matters, of course. Some kind of plan did exist for Shadow of the Erdtree all the way back when Elden Ring launched – there are plenty of loose ends in the original game that are clearly meant to be tied up in a future expansion – but nobody could argue with a straight face that a game of the scope and scale of Elden Ring was incomplete or had seen content sliced off to create a DLC pack.</p>
<p>Moreover, it's taken almost two years for this expansion to arrive, and it's enormous in its own right, essentially the size of a whole new game by itself.</p>
<blockquote>It only takes a couple of cases of the DLC model being abused to convince some consumers that a giant business conspiracy to defraud gamers is unfolding</blockquote>
<p>Those old enough to remember game expansion packs will recognise the Shadow of the Erdtree formula as owing far more to that now-rare approach than to the more conventional modern 'season pass' approach of dropping three or four new pieces of content over the course of a year or so. Much of the positive reaction to this DLC likely owes to FromSoftware having planned it as a full expansion pack rather than as a slice of DLC.</p>
<p>FromSoftware isn't the only company taking this approach of launching large, high-quality DLC packs in the mould of expansion packs, of course. Cyberpunk 2077's equally rapturously received Phantom Liberty DLC is another great recent example. At a little more of a stretch you could point to the extremely positive reception around Final Fantasy XIV's major expansions (notably Shadowbringers and Endwalker), or even to the Miles Morales spin-off from Insomniac's Spider-Man game, as further examples.</p>
<p>The common point between all of these is that they genuinely offer what DLC always claims, but so infrequently delivers. Here is a significant (both in size and scope) and transformative addition to a game that's already thoroughly loved by its players, giving dozens of hours of extra playtime at a very reasonable price.</p>
<p>Given that the base game is a known quantity, and of very high quality, it's a no-brainer for many players to buy this kind of DLC; more of something you already know you enjoy is an easier purchasing decision than taking a punt on a game you haven't played yet.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Shadow-of-the-Erdtree-2_le0l91c.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is the gold standard for DLC, and ought to be what every developer planning an expansion roadmap tries to emulate – reaching high, even if many will fall short is likely.</p>
<p>Getting the base game right is absolutely central to this formula; trying to sell players DLC when the original game is still in need of extensive fixing is like trying to hand restaurant customers a dessert menu when the main course wasn't cooked properly and half the dishes never arrived.</p>
<p>Moreover, DLC of this kind needs to be meaty enough to be worth getting back into the game in the first place. By the time your DLC launches, most players have moved on to new games, so you need to be promising them a significant experience – and ideally one that transforms the original game in interesting ways – to convince them to come back and play again.</p>
<p>This is not not, however, the only approach to DLC and in-game purchases, nor is it the only approach players have come to accept. Which brings us back to Bethesda's horse armour, as it prepares to graduate high school and pack its bags for college.</p>
<p>For all the mockery and negativity around the horse armour – which admittedly was a bit daft in a game that had such an extensive range of free community-developed mods – the reality is that for most of the audience currently in their early thirties and below, charging $2.50 for a cosmetic in-game item seems perfectly natural and uncontroversial. If anything, they might be surprised at how cheap that is. The horse armour won, in the end.</p>
<blockquote><p>Trying to sell DLC when the original game is still in need of fixing is like trying to hand restaurant customers a dessert menu when the main course wasn't cooked properly and half the dishes never arrived</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cosmetic DLC – costumes and weapons and fripperies that do little but customise the game experience in various ways – is now an intrinsic part of the business model of many games, and can be surprisingly successful even in single-player titles where you might expect the instinct to peacock by dressing up characters to be minimal.</p>
<p>This kind of DLC approach is still mocked on occasion, especially when developers go overboard with it (and doubly so when the base game is notably barren in that department before you open the store page), but I'd argue that most consumers have come around to the reasoning that these are essentially the gaming equivalent of luxury items.</p>
<p>You don't need them to enjoy the game, but can blow some cash on them if they really tickle your fancy – yet just as the existence of a high-end Rolex doesn't change the fact that a digital Casio tells the time just as well, most cosmetic DLC doesn't detract from the game experience by its existence.</p>
<p>Where this can go wrong is with things like fighting games, where unlocking costumes for the character roster has traditionally been a core goal of progression in many franchises. Consequently, locking up too many costumes behind a paywall really is detracting from the game experience, and goes down like a lead balloon with players (see also: the industry's what-not-to-do whipping boy icon, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/will-players-tolerate-overwatch-2s-broken-promises-opinion">Overwatch 2</a>).</p>
<blockquote>The lesson from the success of expansions like Shadow of the Erdtree is that DLC really can resonate even with the audiences who supposedly resist it the most</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, this kind of DLC occupies the opposite end of the spectrum from the large, expansion-pack style offerings of Shadow of the Erdtree or Phantom Liberty, and it's at those extremes of the spectrum that DLC seems to find the most success and acceptance.</p>
<p>Developers working on post-launch content plans for their games would do well to consider the kind of audience they're working to attract, and pick a lane based on that assessment – either making big, meaningful expansions, or small cosmetic tchotchkes that serve as disposable luxuries.</p>
<p>It's in the middle ground that DLC tends to trip up and annoy people the most – slices of content that aren't sufficiently differentiated from the core game, don't justify either the price of entry, and aren't worth the mental effort of picking back up in a game players moved on from months ago.</p>
<p>The lesson from the success of expansions like Shadow of the Erdtree is that DLC really can resonate even with the audiences who supposedly resist it the most – but if a game doesn't justify an expansion on that scale, it's worth seriously considering whether adding a small zone and a handful of missions is worthwhile at all, or whether simply downscaling to cosmetics is going to be a far better allocation of resources.</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-update-adds-options-to-change-console-graphics-settings">an update for Dragon's Dogma 2 was rolled out for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S</a>, including some specific changes for consoles, adding the option for those on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S to change graphics settings to high or low, as well as the option to turn 120Hz output on or off. Capcom said turning graphics settings down to low on consoles should improve Dragon's Dogma 2's frame rates, adding: "Further frame rate improvements are planned for future updates as well."</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 has been a hit for Capcom, with the game selling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-sells-25m-as-fixed-frame-rate-arrives">2.5m copies in under two weeks after its release</a>. Back in April, the company actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-success-boosts-capcoms-expected-profits">revised its full-year earnings forecast</a> following this success, combined with the success of its other popular releases over the last year.</p>

            <p>More information has come to light regarding Twitch's 2020 ban of streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm.</p>
<p>Beahm began making headlines again last week, when Twitch's former account director of strategic partnerships Cody Conners stated an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform after they were caught sending sexually explicit messages to a minor. Subsequent reports confirmed the person Conners was referring to was indeed Beahm, something many had already suspected.</p>
<p>Now, a former Twitch employee - who has chosen to remain anonymous - has told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/dr-disrespect-inappropriate-messages-minor-twitch-1235048071/">Rolling Stone</a> that the minor had informed Beahm that they were underage, and Beahm continued to send "sexually graphic" messages to them regardless.</p>

<p>"I recall that Dr Disrespect was made aware by the individual that they were underage during the conversation, after which he indicated that this was no problem and continued on," the former employee told the publication, stating "there was no confusion".</p>
<p>"Messages sent after this was acknowledged were no less graphic and in sexually explicit nature than before, and I think more than the categorisation of 'leaning too much in the direction of being inappropriate' might indicate," they continued.</p>
<p>Later in the conversation, the former employee spoke further about Twitch's decision to ban Dr Disrespect. "After viewing the contents of the Whisper conversation, it quickly became clear the egregiousness of conduct and what actions Twitch must take," they said. "The decision to permanently terminate Beahm was relatively quick, due to the severity of the behaviour."</p>
<p>They also added that following a number of sexual misconduct allegations that arose in 2020, Twitch created an incident response team codenamed Gold Sparrow to address concerns. "We wanted to be able to process mounting investigations quicker and with more resources while providing as much support for the victims as possible," they said.</p>
<p>In the time since Conner's initial post last week (which Rolling Stone's source said "got the ball rolling" for others to come forward with information), Beahm has been dropped from Midnight Society, the game development studio he co-founded in 2021. Other partnerships have also ousted the streamer, including Turtle Beach, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186936/nba-2k24-will-remove-dr-disrespect-from-the-game">NBA 2K24, and the San Francisco 49ers</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/youtube-suspends-monetization-on-dr-disrespects-channel-following-serious-allegations">YouTube</a>, meanwhile, has suspended monetisation on Beahm's channel. Today's report noted Beahm was not offered a contract at YouTube due to the circumstances of his Twitch ban.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">Beahm released a statement on social media platform X</a>, admitting to sending messages to a minor which he tried to pass off as "casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate".</p>
