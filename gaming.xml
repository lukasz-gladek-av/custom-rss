                <p>One of the original Xbox's designers, Seamus Blackley, said that computing power isn't a helpful selling point anymore when it comes to consoles.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/xbox-creator-seamus-blackley-narrative-around-being-more-powerful-not-helpful-today/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, Blackley said that the power-first approach worked for the original Xbox back in 2001 since graphics weren't as polished as they are now. Focusing the narrative on computing power helped the Xbox stand out among Japanese hardware companies.</p><p>"We were a Western company and we were saying 'Okay, we’re going to lose money on these to make them super powerful' and take a bet on the games being awesome," Blackley explained. Back then, the original Xbox was the only console with a built-in hard drive that could handle games like Halo: Combat Evolved, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, Fable, and Shenmue 2.</p><p>It was a way for Xbox to get its foot in the door in the video game-console space, but Blackley said had he still been at Microsoft, he wouldn't have continued the power-focused branding for Xbox.</p><p>He also noted reminisced on seeing Gran Turismo for the first time on the original PlayStation, and how he absolutely had to buy it because its graphics were ahead of its time. However, he acknowledged that graphical power hit a plateau and that he doesn't get excited about power anymore.</p><p>Blackley explained that the battle for content has pivoted to where platform-holders need to create compelling experiences. He pointed to the Nintendo Switch, where he said he played through The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild three or four times. The portability factor also granted him long Skyrim sessions on airplane flights.</p><p>Sony and Microsoft have taken note of the Switch's immense success and are reportedly both producing native portable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reportedly-developing-a-ps5-portable-system/1100-6528023/" data-ref-id="1100-6528023">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-rumored-to-launch-in-2026-with-new-call-of-duty/1100-6528636/" data-ref-id="1100-6528636">Xbox systems</a>, respectively.</p><p>Currently, the most powerful console on the market is the PS5 Pro. Despite its hefty $600 price tag, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pros-huge-price-didnt-negatively-impact-sales-sony-says/1100-6527685/" data-ref-id="1100-6527685">Sony said that it did not negatively impact sales</a>. It seems like Xbox boss Phil Spencer echoes Blackley's sentiments, as he said Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-playstation-and-nintendo-console-market-isnt-growing-phil-spencer-says/1100-6527787/" data-ref-id="1100-6527787">isn't planning on releasing a mid-gen</a> refresh like Sony did with the PS5 Pro because an incremental increase in graphical power doesn't provide a unique experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ricky-jay-defector-archive-preservation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This article originally appeared on February 17 at <a href="https://defector.com/someone-has-to-save-the-film-and-tv-that-studios-wont" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defector</a>, a worker-owned sports and culture website you should totally <a href="https://defector.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support</a>. </em></p><p>HBO had a series of legendary stand-up specials in the 1990s, and one of the best of those came from a performer who was not a comedian.&nbsp;<em>Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants</em>&nbsp;was incredibly funny, but Jay was a magician, although that seems not quite right. The press material for the special, which first aired on Dec. 17, 1996, called him an “illusionist.” That feels closer, but still not quite sufficient. The special, which was directed by Jay’s regular collaborator David Mamet, combined a number of astonishing card tricks with a breezily thorough recounting of the history of magic.&nbsp;That was more or less Ricky Jay's act; no one else has ever really done anything like it.</p><p>Ricky Jay, who died in 2018 at the age of 72, combined mastery of his craft with a thorough knowledge of its culture and lore. His&nbsp;<em>52 Assistants</em>&nbsp;special was notable for his ability to throw playing cards into a watermelon and also his skill at explaining the long history of the cups-and-balls trick. You probably don’t need to be told not to get tricked into playing that by a hustler on the subway; Jay walks his audience through the long history of that hustle.</p><p>The special&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7InE1zXAY4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">exists online</a>&nbsp;in smudgy/greasy form, but it has never been released in a proper format. It deserves one—it deserves a remaster, a real streaming option, a version that is not in 480p, sourced from someone’s old VHS copy. Fortunately there are people who are obsessive about archiving media in the same way that Ricky Jay was about keeping alive the work of old-timey conjurers. One of those people is&nbsp;<a href="https://aftermath.site/author/chris-person" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Chris Person</a>, a contributor at&nbsp;<a href="http://aftermath.site/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Aftermath</a>. He recently acquired and digitized the highest-quality copy of Jay’s special we have. It now also&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/ricky_jay_and_his_52_assisstants_rf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">exists online</a>.</p><p>I am not the only one who was giddy to watch this special. David Roth and I decided this was all cool enough to ask Person about how this all came about, and about the work of digitizing work that's otherwise on the verge of disappearing.</p><figure><figcaption>HBO</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Dan:&nbsp;</strong>Chris, your work archiving media that might otherwise be lost is so admirable. How did you get involved in this kind of work?</p><p><strong>Chris:&nbsp;</strong>It started by being a Chris Elliott fan and a guy who encodes video for a living. In the ’80s he did two specials:&nbsp;<em>Action Family</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>FDR: A One Man Show</em>. The idea of the former is that the exteriors are a shot-on-film police procedural like&nbsp;<em>Columbo</em>&nbsp;and all the interiors are a three-camera sitcom like&nbsp;<em>The Brady Bunch</em>. The latter is an extended parody of one-man shows. Both are online in absolute dogwater quality, so I dug deep and found the most advanced VHS archiving project around: VHS-Decode. You can read&nbsp;<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-person-saving-the-media-you-love-is-you-vhs-decode-domesday-duplicator-ld-decode-laserdisc" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">my entire writeup of it here</a>&nbsp;because it’s complicated, but the short version is you solder wires into a VCR to extract as close to the raw tape signal as possible. From there, you are doing the decoding of the image in software. If you wanna see what a freakishly clean encode upscaled to 4K looks like on a tape from 1987 of The Cure on the BBC, check this shit out:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Cure - Catch, Why Can't I Be You? &amp; Hot Hot Hot!!! (Live) - The Tube (1987)" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ks1wE_NXWv8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>From there, I would just compulsively buy stuff that had no good encode. VHS and Laserdisc tends to be a pretty big blind spot for a lot of people who archive media. If you do this enough, eventually people will come to you. Eventually, I was approached by John Hand of&nbsp;<em>Pulsing Cinema</em>, who found a production dub of Ricky Jay in an eBay auction of a bunch of random HBO tapes. I got to work, and now we have a copy on Archive.org that doesn’t suck.</p><p><strong>Dan:&nbsp;</strong>I have a tangential reasoning. When I was eight, we went to my uncle’s house to watch the WWF Royal Rumble. Just before the end of the match, Sid Vicious eliminates Hulk Hogan, and the crowd kind of cheered. I was eight and even I was kind of sick of Hogan’s shtick by then, too, and I may have cheered along as bad guy Ric Flair won the match. The next week on TV, they’d dubbed the crowd booing, and had the announcers re-record their commentary to make it sufficiently pro-Hogan. I’d turn nine the next day, and I think that was the day I began caring about saving media so the past can’t be altered, even if it’s something as stupid as the end of the 1992 Royal Rumble. I mean, to be fair, that is possibly the greatest wrestling match of all time.</p><p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;It’s all scripted, you know.</p><p><strong>Dan:&nbsp;</strong>Fortunately for me, wrestling fans did not mind its scripted nature. Also, they were and are obsessive. They recorded shows, they traded tapes, and nowadays there are incredible databases of things that WWF would really like you to have forgotten. There are episodes of ECW with the original music, back before anyone seemed to care about getting the rights to anything. There are recorded segments from Backstage Blast, a disaster of a segment during&nbsp;<em>WCW Nitro&nbsp;</em>commercial breaks. When the WWE Network came out, suddenly there were pristine copies of tons of shows. But not all of them were what really aired. The interview where Gabriel Byrne cuts a promo in character as Satan from&nbsp;<em>End of Days</em>&nbsp;is missing, for one thing. These kinds of clips—the weird, the offensive, the actually edgy—have been saved for all time by fans. This is true for sports, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of my library of Philadelphia sports games has simply come from YouTube downloads over the years. And now I am at the point where I have so much, I simply need higher-quality versions of old stuff. I&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;Super Bowl 52 in basically every format imaginable. I now&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;a high-quality version of the Fog Bowl so I can see how it really was.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>David:</strong>&nbsp;Probably the only real journalistic achievement of my career came back when I was freelancing for&nbsp;<em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, and a guy emailed me to tell me that his father had a recording of Super Bowl I, which was for many years thought to be lost—not just because no one was sure anyone actually cared about the NFL back then, but because networks would just tape over stuff as a matter of course. This guy’s dad worked at a TV station and recorded it manually on a reel-to-reel, first with the commercials included and then as the game went on by pausing before the breaks and unpausing after—I have to assume he was the first person ever to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>That recording is at the Paley Museum of TV in Manhattan, and I watched it and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704709304576124373773290508" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">wrote about it for the paper</a>; I split the byline with a staffer because my editor at the time, who was “familiar with my shit,” wasn’t sure I could land it on my own, which at the time was probably correct. This was in 2011, so long enough ago that there was still this sense that the internet&nbsp;<a href="https://flaminghydra.com/the-big-internet/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">might someday contain everything that had ever existed</a>—maybe with ads making it viable, maybe just through The Magic Of Free Speech or whatever. Obviously the internet has shrunk a great deal since then, and feels like it’s shrinking more by the day. This makes me more curious about the community of people doing this archiving. Who are these people? And Chris, I know you’re a movie head from when we used to talk about stuff back in our coworker days, but what is it that made you want to start doing this?</p><p><strong>Chris:&nbsp;</strong>Aside from the aforementioned love of Chris Elliott specials, it’s a combination of my background as a video editor (I have had to deal with a lot of very badly handled footage in my life) and the sheer joy I feel every time I see that someone has uploaded an entire home recorded tape from 1986 with all the commercials. When I grew up, I experienced a lot of anime through fansubbed tapes and so I have a real love of those communities, because it’s overwhelmingly just volunteers. The motto “Keep Circulating the Tapes” that appears at the end of early episodes of MST3K was burned into me forever, and I think it’s something that needs to be taught to every subsequent generation.&nbsp;</p><p>Once people know you have a setup for this stuff, the tapes tend to find you. That’s how the Ricky Jay tape came to me, how someone spotted a rare tape from Yukio Ninagawa's&nbsp;<em>Medea</em>, how someone sent me a laserdisc of the Daicon IV intro. It’s something I can do in my spare time while I work. A24 sent me David Byrne’s copy of&nbsp;<em>Stop Making Sense&nbsp;</em>to capture, and that appears in the&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.a24films.com/products/stop-making-sense-collectors-edition" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">collector’s edition</a>. I have an analog capture station on my desk and my laptop hums along doing the encoding in the background. It’s soothing.&nbsp;</p><p>You’d also be surprised how low the monetary barrier is to saving something sometimes. It requires skill to do it, but there are some tapes you’d assume were totally lost, and when you look them up they cost $30 to $100. It takes a while to learn how to encode and capture things properly, but once you do it’s not that difficult.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, after seeing your work on Ricky Jay, I now have about 20 VHS tapes I want to acquire and digitize in high quality. I even sent you a VHS copy of the Philadelphia Eagles rap “Buddy’s Watchin’ You”&nbsp;<a href="https://defector.com/in-1988-buddy-ryan-was-watchin-the-eagles-rap" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">for my story</a>, and now a perfect copy of it&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/buddys.-watchin.-you.-1988.480p.-vhsrip.-flac.-2.0.x-264-boys-rback-in-town" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">exists online</a>. I am at a point where I am going to have to&nbsp;<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-person-saving-the-media-you-love-is-you-vhs-decode-domesday-duplicator-ld-decode-laserdiscvhs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">follow along with the things you’ve written about it</a>&nbsp;and make a little setup myself. I have recorded media from my cable setup! I have even previously used the program you use, VHS Decode! I can do this! My brain, not to mention my wife, will surely be happy that I am thinking about a new project when several others are not finished! The basement can wait, I swear! Maybe I can put the whole setup down there!</p><p>More seriously and less exclamation-pointy, there’s something here that really seems important in the age of projects simply being shelved and thrown into a vault. It’s not that I needed to see&nbsp;<a href="https://screenrant.com/coyote-vs-acme-release-status-funeral-screening-lana-condor-response/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>Coyote vs. Acme</em></a>, but the idea that a project might never see the light of day for financial reasons just makes me want to have amateurs digitize&nbsp;<em>everything</em>. Obviously that movie was never out there, but there’s a huge amount of media that is—and, due to various real or fake reasons, is never going to get a proper release. Is it important that there are&nbsp;<em>Muppet Babies</em>&nbsp;episodes online that have the original movie parodies and footage? It’s not the&nbsp;<em>most</em>&nbsp;important thing, but it’s good people can see how things originally aired.</p><p><strong>David:&nbsp;</strong>I am broadly in favor of Saving Everything, with commercials if possible, partially on the principle that people put some portion of their lives into making all this stuff and it seems rude and reckless to just leave it on the curb, but also because I feel like there’s a lot about the texture and tone of a moment that can be read from even your bummier and more boring cultural products, or just from the jarringly horny ads for Big Red gum that aired during them. But that’s not quite what we’re talking about here.</p><p>I guess, looking back at it, that&nbsp;<em>Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants</em>&nbsp;is a very ’90s cultural product. Jay looked the same pretty much for the entire time he was famous—the lapels widened and shrunk, but he was mostly this bearish, masterful, patter-intensive presence even during his late-night appearances&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jKuHiY397U&amp;list=PLmWRe-kU82UMsmA9V6BTGfwVvT5VlJElV" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">in the ‘80s</a>, and in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0419633/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">every movie he was in</a>, and presumably in the time he spent in the actual gambler/hustler demimonde&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/04/05/ricky-jay-magician-secrets-profile" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">that he apparently inhabited</a>&nbsp;even as he became of America’s better-known doers of magic. But for all the ways the aesthetics of the audience and the staging mark the special as all that, it is also, to me, totally delightful and amazing. I have watched the deep-fried versions of this on YouTube as a stoned wind-down or just for pleasure for many years now. It was cool to see it looking crisp and contiguous and possibly even better than it did when it aired nearly 30 years ago. Chris, what led you to take this particular one on? Are you a member of the Ricky Jay Brotherhood as well?</p><figure><figcaption>HBO</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris:&nbsp;</strong>I knew Ricky Jay, but I actually came to him fairly late. As with most of these things, you would be surprised how often to posting “<a href="https://x.com/Papapishu/status/1762723420213543259" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Man, I sure would love to see a nice rip of this</a>” which frequently bears fruit. Someone just sent me a LaserDisc I was looking for because I posted about it! I try to make a mental note of which things have decent transfers and which don’t, and this is one of them. Like, for example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdYto9Ehrj0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women</em></a>, an earlier TV special he did based on his book of the same name; it was directed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512327" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Michael Lindsay-Hogg</a>, who you may know if you’re a huge Beatles fan. I also really enjoy the documentary about him,&nbsp;<em>Deceptive Practice: The Mysteries and Mentors of Ricky Jay.&nbsp;</em>It has very high-quality clips from&nbsp;<em>52 Assistants&nbsp;</em>in there and clips that don’t appear on TV (I believe those are shot on film), but it also gives you stunning insight into his upbringing and his tough relationship with his family. He knew magic guys since he was a child, it’s in his blood.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>David:&nbsp;</strong>Watching videos of Jay and sometimes my late namesake, the startlingly elfin&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxd7U7KkPXs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">coin magic legend David Roth</a>, has long been a don’t-want-to-go-to-bed-yet pastime of mine. I’m not sure I can explain it, and given the radical honesty about nerdwad pursuits in here already I don’t imagine I have to, but part of the appeal for me is the sense that these are people with a craft, doing a thing they’ve done so many times that it looks and feels and sounds perfect. Obviously it’s fun to be tricked and wowed and all that, but I like that you can see all that work; part of the fun for me, where Jay is concerned, is in him kind of happily running up the score on the audience because he knows so much and can do so much that he can afford to have fun with it and mess with everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>But obviously that performance comes from someplace beyond repetition, that sort of weird milieu and Magic Guys and all that. The idea that it’s going to be on the people who care about this stuff to preserve it—to learn how to do that as you have, and to put each other onto stuff, and then to put it where people can enjoy it—really resonates with me right now. Obviously the interests that produced all this stuff are fine letting a lot of it die once it stops making them money. It seems important that they not get the last word on that.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong>&nbsp;Preservation is an act of collective willpower and effort. It cannot just be one person. I don’t want to live in a world where the things I love&nbsp;<em>actually</em>&nbsp;disappear.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong>&nbsp;Even things I hate… sometimes I’ll save ’em too. I do have all of the Eagles’ Super Bowl losses.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/viktor-antonov-art-director-rip"><h3>RIP Viktor Antonov</h3></a><p>Antonov was one of the driving forces behind the art style of Half-Life 2 and Dishonored</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/614336/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-update-patches<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl </em>was released in November<em>, </em>it was clearly not yet the game its developers, GSC Game World, wanted it to be. Sure, this imagining of the Zone was fabulously moody, a desolate and bleak expanse of bog, scrubland, abandoned warehouses, and pallid vistas. For all the ways it was transportive and evocative, it did not yet feel truly alive. The Zone was, dare I say, a little too quiet, lacking the kind of brilliant emergent moments (like three-way skirmishes between stalkers, more stalkers, and roving packs of mutant dogs) that have previously defined the franchise. I ended my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300652/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">review</a> wondering whether the game would, and indeed could, become the very best “shining” version of itself. </p><p>Three months on, with two major and five smaller patches under its belt, I’m thrilled to report that the game is close to becoming exactly that. To cut a long story short, the enemy AI in combat situations is vastly improved, A-Life 2.0 (the more expansive AI system that gives the game its thrillingly unpredictable sense of life) is practically purring, and I’m now encountering far fewer of the immersion-breaking bugs (like floating and disembodied heads)<em>. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> was admittedly no <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> disaster at launch. That said, the work done by its Kyiv and Prague-based developers, who have labored throughout the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/arts/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-ukraine-war.html">Russia-Ukraine war</a>, is nothing short of remarkable.</p><p>Last night, while traipsing through the overgrowth to complete a mission in the Malachite region, I was spotted by stalkers from a rival faction. I retreated back into the vehicle station that I’d just passed through, taking cover behind a steel gate. I poked my rifle around the metal panel, leaning to my left as bullets whizzed past my head, catching a glimpse of the masked stalkers attempting to flank me. They threw grenades, pinning me back. I downed one of them, and the other went to heal him. As he crouched down to administer a med kit, I headshotted him, a fearsome crack whipping through the air. Of course, I unceremoniously looted both bodies moments later.</p><p>Improved enemy AI clearly has a massive impact on gameplay. It also changes how the Zone feels. Where, previously, the architecture felt ghostly — blown-out, post-Soviet wreckage that was slowly being reclaimed by nature — now, it is the perfect site for cat-and-mouse shootouts. Fear not, the Zone is still haunting, but the adrenaline-pumping, hardcore firefights that were such a standout feature of <a href="https://youtu.be/0ZqMt74hO6U">prerelease trailers</a> are now very much a reality in the game. It adds up to a 64-kilometer-squared open-world playspace that feels even more dangerous; you’re locked into a battle with the landscape itself and the much smarter humans that stalk it. </p><p>In the latest patch released last Thursday, there are a whopping <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1643320%2Fview%2F579378232238800945" rel="sponsored">1,700 improvements</a>, ranging from small balancing tweaks like radiation levels to what seem like pretty substantial changes, including “level design, and terrain improvements for multiple locations and regions.” Your flashlight now casts shadows on objects, and stealth has been improved (although, truth be told, it’s still pretty wonky). Maybe my favorite detail is that NPCs don’t just heal their fallen allies; they now loot the corpses of downed enemies. Turns out, these NPCs have just as little shame as me. Another small detail that subtly enhances the game’s already wonderful atmosphere: thanks, I think, to the improved A-Life 2.0, NPC stalkers now more regularly gather at campfires, even those in the wilderness outside of major hub areas. </p><p>I don’t want to tacitly endorse developers releasing games in borderline unfinished states. The examples, unfortunately, have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-2042s-disastrous-launch-what-next-for-battlefield">piling</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/26/23738863/gollum-developers-apology-negative-reviews-lotr">up</a> in recent years. But you can’t deny the achievements of GSC Game World. In early December, creative director Mariia Grygorovych reflected on the game’s rocky launch. “It’s not perfect, we need to fix everything,” she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">said</a>. “But it’s a game! It’s a game with soul, with feelings there, with love there!”</p><p>Grygorovych is right, and now it’s easier than ever to appreciate all that love and soul. For sure, it’s an odd and uncompromising love, the kind that’s content to let the player cower in a shed while a blood-red radiation storm whirs above them; the kind that also takes pride in first-person animations of protagonist Skif wolfing down delicious cured sausage. These types of moments feed into a wider tapestry of action that does not go easy on the player — indeed, it goes out of its way to make life miserable for them. </p><p>This type of friction has always been the major selling point of the <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> franchise. It’s what makes the series appeal to such a specific type of video game fetishist. Now, that friction manifests in many more of the ways the developers intended. <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2.</em> is no tribute act to past glories: three months on from launch, it finally feels as if it was worth the wait. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The insoles of the new sneakers feature pixelated mud and dirt, DK-styled gold coins, and even a smooshed low-res banana. Oh, and a big gold coin can be spotted on the back of the shoes, too. Yeah, these are Donkey Kong-themed shoes all right!

It seems Nike wants to combine two of the most expensive hobbies around—collecting sneakers and buying videos games—into one ultra-expensive combo. </p><p>There is no release date listed for these new <em>Donkey Kong</em> sneakers, though Sneaker News reports the upcoming Nike Air Max 1 variants might arrive in late spring or summer of this year. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fellowship-takes-the-mm-out-of-mmorpg-in-a-super-fun-way<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's always cool when a game designer takes one neat thing out of a complex genre and turns it into an entire game. That's how we got the MOBA, after all — breaking just the heroes out of an RTS. Enter Fellowship, a so-called Multiplayer Online Dungeon Adventure that's going to pluck out team-based dungeon raids that are the beating heart of modern MMOs and turn them into a streamlined game – without the hundred hours of leveling up before you get to the best stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After some time with a development version of Fellowship I have to say that the concept turned out just as cool as it sounds: It's no-nonsense, endlessly scaling dungeon runs in a four player team of a tank, a healer, and two damage heroes from among a selection of unique classes. In a group you make yourself, or with a team from a handy group finder, you jump in with your chosen role in either short-and-sweet one boss Adventures or longer multi-boss dungeons—letting you tune your gameplay time depending on whether you've got ten minutes or an hour to kill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end you pick up your loot, tweak your talents, kick up the difficulty, and go again.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was a bit skeptical that you can have a real authentic, MMO-style dungeon experience without, you know, the MMO, but Fellowship really effectively delivered. You move through the environment clearing out packs of enemy minions in order to get at the bosses, and all the classic stuff you'd expect is there: You've got to watch your tank's threat and manage aggro, try to make life easy for the healer, keep track of enemy abilities to interrupt the nasty ones, and know how to best use your class' attacks in a good rotation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Behind the wheel of an elemental mage-type character, I had plenty of abilities to manage even at the starting level. My character built up charges that could be used to call down big freezing meteors or channel icy blasts. Our healer, meanwhile, could summon plants that either damaged or healed. It was clear in my short time that each class has a nice, clear vision for what it can and can't do. The thing my squishy mage couldn't do, by the way, was survive if I took boss aggro. Sorry, tank.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was a bit skeptical that you can have a real authentic, MMO-style dungeon experience without, you know, the MMO, but Fellowship really effectively delivered. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of bosses, I saw four interesting setpiece fights that ran the gamut of stuff I expect from modern dungeon runs. In a ghost pirate dungeon we battled a skeletal shipmaster that required quick reflexes as it tossed our ghosts in and out of our bodies. There was a giant treasure construct that couldn't be tanked—instead, our tank had to roll around a ball to collect the bits of treasure we were knocking off of it. There was also a giant zombie that summoned the tides, requiring us to shackle ourselves to an anchor and dodge sharks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't all gimmicks, though, and the developers were clear they wanted to strike a balance between fights that require reflexes and understanding clever mechanics with those that really push your ability to play your class' skills to the limit. They gave me a good example of the second with a nasty warlock boss, whose up-tempo barrage of skills and summons needed constant interruption even as he created zones that either forced us to group up… or to run away at top speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I especially liked is how Fellowship will be structured. Dungeon difficulty scales from one up to six levels, gradually adding new enemy abilities to learn, mechanics to understand, and taking off the training wheels one by one until you hit the intended difficulty. From there, though, it ramps up for dozens of levels, each with their own unique combination of two or more curses that have their own downsides and upsides. One of those, for example, could sprinkle nasty Empowered minions among the normal enemy packs—but when you beat them you'd get a short-time buff that let you clear trash even faster or take a handy boost into a boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The concept of a game focusing on infinitely scaling dungeons, familiar yet dangerous in new ways, is a really cool one. Combine that with the developers' big plans for competitive seasons, where players can start fresh to race up the leaderboards for world first kills on each boss, and I think I'm pretty excited to gear up, spec out, and take on the challenges in Fellowship when it launches this year.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Marvel Rivals has been a big success on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, but the game hasn't come to Nintendo Switch. With the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on the horizon for 2025, some are wondering if the superhero shooter could come to the new Nintendo system, and it doesn't sound too far fetched.</p><p>Producer Weicong Wu told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-developer-is-open-to-potential-future-release-on-nintendo-switch-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that NetEase is already speaking with Nintendo and "working on some development kits" for the Switch 2.</p><p>"Whenever we find that we could provide great performance for our game on Switch 2, we're open to that," Wu said. "The reason why we didn't launch it onto the Switch, it was the first generation of that device they cannot provide a great experience for our gameplay. So if it could achieve that goal, we're open to that."</p><p>It's quite surprising to hear a developer from such a big company working on a major title like Marvel Rivals speak so openly about the Switch 2. Companies are better known to be much more guarded with information about Nintendo's next console.</p><p>The Switch 2 is coming out this year, with Nintendo expected to share lots more information about the console in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">April during a special Nintendo Direct event.</a> The system, along with the launch of GTA 6, is expected to have an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">outsized impact on the overall video game industry in 2025.</a> The Switch 2 was formally confirmed in January 2025, but many remarked that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-was-surprising-due-to-lack-of-surprises-says-former-playstation-boss/1100-6529203/" data-ref-id="1100-6529203">the reveal didn't pack a punch. </a></p><p>As for Marvel Rivals, the game's developers recently announced it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-adding-human-torch-and-the-thing-very-soon-alongside-a-rank-reset/1100-6529366/" data-ref-id="1100-6529366">restructure its season rankings</a>, but then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-reworks-its-ranking-system-again-due-to-fan-complaints/1100-6529388/" data-ref-id="1100-6529388">quickly reversed that decision</a>. Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1imd0h8/marvel_rivals_dev_talk_vol10_seasonal_rank/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">immediately responded</a> with how much they hated it, causing NetEase to backpedal within hours.</p>

The Human Torch will be added as part of the Season 1 mid-season update on February 21, alongside The Thing.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ORBFXYlQ3U">new trailer</a> shows that Johnny Storm will be primarily a flying character, similar to Iron Man or Storm. His primary fire is a fireball he throws that leaves a small burning area on the ground where it hits. He has six charges, which appear to recharge over time instead of being reloaded. Human Torch can also use a dive attack, which propels him into the ground, dealing damage and knocking enemies back.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Another ability the Human Torch has is to create a square of fire, with the borders of the square dealing damage to anyone standing on them or crossing over. His ultimate ability lets him throw out multiple fire tornadoes, which move around after being placed. The trailer also showed his team-up with Storm, which set her ultimate ability--also a tornado--on fire, presumably doing even more damage than usual. Johnny's flying ability and high-damage output is likely to make him a popular pick once he drops.</p><p dir="ltr">The Human Torch joins Marvel Rivals on February 21, alongside the Thing, who should get his own gameplay trailer later this week. All future Marvel Rivals heroes, including Human Torch, are available for free. The mid-season update includes other changes to Marvel Rivals, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-balance-changes-take-aim-at-triple-support-meta/1100-6529553/">nerfs aimed at the triple-support meta</a> and rewards for players with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-will-now-reward-you-for-leftover-battle-pass-currency/1100-6529551/">leftover battle-pass currency</a> at the end of the season.</p>

It wears its heart on its sleeve but keeps its cards close to its chest in the first of its two episodes, and I hope its final chapter will be as compelling as the first when it launches in April because I’m hooked.</p><p><em>Lost Records </em>follows a group of four girls in a fictional small Michigan town called Velvet Cove during the mid-90s. Swann, a socially awkward high schooler whose only friend is her camcorder, is about to leave town for the Great White North. But as her family is packing their lives into boxes, she meets a new group of friends: the straight-laced ice cream shopkeep Autumn, the no-thoughts-head-empty punk Nora, and the angsty writer Kat. The girls are brought together while confronting a local bully, find an abandoned cabin they make into their secret hideout, and create a punk band together. They’ve all got big dreams beyond this small town and even if their time together is short, they’re all more than eager to hype each other up.</p><figure id="" data-id="ee278d60c7b333f4e126600ddbae832f" data-recommend-id="image://ee278d60c7b333f4e126600ddbae832f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Swann and her friends talk on the phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Swann and her friends talk on the phone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ee278d60c7b333f4e126600ddbae832f" data-recommend-id="image://ee278d60c7b333f4e126600ddbae832f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Swann and her friends talk on the phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Swann is one of the most compelling video game leads I’ve played in a while. She’s awkward, but spirited and passionate. All of that comes through in the dialogue choices you’re given with her. She can be shy and reserved, but she can also be a little bit of a freak who’s never gotten to let loose with other girls her age. So many of the prompts I got while talking to the rest of the group felt like, in choosing them, I was encouraging Swann to take up space. That can be as simple as letting out a joyful scream as the girls run through the woods, or as weighty as asking your friends if they even want you around.</p><p><em>Lost Records </em>is a nostalgic game that leans into its ‘90s setting, but it also recognizes just how much stays the same as years pass, or even gets worse. The ‘90s story is told through interstitial flashbacks as the girls reunite and reminisce in their 40s. Despite decades between both sides of the story, Swann is still largely the same. As an adult, she’s a bookish nerd who, even after everything the girls have been through together, still doesn’t seem confident they even want her there. That’s the double-edged sword of looking back. You think of the “good ol’ days” and realize that the insecurities you felt then are still around. Maybe you fell back into old habits after so long away from each other, or maybe this is just who you always were.</p><figure id="" data-id="428c86e4829fb2f7c6bddd8aabeb6fff" data-recommend-id="image://428c86e4829fb2f7c6bddd8aabeb6fff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Autumn looks down at the table in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Autumn looks down at the table in front of her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="428c86e4829fb2f7c6bddd8aabeb6fff" data-recommend-id="image://428c86e4829fb2f7c6bddd8aabeb6fff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Autumn looks down at the table in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Their time together revisiting the past isn’t all about warm recollections, though; it’s clear something happened in that fateful summer all those years ago that haunts the women to this day. That dark turn in the story begins with a scene in which Kat asks to recite lyrics she’s written for their group. The girls are sitting in a circle out in the woods away from anyone who might judge them, and I was surprised at how affected I was by the vulnerability of Kat just singing a song she wrote for her closest friends. I’m in my 30s, and I know that exposing yourself like that doesn’t get any easier with age. I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791">moved to New York City</a></span> two years ago and I’m still painstakingly analyzing every word I say to new connections I make in this city, like it’s a negotiation for their time and attention and I’m trying to make my case. But when you’re a teenager everything you feel is so raw, and every request to be seen by those around you feels like the riskiest thing you’ve ever done. That’s the barrier Swann is pushing against throughout <em>Lost Records</em>’ first half.</p><p>In the present day, I see Swann is still friendly with her old group, but each dialogue option feels high-stakes, despite all the years they’ve known each other. Making a choice in <em>Lost Records </em>is accompanied by an icon of either a whole or broken heart, signifying each girl’s reaction to it. Swann’s awkward demeanor and her clear desire to be accepted by her first real, close friends made every broken heart icon sting. The paranoia of saying the wrong thing to someone you still don’t know that well but would like to can stay with you long after your awkward teenage years are behind you, and <em>Lost Records</em> makes this agonizing reality a game mechanic. It’s so well executed that I winced for Swann whenever I said the wrong thing and maybe made one of the other girls sad or uncomfortable. It ate at me until the credits rolled, not unlike remembering a dumb interaction with a new friend hours after it happened.</p><figure id="" data-id="c461a93e2a93d9fa9b98e76b0864e006" data-recommend-id="image://c461a93e2a93d9fa9b98e76b0864e006" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Swann and her friends look down a chasm as a purple light shines from it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Swann and her friends look down a chasm as a purple light shines from it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c461a93e2a93d9fa9b98e76b0864e006" data-recommend-id="image://c461a93e2a93d9fa9b98e76b0864e006" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Swann and her friends look down a chasm as a purple light shines from it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Swann feels most herself when she doesn’t have to talk at all and is instead behind her camcorder taping all the group’s shenanigans. <em>Lost Records</em> trades <em>Life Is Strange</em>’s superpowers for a <em>Pokémon Snap</em>-like mechanic of recording your friends, nature, wildlife, and the citizens of Velvet Cove. Looking for enough shots to complete different themed videos can become a bit of a tedious collectathon, but I liked bringing out my photojournalism schooling to line up good shots and see the final montage. The system Don’t Nod uses to recognize if you’re recording the right thing is forgiving enough that you don’t feel restricted and can be expressive with your cinematography. It’s a mostly fun detour on your way to the game’s more impactful moments, but the best parts of <em>Lost Records </em>happen when Swann puts the camera down and has to relate to her friends without a buffer.</p><p>The first half of <em>Lost Records </em>only gestures at the bigger picture until it nears the end of its roughly six-hour run time. Something unspeakable happened in the ‘90s, and even as middle-aged women, Swann and her friends struggle to talk about it. But as they trace their footsteps to how they all found themselves back in Velvet Cove in their 40s, they will have to confront the truth, as much as some of them seem hesitant to do so. Don’t Nod has been gradually lowering the number of episodes in its episodic adventure games since the original <em>Life Is Strange</em>’s year-long run in 2015. So at the very least <em>Lost Records</em> won’t take too much longer. I just hope the second half lives up to the first when it launches on April 15.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals players will finally be able to exchange their leftover Chrono Tokens from the battle pass into something more useful. After having to let those extra tokens go to waste earlier, players that complete the Season 1 pass can get rewarded for their extra efforts.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-adds-new-chrono-token-exchange-system">Marvel Rivals Adds New Chrono Token Exchange System</h2>



<p>In the developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPCzylKgc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> for the upcoming Marvel Rivals Season 1.5 update, the team at NetEase confirmed the new Chrono Token redemption system. Players that own the Luxury battle pass and redeem all the rewards can convert leftover Chrono Tokens into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launching-perfect-couples-costumes-on-valentines-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Units used in the store</a>. “Luxury” just refers to the paid pass itself: you did not need to buy the more expensive version that came with extra Chrono Tokens to be eligible for the new redemption system. Any player who buys the pass and redeems all its awards will be able to convert excess Chrono Tokens into Units.</p>



<p>This issue was a major community talking point during Season 0. The shortened season features a much smaller battle pass that could be completed rather quickly, but players were still completing daily and weekly challenges and earning Chrono Tokens that completely went to waste. With the new system, it should encourage players to continue playing and completing challenges even if they’ve completed the pass.</p>



<p>Potentially, this change could result in a little bit less spending of Lattice at the store. However, that all depends on what the ratio of Chrono Tokens to Units will be, which NetEase hasn’t revealed yet. Marvel Rivals fans should temper their expectations now, as it’s very unlikely that it will even be close to a 1:1 ratio. Season 1.5 officially goes live on February 21.</p>

                <p>Out of the all the side quests you can embark on in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>, Forged of the Star-Stuff has the longest, but arguably most rewarding payoff. This quest begins whenever you find a Fragment of Starmetal and requires you to reach the final map of the game to complete it. The Fragments of Starmetal are difficult enough to find, but having to potentially wait dozens of hours to find out what the metal does can be agonizing.</p><p>Fortunately, the quest is worth the wait, as you can score yourself an incredible weapon in Avowed with the Starmetal. The question is, how do you find Fragments of Starmetal and complete the quest?</p><p><strong>Be aware this guide naturally contains some light spoilers.</strong></p><p>First and foremost, once you find a Fragment of Starmetal, the Forged of Star-Stuff quest is automatically triggered in Avowed. You can view the quest in your journal but the game offers nothing in the way of an explanation for what to do with the metal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445586" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445586"></a><figcaption>One of the Fragment of Starmetal pieces</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png"></figure><p>You can find a Fragment of Starmetal as early as Dawnshore, but unfortunately, you have to go through every single map in the game until you can use it. If you speak to certain vendors across the three maps of Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, and Shatterscarp, you can ask about the Starmetal. Specifically, asking blacksmiths about the metal will yield the most answers.</p><p>Regardless of who you speak to about the Starmetal, though, you'll get told the same thing: The Starmetal can only be worked by a smith in Solace Keep. Solace Keep is the main hub city in the final map of Avowed, called Galawain's Tusks. You can only reach this map by progressing through Avowed's main story. So, if you happen to find the Fragment of Starmetal in Dawnshore, you'll have to go through the events of Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, and Shatterscarp before you're finally able to do something with the item.</p><h2 id="How_to_get_into_Solace_Keep_and_complete_Forged_of_Star_Stuff">How to get into Solace Keep and complete Forged of Star-Stuff</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445585" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445585"></a><figcaption>Talking to Forgemaster Dela in Solace Keep</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png"></figure><p>When you finally reach Galawain's Tusks, you need to travel all the way north to Solace Keep. Solace Keep is extremely well-guarded and doesn't let outsiders in, however, so you have to speak to the guards at the drawbridge before entering the city.</p><p>You are able to persuade the guard to let you in through a few methods. I was able to tell him I got the clear water running by completing an earlier side quest in Galawain's Tusks, but you can also use persuasion checks and certain background dialogue to convince the guard to let you through.</p><p>Once inside Solace Keep, head straight through the mess hall until you reach a pathway that leads downstairs. This goes into the forge, where Foregmaster Dela is standing in front of a statue. Talk to Dela and show him the Starmetal you have in your inventory. He'll start to clamor over the metal and offer to make you a unique weapon from it. You have the choice between a Starmetal Sword or an Arquebus.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445584" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445584"></a><figcaption>The unique Moonstrike arquebus weapon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png"></figure><p>The unique sword is called Meteor Blade while the unique arquebus is called Moonstrike. Both are fantastic weapons, but the Moonstrike is a little bit better and more useful, in my opinion. However, if you find more Fragments of Starmetal, you can bring them back to Dela and he will make you more weapons with them, allowing you to possess several unique Starmetal weapons. You can also bring more Starmetal to Dela so he can upgrade your existing weapon.</p><p>Forged of Star-Stuff doesn't end until you find the location of every Fragment of Starmetal in Avowed, but once you have one weapon, the quest is essentially completed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445583" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445583"></a><figcaption>One of the Fragment of Starmetal pieces</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png"></figure><p>So far, we know of four different Fragment of Starmetal locations, but there are certainly more on the map that have yet to be discovered. Here are the four locations we know of:</p><ul><li><strong>Galawain's Tusks</strong>: Right beside the Ash Forest in a meteor pit where the Revenant bounty is located (northwest of Solace Keep)</li><li><strong>Dawnshore</strong>: At the Godless Altar directly south of the gate to Emerald Stair on the eastern side of the map</li><li><strong>Shatterscarp</strong>: In the Abandoned Mines directly across from Ruanga's house (seen during the One Last Drink side quest)</li><li><strong>Emerald Stair</strong>: Right underneath the Damp Burrow text in the northern part of Emerald Stair on a rock (to the east of the Abandoned Farms and Rolling Crags)</li></ul><p>We'll update this guide with more fragment locations if they are discovered. All you really need is one to complete the Forged of Star-Stuff quest in Avowed, but like we said, a few more overpowered weapons surely don't hurt, right? Well, they don't hurt <em>you</em>, anyway.</p><p>Obsidian is no stranger to crafting compelling RPGs.

Sanza is missing one last cartographer somewhere in the fiery region and it's your job to find out where they are. Unlike the other cartographers in Mapping the Living Lands, however, the one in Galawain's Tusks is alive and well, and you have a decision to make regarding their fate.</p><p>To see where the Galawain's Tusks cartographer is located in Avowed and how to finally complete Mapping the Living Lands, keep reading the guide below.</p><h2>Galawain's Tusks Cartographer location in Avowed</h2><p>Unfortunately, the cartographer in Galawain's Tusks is just about as far as possible from the starting position in the region. You have to travel all the way north to Solace Keep and then find a jail tower where the cartographer is being held prisoner. This jail tower is called "Soreena's Mercy" and it's located to the northwest of Solace Keep.</p><p>You don't have to enter Solace Keep or complete any additional story missions in Avowed to reach the cartographer. You don't even have to actively track the new Mapping the Living Lands quest.

At the very end of the prison cells, you'll see an NPC standing outside of one of the cells. There's a person inside named Renato, who you can speak to through the cell.</p><p>Renato is Sanza's missing cartographer, and he was arrested by the Wardens at Solace Keep for stealing supplies so he could stay alive to complete his mission for Sanza. As you continue speaking with him, you'll be able to make a choice regarding his fate. You can either convince the Warden to release Renato, which isn't too difficult, or you can say you're going to take his map and leave him to rot in the cell for his crimes. The alternative is to fight the Warden and free Renato yourself, but that's mostly unnecessary unless you're playing a more aggressive character.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445558" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445558"></a><figcaption>Choosing to free Renato or leave him in the cell. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png"></figure><p>If you choose to free Renato, he will end up giving you his cartography map anyway. If you take his map and make him stay in the cell, the outcome is the same, as you can take the map back to Sanza in Paradis to complete the Mapping the Living Lands quest.

The mid-season update will also add The Thing and Human Torch, along with a new map and balance update.</p><p dir="ltr">Shared in the <a href="https://youtu.be/FMPCzylKgc8?si=jxolri2w_qBGMha6&amp;t=189" rel="nofollow ">Marvel Rivals Dev Vision</a>, leftover Chrono Tokens, the battle-pass currency, will be exchanged for Units, an in-game currency used to buy cosmetics from the store, like hero skins. While the exact ratio wasn't revealed in the video, this exchange will be available to players who have purchased the premium version of the battle pass and redeemed all of the rewards in the battle pass. If you meet those two requirements by the end of the season, whatever tokens you have left will be exchanged at whatever the ratio is. It wasn't stated if the ratio will be revealed along with the patch notes for the mid-season update, or if it will be revealed towards the end of Season 1.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPCzylKgc8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FMPCzylKgc8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Chrono Tokens are earned exclusively from challenges--daily, season, or event--so players cannot earn them endlessly. However, in Season 0 there were certainly far more tokens that could be earned than needed to unlock every item in the battle pass, and the Season 1 battle pass is tracking to be similar. Marvel Rivals battle passes don't expire, so this exchange offers a reward for players who finish a battle pass within the same season it's released.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals Season 1 mid-season update drops on Friday, February 21, bringing a new Duelist and Vanguard to the roster, along with a new map and balance updates, like some much needed nerfs for certain Strategist ultimates.</p>

In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">an interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, senior game designer Daniel Holt talked about the collaboration and this initial look, which focuses on four major character cards and their associated pre-constructed Commander decks.</p><p>The revealed cards include Terra from <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, Tidus from <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, Y’shtola from (<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-critically-acclaimed-mmorpg">critically acclaimed MMORPG</a>)<em> <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></em>, and of course, Cloud from <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> adds various new tinctures of wyvern, toad monster and arachnid to the fantasy creature chopper's vaunted eco-stew, but that additional variety isn't quite apparent from the weapon types. They're fancier-looking with tweaked or expanded movesets, but it's a familiar line-up beneath the extra layers of flesh and metal. I recognise most from my ancient PSP copy of Monster Hunter Freedom 2, released in 2007.</p>
<p>Capcom have thrown in a few novelties such as Monster Hunter 4's Insect Glaive over the intervening years, but according to Wilds director Yuya Tokuda, the developers currently feel it's more important to trick out and rebalance the existing wargear than give you entire new ways to play.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"When we start development of games such as World and, recently, Wilds, we always consider whether or not this is the time to add another weapon type," Tokuda told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/monster-hunter-wilds/new-weapon-type">PCGamesN</a> via translator in a recent interview. "It's not off the table for any particular reason, it's just that we never really decided that we wanted to for the recent titles."</p>
<p>The game's current arsenal includes 14 categories of large animal evisceration, from the relatively fool-proof Greatsword to the fussier Hunting Horn, aka Magic Murder Trumpet. It's tricky, Tokuda said, to envisage "a 15th weapon that would actually have a place in that lineup and feel equally as valid as the other weapon types while also not overlapping with them too much."
</p>
<p>
"It's a very difficult thing," he went on. "With each title we always adjust all the weapon types and maybe bring new concepts to them and their relationships with each other to make them feel fresh. We also bring new depth with new combos and moves. The resources and time that it takes to do that is something that, in every case since the last weapon was added, we've always decided were better spent bringing the whole lineup to a better place than to simply start adding another new one in."
</p>
<p>In the case of Wilds, Capcom have also had to wrangle with the problem of what to bring back from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>'s Iceborne expansion - the last home format Monster Hunter release, which was aimed at more proficient players. "People who were playing a given weapon in Iceborne were assumed to have mastered the basics and it was going beyond that with adding new combos and moves and abilities," Tokuda told the site.</p>
<p>
I haven't really felt the need for fresh weaponry in Munster Honker of late. I've been distracted by all the talk of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ghastly-spider-monster-is-actually-key-to-the-games-more-approachable-design">atrocious pedagogic spiders</a>. But adding to and balancing Monster Hunter's arsenal sounds more intriguing than doing likewise for, say, Call Of Duty, because of course, every Monster Hunter weapon has to come from a monster.</p>
<p>I wonder if Capcom have considered siloing off their monster design teams, feeding them a lot of fermented berries, and having them challenge the blacksmiths by putting together a menagerie that defies weaponisation. Here's a rare species of wyvern that consists entirely of balloons! Here's an insect monster made of nested triangles! Here's a dinosaur that's so thin it's only visible from the side! Let's see you make another Gunlance out of that.
