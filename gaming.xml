<p>Rejoice, Gods and Goddesses! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> launches on Switch and Switch 2 tomorrow, 25th September 2025. Gosh, can time slow down a little bit? There are <em>so many</em> games coming out at the moment.</p>
<p>You'll see reviews have gone live at a number of sites today and might be thinking "wait, where are NL's impressions?" Well, they're coming very soon! So keep an eye out in the coming days.</p>
<p>For those of you who can't quite wait, however, Felix has put together some early impressions of Supergiant Games' first-ever sequel. And, don't worry, if you've never dipped into the Early Access version of the game on Steam, there's no need to fear spoilers, as we're keeping things contained to the early hours.</p>
<p>We've also got some comparisons between the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions — longer load times and less-crisp visuals, and only 60fps in docked and handheld, while on Switch 2, docked performance is 120fps.</p>

<p>So if you're not sure whether to dive in tomorrow or just want to get a little bit more excited for Hades II, have a look at Felix's video up top. And then check back very soon for our full review.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget, Hades II is getting a full physical edition, and it will have the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions on the cart! If you can't wait, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/heres-when-hades-2-releases-in-your-time-zone">we've got a rundown of when the game drops in your region digitally</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Activision has debuted the first gameplay trailer for the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and published a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">new blog on the Call of Duty website</a> along with it that delves further into the loose narrative that ties the zombie killing together and the new and returning gameplay features in this year's iteration. What's most exciting for players who can't wait to jump into the Zombies mode is that the upcoming Open Beta will feature the zombies survival gameplay mode on top of its other multiplayer modes.</p>



<p>The new trailer kicks off with a short recap of <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-debuts-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-trailer/">what we saw in the cinematic trailer that debuted last week</a>, when we were first introduced to the cast of characters in the zombies mode, before showing off some snippets of gameplay to the tune of AC/DC's Highway to Hell.</p>



<p>It's all appropriately action-packed and what you'd expect from a trailer showing off some gruesome zombie killing, while the blog post that appeared alongside it has more of the juicier details about what the mode will actually play and look like.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Zombies Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/07SF99EeZ1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the narrative in this year's Zombies mode, Black Ops 7 Zombies picks up where Black Ops 6 left off, and sends players "<em>to the beating heart of the Dark Aether</em>," with multiple timelines colliding in one place.</p>



<p>The eight-character crew you'll play as throughout the Zombies mode are fighting their way through the Dark Aether, and the narrative bits that connect all this fighting will be dolled out as they usually are, through seasonal post-launch updates for players to dig through. Of course, though, no one really plays Zombies for the story.</p>



<p>It's the creatures, the killing, intricate maps, and fun gameplay loop that continues to keep players hooked. The maps included in this year's Zombies mode include Janus Towers Plaza, Vandorn Farm, Blackwater Lake, Ashwood, Exit 115, Zarya Cosmodrome, and The Fog. </p>



<p>Each map includes different points of interest and variations that make sessions on them feel different, like the thick fog that blurs your vision, the deteriorating and decrepit highway diner and gas station of Exit 115, the constantly sinking frontier town of Ashwood, and the picturesque resort of Blackwater Lake that's made less eye-catching by the zombies everywhere.</p>



<p>One of the key new features in this year's mode is the addition of a new wonder vehicle called Ol'Tessie, a truck that can be your battering ram through the hordes and get you out of a pinch when you need it, but you'll still need to maintain the truck by reinforcing its frame whenever it takes too much damage.</p>



<p>There's also a new ultimate weapon to tack on to the Ray Gun with the Necrofluid Gauntlet, a glove that lets you punch through zombies' heads like nobody's business. You can also fire spikes through it, and even pull items to you.</p>



<p>Of course, there's much more to come in this year's Zombies mode, and you'll be able to try a lot of them out during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-october/">coming beta that kicks off next week</a>. Today's Zombies trailer also isn't the only recent look at gameplay we've gotten for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-reveal-trailer-wall-running-activision/">new multiplayer gameplay trailer debuted just two days ago</a>.</p>

            <p>
Capcom and Square Enix announced earlier this year that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> would be collaborating with one another, and the first trailer for the former's collab received a proper look in today. It's coming as part of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game's third title update, so there's more included than just Final Fantasy bits, but that does seem to be the main thing here. So what's included?
</p>
<p>
Well, for starters there's the cosmetics. A couple of Final Fantasy 14 jobs will be making their way into the game, the first being the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> reference that is the Dark Knight job. This one gives you a big ole greatsword, and equipping the armour set lets you perform a special action. Then there's Pictomancer, a more recent addition to Final Fantasy 14 that lets you cast different pictomancy spells. It's kind of like you get to do a little cosplay!

<p>
The new monster for this update isn't technically a monster, instead you'll be getting Omega Planetes, a Final Fantasy 14, Magitek-themed enemy that looks like it'll incorporate some mechanics from the MMO itself. Neat! You'll also be able to ride around on a Chocobo instead of a Seikret, and Cactuar will show up along the way somewhere too (including its signature pose).
</p><p>
Outside of the collab stuff, Arch-tempered Nu Udra is showing up in an event quest starting October 22nd and running until October 29, which nets you some fiery-looking armour. The Grand Hub will also get a Halloweeny overhaul too. At the end of the trailer there was a tease for title update four too, which showed a look at Gogmazios (great name), a volcanic-themed monster.
</p>
<p>
Title update three is scheduled for release later this month on September 29th, and title update four is planned for some time in December.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/annapurna-showcase-tgs-trailers-zelda-kpop-ai-puzzle-2000628182</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-publisher-behind-the-award-winning-stray-just-revealed-three-cool-new-games.1307256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/annapurna-interactive-stray-alan-wake-tv-control-2-1851647950">Annapurna Interactive</a> kicked of Tokyo Game Show 2025 with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXf5t1MC1k">brief showcase</a> last night that highlighted three new indies joining its <a href="https://kotaku.com/stray-steam-cat-game-god-of-war-powerwash-simulator-1849339513">impressive list of published games</a> which includes <em>Donut County</em>, <em>Stray</em>, and <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>. The upcoming releases hail from a variety of teams and feature unusual genre mashups. Could one or more of them be a 2026 GOTY contender? Here’s a brief breakdown of each.</p> <h2><em>People of Note</em> is an RPG for theater kids</h2>  <p>I’ll admit, I usually try to stay as far away from theater kids as possible, doubly so if they start singing (which I’m allowed to say as a reformed theater kid myself). But <em>People of Note</em>, a musical RPG, is boasting turn-based battles and some really pretty-looking environments.</p> <p>You travel around to different musically themed cities recruiting new band mates, but the real draw is the rhythm-based combat that evolves over the course of each fight as the music being played shifts. “Did you like <em>Expedition 33</em>? Did you like <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em>? Well…” is the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sunshineduk.bsky.social/post/3lzkfq2fylc2j">best pitch</a> for it I’ve heard yet. It’s made by Iridium Studios and is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year.</p>

 <h2><em>Demi and the Fractured Dream</em> is a <em>Zelda</em>-like for Dungeon nerds</h2>  <p>Okay, we’re getting a little warmer to my personal tastes with <em>Demi and the Fractured Dream</em>, a pretty familiar-looking riff on the classic <em>Zelda</em> puzzle action formula. You play as an antlered “voidsent” trying to lift a mysterious curse who travels to a bunch of different biomes to do that, including one that looks very <em>Journey.</em></p>

 <p>The draw here is the<em> Devil May Cry</em> sword combos and 3D dungeon exploration. There’s even a backwards flip just like in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. <em>Zelda</em> homages are a dime a dozen at this point, but I’m as hungry as anyone else for clever 3D puzzles. It’s being made by Yarn Owl and it’s coming to Switch 1/2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next year.</p>

 <h2><em>D-topia</em> is a cozy puzzle adventure for people terrified of the future</h2>  <p>This is by far the game I came away from the showcase most excited to check out. <em>D-topia</em> takes place in a future where, instead of drowning us in meme-slop and cooking the planet’s atmosphere, highly advanced AI has actually helped to take care of humanity’s every seeming need. If there’s a grim <em>Black Mirror</em>-style lining to this sci-fi story, it’s not apparent from the first trailer.</p> <p>Your job is to help the AI help make people’s lives better, exploring their personal relationships and unique life situations along the way. There’s logic puzzles, branching convos, and a very cute, very thick cat in the mix. It’s being made by Marumittu Games and coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Maybe it’s just because nothing could possibly live up to the cultural takeover of last year’s </span><i><span>Wicked</span></i><span> that the promotional campaign for </span><i><span>Wicked: For Good</span></i><span>, the second and final part of the </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz</span></i><span> stage musical’s movie adaptation, has felt a bit understated. We’re still two months away from the movie’s premiere in November, but this far out from the release of the first film, I was already being inundated with videos and memes of Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo on a press tour, and nothing like that has happened yet with this one.. So it was surprising to me to see that, this morning, Universal released the final trailer for </span><i><span>For Good</span></i><span>. Maybe I’ve just been in an unintentional media blackout, but what was more surprising to me than the arrival of the trailer itself was that it pretty much spoils some of the biggest twists in the musical’s second act.</span></p>  <p><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>fans have spent much of the last year trying to obscure some of the major reveals yet to come after Erivo’s showstopping “Defying Gravity” closed out the first movie, but the final trailer for the sequel pretty much gives away some of those details just months before the movie hits theaters. Specifically, the first film</span> <span>sows the seeds for iconic characters from the original </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz </span></i><span>to appear in </span><i><span>For Good</span></i><span>, but you might not catch on if you weren’t already privy to the musical’s second act. The most obvious is the lion cub Elphaba and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) rescue, who grows up to be the Cowardly Lion who accompanies Dorothy. But what about the Tin Man and Scarecrow who make up the rest of their crew? Well, viewers are quite familiar with both of these characters, actually. Boq, played by Ethan Slater, is turned into the Tin Man by Elphaba in an attempt to save his life. Fiyero suffers a similar fate, with Elphaba’s magic turning him into a scarecrow after he is tortured by the Wizard’s guards.</span></p>  <p><span>All of that had been mostly kept under wraps, until this new trailer. Boq’s fate is much more spelled out, as we see him turned into the Tin Man and shouting at Elphaba for what she’s done. Fiyero’s fate is more implied, as we see Elphaba stroking his face, but Bailey is facing away from the camera, so people who aren’t paying a ton of attention might miss that one. If you somehow didn’t catch it and are still reading this article anyway, sorry?</span></p> <p><i><span>Wicked: For Good</span></i><span> heads to theaters on November 21, when we will finally get to hear Erivo’s rendition of “No Good Deed,” resulting in world peace and happiness across the land.</span></p>

One of the mods even removes the franchise's signature fog from the Japanese town of Ebisugaoka. And suddenly it's a much nicer day for high school student Hinako Shimizu, at least until something tries to kill her.</p><p>As demonstrated in the post above, the game isn't quite as intimidating if you can see everything clearly. Last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2</a> remake also had <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/videos/51" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a mod that got rid of the fog</a>. Some of the other notable mods for Silent Hill f include <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthillf/mods/7" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hardware-based ray tracing</a>, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthillf/mods/5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removal of the HUD</a>, and some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthillf/mods/9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">optimization tweaks for the game's engine</a>.</p><p>Silent Hill f is a departure for the series and the first game in the franchise to be set in Japan. The story takes place in the '60s and follows Hinako as she tries to understand why her town has seemingly been swallowed in endless fog and populated by horrific creatures. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/" data-ref-id="1900-6418411">review for Silent Hill f</a> gave it a 9 out of 10.</p><p>This game arrived less than a year after Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake. That title was so well-received that Konami and Bloober Team are joining forces again for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-remake-seemingly-teased-by-bloober-team/1100-6532382/" data-ref-id="1100-6532382">a remake of the original Silent Hill</a>. However, there's no release date set for that game yet.</p><p>Next year, the franchise will return to the big screen with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-will-hit-theaters-in-early-2026/1100-6532537/" data-ref-id="1100-6532537">Return to Silent Hill</a>, a film that will adapt the story of Silent Hill 2. Original Silent Hill director and screenwriter Christophe Gans returned to helm this sequel, which stars Jeremy Irvine as James Sunderland, Hannah Emily Anderson as Mary, and Evie Templeton as Laura. Return to Silent Hill will hit theaters on January 23, 2026.</p>

            <p>
There is perhaps no better thing for a game to have than other, inconsequential things that have no real relation to the main thing for you to do that are entirely focused on mucking about. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> is ostensibly about reaching the top of a mountain all for the sake of a sweet chance of escape, but really it is about doing silly things with, to, or around your friends. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/520850995978175752?l=english">new update</a> has arrived in the game that is, to use the word ostensibly again because I couldn't think of another one, ostensibly about rebindable controls, but here too it's really about doing silly things with friends, things that don't even involve any climbing.
</p>
<p>
Basketball! This is one such way you can pass your time before heading out on your next misadventure. The devs say they "even made it dribble," which I do believe is quite important in this particular sport, I can't be sure, America hasn't successfully forced this pastime onto the UK like it has every other aspect of its culture. There's also chess, a game which I feel in my gut is somehow the spiritual inverse of Peak, but don't have the words to accurately describe this just yet.
</p>
<p>
On the cuter end of things, there's a photobooth in the airport now too, complete with non-functional, prop versions of the game's various items to take pictures with. Oh, and Bing Bong - you've met Bing Bong, right? Great guy, great guy - will now give you a yes-or-no answer after giving him a good squeeze, say for example if you were to ask him if it's a good idea to leap to your death or not. Love ya Bing Bong!
</p>
<p>
There is another big biome update on the way, this was mostly an update to get rebindable controls in (which are exactly what they sound like) with a few extras thrown on top.
</p>
<p>
You can pick up Peak with its new update on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">Steam</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have once again addressed the range of performance issues that've come to afflict the shooter, teasing a mid-October update that they reckon should deliver a "noticeable improvement" and outlining that wider plans are in the works in terms of dealing with some larger problems.</p>
<p>Problems with Helldivers 2's stability and general bugginess of the bad kind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-hotfix-tackling-into-the-unjust-update-crashes-out-now-and-arrowhead-are-looking-into-pc-freezing">rose to prominence again following last month's Into the Unjust update</a>. Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-will-target-helldivers-2s-crippling-tech-issues-now-xbox-release-is-sorted-but-would-rather-not-do-a-performance-only-update">quick to admit that the game's performance was "not good enough"</a>, citing "crippling" technical debt as being st the root of some of the more deep-seated issues. At the time, he said the studio would likely prefer not to put out an update focused only on performance fixes unless it was totally necessary, but it appears that might have been deemed to be the case.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We know many of you have been experiencing issues including performance drops, stability hiccups, freezes, and the annoying audio bugs...We also recognise that our recent updates haven’t hit the mark, and our silence hasn’t helped. That’s on us," reads a tweet attributed to the entire Arrowhead team.
</p>
<p>They go on to tease an update they're aiming to release "mid October-ish", which they reckon "will make a noticeable improvement" in the short-term. As to which problems it'll target/fixes it'll include, the studio listed the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Some key crash fixes</li>
<li>Fixed the Primary weapon/Side-arm audio that stops during a mission</li>
<li>Minor performance improvements</li>
<li>Long overdue bug fixes, like Charger footstep sounds (pretty useful) or weapon audio stopping mid mission</li>
<li>No more landing on caves</li>
<li>A Balance Pass</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that, Arrowhead wrote: "For some of the bigger performances pieces unfortunately we can’t wave a ‘short-turnaround-magic-wand’, nor would a 60 day patch fix them fully (rather it would be duct tape where we need to solder); so we’re working on a bigger development plan as to how we can address some of the larger concerns."</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Greetings Helldivers,</p><p>We know many of you have been experiencing issues including performance drops, stability hiccups, freezes, and the annoying audio bugs.</p><p>We’ve seen the feedback across Discord, forums, Reddit and our dashboards. You’ve been loud, clear, and absolutely right…</p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1970845182674215225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>They closed out by promising more communication and transparency with players going forwards, something that's long been a bit of an achilles heel in the otherwise admirable job the studio have done in terms of working to sustain their live-service about super service. We'll see if they're finally able to get on top of it this time, possibly by bringing in more folks to help out a community team that from what I've seen already do an awful lot in terms of answering questions and addressing concerns on the game's very active Discord. The issue's generally been the comms which goes beyond that sector of the playerbase, with responses on Discord regularly having to be reposted elsewhere to get word out.</p>
<p>Arrowhead have their hands full from the perspective of new additions to the game too at the moment. They recently had to commit to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-devs-arrowhead-pull-new-rupture-strain-bugs-offline-for-five-weeks-to-fix-their-er-bugs">turning off a new strain of Terminids</a> for just over a month in an effort to fix issues with the burrowing bugs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hades 2 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2-review.1307208/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">How do you follow up a character-driven rougelite that's nearly peerless at everything it does like Hades? You need to know where to go bigger without adding too much bloat. You need to know where you can tighten down some screws without smoothing away too much texture. You need to know what the essential, sacred elements were that made it special while also finding places where it makes sense to experiment and remix. Hades 2 somehow does all of these things with the care and flourish that has become Supergiant Games' signature at this point. There's scarcely a note out of place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you haven't played the original Hades recently, or at all, Hades 2 starts fairly abruptly. You're introduced to Melinoë, daughter of Hades and Persephone and sister to the first game's hero, Zagreus, and set on your way with little other context than an urgent charge to kill your grandfather, Chronos, the Titan of Time. It's been a couple years since I played Hades, and I didn't play Hades 2 in early access because I was saving myself for the main event, so it did feel a bit like being adrift for the first couple hours or so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This feeling fades fast, though, as I grew to love an excellent and varied cast of mostly new characters inhabiting the night-shrouded crossroads between the realms of the living and the dead. Supergiant's character designs remain at the absolute peak of the mountain with their distinctive silhouettes, strident but never garish use of color, clever interpretations of classic myths, and tiny, delightful details placed just for the super nerds who can quote The Odyssey from memory. They’re still represented by static images, but this time the artists have built in subtle touches of animation that bring the characters to life that much more, like the glint of green light on Mel's lower lip.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nemesis is probably my favorite of the newcomers, with the buff avatar of vengeance presenting an aloof rival who was so very satisfying to eventually turn into a friend (and more) through a long and complicated arc. Hecate plays the mentor and reluctant caregiver to Mel, always self-conscious of being compared to the heroine's mother while secretly wishing she could call her a daughter. There are so many layers here. Not even the archetypical Olympians are one-dimensional. And the voice acting is top-notch for everyone.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Mechanics and characters are added at a generous but not overwhelming pace.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Layers" is really the keyword when it comes to Hades 2, and I don't just mean the ones you fight through to get to the next boss. Similar to the first game, things start simple, but more mechanics and characters and methods of progression get added at a generous but not overwhelming pace with each run, failed or completed. Even sitting north of 50 hours and 50 runs, I don't think I've unlocked everything there is to unlock and I've never had a night pass that there wasn't something new to discover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not just new dialogue snippets, either – although there are almost an absurd number of those for so many different character combinations and contexts, where they react to specific things you’ve done in your most recent run or which other gods' boons you're carrying. Meaningful, permanent upgrades from Hecate's cauldron, tricky challenge runs from Chaos itself, a clever revision of the original's Heat system, a simple farming minigame, adorable animal familiars who can help you in and outside of combat… all added to the epic at a pace that always makes them an exciting treat without feeling like one too many things to keep track of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe the biggest single leap forward for the sequel is the fact that Mel has two paths in front of her each night (after you unlock the second fairly early on): down toward Tartarus to pursue the ultimate villain, Chronos, or up to break the siege his allies have placed upon Mount Olympus. Each consists of four regions with their own bosses, and the way the areas flow together is rarely as simple as going from one meadow to the next. In the surface city of Ephyra, for instance, there is a town square with 10 streets leading off into 10 different battles, and you can pick which six of them to visit (and which rewards to earn) to bring down the barrier blocking your progress. I really liked how stuff like this changes up the usual "pick Door Number One or Door Number Two" routine, and there are similar but different approaches in other areas as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the real genius here is that alternating between the two paths creates double the variety possible in subsequent runs. Doing a Tartarus dive and then an Olympus climb, you won't be seeing any of the same bosses or areas back-to-back. It's not like the first Hades ever got really stale, but this one definitely won't when this choice is always on the table – and you aren’t forced to go through every Tartarus level to see the first Olympus one, which means it’ll take longer to get tired of them. It’s a very smart approach because if there's a particular boss on one route who's really driving you up the wall (Eris), you can switch to the other one for a bit and farm some upgrade materials before trying to break that wall down with your head once again. You will have to vanquish both routes multiple times eventually to see the end of the story, of course.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Zipping around and zapping monsters as Mel is snappy and delightful.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Zipping around and zapping monsters as Mel is just as snappy and delightful as it was as Zagreus, but also feels distinct. I almost think of it like playing the same RPG with a different character class. If Zagreus was a warrior, Mel is a mage (or more appropriately, a witch), with a stronger emphasis on clever battlefield control and an in-depth mana system to manage. Her varied arsenal can change this up a lot, from a pair of twirling torches that turn you into a ballerina of death to an enormous f-off axe that rewards careful timing with terrifying damage. Each of these comes with multiple unlockable variations with unique abilities and cool designs (turning the axe into a scythe, for instance), and your choice of weapon is a defining moment at the beginning of every run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter which you take, you always have access to a weapon-agnostic Cast ability as well, which binds foes in a magic circle that can slow and damage them. Many of the challenging new enemies are built with this in mind, requiring you to really think about where and when to place your trap if you want to master her fighting style. It's very thematic and made me think about Mel’s battles quite differently than I would with Zagreus, which is awesome.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to the randomized boons various gods will offer, it's like Supergiant’s designers took every piece of feedback I could have given them about those in the original and used that to mirror-polish these new and returning ones. At this point, there is no Olympian whose sigil I will reroll immediately. They all have some really cool and powerful stuff that slots nicely into my preferred playstyle. Some are still more desirable than others, naturally. Hermes is still my boy, though darting around at warp speed isn't quite as powerful as it was in Zag's day. But even a few like Poseidon I used to sigh at have kept their thematic identity while also offering perks I actually want to take, such as speeding up the collection of valuable resources for unlocking more upgrades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's an interesting new consideration of elemental affinities, where boons all grant one of a handful of elemental essences, and other boons will activate based on how many of a specific essence you have – another layer to consider when planning out a build. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Selene is a major standout among the Gods and Titans in that her moon blessings give you an ultimate ability called a Hex that can range from slowing down time to blasting foes with lunar energy. Each time you pick her symbol, you get to put points into a powerful (and semi-randomized) talent tree for that specific Hex in order to make its effects last longer, hit harder, recharge faster, and some other really creative modifiers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are so many new ways to fish for synergies and discover gloriously overpowered builds that I rarely have a run that makes me feel weak or bored.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Favorite Roguelikes and lites</h3><p>Some of my favorite Roguelikes/lites from over the years.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For my obols, Darren Korb is probably the best video game composer working right now, and Hades 2 is, as the kids would say, a "common Korb W." I would even call it a step up from the first Hades musically, as his blend of ghostly melodic motifs, lofi hip-hop vibes, and soaring nods to the heroic and mythical brew up a soundscape that is so distinctly his own. Long-time collaborating vocalist Ashley Barrett returns as Artemis for Moonlight Guide Us, my favorite of the new tracks, joined by Mel's voice actor, Judy Alice Lee, to create a hauntingly uplifting harmony that brings tears to my eyes. "Take shelter from the world above, in safety and in solitude," kind of sums up how I feel about Hades 2 overall. Things are a lot right now, and this is a place I like to go to hang out with my witchy friends for a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course I also have to shout out the musical Scylla and the Sirens boss fight, featuring the absolute pop-rock banger "I Am Gonna Claw (Out Your Eyes then Drown You To Death)." I find myself humming it every time it plays, even as I fight for my life against a group of sea monster divas with very little respect for my life or fashion choices. (An excellent touch to this fight is that the music changes as you defeat the drummer, the guitarist, and the singer individually, which you can do in any order.) Hades 2 can be laugh-out-loud funny just as well as it can be melancholic and introspective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I played about 10 of the 50 hours I've logged so far on the Switch 2, and I should note that the Switch 2 upgrade pack was not available until launch day, so the version I was playing was almost identical to the Switch 1 version. And while it's just as good playing docked on a big TV as it is on PC, I did find that there were some minor readability issues in portable mode. Particularly in certain boss fights where it's important to tell which way a smaller enemy is facing, it can be tough to pick out with Hades 2's zoomed-out perspective. And I have better than 20/20 vision. It's not a deal-breaker, but I would often pause and switch to docked mode for tougher battles.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-review]]></content:encoded>

		<p>If there is a mode that players love in Call of Duty, it is Zombies. It has been a staple since Call of Duty: World At War. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 continues the zombie tradition and there is now a trailer showing some gameplay from the upcoming release, backed with AC/DC’s Highway to Hell. There has also been confirmation that those who pre-order Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will get to play Zombies Survival in the beta.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Zombies Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/07SF99EeZ1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Black Ops 7 story is continuing the narrative threads set up within Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6. There’s also The Guild, a new high tech military force that doesn’t necessarily mesh with classic morality and the scale of good vs. evil. Black Ops 7 can be played solo, or with up to four players – the Black Ops 3 connection returns! – and there’s plenty of twisted dream-like versions of locations found within the trailer, such as Nicaragua with giant knives, LA with motorways twisting up into the sky, and so much more. These locations will be tied together with Avalon. There’s also the return of Dead Ops Arcade for some top-down action, and an endgame PvE social experience where you fight overwhelming odds and play through a roguelike structure in Avalon.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14th for PC, Xbox Series XS, and PS5.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-the-latest-previews-are-in-for-pokemon-legends-z-a</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/round-up-the-latest-previews-are-in-for-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a.1307166/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It has felt like a long time coming, but we are finally on the home stretch of the run-up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have been popping up at a handful of public events over the last month or so to give us all a taste of what the next entry has in store, but we recently got the opportunity to play... more of it.</p>
<p>The lovely Alex-from-Nintendo-Life-here was lucky enough to go <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/pokemon-legends-z-as-combat-shines-brightly-but-its-visuals-are-still-dull">hands-on</a> with the game for the best part of an hour at a Paris press event, and his thoughts are somewhat mixed. While Mr Olney had a great time getting to grips with the new real-time combat, his optimism was sullied by the rather bland presentation.</p>
<p>You can watch his full thoughts in the video above, but here's a snippet from the written version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It really is baffling and overwhelmingly disappointing that Pokémon games continue to fall short in the looks department, especially when you consider that historically (on handheld devices) they were graphical showcases many moons prior.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:188256 @ 1758731434 -->
<p>And yet, we were not the only ones to go hands-on with the game, oh no. Other outlets have also shared their preview thoughts after attending a similar session, so let's try to get an idea of the consensus, shall we?</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/hands-on-one-hour-with-pokemon-legends-z-a-highlights-big-changes-to-the-series/">VGC</a>. The outlet seemed pretty hot on the game, praising the returning catching mechanics and bold battle swings — even if the latter may be initially difficult for long-time fans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The speed with which Pokémon can be caught is as satisfying as it was in the first Legends game, and is as close as the series has come to the idea of being a bug catcher sneaking up on a rare creature, the inspiration for the series as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-essentially-an-action-game-but-might-not-be-a-particularly-great-one">Eurogamer</a> seemed slightly cooler on the new battle system, noting its potential for chaos and frustration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is Pokémon going full real-time action, ultimately, with your character frequently dodge-rolling around the Wild Zone or crouching behind cars in the Z-A Royales, as Pokémon attacks fly. I've nothing against that in principle, much as I love Pokémon's classic, highly tactical turn-based battle system. The only concern is the implementation: this feels, at first pass, like a system retro-fitted onto a series that already has all kinds of baggage, as opposed to proper ground-up reimagining of how Pokémon-on-Pokémon combat might work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the flip side, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/ive-been-playing-pokemon-for-17-years-but-pokemon-legends-z-a-makes-me-feel-like-im-relearning-everything-i-knew-about-battles-in-the-best-way-possible/">GamesRadar</a> had much more fun with these new battle mechanics, believing that Z-A "has what it takes to rejuvenate Game Freak's tried and tested RPG formula":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like I have so much to learn about its new combat mechanics, as the experience so far feels like relearning so much of what I knew – <em>especially</em> after seeing just how different certain moves can behave compared to the turn-based games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-the-final-preview">IGN</a> kept the good vibes coming, even if it was in a slightly more sceptical way. The outlet's preview praised the game's Wild Zones and potential depth of battle mechanics, but worried things may become a little repetitive in the long run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Legends: Z-A’s gameplay loop is unique, and I’m looking forward to experimenting with and mastering the new, real-time battle system. I appreciate the risks Pokémon is taking here - I just hope they fully pay off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-preview-battles/">Polygon</a> was all about the battle system, praising Z-A's depth and "thrilling" gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a lot of familiarity in sitting down to play <em>Z-A</em> — it’s Pokémon through and through — with just enough of a twist on the traditional formula to feel innovative and original.</p>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[This New $3 Boomer Shooter Is An Incredible Fever Dream You Should Play]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/quake-2-brazilian-drug-dealer-3-favela-steam-review-fps-boomer-shooter-weird-2000628167</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-new-3-boomer-shooter-is-an-incredible-fever-dream-you-should-play.1307160/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sometimes I discover a new game by looking at what’s trending on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3191050/">SteamDB</a>. That’s how I first learned about<em> BRAZILIAN DRUG DEALER 3: I OPENED A PORTAL TO HELL IN THE FAVELA TRYING TO REVIVE MIT AIA I NEED TO CLOSE IT,</em> a game which I will now only refer to as <em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> or <em>BDD3</em> to save us all a lot of time. Of course, the long and wild name caught my eye, but it also has a very high Steam review rating. So I paid $2 and checked it out, and folks, it’s a wild but oddly charming experience.</p> <p><em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> is best described as <a href="https://kotaku.com/more-tips-than-you-probably-need-for-the-quake-remaster-1847616427">a heavily modded and twisted version of <em>Quake</em>.</a> It uses that classic shooter’s engine as its foundation, as well as reskinned enemies and weapons from Id’s fantastic FPS. But while it plays a lot like that classic shooter, this definitely ain’t <em>Quake</em> anymore. At least, I don’t remember <em>Quake</em> containing so many hellish favela levels and evil soccer players.</p>  <p><em>BDD3 </em>plays, looks, and sounds like a retro fever dream, complete with loud, ear-piercing music, random sound effects, bizarre textures everywhere you look, and oddly shaped levels based on real-life locations, like a grocery store and a soccer stadium. Filling these levels are reskinned <em>Quake</em> enemies, now replaced with demonic soccer fans armed with assault rifles and grenade launchers. Oh, there are also demons and other monsters, too. I’m not sure if they like soccer. To rip through these enemies, you’ll use gold-plated handguns, assault rifles, dual shotguns, a simple sandal, a staff that shoots electrical beams, and other strange stuff I won’t spoil here. Every gun is very loud and feels like it would kill an elephant. And because this is the OG <em>Quake</em> engine, you move fast and hit hard, and it all runs perfectly on a modern, powerful PC. In other words, I had a blast playing <em>BDD3.</em></p>

 <p>As the game’s very long name suggests, <em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> (loosely) tells the story of a person who, in trying to revive their favorite musician, accidentally opened a portal to hell and is now desperately fighting back against the demonic invaders while trying to close it and save the world. You know, that ol’ chestnut. Trying to follow the story is tricky, and&nbsp; I’m not even sure the game’s main developer is aiming to provide a coherent narrative. But whatever, the real appeal of <em>BDD3</em> is its fast-paced action and fever dream vibes. It’s the kind of game in which I was excited to play the next level just to see what nightmarish music or mess of textures awaited me.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628184"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628184">©Joeveno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>However, to <em>BDD3</em>‘s credit, while it might look like a giant mess of nonsense, there’s actually a well-made shooter under all that chaos. Levels are perfectly paced, providing you with a mixture of big fights and smaller encounters that tend to flow really well together. Though it may look slapdash, I think that aspect was carefully cultivated, and that a lot more thought than you might expect went into crafting every level.&nbsp; For example, each one is filled with strategically placed (and very odd-looking) quick save machines,&nbsp; so even less-experienced FPS players will have no trouble at all progressing.</p>

 <p>The other reason I’ve really enjoyed playing<em> Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em> is that it’s quite a charming experience. It’s clear that the game’s lead developer, <a href="https://x.com/JoevenoYT">Joeveno</a>, is channeling his experience as a Brazilian gamer and developer to create something that, from the outside, might seem weird for weird’s sake. And to be sure, <a href="https://x.com/get_glizzy/status/1965638844910633266">if you listen to the dev talk about the game</a>, some of what’s in <em>BDD3</em> is just meant to be odd and make you laugh. But it’s also recreating the kind of bizarre <em>Quake</em> and <em>Doom</em> mods that used to be all over the internet back in the early 2000s, as well as the various foreign bootlegs of popular shooters that were passed around via forums or floppy disks long ago.</p> <p>On<em> Brazilian Drug Dealer 3</em>‘s Steam page, Joeveno calls the trippy game a “Tribute to the Brazilian mods” and “bootleg games” from that era, and while I might not be as familiar with the source material as the dev is, I can still feel the passion and care that was put into nailing a very specific and chaotic vibe. <em>BDD3</em> won’t be for everyone, but for players looking for something different that is also well-made and fun, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3191050/BRAZILIAN_DRUG_DEALER_3_I_OPENED_A_PORTAL_TO_HELL_IN_THE_FAVELA_TRYING_TO_REVIVE_MIT_AIA_I_NEED_TO_CLOSE_IT/">I’d recommend spending $3 to check it out.</a> (The game’s price will jump to $5 on October 1.) And hey, at the very least, in the future, if someone says they own a game on Steam with a long name, you can make a bet with them that you know you’ll likely win.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Did Sega just completely change the spirit of <em>Yakuza 3</em> by recasting its lead in the remake? Does <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a> really look prettier without fog? And when will Nintendo finally support smaller SD express card sizes and ditch those dreaded game key cards? It’s another edition of <em>Morning Checkpoint</em>, <em>Kotaku’</em>s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Fed chair Jerome Powell <a href="https://x.com/TFTC21/status/1970606369578590451">says tariffs aren’t driving up inflation just yet</a> as companies eat the cost of the new taxes. I guess he’s not trying to buy a new game console!</p> <h2>Game devs aren’t happy about Switch 2 game key cards either, apparently</h2> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2025-09-24/T2T62TGP493K00?srnd=cojp-v2"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> some backroom grumblings ahead of Tokyo Game Show 2025 this week regarding the health of game development in Japan and also, interestingly enough, anecdotal frustration with Nintendo’s game key cards for the Switch 2. It also confirms that Nintendo currently only offers 64GB sizes for all games, which increases the cost and appears to be the primary reason so many third-party publishers are opting for the plastic DRM keys instead.</p> <p>It’s clear, however, that paying the higher cost of going physical on Switch 2 can pay dividends for some games. <em>Bloomberg</em> points to the recent example of <em>Daemon Ex Machina: Titanic Scion</em>. “In the UK, it was released as a standard physical cartridge, ready to play straight out of the box. According to Nielsen IQ, 72% of physical sales in the UK were for the Switch 2,” it reports. “In Japan, however, it was sold as a key card, and the results were reversed. According to<em> Famitsu,</em> only 40% of sales were for the Switch 2.”</p>

 <p>Nintendo recently surveyed fans about their feelings on game key cards, and at least some publishers say requiring downloads helps with performance for more taxing games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-game-key-card-2000623413"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>.</p> <h2>A <em>Yakuza 3</em> remake and more are on the way</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm watching the Kiwami 3 Summit but seeing the new Rikiya is pissin me off <a href="https://t.co/qDZE7covQn">pic.twitter.com/qDZE7covQn</a></p> <p>— Jtastic (@JtasticVA) <a href="https://twitter.com/JtasticVA/status/1970696209749746121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Announced during the Ryu Ga Gotoku Summit livestream, <em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em> will bring the last PS3-era entry in the series to modern platforms on February 12. It recasts a key character, Rikiya Shimabukuro, with the guy from <em>Tokyo Vice</em> (Sho Kasamatsu), however, and fans are not happy.</p>

 <p>It’ll come bundled with a new spin-off called <em>Yakuza 3 Gaiden: Dark Ties</em> that follows main villain Yoshitaka Mine. <em>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut</em> and remakes of the first two games are also getting upgraded ports for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

 <h2>PlayStation will now make you work to unlock special merch</h2> <p>Sony unveiled <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-photo-mode-features-detailed-tips-guide/">Franchise Rewards</a> this week, a new program through which popping certain trophies in games will qualify you to pay the company money for select swag. It’s kicking off with a pin and T-shirt for <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> that cost a combined $55.</p>

 <p>This will be familiar to <em>Destiny 2</em> fans since Bungie has been running this exact type of program, offering special swag to day-one raid players, for some time. The reason it works <em>there</em> is that it’s a limited-time group achievement. I’m confused as to why Sony seems to be having so much trouble figuring out cool rewards initiatives.</p>

 <h2><em>Silent Hill f</em> players are already nuking the fog</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone already removed fog in Silent Hill F lol <a href="https://t.co/K6daHORlZ7">pic.twitter.com/K6daHORlZ7</a></p> <p>— Besk (@BeskInfinity) <a href="https://twitter.com/BeskInfinity/status/1970526109851648178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Konami’s latest survival horror game isn’t technically even out yet and it’s already getting the mod treatment. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-modders-add-ray-tracing-cheats-and-remove-the-hud-and-the-series-signature-fog-a-day-after-advanced-access-went-live-on-steam"><em>IGN</em> notes</a>, fans are already adding cheats and ray-tracing while erasing the HUD and any other immersion-breaking elements. Now if only they could mod in a proper PS5 Pro mode for the console version.</p> <h2><em>Nioh 3</em> gets a release date</h2> <p>Team Ninja’s upcoming Soulslike is coming soon, according to a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026">leaked store page</a> on Amazon Japan. The PS5 console exclusive arrives February 6 (on PC too). In addition to its samurai combat, the sequel is adding a new ninja playstyle. Who’s ready for some “Soulsgaiden?”</p> <h2>Here are some <em>Mega Man</em> RPGs you probably never knew existed</h2>  <p>Was I alone in never having heard of the <em>Mega Man Star Force</em> trilogy before? They were spiritual successors to <em>Mega Man Battle Network</em> that came to the Nintendo DS in the second half of the aughts and were mostly panned by reviewers at the time for failing to change up the formula much. Capcom is clearly still riding the high of the <em>Battle Network</em> collection selling over 1 million copies, and I applaud the effort to bring lost niche games to modern platforms. I’m morbidly intrigued.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">The Switch 2 port of <em>Borderlands 4</em> was delayed at the last minute with no real explanation</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">DHS goons are using Ash Ketchum’s <em>Pokémon</em> anthem to promote fascism</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-physint-od-trailer-showcase-2000627889">Hideo Kojima announced a bunch of things yesterday include a new credit card</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Capcom [2,618 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> has released a new trailer and screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Onimusha: Way of the Sword [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/onimusha-way-of-the-sword">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a></em> introducing the XXX. <span id="more-994851"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details, via Capcom:</p><blockquote><p>Today’s  Capcom Tokyo Game Show 2025 Online Special Program debuted a new story trailer for <em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em> revealing the supernatural events that set the dark fantasy adventure into motion. The sneak peek also introduces new characters who play key roles in the swordplay action game’s narrative. </p><p>After protagonist Miyamoto Musashi’s arrival in Kyoto, the samurai is ambushed by the demonic Genma. On the verge of death, Musashi is “gifted” an Oni Gauntlet granting him the power to stand against these monstrosities from the underworld. However, as a warrior who wishes to carve a path by his own hand, he seeks to sever his link with this mystical artifact.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_994865"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>During Musashi’s journey, he encounters Izumo no Okuni and Ono no Takamura, newfound friends who are also based on real figures from Japanese history. Guided by the voice of the mysterious Oni woman within his gauntlet, Musashi is led to Takamura, a venerable swordsman with a gauntlet of his own. He also crosses paths with Okuni, a famous performer known for her iconic Kabuki dance, who has departed the stage in search of a way to defeat the Genma. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The latest footage also contains flashes of gameplay where Musashi faces enemies in the streets of Kyoto, including Togemaru, a serpentine Genma with spikes running down its spine that whirls into the fray with great speed to eviscerate its unfortunate targets. Though Musashi is reluctant to embrace his Oni Gauntlet, he must harness its power to slay such formidable foes. </p></blockquote><p><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,435 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,955 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,326 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2638890/Onimusha_Way_of_the_Sword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> in 2026.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.

                <p>Since Nintendo launched Switch 2 in June, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-ref-id="5000-671287">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> have emerged as the system's early flagship titles. Both games were also given updates this week, although Mario Kart World fans will notice more differences and improvements to the game.</p><p>Mario Kart World patch <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/kw/mario%20kart%20world" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ver. 1.3.0</a> makes a number of welcome changes to Free Roam, including the ability to play that mode with a second player if the game is full while trying to join a race against friends. It's also going to be easier to encounter UFOs and find collectibles in Free Roam, especially now that the game will let you know which items you've already found on the map.</p><p>The patch tackled a few annoying bugs like losing your ranking if you went out of bounds by the finish line, or getting stuck in the Bowser's Castle walls when using Bullet Bill. Most of the bug fixes would be best described as quality-of-life changes rather than game-breaking issues.</p><p>Surprisingly, Donkey Kong Bananza <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68614/kw/donkey%20kong%20bananza" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ver. 2.0.1</a> only tackles a few issues with this patch. Pauline's shout voices will now align with the player's chosen language. Prior to the update, there was a known issue where her shout voices wouldn't be played when English was chosen as the language for the system. The update also addressed a bug that kept players from claiming a disc as their reward for finding all of the balloons in Bananza Rehearsal.</p><p>A recent video demonstrated that Mario Kart World NPCs aren't above <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-characters-are-stealing-cars-gta-style-sort-of/1100-6534813/" data-ref-id="1100-6534813">a little GTA-style auto theft</a>. It's a funny touch, especially since the former drivers of the vehicles don't appear to react to the loss of their cars. As for Donkey Kong Bananza, the game recently received a roguelite mode DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-roguelike-mode-dlc-will-let-you-smash-stuff-forever/1100-6534690/" data-ref-id="1100-6534690">Emerald Rush</a>, which will let you keep smashing forever.</p><p>The complete patch notes for Mario Kart World Ver. 1.3.0 are below.</p><h3>General</h3><ul><li>You can now join friends playing "Knockout Tour" by selecting "Friends" from

                <p>Treyarch senior director of production Yale Miller has revealed that the company rejected collaborations with unspecified "big brands" for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> skins.</p><p><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-7-devs-canceled-big-brand-collabs-after-backlash-3256095/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Miller told Dexerto</a> that Treyarch wants to have collab skins in Black Ops 7 that "make sense" for the game. This mandate led the company to apparently say no to possible deals.</p><p>"There are opportunities that we have had lined up that, after some of our conversations, we straight up turned down. Big, big brands, big things, and we're like, 'No, we're not gonna do that because it just doesn't fit,'" Miller said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4573998-screenshot2025-09-24at11.28.28%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573998" data-ratio="0.55418381344307" data-width="729" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4573998-screenshot2025-09-24at11.28.28%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573998"></a><figcaption>The Nuketown Block Party mannequin skins in Black Ops 6.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4573998-screenshot2025-09-24at11.28.28%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>Some part of the Call of Duty fanbase has spoken out against the franchise's series of wacky and over-the-top skins, while others have embraced and enjoyed them. Miller said the recent Nuketown Block Party skins that let you play as a mannequin from the map are examples of skins that aren't "grounded" per se but something that "feels right for the game."</p><p>"All intentions [are] to stick to stuff that we can hand on our heart, say, 'Yeah, that feels Black Ops,'" Miller said. "That's really our goal. And I think that's a good clarification versus 'grounded.'"</p><p>Most Black Ops 6 skins <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">will not carry forward to Black Ops 7</a>, but it remains to be seen what kinds of skins--licensed or original--show up in Black Ops 7. In August, Activision acknowledged that some fans believe the franchise has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/" data-ref-id="1100-6534279">"drifted" from its identity as a military shooter</a> with its wacky skins.</p><p>Activision made this key announcement against the backdrop of EA's stance on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> skins. Developers stressed that the game's cosmetics would feel "grounded." An EA developer even name-checked Nicki Minaj, which was no doubt a reference to Call of Duty's DLC that allows people to play as her.</p><p>Design director Shashank Uchil told <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DBLTAP</a> that, "It has to be grounded. That is what BF3 and BF4 was--it was all soldiers, on the ground. It's going to be like this." Uchil went on to say, "I don't think it needs Nicki Minaj." Instead, Uchil said the aim for Battlefield 6's skins is: "Let's keep it real, keep it grounded."</p><p>Call of Duty games over the years have featured all manner of outlandish skins, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-4-20-event-brings-cheech-and-chong-a-stoned-sloth-and-weed-themed-bundles/1100-6522208/" data-ref-id="1100-6522208">stoner sloths</a> and licensed skins from franchises like The Boys, TMNT, King of the Hill, Beavis and Butt-Head, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Many people enjoyed and embraced these skins, some of which included their own special modes, while others said they are a blight on the overall Call of Duty experience.</p><p>One thing is for sure, and that is that Call of Duty's in-game shop no doubt brings in a lot of money for Activision and the company will undoubtedly continue to sell skins and other DLC for Black Ops 7.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, but you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">play the game's multiplayer beta in October</a>. Just recently, Activision announced that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-also-includes-zombies/1100-6534980/" data-ref-id="1100-6534980">beta will include Zombies. </a></p>

            <p>The Pokémon Company has responded to a disturbing video from the US Department of Homeland Security posted on social media that used imagery and music from the Pokémon anime to promote the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-department-of-homeland-security-uses-pokemon-theme-song-and-images-in-disturbing-ice-promotion">Eurogamer reported yesterday</a>, the video (shared with the caption "Gotta Catch 'Em All") included footage of people being arrested alongside protagonist Ash Ketchum, as well as Pokémon card-style graphics of criminals.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has shared the following statement with Eurogamer in response: "We are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand. Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property."</p>
<p>The video was responded to with calls for Nintendo to sue for copyright infringement. However, the company is yet to respond to Eurogamer's request for comment regarding what action it plans to take in response to the unlicensed use of its property.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>After being announced just over a week ago <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/mega-man-star-force-legacy-collection-brings-ds-rpgs-to-switch-in-2026">during the Japanese Nintendo Direct broadcast</a>, Capcom has shared an updated trailer and a few new details about the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_star_force_legacy_collection">Mega Man Star Force: Legacy Collection</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer was shown during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2rD0i4pOTk">Capcom's TGS 2025 Online Program</a> and, as you'd expect from this compilation of DS RPGs, the team has introduced a couple of new features to help modernise the experience and provide a package that loyal fans will love.</p>
<p>These include a toggleable high-resolution filter, an in-game gallery featuring over 1000 pieces of art, a music player — plus "new versions of favourite tracks" — and difficulty and assist settings, which look to include different screen settings, similar to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_dominus_collection">Castlevania Dominus Collection</a> from Konami and M2.</p>
<p>Plus, in another win for fans, cards that were exclusive to special events and toys will be available in-game. So this is the complete experience for the entire series.</p>

<p>The latest Mega Man collection is due to drop on Switch in 2026, so we'll bring you that release date as soon as we know!</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/783718/hades-ii-2-1-0-update-review-pc-nintendo-switch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-ii%E2%80%99s-big-1-0-update-has-me-obsessed-all-over-again.1307118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When <em>Hades II</em> first launched in early access, I had to force myself to stop playing after around 30 hours. I didn’t want to burn out on what was already an excellent, jam-packed <em>Hades</em> sequel before it hit 1.0, when the final polish and story would be in place. I made the right choice; the 1.0 milestone is now here, and after more than a week with it on my Steam Deck and Switch 2, I’m obsessed with <em>Hades II</em> once again.</p><p><em>Hades II</em> is a roguelike with flashy battles, hot and chatty Greek gods, and exquisitely paced progression that makes you feel like you’re getting better nearly every single run. (If you’ve played the first <em>Hades</em>, you know the drill.) Like a lot of Greek mythology, <em>Hades II</em> revolves around some <em>very</em> complex family drama: you play as Melinoë, the daughter of the Underworld god Hades and the younger sister of <em>Hades</em> protagonist Zagreus, and her goal is to kill Chronos, a Titan who is Hades’ dad (so technically her grandpa) and has attacked and taken over the Underworld.</p><p>Getting to Chronos involves descending into the Underworld. In each run, your goal is to clear out rooms of enemies, which typically takes a minute or two. When you do, you’ll get rewards like new “boons” (perks of some kind) from various gods you can use to build out a playstyle, or you can pick from upgrades like more health, more magic power, or improvements to your weapons. Eventually, you’ll reach a tough boss for a zone, and if you take them down, you’ll head to a new zone with new baddies. Rinse and repeat until you get to Chronos, and eventually, you’ll be able to take on a second, entirely separate route of zones with a new final boss.</p><p>Fights in <em>Hades II</em> are still action-packed skirmishes that usually pit you against a bunch of enemies at once. I tend to design builds that let me take on enemies at a distance, which pairs well with Melinoë’s witchy weapons, like a staff or torches that can toss fireballs, and her ability to cast a large, magical ring onto the battlefield. The new weapons and abilities feel a little different than the first <em>Hades</em>, but still cut from the same cloth.</p><p>If you’ve already poured time into <em>Hades II</em> during early access, I recommend starting a fresh file to experience everything with a clean slate. That’s what I did, and it’s been a blast to start from scratch, while also relying on what I already know about the game to overcome some things a bit more easily. I’ve been playing on my Switch 2 and Steam Deck, using cloud saves to easily bounce between the platforms (underrated feature!), and the game plays great on both.</p><p>All of the touches that made <em>Hades</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc">so gripping</a> are here in <em>Hades II</em>, including quippy conversations with fully voiced characters, gorgeous artwork, incredible music, and lots of little ways to upgrade your abilities and equipment between runs. The 1.0 version of <em>Hades II</em> seems huge, with two separate routes, a massive well of upgrades you can grind for, difficulty modifiers for runs, and, like the first game, many reasons to keep playing even after you get your first win. (I’m particularly surprised how much I want to move the main story forward.)</p><p>It all adds up to an experience that makes <em>Hades II</em> the most gripping roguelike I’ve played since the first <em>Hades</em>. Every time I jump in for one more run, I can’t wait to see what happens next.</p><p><sub>Hades II <em>launches on September 25th on Nintendo Switch and PC.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/783718/hades-ii-2-1-0-update-review-pc-nintendo-switch#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/783718/hades-ii-2-1-0-update-review-pc-nintendo-switch]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's a controversial way of going about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">trying to limit the amout of fraudulent 360 no-scopes</a>, as it involves publishers mandating an aspect of how players' hardware's used, if a pretty easy one to check with a trip to your BIOS if you know what you're doing. Not everyone's used to delving into those settings though, which is why it's nice Valve have made this useful addition to their game playing place.</p>

<p>As outlined in this <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545621427784515587">brief post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/steam-now-lets-you-check-if-you-have-secure-boot-enabled-the-security-feature-were-all-going-to-have-to-get-to-grips-with-for-battlefield-call-of-duty-and-more/">Pretty Cold Grandma</a>, a Steam client beta update deployed early this morning has brought in this tweak.</p>
<p>To use it to check if you've got secure boot enabled, you'll first need to opt into the latest client beta if you haven't already. On desktop, that's done by heading to the Steam logo in the top left when you open up Steam, then selecting 'Settings' from the drop-down menu. From there, you go to 'Interface', 'Steam Client Beta Participation', and select 'Steam Beta Update' from the drop-down menu to the right of the latter. A restart of Steam'll be required, then once it loads back up, you can head to 'Help' in the top left, select 'System Information' from the drop-down.</p><p>You'll get a list of info about your PC, and in the bit about your operating system, you'll find a line which specifies whether or not secure boot is enabled. Just below that's a line listing your Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version, this being a processor that allows your PC to carry out cryptographic operations with some added security measures. It's generally a requirement to get secure boot up and running.</p>

<p>We'll see if these measures ever manage to do more than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-battlefield-6-betas-hacking-problem-shows-the-difficulty-in-playing-cat-and-mouse-with-cheaters">continue to move the goalposts those keen to cheat will likely just find another way to auto-aim their bullets through</a>. At least if the amount of time/energy it takes to check if secure boot's enabled can be minimised, with the added bonus of making it easier for the less tech-savvy, that's something positive.</p>

              <p>It’s almost as if Amazon knows you’re thinking about upgrading your older laptop for something newer, faster, and packed with more features than you thought possible. Why else would they offer this deal on the Dell 15 Inspiron touchscreen laptop in its most souped-up state — <strong>the max 64GB of RAM and 2 TB SSD, preloaded Windows 11 Pro, and a free accessory bundle worth $199?</strong> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4278/">It lists for $2,400, but right now it’s just $900 dyring this killer 63% off limited-time deal.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Credit where credit is due, Amazon has been hard-selling this high-end Dell model lately, maybe because they know that a touchscreen laptop packed with as much RAM and SSD space as possible and driven by an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor (speeds up to 4.5GHz) and AMD Radeon graphics chip is a literal game-changer to anyone who’s been slogging through their work and play with an older, slower machine. Why else would they take a do-it-all machine like this and slash $1,500 from the price?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4278/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Machine, Premium Deal</h2>
<p>The top-of-the-line specs, preloaded Windows 11 Pro — including the AI wizardry of Microsoft Copilot — and compact profile and light weight of this Dell laptop virtually guarantees it would be a significant upgrade for pretty much anyone. (Other than the happy shoppers who have already cashed in on this deal.) It’s slim and lightweight enough to pop into a backpack or briefcase to take anywhere, and built sturdily so it won’t break down or fall apart during your road trips.</p>
<p>The touchscreen has all the responsiveness of a high-end tablet, but it’s also a full-HD screen with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 60Hz refresh rate, and IPS technology for wide viewing angles. The energy efficient LED-backlit screen helps keep your power bills manageable, and the entire screen plus processor plus graphics card is the equation for awesome streaming on the Dell Inspiron 15. But if you insist on using the high-end visuals for work, there’s also an HD webcam and MaxxAudio Pro speaker for those unavoidable Zoom calls.</p>



<h2>No Upgrades Needed</h2>
<p>You won’t need to immediately drop more money on upgrading the OS of this Dell Inspiron 15, because Windows 11 Pro is already loaded and ready to go. Which also means Copilot AI is at your service. This AI assistant has gotten rave reviews for power, speed, and intuitiveness, and the Dell Inspiron 15 gives it more than enough processing power to do that research or write that email for you almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>We’ve been playing Whak-a-Mole with these massive PC laptop deals at Amazon — every time we think we’ve covered the last of them, two more pop up. But there’s on guarantee these will continue to drop like this, and this one that saves you $1,500 off the price of a brand-new Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen laptop and free accessories bundle valued at $200 isn’t going to get beat anytime soon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4278/">Head to Amazon now and make the upgrade that puts a powerful touchscreen PC laptop in your hands and a pile of money back in your pocket.</a></p>
