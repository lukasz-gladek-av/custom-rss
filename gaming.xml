            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Gamers are always looking for the next level. A bigger sword, a more powerful gun, magic that turns your foes into globs of pink mush. But what about levelling up your gaming setup? A headset would always be my first call, and then maybe a pro controller or high end mouse, but what then?</p>
<p>Woojer have their own ideas on that, and they’ve been toting their haptic-infused devices for several years. While the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/30/woojer-vest-3-review/">Woojer Vest</a> – now on its fourth generation – is the headline grabber, the Woojer Strap is the more accessible option, giving gamers and music lovers an extra layer of immersion by strapping a single device to your body, its haptics shocking, rumbling and thumping in time with the action.</p>



<p>Priced at £124 – with a healthy holiday season discount down to £95 – the Woojer Strap 4 is the latest iteration of the single-unit device. In the box, you’re getting the Woojer Strap 4 central unit, an elasticated strap to wrap around your body, a USB-C to USB-C charging cable, and a double-ended 3.5mm cable to physically connect your audio devices.</p>
<p>As gaming devices go, the Strap 4 is pretty straightforward. The unit itself has some weight to it and feels incredibly robust in your hand, crafted from solid plastic throughout, and available in a series of different colours. To the front, there’s a customisable LED ring with rubberised physical volume and intensity controls within it.</p>

<p>The top edge features the power button and Bluetooth pairing button, while the bottom includes a USB-C charging port and two 3.5mm audio sockets, one for input and the other as a dedicated output. I thought the older model’s copper finish looked great, but the addition of RGB allows the Strap 4 to match your gaming setup, and the extra layer of customisation gives you some individuality too. If you’re not an RGB fan? You can just turn it all off.</p>

<p>You’ll need a mobile device for the Strap 4 setup, and it proves pleasingly simple to connect the device to the Woojer app, where it takes you through pairing to your device, and then the secondary pairing of your headphones to the Strap 4. This all worked first time, which almost never happens, and you then find yourself with the main control page, which gives you an input and output display, as well as power remaining and the current latency setting, which you can alter if you find that the Strap 4’s haptic output doesn’t quite match up with whatever visuals you’re looking at.</p>
<p>Besides that, you can directly control the volume and the intensity, though there’s physical buttons for these as well, and, if needed, you can dive into the haptic sensation mode, which alters the behaviour of the haptics through Broad, Focused and Gaming settings.</p>
<p>The app also gives you decent control over the LED lights. There’s a full spectrum colour wheel to dial in the exact tone you want, adjust the brightness, and choose between a series of different effects to keep things interesting. While you’re playing, it’s not exactly something that adds all that much to the experience, but it’s certainly more futuristic, and if you’re out and about listening to music, you’ll certainly turn a few heads.</p>
<p>The Strap 4 experience is definitely easier to get into than the Woojer Vest. It’s small and portable, doesn’t take up much space, and requires minimal setup. You can just throw it on, and start watching, playing or listening to whatever you want, and I really liked how simple it felt. In turn, it immediately lifts your experience, with the added haptic feedback from your audio immersing you deeper in your content than ever before.</p>

<p>You can wear it in a variety of ways, though Woojer seem to recommend particular setups for particular input types, so for music you’d wear it around your waist, or horizontally while playing VR . Fundamentally, you can go for whatever feels best and most natural to you, and I gravitated most towards wearing it across my body, with the strap over one shoulder and the unit in the centre of my chest. This makes the haptic sensation fire directly into your chest, and explosions and heavy hits thump and rumble straight into you. Just like the rumble motors in a controller, it brings the action to life that bit further, and I find it hard to go back to playing without the extra layer it provides.</p>
<p>I loved using the Strap 4 for regular flat-screen gaming, listening to music and rewatching the most recent Star Trek movies, but VR is where it truly makes a major difference. With your senses cut off from the outside world, the rumble feels more nuanced and powerful, and whether you’re playing Beat Saber and throwing yourself directly into the music, or going for something more action-heavy like the new Deadpool VR, the Strap 4 brings a new level of immersion for a relatively low entry price.</p>
<p>While it can’t compare to the full experience you feel with the Woojer Vest, in terms of value for money, I think the Strap 4 hits the sweet spot between what it brings to your experience and the asking price. If you’ve already got a great headset, a pro controller, and a VR setup, the Strap 4 is practically a no-brainer as the next step in your gaming setup.</p>

<p>The only limitation, and this goes for all Woojer devices, is that this is a physical representation of audio output. That means your experience relies on how the audio is delivered, getting the levels right, and it will change on a game-by-game or song-by-song basis. It means there’s a certain degree of variation and inconsistency that some users might find disappointing, and hopefully Woojer can find a way to tap into the rumble and gamepad haptic signals in future. Once you’ve become accustomed to that abstraction, though, I still don’t think you’ll look back.</p>

<p>Only 4000 copies up for grabs</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We love ourselves a bit of Yacht Club Games' stupendously good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/shovel_knight">Shovel Knight</a> series, and 2022's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shovel_knight_dig">Shovel Knight Dig</a>, a collaboration with the maestros at Nitrome, even managed to swipe <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/shovel-knight-dig">a rather excellent 9/10 in our review</a>, where we concluded that the game "positively oozes quality, whether that be the snappy action-platforming or the fresh 16-bit art style and animation."</p>
<p>Now, Super Rare Games has announced that a limited physical edition of this roguelike belter will be made available via its official website <a href="https://superraregames.com/products/srg-146-shovel-knight-dig-switch">right here</a> at <strong>6pm BST / 1pm EST</strong> on <strong>8th January 2026</strong>. Hey, that's this Thursday!</p>
<p>As you'll note if you head over to the site right now, the game isn't yet up for pre-order just yet, so with only 4,000 units to shift (and a limit of two copies per customer in place) we reckon anyone interested should be fairly swift in nabbing a copy once it goes live.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1c971fd9affea"><a title="Shovel Knight Dig physical" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c971fd9affea/shovel-knight-dig-physical.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Super Rare Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The physical edition of Shovel Knight Dig comes with a full colour manual, exclusive sticker, a set of three trading cards and a "fully assembled Nintendo Switch game with cartridge." Whatever that is (psst, the full game on the cart).</p>
<p>Sounds pretty tasty and, if you happen to have forgotten the ins and outs of this one since it released (hey, three years is a long time ago in this economy), here's some further quick-fire deets to refresh your memory from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br>
💎 An all-new presentation featuring a new Shovel Knight story! When Drill Knight and his dastardly digging crew blast apart Shovel Knight’s peaceful campsite and steal his loot, he grabs his trusty Shovel Blade and starts tunneling after them!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>👾 The first Shovel Knight adventure in glorious high color pixel graphics and sound. Fluid animation, scaling, rotation, and parallax create the most convincing Shovel Knight world yet!</p>
<p>🔄️ Every adventure is different! Shovel Knight Dig levels have been meticulously crafted, then stitched together using proprietary generation techniques for infinite replayability.</p>
<p>🪏 Jump, slash, and dig your way in an all-new direction - down! Rely on your trusty Shovel Drop, then dig through huge swaths of dirt with all-new Speed Shovel mechanics.</p>
<p>🦾 Grow in power and wealth as you descend into the depths of the earth. Emerge with untold riches to outfit Shovel Knight further, unlocking permanent items and upgrades to your Shoveling equipment.</p>
<p>⚜️ New Knights, new characters, and new enemies abound, but fear not! Shovel Knight Dig features Shovel Knight’s signature storytelling, humor, and maybe even some familiar faces</p>
<p>🎵 Another pulse-pounding soundtrack in a new style by astonishing virtuoso Jake Kaufman!</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/854886/corsair-galleon-100-sd-elgato-stream-deck-specs-price-launch</link>
            <guid>1398178</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Elgato’s Stream Deck has come full circle. Almost eight years after the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/features/24191410/elgato-stream-deck-art-lebedev-optimus-maximus-keyboard-retrospective">picked up the pieces of Art Lebedev’s ambitious Optimus keyboard</a> and went in a different, cheaper direction with the idea, we’re going back to keyboards. Corsair’s Galleon 100 SD, announced at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854159/ces-2026-best-tech-gadgets-smartphones-appliances-robots-tvs-ai-smart-home">CES 2026</a>, is a wired mechanical keyboard that effectively has a full <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23517751/elgato-stream-deck-plus-review">Stream Deck Plus</a> built into it and then some: 12 customizable buttons, a multi-purpose 5-inch 720 x 1280 IPS screen, and two rotary dials.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Elgato’s Stream Deck DNA has appeared in a Corsair product. I reviewed the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23311640/corsair-voyager-a1600-gaming-laptop-review-amd-stream-deck-elgato">Corsair Voyager gaming laptop</a> in 2022, which had uninspiring touch-sensitive buttons that could be configured using Elgato’s software. It was underbaked, but it felt like the start of something that was long overdue, given Corsair acquired Elgato in 2018. The Galleon seems like a remarkable improvement, mostly due to the fact that it’s the full Stream Deck experience, not a distillation. It’s launching January 29th, and you can preorder one now for $349.99.</p><p>Not to dismiss the Galleon’s chops as a gaming keyboard (it has an 8,000Hz polling rate, hot-swappable PCB that comes with MLX Pulse switches, gasket mounting, and FlashTap simultaneous opposing cardinal direction support, to name a few specs), the marquee feature here is most definitely its Stream Deck integration. Elgato general manager Julian Fest tells <em>The Verge</em> that it uses a bigger, higher-resolution screen behind the keys than Stream Decks that are currently available, and its viewing angles are supposedly better, too.</p><p>As you might have predicted — and perhaps feared — the Galleon is technically two different devices controlled by different software. The left side is controlled by Corsair’s web hub browser tool, while the right side requires Elgato’s Stream Deck software. That won’t always be the case for tweaking some settings, Fest tells me. They’re still working on firmware that will let the Stream Deck side control the keyboard for things like LED color profiles and polling rate. It’s also working with publishers to build native Stream Deck integration into more games beyond <em>Star Citizen</em> and other hardcore simulators, although Corsair sees the Galleon as being the best fit for players of those genres over others.</p><p>The Stream Deck has become a tool that’s ubiquitous among streamers, and it’s increasingly a popular tool for everyday users who simply need to mute or turn off their webcams. Its programmable buttons offer a vast array of use cases thanks to a <a href="https://marketplace.elgato.com/">vibrant marketplace of plug-ins</a>, from launching files or macros to simply popping bubble wrap with former <em>Verge </em>writer Mitchell Clark’s free <a href="https://marketplace.elgato.com/product/bubbledeck-2dfecd5a-2886-449a-8a32-40f52b521d84">Stream Deck plug-in</a>.</p><p>Fest is a power user, unsurprisingly, swiftly using the buttons to queue some Christmas music, swapping to different webcams via OBS, adjusting the brightness of his room’s lighting, then dialing down the volume all while barely moving his fingers. The Stream Deck’s screen is showing the weather and Spotify cover art. It’s a supercharged multifunction station that’s also a keyboard. And, of course, the Stream Deck’s buttons can turn into a numpad, too.</p><p>During the demo, it became clear that this isn’t something that most companies could achieve; the Galleon is a keyboard with an overflowing level of customization, where the software has already been honed for going on eight years. It also may not have happened right now if Corsair didn’t hire Tobias Brinkmann, who founded Mountain keyboards.</p><p>One of that company’s big swings was the Everest Max, a full-size mechanical keyboard that had a detachable numpad complete with four programmable buttons with screens behind them, its own spin on Stream Deck functionality. We liked it in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22996700/mountain-everest-max-keyboard-review-gaming">our 2022 review</a>. Fest tells me that he bought one, took it apart, and had it checked for patent infringement. “At that point, I had no idea who Tobias was. Now, a few years later, he’s heading up our gaming business.”</p><p>“I’m personally grateful that it took Corsair so long, and they couldn’t get it together,” Brinkmann jokes. “It helps that Julian and I both have German backgrounds, and we kind of like each other. So that makes it easier to do it.”</p><p>“I’d still do it if you were an asshole,” Fest adds with a smirk.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/854886/corsair-galleon-100-sd-elgato-stream-deck-specs-price-launch]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1398175</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Losing power can be both inconvenient and frustrating. If you’re looking to have a backup solution at home during outages, or want a reliable source to take with you on your off-road trips, now is a great time to invest in a portable power station.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6670/">Anker makes some of our favorite options around right now, and you can grab its Solix F1500 power station for just $499 at Amazon</a>. That’s after the retailer slashed its retail price of $1,399 by a whopping 64%. This is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen the power station drop to in a long while. Grab it quickly, though, as discounts this massive don’t stick around for long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6670/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports for Different Devices</h2>
<p>This portable power station features an impact-resistant, flame-retardant, and anti-UV build that’s designed to handle everyday wear and tear well. You’re getting a total of 13 ports to juice all your important devices – from smartphones to kitchen appliances, entertainment gadgets, and even laptops – at the same time. These include one car outlet (120W max), two USB-C ports (100W PD max), four USB-A ports (12W each), and 6 AC outlets (1800W total output). It’s powerful enough to keep your desk lamp running for more than 35 hours, an 18 cu. ft. fridge for over seven, a coffee maker for three, and a toaster oven for just under an hour. You can also fully power a standard 58.2Wh laptop for more than 24 times, and your smartphone for over 97! Basically, this station can keep all your important stuff up and running for days and even weeks. Whether you’re craving a hot cup of joe on a camping trip or need to hit some work deadlines at home during an outage, F1500 has you covered in every situation.</p>
<p>When it comes to recharging the power station itself, you’ve got multiple options, including AC, car, and solar. Using a 600W solar panel, for instance, can push it from 0 to 80% in just under 1.5 hours. The LifeP04 battery is designed to last up to 10 years, meaning the power station will support all your energy needs for years to come. You can also extend the standby time and minimize battery damage using the power-saving mode on the station.</p>



<p>The Anker app makes it easy to manage power and check the power bank’s battery using your phone. There’s also an informative display at the top of the power bank, which shows recharging time, active ports, and other stats. Another handy feature that deserves a mention is the built-in LED. This light makes it easy to find emergency supplies and other essentials in cases of a blackout.</p>
<p>Even better, the Solix F1500 monitors temperature 100 times per second and notifies you if things get a bit too tense, ensuring smooth, safe power delivery. Included in the box are the Anker SOLIX F1500 itself, a 5-year warranty, an AC charging cable, a car charging cable, a solar charging cable, and a user manual.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6670/">Normally, you’d pay over $1,300 to enjoy the peace of mind this power station brings, but you can pick it up for just $499 today.</a> Grab it quickly, as it’s a limited-time offer. We don’t expect the deal to last more than a day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new Sony patent has surfaced called ‘Ghost Player’, which is AI tech that can not only guide the players who are stuck, but also play the games for you. </p>



<p>Sony is known to patent new tech years before it is actually released. We have already seen multiple patents for the DualSense controller that discuss <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-new-patent-reveals-a-controller-concept-with-conductive-ink/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introducing conductive ink</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-new-dualsense-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replacing the touchpad with a touchscreen</a>. Now, the new patent focuses on AI technology, which could enable the console to play the game for you. </p>







<h2 id="h-sony-s-ghost-player-ai-patent-talks-about-a-guide-mode-and-a-complete-mode">Sony’s Ghost Player AI Patent Talks About a ‘Guide Mode’ and a ‘Complete Mode’</h2>



<p>A report by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> talks about the new ‘Ghost Player’ AI tech patent for Sony, wherein an AI-generated player can either guide a player towards the solution or even complete the game for them. There are two modes, ‘Guide Mode’ and ‘Complete Mode’. The Guide Mode can seemingly create an AI-controlled version of Nathan Drake in a game like Uncharted and show the player how they can get past the level. In ‘Complete Mode’, the AI-controlled character will complete the entire section for the player. </p>



<p>Sony’s Ghost Player AI technology will be trained using existing gameplay footage online and will not require the developer to provide a pre-recorded character to play the game. The AI patent could serve as an upgrade to PlayStation’s existing Game Help feature, which offers hints, tips, images, and even video walkthroughs to guide players through certain sections. </p>



<p>However, players should note that acquiring a patent doesn’t mean the tech will be released; it could be years before we even see it in action, or it may not be released at all. </p>







<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-game-hike-in-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 jailbreak rumours</a> have caused the price of a Star Wars game to increase by 1000%.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, I had the great pleasure of attending the Games Industry Conference (GIC) in Poznań, Wielkopolska, where I sat in on a number of talks about game development and craft. In one of those talks, given by Petr Nohejl, devops programmer for Warhorse Studios, I heard a fascinating anecdote that got me thinking about the silliness of video games, and the lengths testers go to in order to ensure they run smoothly for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nohejl’s talk was about Kingdom Come: Deliverance II and the challenges faced by programmers trying to debug the game, resolve crashes, and deal with gameplay hitches. It was far deeper and more advanced than the bit I’m presenting here, and admittedly pretty over my head in terms of technical specifics, as I’m not a game developer myself. But at one point, he was talking about setting up simple, repeatable scenarios in-game that can be tested automatically, and gave the following example:</p><blockquote>There are some test rotations, so you just spawn the player, you wait, you as I mentioned…and then the player rotates a few times. So it just loads up all the stuff, the streams. And we have these random rotations all around the maps. So the rotation test just like teleports and performs the rotation on thousands and thousands of places on the map. And then we have actually a heat map of the whole rotation test.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Essentially, Nohejl is describing what I am told is a quality assurance test where the player is spawned in, they spin around a few times in place, and that’s it. I am told by several individuals I spoke to with QA experience and expertise that this is a very common test and, to most QA professionals, probably pretty boring. But to me, who’d never considered the granular specifics of what went into testing games, it was hilarious.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the wake of this discovery, I put out a call on social media and through various PR contacts for QA professionals to share their most ridiculous game testing stories: essentially, what’s the silliest thing they’ve had to do to test something in a game? What came back was a delightful flood of anecdotes ranging across AAA blockbusters to small indies, canvassing a decade or more of game development. I am now thrilled to share these stories with you in hopes that you find the goofy incidentals of QA testing as funny as I do.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Shootin’ the Breeze</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">“While testing Unreal II for Xbox, if we angled our gun upwards by 45 degrees and shot the assault rifle at the bridge strut as we walked across it, the game would consistently crash. We tested that stupid bridge for weeks.” -Ben Kosmina</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When I was on Overwatch I had to test to make sure that the materials on the various surfaces were set up properly for hit effects. For example, when shooting wood it would sound like wood was being impacted instead of metal. There are a LOT of materials and surfaces in the various levels, but I had access to the editor tools so I actually made a testing hero to help make things easier. It was basically Widowmaker with a 1s cooldown on her hookshot, Hanzo's wall climb ability, and an expanded magazine size so I could shoot more freely. I also gave myself like 10x movement speed and the ability to toggle the bullet sounds on and off so I could hear the impacts better. Then I proceeded to methodically run around every map shooting every unique material surface to make sure they were making the right noises. When I moved off the team I was chatting with one of my friends and he was saying he still used that hero for testing, which made my day.” -Andrew Buczacki</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“[On] Anno 2070, I had to do a series of tests and videos for the USK rating board. Spent several days dropping nukes over and over, zooming in to the little people showing that it wasnt graphic. Had a whole video &amp; Images folder of a mother with a baby buggy no-selling a direct nuke at different angles.” -Ruairí Rodinson, Rho Labyrinths studio head</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Inventing a Guy</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hello! The whole story is a bit more complicated. The NPC in Mental Refreshment [in The Outer Worlds 2] was actually my 1st encounter with a peeing NPC and I thought that, for some reason, the invisible collision is the intended behavior displayed by a urinating NPC. Then, some days later, I saw an NPC performing an unfamiliar animation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I curiously walked up to him and, to my great surprise, he was peeing! At that moment the confusion started. ‘Why does the game let me get so close to him?’ ‘I couldn't even dream of coming this close to the other peeing NPC!’ And so, the investigation has begun. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After bothering a few other innocent pissing NPCs it turned out that my fundamental assumption that NPCs are supposed to be shielded while relieving themselves was wrong! I dutifully reported the excessive collision on the mentally refreshed subject and now the User can peacefully watch him do his business from up close.” -Aleksander Gozdzicki, FQA Tester, QLOC, The Outer Worlds 2</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I was a programmer rather than QA, but I remember having to get creative when I was testing some of my code on Kinect. I had some code that was meant to detect someone making air guitar motions, and I had to shove my hoodie up my T-shirt in order to check that it would work with pregnant people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When testing the 'new user' Kinect login sequence we had to wear carnival masks to stop it from recognizing us.” -Tim Aidley</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“On Saints Row we had a debug npc named Skinballs (lol) that was literally just four spheres wrapped in different shades of skin texture so we could test lighting for different skin tones during development…teams need to plan for that kind of testing with intentionality, and not enough do.” -Elizabeth Zelle</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/bafkreicz6wfne6ja5frh5fzkmmgun6ouuurxuqvtxayy2byye2wcwfdabm-1766179538710.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Skinballs.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“My favorite example of this was ‘The Carwash’ on Mortal Kombat (X? 11?) where a T-posed character would slowly move through a series of particle emitters, each one causing a specific type of damage - cuts, stabs, burns, gashes, ice, etc. so we could test damage models on characters.” -Daanish Syed, former Netherrealm Artist</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We used placeholder characters earlier in Sunderfolk’s development whilst character art was still pending. One in particular was a free character model from Adobe’s Mixamo site called ‘Brute’ which was essentially a large oily barbarian. He was regularly used to fill in the board and for cinematics to see how animations look and function. Affectionately named Oily Man, we still use him in-engine for hero spawn indicators in the encounter designer. Oily Man lives on!” -Ali Tirmizi, Sunderfolk QA Lead at Secret Door</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">WoW!</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Andrew Buczacki graciously supplied me with a number of anecdotes from his time on World of Warcraft, which I’ve included all as one chunk for the WoW fans in the room:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When testing the final boss of the Icecrown raid in Wrath of the Lich King, we had a bug where Frostmourne (the Lich King's sword) didn't appear in cinematic on a specific hardware configuration. They mobilized the entire QA floor for WoW to test every permutation of graphics setting, resolution, etc. to see if it was happening anywhere else. By the end of the testing day we had all watched the cinematic (and seen most of the raid fight), to the point where many of us had memorized the monologues and the cinematic. You'd randomly hear "Bolvar!" for months after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Also on that fight, I was assigned a hotfix where one of the AoEs the boss did was supposed to expand 15% faster. There were no good precise measuring tools so my friend and I set up a ridiculous testing contraption involving engineering smoke flares, a hunter pet, and liberal use of in-game cheats. At the end we were able to verify that it was at least expanding faster, although I argue we got a degree of precision that probably wasn't necessary by the end.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Old time WoW fans may remember that over the course of a few patches the shoulderpads on some race/gender combos (male Orcs most notably) shrunk. This was eventually caught and fixed, but to make sure it didn't happen again one of the tests my team ran was to look at a fixed gallery of character models wearing various equipment on the current version and the newest build. We had an automated script that would log in and take pictures from fixed angles and equip the same things so we could compare screenshots to make sure that everything stayed the same size.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once I had to test and verify that the ‘Win a loot roll with a 100’ achievement was working. To do this I went to Onyxia's Lair (a popular sandbox for QA), and after not winning the lottery and winning loot with a 100 on Onyxia I spawned in about 100 raid bosses at once with god mode on. Then I used super powerful AoE cheat spells to kill them all and began the laborious process of looting and rolling on all of them. The achievement totally worked, by the way.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">CAN you pet the dog?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">“So here's something that I'm pretty sure most people don't ever think about: Testing "Can you Pet the dog?" in games. Like, it's a feature a lot of people look for and adore in video games, but I don't think your every day average person realizes that, as cute as it is, it took people HOURS upon HOURS to get it right haha. So in Demonschool for instance, when you pet the dog, you'll get unique dialogue per interaction. The dog can also be found on different maps and depending on the date and how many times you've pet him, he might move to different locations. If you sit there and let Faye pet the dog, the camera will (very) slowly zoom in to give the player a better view of it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“At one point in development, we came to find out of that one of the random softlocks we were encountering was actually tied to the adorable, lovable action of petting the dog. This meant that we had to spend HOURS testing every possible variable of petting the dog. Every location it showed up in, every dialogue string attached to it, every date it was available to pet. We'd skip petting it certain days  and in certain locations to try to mix up where it appeared in the game on different dates to see if THAT was causing the issue. We had to make sure that the slow camera zoom was working on each and every map that the dog can appear on, and every VERSION of those maps (day, evening, and night).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So what ultimately should be a fun, cute little easter egg that pretty much every random player enjoys seeing in a game, ended up becoming hours and hours of work behind the scenes to make sure it worked just right and wouldn't softlock the game for everyone haha. And after tons of hours and hundreds of pets, we can now all happily pet the dog without issue!” -AJ McGucken, lead QA at Ysbryd Games</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Make Some Noise</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">“One time when I was doing audio for god of war, we had put a sound of a frog croaking on the frog asset. Well, one of the level designers took that frog and COVERED an island in them. So I had to make a JIRA ticket to kill frog island.” -Shayna Moon, senior technical producer</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Off the top of my head, I found a bug working on New Super Mario for Wii that was at the start screen. The game shows the title and plays a little song. At the end of the song, it transitions to "demo" footage of Mario &amp;co jumping around. If you press start, you are taken to the starting menus (new game, load game, options etc) IN THEORY, but if you happen to press start at the EXACT moment between the two states of the start screen, the game instead hard locks and must be force-restarted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, every day we got a new build, I had to regress this bug by sitting at the start screen and trying to press start at exactly the right moment. If it didn't lock, I had to back out and try again. It was extremely tedious and difficult to get right, proving a negative. Another tester was a little better at the timing than me so we would do this together every morning, just pushing start, for hours, like the world's worst rhythm game.” -Anonymous</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>In addition to all the anecdotes I received for this piece, I also conducted an interview with Camden Stoddard, audio director at Double Fine working on Keeper. Stoddard chatted with me about the complex process he went through to get Twig, the bird, to sound exactly right, which included a lot of strange testing practices.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The emotional bond between Twig and the Lighthouse in Keeper was critical to the game, so Stoddard spent a lot of time testing different things to get the communication between the two just right. He tried actual bird sounds and recordings and libraries. He tried using a foghorn with the Lighthouse, "which no matter what you do, a foghorn doesn't get that emotional," he said. So he muted the Lighthouse, which worked out better, but there was still the matter of the bird, Twig. I'll let Stoddard take it from here:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I wasn't reaching it with the recordings of birds. So I just started studying how a bird talks, and it turns out their larynx is unique in nature. They have two. They have an avian larynx where they have a lower one called a syrinx. And basically, that means that their pitch control and their pattern control is ridiculous. They can just do things that most animals cannot with their voice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So I started thinking about that. I'm like, 'Well, okay, this bird is way beyond the emotional tone of an actual bird. So we need a human performance here. So how do I make a human sound like a bird?' So I just started fooling around with my own voice, and I wound up finding this software that was meant for electronic music. It was from an electronic group in Europe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And I had used it before, but what was interesting about it is a lot of things you can adjust, pitch and things like that, but this, you could adjust the harmonics trail. That was what was interesting. And as soon as I put my voice through it and I started messing around with it, I became a bird. My voice just started sounding like a bird, which made a lot of sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So I started experimenting with, I would do the performance as the bird. I started studying how birds communicate, and then I started thinking about, "Okay. Well, if I can have the sound of the bird, but I can have the emotional punctuation and pattern that we want emotionally, then I think we got it nailed." So over about two years, I finally got how to do Twig. And the hard part on me was, the best way to do Twig was to inhale while I was doing the sound and not exhale, because when you inhale, your larynx becomes much more raw and kind of nonhuman-sounding. So if I inhale, you're like... You get this crazy range that you're not used to. And once I manipulated that, that's where Twig came from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So then all of a sudden, I became like an actor, and I had to figure out these heavy, heavy scenes, which I hadn't counted on, because it's a very emotional game. There's some heights of anger and sadness and surprise and true existentialism in the end. It's wild. So I not only had to go to the limits of my sound design know-how, I had to figure out how to make this bird very emotional and really care about this lighthouse."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Below is a recording shared with us by Stoddard showing the three-step transformation of his voice from his own bird sounds to the final sounds used in the game. It uses a Granelli SM57 dynamic microphone going through an Avalon 737sp preamp, and various software to edit it, including a combo of Eventide 910 and 949 harmonizers (software) and Manipulator by Polyverse (software). It was all recorded in Pro Tools.</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Climb Every Mountain, Drop Every Weapon</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">"When working on the Mr. X Nightmare DLC for Streets of Rage 4, the team noticed that sometimes, when a player dropped their weapon, it would fall through the floor. We had to drop all the weapons to identify the issue, which turned out to be specific to a single weapon... the swordfish! Perhaps it's a new type of flying fish?" -Laura Peitavi, lead senior QA, Streets of Rage 4 DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound, the player character (Kenji) can climb up walls. However, when attempting to grab a wall with a small surface, he would often assume an unnatural position where it appears that he is supporting his entire body weight with a single arm. The level designers at The Game Kitchen could set an "is climbable" property for each wall in the Unity game engine, but there was no way to set this property to false automatically for every short wall found in the game. Therefore, Dotemu's entire QA team had to attempt to grab every single wall in the game in order to find which ones could lead to animation issues so that The Game Kitchen could alter the properties of the problematic walls." -James Petit, QA analyst - Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A Castle Made of WHAT</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">“Back in 2022, well before we announced Wildgate, ‘Banana Castle’ was the nickname we gave to this example project that we sent to external vendors so they could help us identify performance bottlenecks in our physics simulation, without revealing what we were actually working on. Using stock Unreal assets, we glued these models together to test our in-game physics.” - Grant Mark, Wildgate technical director at Moonshot</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had a test level [in The Outer Worlds 2] that was a tower where each room was a different physical material, which meant that some of the rooms had walls/ceilings/floors made entirely of hair or skin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Different ‘physical materials’ will have different sound/visual effects depending on the material. For example, if you fire a bullet at a concrete floor, the decal (a bullet hole), the impact VFX (sparks flying or whatever) and the sound effects will be different than if you had fired at the ground on a sandy beach. Footsteps also make different sounds when walking around on these different materials. In addition to things like concrete and sand, we also have physical materials for hair and skin (so that they can have the appropriate response to being shot at or whatever). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If I wanted to quickly verify that these effects were working correctly it was useful to be able to load into this test level, teleport to the room with the physical material I was looking for, and then I could test for all of these material-specific features by shooting the walls and walking around on the floors and such.” -Josh Ledford, QA analyst, Obsidian for The Outer Worlds 2</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> came out in 2020, fans have debated Act 1, which sees V befriend Jackie Welles and attempt to make it big in Night City before the infamous heist mission goes horribly wrong. Some feel the game would have been better had Act 1 been extended and given players more time with the much-loved — but short-lived — companion character. But what does the creative director of Cyberpunk 2 think?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mbokwdsals27" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a>, CD Projekt's Igor Sarzynski said extending Act 1 before the heist wouldn’t have made Cyberpunk 2077 a better game, and he used Star Wars to back up his point: “it's like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then: “the motivation / goal in this section of the game is pretty vague — 'get to the top' — which, prolonged and without stakes or pressure would result in meandering, unfocused experience.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Act 2 picks up after the shocking events of Act 1 and Jackie’s untimely death, with V desperate to find a cure for the Relic in their head. Part of the story involves V grieving for Jackie and helping other characters deal with his death in their own ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some Cyberpunk 2077 players, determined to spend as much time as possible with Jackie before the inevitable happens, focus on Watson, the Act 1 playable area, and little else — something Sarzynski acknowledged in his posts. “It's an open world game, some manage to squeeze 20 hours out of Watson,” he said. “Pick your own pace.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Sarzynski acknowledged the ongoing debate around how much time players get to spend with Jackie. “Is it enough time to bond with Jackie?” he asked. “For some it is, for some it isn't. All things considered I think we struck a good balance.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, “No, half-year montage is not cut content. We always planned it like this. But more on 'cut content' notion in some other post.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sarzynski has moved on to Cyberpunk 2, and there’s no indication that anything he’s said here on Jackie has a bearing on what to expect from the hotly-anticipated sequel. Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith has been chatty about it, however. In May last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-has-night-city-and-another-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-mike-pondsmith-teases"><u>Pondsmith teased some previously unknown details</u></a> when he was asked about the scope of his involvement with Cyberpunk 2 (then known as Project Orion) at the Digital Dragons 2025 conference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pondsmith admitted he wasn’t as involved this time around, but said he does review scripts and had been to CD Projekt to check out the ongoing work. “Last week I was wandering around talking to different departments, and seeing what they had, ‘Oh look, this is the new cyberware, what do you think?’ ‘Oh yeah, that’s pretty good, that works here,’” he said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the morsel on the sequel: that it features a brand new city in addition to the Night City we know from Cyberpunk 2077. Pondsmith described this new city as “like Chicago gone wrong.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion, because there’s another city we visit — I’m not telling you any more than that but there’s another city we visit. And Night City is still there. But I remember looking at it and going, yeah I understand the feel you’re going for this, and this really does work. And it doesn’t feel like Blade Runner, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong. I said, ‘Yeah, I can see this working.'”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Pondsmith’s comments do not necessarily suggest the Cyberpunk sequel will feature a future Chicago, rather a city that has the feel of a dystopian version of the city. It may well be a take on future Chicago, but that isn’t confirmed based on these comments. There is also some debate about whether Cyberpunk 2 will expand upon the Night City that’s in Cyberpunk 2077 or feature a new version, and the extent to which it is playable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like we'll have to wait some time to find out.

Special Edition</a> launched on Switch 1 back in 2024, and surprise! Limited Run Games has brought it back again for Nintendo's new hybrid with a host of hot upgrades.</p>
<p>As revealed in a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3mboiujxgzj2x">Bluesky</a>, this Switch 2 Edition packs in increased resolution and "improved performance" — though the frame rate specifics were not given. You can also expect higher quality assets from this release and a "downsampled display mode".</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version is now available on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tomba-special-edition-switch-2/">North American eShop</a> for <strong>$19.99</strong>. LRG doesn't appear to be offering any Upgrade Path options between the consoles at the time of writing, but we will be sure to update this post if that changes.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tlpmsv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>For those who missed the initial release, here's a quick summary of Tomba's key features and a handful of screenshots from its new eShop listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-Save Anywhere! No more worrying about heading back to a checkpoint.<br>
-Rewind - Stuck on a difficult challenge? Try again!<br>
-Toggle for analog control<br>
-A museum crammed with classic print advertisements, original packaging and manuals, never- before-seen dev documents, and high-res original artwork<br>
-A new remastered soundtrack<br>
-Interview with the creator, Tokuro Fujiwara</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Switch 2 release of 'Tomba 1' lands mere weeks after Limited Run Games launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomba-2-the-evil-swine-return-special-edition">Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return Special Edition</a> on both hybrid consoles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyberpunk 2077</em></strong> was released in a rather poor state in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2020</strong> which required <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-release-date/">multiple updates to fix</a></strong>, the story was always considered to be among the game's strongest points. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Act 1</strong>, however, has long <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">remained one of the most controversial parts of the game's engaging story, especially the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">half-year montage</strong>&nbsp;that propels&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">V</strong>&nbsp;to the top of the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Night City</strong>'s&nbsp;mercenary world, setting the stage for the heist that would put</span> the proper story in motion.</p>



<p>For a long time, it has been speculated that the <strong>half-year montage replaced cut content</strong>, but that is not the case, as <strong>Act 1</strong> was reportedly designed the way it was from the beginning to avoid a <strong>meandering, unfocused experience</strong> that would have made most players bounce off the game.</p>



<p>Speaking on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a></strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyberpunk 2077's</em></strong> sequel creative director <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Igor Sarzynski</strong> commented on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Act 1</strong>, detailing why extending it wouldn't have made for a better experience, making an interesting comparison with the first movie in the original <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Star Wars</em></strong> trilogy: "<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">No, it wouldn't. It's like saying we should spend more time on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Tatooine</strong> with farmer <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Luke</strong> before he got involved with all this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Jedi stuff</strong>,"</em> Sarzynski said.</p>



<p>Besides, extending the story of <strong>Act 1</strong> wouldn't have necessarily extended playtime for most players, as with <strong>open-world games</strong>, players are free to choose their own pace. More interestingly, however, the <strong><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></strong> creative director highlighted how the motivation in this portion of the game wouldn't have made for an engaging experience.</p>



<p><strong><em>"The motivation / goal in this section of the game is pretty vague - 'get to the top' - which, prolonged and without stakes or pressure would result in a meandering, unfocused experience,"</em></strong> Sarzynski explained.</p>



<p>In another message, the sequel creative director provided further clarification on this motivation being too vague:<em> <strong>"Do jobs, make money, make reputation" - ok but what for? what are you trying to achieve? there would have to be a more specific goal for this section. 'Do stuff' without a clear hurdle to clear would make a lot of players bounce off the game."</strong></em></p>



<p>This isn't just a vague prediction, according to <strong>Sarzynski</strong>, as building reputation <strong><em>"is not a specific, measurable goal. and it's not about my opinion, we have telemetry, UX lab, survey data."</em></strong> Feeling that a good balance was also struck in regards to the time to bond with <strong>Jackie</strong>, Sarzynski ultimately confirmed that the <strong><em>"half-year montage is not cut content. We always planned it like this</em>."</strong></p>



<p>Given <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">that&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Act 1</strong>&nbsp;remains one of the most hotly debated&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">topics in Cyberpunk 2077</strong></em>, the community's opinion on the ma</span>tter appears to be generally at odds with the way this story segment has been designed. Some like user <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcleansix.bsky.social/post/3mbpbvdf27k2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew C. McLean</a></strong> feel that the in-game <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">reputation rating</strong> would have made the "reach the top" goal more tangible. </p>



<p>While setting a goal like reaching a certain level is not the kind of storytelling <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CD Projekt Red</strong> wants to do, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sarzynski</strong> admits that something of the sort would have been doable, but <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em>"it would require a significant rewrite and introducing a storyline that contextualizes and structures this getting to the top."</em></strong> </p>



<p>Likewise, others would have loved to experience <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">V</strong> reaching the top, or spending more time with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Jackie</strong>, although in some ways, not having had that much time with this likeable character made the events of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">heist</strong> even more impactful.</p>



<p>Considering how it's possible to spend so much time in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Night City</strong> completing meaningful content that further fleshes out the franchise's universe, I understand why the developer made some sacrifices to keep the narrative pace tighter. However, it's undeniable that, for a first playthrough, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">half-year montage can feel disappointing</strong>. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see if the community's opinion on this matter will influence the development of the <strong>second entry in the series</strong>, which promises to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-includes-a-second-city-that-is-like-chicago-gone-wrong/">an even bigger game.</a></strong></p>

Others, it's for the thrill of competition. Whatever the reason is, multiplayer games are often the throughline of most people's year with games. Here are our best of 2025.</p><p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2025 Best Multiplayer Award for exceptional multiplayer gameplay and design.</p><ul><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>Elden Ring Nightreign</li><li>Mario Kart World</li><li>Peak</li><li>Split Fiction</li></ul><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/awards" rel="nofollow">Check out here</a>&nbsp;for our other award categories.</p><hr><h2>Third Place - Split Fiction</h2><p>Developer: Hazelight Studios | Release Date: March 6th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Josef Fares may forever be the man who publicly hated on the Oscars once, but let's not forget that he and his studio champion unique multiplayer experiences. <em>Split Fiction</em> is the latest of his games, and it's filled to the brim with gameplay that puts cooperation centerstage.</p><p>It starts off easy, with each player getting access to a couple unique mechanics. These mechanics compliment each other, often requiring a one-two punch to solve a puzzle or beat an enemy. It's simple, but the game layers on challenges to mix things up. These mechanics change every level and evolve over the course of each level, keeping things fresh.</p><p>Each stage swaps back and forth between fantasy and sci-fi for narrative reasons, and homages to other franchises are peppered throughout. It all culminates with a fantastic interdimensional setpiece that puts the marketing behind<em> Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em> to shame.</p><p>That doesn't even scratch the surface of some of the more unique gameplay moments in <em>Split Fiction</em>. Everyone loves the motorcycle chase scene with the CAPTCHA mini game, but no one talks about when the game turns into pinball or <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> for a minute.</p><p>Few games go in this hard on a crafted two-player co-op experience, and <em>Split Fiction</em> is an easy recommendation for two people to enjoy each other's company over a game.</p><h2>Second Place - Battlefield 6</h2><p>Developer: Battlefield Studios | October 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>In late 2021, <em>Battlefield </em>took a bit of a nosedive with the release of <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, which was widely considered one of, if not the worst entries in the series. Following that incident, Respawn developer Vince Zampella (whose legacy cannot be overstated enough) was called in to oversee the <em>Battlefield </em>series. Zampella unfortunately passed late last year, but there is no doubt in my mind he played a pivotal role in turning this series around with <em>Battlefield 6</em>.</p><p>With <em>Battlefield 6</em>, we’re met with a robust multiplayer experience comprising an absolute TON of guns and customizations, giving us some of the weightiest and most visceral combat in the series. Playing on a giant map with dozens of other players, or getting together with your own squad of friends to accomplish objectives, feels like the good ol’ days that made <em>Battlefield </em>such a coveted franchise.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Peak</h2><p>Developer: Aggro Crab, Landfall | Release Date: June 16th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>The term "friendslop" was coined recently to describe a game like <em>Peak</em>, but it undermines just how great of an experience <em>Peak</em> is. It's silly, challenging, and rewarding. Most games are generally better with friends, but <em>Peak </em>transforms into something that feels like lightning in a bottle.</p><p>Climbing the newly generated mountain every day requires a lot of effort, teamwork, and communication, which all can breed frustration and stress in multiplayer environments. But with its cartoony presentation and lighthearted atmosphere, the vibes stay relaxed.<br>Ingenious items keep the gameplay exciting, where every situation can be answered with the perfect item. The limiting inventory adds just enough tension to keep things engaging, especially with how it forces you to communicate—and opens the door for some mischievous item misuse.</p><p>Even failure is funny in <em>Peak</em>. Nothing beats hearing your friend fall as the spatial audio does its magic. Coming back as a ghost is great too, giving everyone the ability to participate and make color commentary, regardless of skill level.</p><p>For what feels like a silly joke, for what amounts to a "friendslop" game, <em>Peak</em> exemplifies what a perfect casual game night should be. This isn't for the sweaty leaderboard chasers; this is for the silly group of friends who love a good laugh.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>After a run collecting some of the best loot of your life, getting unexpectedly downed in&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> is one of the worst feelings. But perhaps a player is taking things a&nbsp;<em>smidgen</em> too seriously when they scream so loudly for help that a neighbor tries to kick their door down in panic.</p> <p>In&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, running out of health doesn’t mean instant death but rather falling belly-first to the ground, able only to crawl at a brutally slow pace while a timer ticks down until your complete death. You can no longer access your inventory, there’s no way to heal yourself with your bandages, and your only hopes are to reach an escape hatch or be revived by a fellow player. When you’re carrying some top-notch loot, perhaps exactly the items you’ve needed for so long to upgrade a workbench, this can be agonizing. Crawling to safety can sometimes be achieved, and it’s one of the most rewarding moments in the game, but it’s very unlikely. And when that timer runs out, you’re going to lose <em>everything</em> you have with you, likely including some favorite fully-upgraded weapons. It makes sense to be upset. It makes sense to shout out to other players for help.</p>

 <p>Perhaps not too loudly, however. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-player-calls-for-help-during-game-gets-door-kicked-in-by-concerned-neighbour">spotted by&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em></a>, one&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> player posted doorbell footage to Reddit of their neighbor knocking on their door in concern after hearing appeals for help, asking, “Y’all good?” and hearing, “Help me! Somebody help me!” come from inside. He then steps back and prepares to kick the door down.</p>

 <p>“My heart just about jumped out of my chest when I saw the door bulge like an explosion was behind it,” Reddit user Dreamthorp noted below the video footage.</p>   <p>It’s actually even worse than that. This wasn’t Dreamthorp’s home. He was house-sitting for a friend at the time, and thankfully the incredibly splendid neighbor (who it turns out is a firefighter) didn’t manage to kick through the door. The home’s owner apparently thought it was “hilarious,” and Dreamthorp noted that “if it was damaged in the slightest I’d buy him a new door at the very least.”</p>

 <p>It’s probably a good job front doors don’t collapse when kicked a single time like they do in the movies, given how little protection that would offer your home. Apparently the video cuts where it does as from that point on there was just a black screen, but it does to protect the embarrassment of the kindly hero as he likely bounced off it.</p>

 <p>“For context,” says the&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> player, “I was in a night raid on dam trying to extract from an elevator when a leaper landed on me and downed me right before the extract door shut. I just wanted to get stabilized so I could leave.”</p>

 <p>Dreamthorp thanked the friend’s neighbor by dropping off a six-pack outside his door.</p>   <p>Naturally, many on Reddit are skeptical, especially given the video cuts off before the kick, but Dreamthorp swears up and down that it’s real. I much prefer the reality where he’s telling the truth, so I’m opting to live in that one.</p>

                <p>Sony has filed a patent document that could potentially allow AI to take over your game for you if you're struggling with it. The documents suggest that this "ghost assistance" can be activated at any time to either guide a player through progression or assume direct control of gameplay.</p><p>As revealed in the <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US454147536&amp;_fid=WO2025080356" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patent documents</a> first filed in September 2024 (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), the AI assistance system could potentially play through a section of a game that a player is struggling with, completing it for them. Sony describes the idea of training its AI agent using "footage from many users that have played the game" and various other online sources where gameplay videos have been uploaded.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630349-sony-patent.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630349" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630349-sony-patent.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630349"></a><figcaption>An example from Sony, showing how the feature could potentially work.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630349-sony-patent.jpg"></figure><p>Over the last couple of years, Sony has worked on several features to make its video games more approachable. The PS5 console launched with the Game Help system, which offers helpful tips and tricks via short videos and images on PS5 cards that can be instantly called up during gameplay. While developers haven't widely adopted it, it's still a useful feature for the games that do.</p><p>Sony has also expanded accessibility options for several of its first-party games, while other titles like God of War Ragnarok and Horizon Forbidden West have been criticized for offering too much assistance to players via protagonist musings or nearby NPCs constantly offering advice. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-september-update-expands-ai-assistant-gaming-copilot/1100-6535091/">Microsoft is also experimenting in this space</a> with its own AI-driven assistant. Revealed last year, Gaming Copilot is designed to provide help, recommendations, and other in-game support.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-patented-an-ai-gaming-ghost-that-will-play-playstation-games-for-you-when-you-get-stuck</link>
            <guid>1398124</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A patent filed by Sony over a year ago has resurfaced, and shows the company has ideas for an AI 'ghost' that could assist players if they get stuck in a game.</p>
<p>The aforementioned patent, which was recently noticed by <a href="https://www.allaboutai.com/ai-news/sony-ai-ghost-player-patent/">allaboutAI</a> and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/">VGC</a>, describes an "overlay" version of a player's character. When in use, this overlay character would be able to demonstrate actions, such as how to solve a puzzle or by providing "example controller input button sequences", which would in turn allow a player to then progress with the game.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>In some cases, an AI 'ghost' could also have a conversation with the player's character and give some "guidance or instruction" about what to do. Other times, the ghost could complete a section for the player. It sounds like an evolution of PlayStation's Game Help on PS5, which offers users tips and guides via videos and images on screen.</p>
<p>An image within the patent also describes mode switching, which would encapsulate four different options for users to be able to choose from. These are: Story Mode, Combat Mode, Exploration Mode and Full Game Mode .</p>
<p>"Although video game technology has seen many advances, some players find themselves in need of assistance. Games become very complicated, so players who are not experts oftentimes quit playing or find it hard to complete tasks," <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025080356">the filing reads</a>. "Players are able to do research for the game or even look up prior gameplays on internet sites, but that process is time consuming and many times not very relevant to tasks and/or scenarios currently being encountered by the player."</p>
<p>Should these AI Ghost helpers become a reality, it appears that they would be trained on existing footage of any given PlayStation game.</p>



<p>Assistance in games is, of course, nothing new. As I have already mentioned, the PS5 has Game Help, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-soon-add-ai-copilot-to-minecraft-offering-real-time-advice">Microsoft has its own Copilot AI feature</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, games more broadly often include a range of features to make them more accessible for as wide an audience as possible. This includes everything from adjustable difficulty levels to controller remapping, colour-blind modes and in-game hint systems (I personally quite liked the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returning-to-monkey-island-with-its-legendary-creators">book that Guybrush had tucked away in Return to Monkey Island</a>, but there are plenty of other examples out there).</p>

<p>As for AI, it remains an area of heated debate within the industry. In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development. In this report, Unity noted animation was the top use case. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, said that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. That number is now likely to be higher, and a more recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development.</p><p>Last year, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 lie ahead.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s narrative really kicks into gear when, after a job gone wrong, metal-infused merc protagonist V realises they're now living in the shadow of a Keanu Reeves-shaped clock. Despite this, you're free to while away hours doing a million things other than confronting your urgent mortality problem. It's something even CD Projekt themselves have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyberpunk.net/post/3m7sfrres7s2l">joked about</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prior to the heist going askew, however, there's an opening section in which V's working their way up through the ranks of Night City's underworld alongside Jackie Welles. This bit can last a while if you're happy to run after every side quest right out of the gate, but a lot of folks breeze through it, keen to be whisked into exploring all of the game's metropolis as rapidly as the action plays out in the cutscene which fast-forwards through most of the time Jackie and V spend making a name for themselves. So, in hindsight, would CD Projekt have benefitted from having this section of the main narrative run a bit longer? In the eyes of Cyberpunk 2 creative director Igor Sarzynski, the answer's a firm no, a view he's explained in a flurry of posts.</p>
<p>Writing on BlueSky (as spotted by <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/cyberpunk-2-director-says-extending-2077s-opening-act-makes-no-sense/">FRVR</a>), Sarzynski addressed the question of extending the pre-heist act head on, arguing that it wouldn't make for a better experience and is "like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff". Random shade thrown at uncle Owen and aunt Beru aside, Sarzynski's argument for this section working better as is revolves around the idea that the main perceived benefit of giving folks more time to bond with Jackie before, er, that thing happens to him at Konpeki Plaza wouldn't outweigh the drawbacks of a more drawn-out arc prior to the fatal twist in V's tale.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifv6rfa5ld57n7bcs76xz3qvtgxvouymheiga6sninoay3s5zuvza" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:nkkdls4c67lfagg735y7ywpq/app.bsky.feed.post/3mbokwdsals27"><div lang="en"><p>So would extending Act 1 (before the heist) in CP77 make the game better?

1. No it wouldn't. It's like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff.

</span></p><p>"The motivation/goal in this section of the game is pretty vague - 'get to the top' - which, prolonged and without stakes or pressure would result in meandering, unfocused experience," the developer argued, acknowledging that it is possible at current to spend up to 20 hours or so just exploring Watson during the pre-heist arc. As to whether the section as is offers enough time to grow close to Jackie and make what happens to him bear the emotional weight it's designed to, Sarzynski admitted that'll vary from player to player, but added: "All things considered, I think we struck a good balance."</p><p>The start of Cyberpunk sometimes feeling like a bit of a rush to get everything in position for the main narrative arc to really kick off with the introduction of Silverhand and the relic's long been an aspect of it that I've seen not necessarily as bad, but certainly something that could potentially have been improved. The cutscene montage of early jobs definitely made it harder initially for me to fully buy into the elements of the story surrounding clawing your way to Night City legend status. Ostensibly watching someone else blast through the start of that path in sped up fashion takes you out of it a bit, and you don't get as full a picture of day-to-day life with Jackie as you otherwise might.</p>
<p>There's also the matter of the game unfolding in a manner which inundates you with side stuff which essentially feels like pushing snooz on a threat of death which is supposed to feel inescapable and crushing from act two onwards. Sarzynski <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mboxdpmils2f">acknowledged that here</a>, writing: "If I were to do it again, I'd contextualize gigs and sidequests as escaping death in a different way - by creating your own legend. And maybe gate a specific ending behind doing enough side content." So, possibly a lesson which could be applied in some fashion to Cyberpunk 2 there.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as someone who feels <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> - a game which also draws plenty of good from its general commitment to taking the lengthy and massively detailed route - start to drag a bit as its Western epic tale trots from the mid-game towards the end, I can very much see Sarzynski's point about act one.</p>
<p>Both approaches can make for great games. In my book, a bigger issue in the base version of Cyberpunk arguably suffers due to is Johnny Silverhand's regular presence and commentary sometimes feeling like it can undercut that game's ability not to fill moments of silence that'd be perfect for Bladerunner-style broody contemplation with chatter that may not add much to proceedings. That's a balance I felt was nailed a lot better in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty</a>, simply by having Songbird cut in as a second voice in your head and offer some variety in outside perspective on events.</p>
<p>As for Jackie, it's a bit of a cold way to put it given his fate, but I think he's got just enough of a presence to fulfil his narrative role of early-game buddy cut down in his prime.</p>

              <p>Things get so busy during day-to-day life because there’s always something new to tackle. A great computer or tablet can make juggling it all a little less frustrating.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a single 2-in-1 device that provides the ability to perform real-world work and has the qualities of a tablet, the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/ Tablet (2024) is that choice. This 13-inch Copilot+ PC comes with a very clear, interactive touch-screen that converts to a canvas, notebook and full laptop upon attaching a keyboard. With the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024), you can replace an old laptop and a tablet with one light weight device that is highly versatile.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6668/">You can purchase the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024) on Amazon today for $989.99 which is $510 less than the original price of $1,499.99 or 34% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6668/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A flexible laptop and tablet hybrid for plenty of use cases</h2>
<p>Your first impression of the device will be of the 13-inch touch-screen display. The large 13 inch screen allows for ample amounts of viewing area for multiple applications open at the same time, viewing high definition images and reading comfortably. The clarity of the text is excellent, colors appear vibrant for creative professionals, and the aspect ratio of the display offers a wide viewable area for viewing web pages and documents; even watching movies. Additionally, you can use all the normal gestures of a tablet such as tapping, swiping, and pinching, and, when you need to utilize the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet as a more conventional laptop, simply place it upright using the built-in kick stand. When paired with a Surface keyboard and Surface Pen, you create a perfect combination for writing and sketching that still makes for a convenient and portable solution to pack in a backpack.</p>



<p>It’s super easy to change form factors if you’re looking to use the Surface Pro 2-in-1 to its full potential. You can use it flat as a tablet to read books, annotate PDF files, or draw pictures. But you can also tilt the Surface Pro 2-in-1 upright with the the kick stand to watch videos, join online meeting/video conferencing sessions, etc., and attach the Surface keyboard when you need to type.</p>
<p>All told, the Surface Pro 2-in-1 Laptop/Tablet (2024) has everything most users need to be a super flexible device. It’s the perfect alternative to an iPad or other on-the-go laptop and tablet, and you won’t have to go broke picking one up if you need that kind of versatility. We suggest picking it up now before it’s all sold out, because you might not see this Surface at such a price point again for some time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios is enjoying a rampant run through the extraction space since releasing ARC Raiders on October 30. The transformative, disruptive title has shaken up the genre and emerged as a stellar, best-selling game that has taken the world by storm. But it might not end with it being <strong>just a game</strong>.</p>



<p>The CEO of Embark Studios, Patrick Söderlund, recently revealed that multiple companies have reached out to pitch an ARC Raiders television show or movie. While he believes the IP would align quite nicely with alternate media, the studio is reluctant to do anything until they’re <strong>doing it right</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-would-arc-raiders-work-as-a-tv-show">Would ARC Raiders Work as a TV Show?</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with GamesBeat, which was hosted while <strong>playing ARC Raiders</strong>, Patrick Söderlund&nbsp;and Nexon CEO Owen Mahoney spoke about all things extraction. They touched on the future of the game, how it came to be, and even offered some insider tips on dominating the game’s multiple maps.</p>



<p>During the interview, the topic of an ARC Raiders TV show or movie came up, and Söderlund&nbsp;explained that Embark Studios has been approached numerous times.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t tell you how many companies have reached out wanting to make a TV series and movie out of this IP.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then stressed that it ‘needs to be done in the right way’ and suggested it would ‘be fun to see’ ARC Raiders represented in that medium.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders is nothing short of a cinematic marvel. The world-building is unparalleled, and each raid topside goes hand-in-hand with a sense of unpredictability that few games can truly capitalize on.</p>



<p>Live-action adaptations of video games are exploding these days. From the success of The Minecraft Movie and Super Mario Bros. to the ongoing unravelling of Fallout and The Last of Us in television form, fans of these games are lapping up every adaptation that hits the market.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders would likely do phenomenally well as a television series written to tell the backstory of the ARC invasion and how the survivors make their way into and ultimately dwell within the relatively safe walls of Speranza.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Demo Launches Tomorrow; Save Will Carry to the Full Game]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-demo-launches-tomorrow-save-will-carry-to-full-game/</link>
            <guid>1398094</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Japanese publisher <strong>Square Enix</strong> has revealed that a demo of <strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</strong> will be available tomorrow (<strong>January 7, 2026</strong>) on all platforms. Data from the demo's save file can be transferred to the full game, allowing players to continue where they left off. Moreover, everyone who plays the demo will receive the 'Day Off Dress' costume for Maribel to use in the final game.</p>



<p>We first heard about a Dragon Quest VII remake in July 2025, when a rumor <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-remake-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> a potential 2026 or early 2027 launch</strong>. <span>The official confirmation came just a couple of months later, in September 2025, when, during a Nintendo Direct</span>, Square Enix&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-annuounced-for-an-early-2026-release-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>&nbsp;the planned release date of&nbsp;<strong>February 5, 2026</strong>,&nbsp;for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>With this remake, the publisher has gone in an entirely different direction than with the recent <strong>HD-2D</strong> style featured in the <strong>Dragon Quest I–III remakes</strong>. Square Enix collaborated with developer <strong>HEXADRIVE</strong> (<strong>Monkey King: Hero Is Back</strong>, <strong>Voidcrisis</strong>) to craft a <strong>hand-painted diorama aesthetic</strong> that treats the game world as a miniature landscape populated by three-dimensional, doll-like characters. The character models themselves derive from actual physical dolls created during development, a deliberate choice to evoke <strong>Akira Toriyama</strong>'s original character designs.</p>



<p>In a slightly controversial move, Square Enix <strong>deliberately cut three entire islands</strong> and converted four others to optional sidequests, directly addressing <strong>the original's bloated 100+ hour structure</strong>. However, new content compensates: expanded character backstories, a new Kiefer scenario, and hints at an alternative ending absent from prior versions. The game now also supports non-linear progression, allowing players to tackle episodic arcs in varying order once the tablet fragments have been collected.</p>



<p>The signature vocation system also received a comprehensive redesign in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. The 50+ vocation roster is now streamlined to 20 per character, with "Moonlighting" enabling dual-vocation equipping and simultaneous progression. Most critically, the Career Sphere menu eliminates the dreaded mandatory backtracking to Alltrades Abbey. Monster vocations are now Monster Hearts (accessories), while a new Monster Master vocation consolidates scattered abilities. Lastly, the producer <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-feature-a-brand-new-ending-producer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <strong>there is a new ending in the remake</strong>.</p>



<p>Starting tomorrow with the demo, everyone will be able to experience some of these changes firsthand and judge for themselves. By the way, Square Enix has also just released the opening movie of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. Check it out in the embedded video below.</p>

            <p>In what has become <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amds-ryzen-9000x3d-processors-with-their-fancy-pants-cache-are-launching-november-7th">CPU tradition</a>, AMD have announced a new fastest-ever gaming processor to replace their last fastest-ever gaming processor. The newcomer, detailed at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2026">CES 2026</a>, is the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which actually shares the same architecture, socket, core and thread counts, and power usage rating as the erstwhile big dog, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. It’s mainly a quicker maximum boost clock, up from 5.2GHz to 5.6GHz, that grants it a performance edge.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>And cor, what a fine edge it is. By AMD’s reckoning, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D averages 27% better framerate results in games than Intel’s best offering, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-bets-on-efficiency-with-the-power-sipping-core-ultra-200s-series">Core Ultra 9 285K</a>. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D? 24% better. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tep42MpeD_Y&amp;list=PLTU_E21aX_rgRFQRrnvYySBt24dQUTXQC">Destroyed in seconds</a>.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The 9850X3D is out in Q1 2026, i.e. between January and March. There’s no pricing info yet, so we don’t know much extra that 3% will cost ya, though it’s probably worth noting that CPUs have seemingly been spared from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-pc-gamings-key-ram-manufacturers-arent-selling-to-regular-humans-anymore-so-they-can-peddle-more-kit-to-ai-companies">stock disaster currently engulfing RAM and SSDs</a> (and threatening to drag in graphics cards while it’s at it). As such, any big bump over the Ryzen 7 9800X3D’s $479 launch price would be, at best, extremely cheeky. Here be specs, in any case:</p>
<h3>AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Zen 5</li>
<li><strong>Socket:</strong> AM5</li>
<li><strong>Cores:</strong> 8</li>
<li><strong>Threads:</strong> 16</li>
<li><strong>Base clock:</strong> 4.7GHz</li>
<li><strong>Max boost clock:</strong> 5.6GHz</li>
<li><strong>L1 cache:</strong> 640KB</li>
<li><strong>L2 cache:</strong> 8MB</li>
<li><strong>L3 cache:</strong> 96MB</li>
<li><strong>TDP:</strong> 120W</li>
<li><strong>Max temp:</strong> 95°c</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking of the 9800X3D, any healthy computer-owning mind should keep a guard up around superlatives, but I’ve got one in the RPS Test Rig and it kinda <em>is</em> the fastest gaming CPU. Or, at least, it was. Now that there’s a newer version, I’ve naturally had to spend the morning berating it for its idleness and incompetence, which is why this post is only going live several hours after AMD’s announcement.</p>

            <p>An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> player calling for help while playing the game had their door kicked in by a concerned neighbour, who thought their wails were a sign of real-world distress.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARC_Raiders/comments/1q35psm/neighbor_heard_me_yelling_help_in_arc_raiders/">User Dreamthorp on the Arc Raiders Reddit</a> was house-sitting for a friend and decided to boot up some Arc Raiders. While playing ,they claim to have been calling to their squadmates for help when a nearby neighbour heard the commotion. Fearing the worst, they came to the rescue, kicking the door.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the door didn't break thanks to the two deadbolts keeping it locked and secure. Dreamthorp claims that the friend they were house-sitting finds the whole situation funny, and the whole story has a happy ending, with Dreamthorp posting a picture of a six-pack of Shiners left at the neighbour's door as thanks.</p>

<p>Arc Raiders continues its hot streak as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">both a top seller over the Christmas holiday</a> and one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">of the most popular games out right now</a>, players remain engaged with its blend of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-aggression-matchmaking-is-now-a-thing-in-arc-raiders">hyper aggressive extraction-style PvP gameplay</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">the interesting social dynamics present in an otherwise perilous experience</a>.</p><p>As for what's to come in 2026 for Arc Raiders?

                <p>Asus has hit the Consumer Electronics Show show floor with a brand-new set of Extended Reality glasses. Developed in partnership with Xreal, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 packs an impressive amount of technology into a slim frame for your face, allowing you to stream video directly to your eyes via a USB-C connection.</p><p>Internally, the Asus ROG Xreal R1 features 240Hz micro-OLED 1080p lenses, and it comes with an ROG Control Dock for HDMI and DisplayPort connectivity. You can also connect it to an ROG Ally via a single USB-C cable for a seamless experience. Asus says the lenses can create a 57-degree field of view and a 171-inch virtual screen at a distance of four virtual meters, covering 95% of the focused viewing area.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbIIPM7Lsrg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mbIIPM7Lsrg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As you'd expect from Asus, these glasses also match the company's Republic of Gamers aesthetic, with RGB lighting on the sides. Weighing just 91 grams, the glasses also have built-in Bose speakers, and electrochromic technology allows the lenses to tint automatically or on demand to suit varying lighting conditions. Pricing has yet to be announced, but Asus aims to launch the glasses in the first half of 2026.</p><p>This is one of several major announcements from Asus at CES 2026. Fans of the ROG gaming laptops can also expect several new models to arrive throughout the year, including a massively updated version of the Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo. This new version features <em>two</em> 120Hz OLED HDR 1displays, each 16 inches, and a detachable wireless keyboard.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Our Most Wanted Games of 2026 – #30 to #26]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/06/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-30-to-26/</link>
            <guid>1398058</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We are now in the top 30 of our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a> and here we’re hitting a mix of sequels, prequels, a much anticipated horror, and what could prove to be the ultimate mashup that will dominate 2026. Scroll down to find out what games have got into our top 30.</p>
<h2>30 – Slay The Spire II</h2>
<p><em>PC – “A secret Thursday in March 2026”</em></p>
<p>It was in early 2024 when we learned that smash-hit rogulike deckbuilder <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a> would be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/15/slay-the-spire-2-announced-with-early-access-in-2025/">getting a sequel</a>, and it’s safe to say it has big shoes to fill. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2">Slay The Spire II</a> is separated by 1000 years from the original game, which means new slayers, new cards, and new potions to use in the challenge to beat the Spire, which will contain new challenges.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slay the Spire 2 - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttVtllHkb4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Slay The Spire II was meant to be released into early access in 2025, with Mega Crit envisioning a year to 18 months before a full release. However, development delays meant early access did not take place when initially planned, instead now penned in for March 2026. We can only hope that Slay The Spire II is more worthy successor rather than the difficult second album.</p>

<h2>29 – Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>It was in mid-2025 when Asobo Studio revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/resonance-a-plague-tale-legacy-revealed-as-a-prequel-spin-off/">Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</a>, giving us a new game in the A Plague Tale universe, though setting it 15 years before the events of the main games. This spin-off sees a new main character in Sophia, a plunderer who finds herself on Minotaur Island fighting and trying to evade an army that is chasing her, with the possibility that the Minotaur will also make an appearance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lroYak-ryyM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The description for Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy references two heroes as players will switch between the ancient Minoan civilisation and Sophia’s time. The gameplay will consist of fighting various enemies as they come for Sophia and solving the puzzles across Minotaur Island to discover answers to why Sophia is there.</p>
<h2>28 – Pokémon Pokopia</h2>
<p><em>NSW2 – 5th March 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> could easily end up as one of the most popular and best selling games of 2026 when it comes out in March. Take the popularity of Pokemon and blend it with the life sim vibes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing</a>, and you have something that very few fans of both franchises would be able to resist.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon Pokopia | Extended Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDh6COB0Nqk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Pokémon Pokopia, you play as a Ditto that has taken on human form who has decided to create a little slice of paradise for fellow Pokemon. Just like any other Ditto, Pokopia’s Ditto can learn moves and abilities from other Pokemon allowing it to find ways to craft the cosy little getaway. For example, Ditto can transform into Lapras to swim around the world or sprout Bulbasaur vines for some bush slashing. Ditto will have friends to help with the crafting of paradise with the likes of Professor Tangrowth, and as more spaces are created more Pokemon will be attracted to join your little commune.</p>
<h2>27 – Reanimal</h2>
<p>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 13th February 2026</p>
<p>There is a lot of expectation behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reanimal">Reanimal</a>. Coming from Tarsier Studios, the original developers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review/">Little Nightmares</a> and with a good long wait for their latest game since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/09/little-nightmares-2-review/">Little Nightmares II</a> (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/08/little-nightmares-3-review/">Little Nightmares III</a> was not developed by Tarsier but Supermassive Games), and Reanimal looks like it could scratch that horror adventure vibe that made Little Nightmares so popular.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="REANIMAL Trailer #2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACZL7VziLS8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Reanimal looks familiar to Little Nightmares but this a new universe, a new story, and an emphasis on partnership as a brother and sister search for their friends and look for a way off the island that was once their home. The pair explore the remnants of their home by land and sea, going to once familiar locations that have been twisted and have their own horrifying stories. Reanimal has been designed to have the siblings experience things together, which means it is fully playable either solo or in co-op. We don’t have too long to wait as Reanimal is out in just over a month.</p>
<h2>26 – Gears of War: E-Day</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">its reveal in 2024</a> we have not heard much about Gears of War: E-Day, the prequel to the entire Gears of War franchise that will take us to the very start of the war with the Locust on Emergence Day. The game is being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/people-can-fly-confirmed-as-gears-of-war-e-day-co-developers/">co-developed by The Coalition and People Can Fly</a>, with the teams putting players in the boots of young Marcus Phoenix and Dominic Santiago.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine) - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EC20gLfUHeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All we really know is that will see a Sera in the immediate aftermath of invasion rather than a fallen planet suffering from years of conflict. It’s also currently only announced for Xbox Series X|S and PC, even if last year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/26/gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5-review/">Gears of War Reloaded remaster brought the series to PS5 for the first time</a> with a day and date release. Anyway, for now, enjoy looking back at the reveal and its Mad World trailer above.</p>
<p><em>Did any of these games resonate with you? Come back tomorrow and we’ll have five more as we break into the top half of our list.</em></p>

            <p>The team over at Xbox has added two previously unannounced games to its Game Pass subscription service.</p>
<p>Game Pass subscribers can now play <strong>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition</strong> and <strong>Brews and Bastards</strong> through the service. These two titles were not previously said to be coming when Microsoft laid out its most recent Game Pass line-up plans.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> Enhanced Edition and Brews and Bastards <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-xbox-game-pass-games-for-december">join the likes of Dome Keeper and other recent Xbox Game Pass additions</a>.</p>

<p>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition is a remaster of the unsettling puzzle platformer, which tells the tale of a yellow-raincoated girl named Six, as she attempts to escape The Maw. That is to say, a strange underwater vessel inhabited by a multitude of bizarre residents.</p>
<p>The adventure was warmly received on release, with Edwin Evans-Thirlwell calling it a "masterpiece of meat and malice" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-review">Eurogamer's Little Nightmares review</a>.</p>
<p>Brews and Bastards, meanwhile, is described as an "intoxicating" dungeon crawler, which developer Mune Studio says is "overflowing with action-packed combat, potent brews and outlandish bosses". Players will need to choose an "inebriated" hero to then make their way through "hordes of drunken demons" as they try to search for the stolen Brew Stone.</p><p>As well as these two new Game Pass additions, Xbox has also detailed five games that will be leaving the service in the coming weeks. These are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>, Road 96, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, The Grinch: Christmas Adventures - Merry and Mischievous Edition and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-ascent">The Ascent</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, the most recent game from Tango Gameworks, is getting a special re-release in collaboration with Limited Run Games.</p>
<p>With pre-orders set to open from 16th January up until the 1st March, Hi-Fi Rush Rhythm Edition will feature the deluxe version of the game alongside three special DLC costumes. These costumes are the Bossplay, Traditional Garb, and Teamplay outfits. It'll be available for the Xbox Series X/S and PS5.</p>
<p>Extra keen fans go opt for an even grander package with the Hi-Fi Rush Smidge Edition. This features the same Deluxe version of the game and DLC costumes, alongside a special three disc soundtrack, developer notes, and a custom box designed after the tutorial robot present in the game. There's also a bunch of in-game skins and gears for gameplay upgrades.</p>

<p>Then there's an even bolder option, the Project Armstrong Edition. This contains everything in the Smidge Edition alongside an 808 plush, a small replica of Chai's guitar, a Chai Project Armstrong pass, a glow-in-the-dark MP3 player pin, an hard cover art book, and an individually numbered certificate of authenticity.</p><p>Both the Smidge and Project Armstrong Edition will be going up for pre-order during the same period as the regular Rhythm Edition, <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/hi-fi-RUSH">and prices for each are viewable on the Limited Run website</a>. The Rhythm Edition will sell for $39.99, the Smidge Edition for $69.99, and the Project Armstrong Edition for $174.99.</p>
<p>Hi-Fi Rush has been through something of a journey over the past few years. Dropping suddenly back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">the game proved an exceptional release, receiving ample critical praise</a>. Its developer, Tango Gameworks, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">later shut down by Microsoft as part of widespread cuts</a>, which Xbox executive Matt Booty stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matt-booty-implies-tango-gameworks-closure-was-partly-due-to-leadership-change">was partly due to the studio's leadership change</a>, as Shinji Mikami left shortly after Hi-Fi Rush's release.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks-to-maintain-its-legacy-rather-than-cash-in">The studio would then be saved by Krafton</a>, who acquired the team shortly after. Late last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-and-inzoi-publisher-krafton-declares-itself-an-ai-first-company-placing-ai-at-the-centre-of-problem-solving">Krafton would then declare itself an "AI-first company"</a>.</p>

		<p>Ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> on 19th February, Nacon and developer Cyanide have released a 9 minute gameplay video to showcase various elements of its stealth action shenanigans.</p>
<p><iframe title="Styx: Blades of Greed | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/609Oad5kwCE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Styx provides the narration through the video, using a bunch of new and returning gadgets and abilities to scale a vertical fortress and reach the next preserve of Quartz. Key new abilities that are shown off include using a gappling hook and floating up hot air streams with a glider, but there’s also returning elements like poisoning barrels, possessing enemies and creating gloopy clones. Add to that genre classics of dousing flames, skulking through vents and just observing and listening for new opportunities, and you’ve got the broadest stealth game in this series to date.</p>
<p>This is the fourth game Styx has appeared in, making his debut in Of Orcs and Men which led to a spin off series of games starring the goblin assassin. In this new adventure, Styx is after the new mystical powers provided by quartz, which give him abilities like mind control, but he’ll have to build a team of allies (reluctant and otherwise) to do so, while making his way through the domains of humans, elves and orcs alike, the gang flying back and forth in a Zeppelin as their base of operations.</p>
<p>The trailer ends with this base under attack, as another fleet of airships catches up to Styx and his crew!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-may-the-quartz-be-with-you/">our preview of Styx: Blades of Greed</a> from Gamescom last year, I said, “It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun.”</p>

		<p>Square Enix has a nice surprise for Dragon Quest fans, <a href="https://xcancel.com/DragonQuest/status/2008298591597850979">announcing a demo for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> that will be available from tomorrow, Wednesday 7th January.</p>
<p>The free demo will be released across all platforms: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Switch, and PC via Steam.</p>


<p>Oh, and you’ll be able to carry over your progress into the full game when it releases on 5th February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Opening Movie | DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GL2-tty-p4M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s great to see demos released for games, and especially for remakes where you kind of just want to see if it catches the right vibes and tone when reviving a classic.</p>

<p>Square Enix have taken an awful lot of contrasting approaches to their remakes and remasters. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is sitting somewhere between the HD-2D remakes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/29/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review/">the original Dragon Quest trilogy</a> and the wholesale reinvention of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy.</p>
<p>One of the most striking things here is the art style, with Square Enix creating all of the characters as real-life dolls and then 3D scanning them into the game to capture the look that they want. However, there’s plenty of other modernising touches, from doing away with the tiresome random battles, to full embracing party automation and battle speed settings, and then there’s some parts of the story that are being reconsidered too.</p>
<p>We went hands on with the game last year, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/19/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-preview/">I said in our preview</a>, “Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is shaping up to be another fantastic remake from Square Enix. It’s a bit bewildering just how many different styles and approaches they’ve taken to revisiting their classics, but this takes a wonderful art direction and combines it with a great set of quality-of-life improvements while tweaking it to address the biggest criticisms. All in all, it should be the best way to revisit this adventure when it arrives [in 2026].”</p>
