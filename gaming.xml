The top five are all worth at least $40, with the top three going above $50. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to some other sets, that's all-in-all fairly reasonable... unlike the $500 plus you're looking at for the rarest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-destined-rivals-cards">Destined Rivals singles</a> right now!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While other recent sets have more expensive cards in general amongst their top ten, the special illustration Charizard ex is still among the priciest cards in the recent TCG right now, regularly floating between $170 and $185.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Ivysaur - 167/165</h2><div catalogid="adb6b196-6dcd-4a7e-ab99-4844468d534b" id="223551"><div id="223551" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ivysaur - 167/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Glancing at 151’s full-art holofoil of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ5OY?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ivysaur</a>, it’s not hard to understand why it’s a pricey contender to start off this list. Drawn by Yoriyuki Ikegami, who has been working on the TGC since the Crown Zenith days, this Ivysaur is a beautifully drawn card featuring the Seed Pokémon in a forest, staring into the water and seeing its former self as a Bulbasaur staring into the water.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a vibrant, colourful card with a bit of emotion under the surface. Plus, this is a solid card for gameplay as well. Its 100HP makes it a bit tanky for a Stage 1 card. While it’s three-Energy Vine Whip dealing 80 damage feels standard, Leech Seed being able to heal and pepper damage at the same time is a nice bonus. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Charmeleon - 169/165</h2></div><div catalogid="7c24db06-3ef7-4529-8884-6d778802c567" id="223549"><div id="223549" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Charmeleon - 169/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re back to a Stage 1 illustration rare, but this time of a <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q473ld?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charmeleon</a> drawn by Miki Kudo, a long-time Pokémon TCG artist who’s been around since the 2016 Generations set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When looking at all three full-art versions of the Charmander evolution chain, you can see that Kudo has gone for a mountainous theme, respective to what’s thought of as a Fire Pokémon’s natural habitat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, needing to discard an Energy each time for the already costly Fire Blast may seem cumbersome, but its 90 damage could quickly turn the tide depending on early game situations. That said, it shouldn’t be much trouble anyway if you plan on evolving it quickly. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Bulbasaur - 166/165</h2></div><div catalogid="bed8f282-efd4-4afd-87c6-ac9db6851a4e" id="223550"><div id="223550" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bulbasaur - 166/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of the illustration rares beyond the standard 165 cards in 151, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWYJrA?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur</a> is another Ikegami card that captures what Pokémon fans love about the original Grass starter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While collectors can enjoy its adorable face, sitting under a tree and loving life, also having Leech Seed as an attack with 70HP makes it a pretty reliable Basic Pokémon that can at least take a hit or two at the start of a match. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Alakazam ex - 201/165</h2></div><div catalogid="10253fac-98fb-4225-b3a0-8d6e29fef852" id="223541"><div id="223541" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alakazam ex - 201/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first among the pricey ex cards of 151 is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgj3E?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alakazam ex</a>, who can quickly stack some serious damage, both by using its Mind Jack to take advantage of your opponent’s benched Pokemon, and Dimensional Hand to deal damage from your own Bench. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Drawn by Shinya Komatsu, it wouldn’t be surprising if this Alakazam ex’s design is one of your favourites among 151 like it is mine. Set in the back of a home with potion bottles and books everywhere, testing its psychic abilities with those iconic spoons, it’s a thoughtfully done yet cosy sort of card that shows Komatsu understands Alakazam’s genius and drive to gain the edge in battle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Squirtle - 170/165</h2></div><div catalogid="cac6fcfd-399f-4bf5-81aa-16cdfe3d67fb" id="223540"><div id="223540" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Squirtle - 170/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The illustration rare of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgw7B?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Squirtle</a> is where 151 starts to get pricier, but it’s not hard to understand why when you look at its artwork and who illustrated it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Placing the Tiny Turtle Pokémon in the ocean water at the beach, this Squirtle was drawn by Mitsuhiro Arita, a veteran artist who has been working on Pokémon cards since the TCG’s very inception and has drawn almost 700 of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The risk of its Withdraw attack and the two-Energy cost of a 20-damage Skullbash doesn’t make it the best gameplay-wise. And yet, with the amount of jaw-dropping detail put into Squirtle and the ocean waters themselves, this can more be considered a work of art than a playing card.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Charmander - 168/165</h2></div><div catalogid="b440d385-5030-4d17-9b9e-27c615da2908" id="223539"><div id="223539" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Charmander - 168/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that we’ve reached Kanto’s Fire-type starter, it’s the illustration rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL82wM?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charmander</a> that turns out to be the most valuable among the original three, compared to Squirtle and Bulbasaur. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also illustrated by Miki Kudo, you can see its design is much like Charmeleon’s in a mountainous canyon, but this time at the bottom. The crowning touch for this theme is further down this list, but its duo Fire attacks, one dealing damage and another removing a troublesome Stadium card, this Charmander is a must for any Kanto-based Fire deck when its full evolution chain has been added. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Zapdos ex - 202/165</h2></div><div catalogid="d90cc191-aa00-4caa-900a-660bf81f4aac" id="223538"><div id="223538" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zapdos ex - 202/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Conjured up by the artistic talents of Shiburingaru, who has been of part ot the Pokémon TCG since 2022’s Brilliant Stars, 151’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwOG3?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zapdos ex</a> is stunning, with a majestic illustration featuring the electric bird soaring through the sky with its fellow Legendaries, Moltres &amp; Articuno. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its ability and moveset are nothing to overlook either. Along with Voltaic Float giving it flexibility for an easy retreat, Zapdos’ Multishot Lightning attack gives it the capability to shred through your opponent’s benched Pokémon as well as those active. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Venusaur ex - 198/165</h2></div><div catalogid="9434fc56-5232-437f-b0a8-b70052fba801" id="223537"><div id="223537" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Venusaur ex - 198/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A vivid and colourful card design, even more so than its pre-evolutions, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ5LY?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Venusaur ex</a> looks both peaceful and intimidatingly stoic at the same time. Another card by Yoriuki Ikegami, it’s fitting for the fully evolved Grass-type starter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also like Bulbasaur and Ivysaur, it’s fairly tanky as well with 340HP, paired with it being able to steadily heal your team and inflict Poison plus Confusion to your enemies too. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Blastoise ex - 200/165</h2></div><div catalogid="f195fc8d-ec53-4736-a93b-bcadc97a550e" id="223536"><div id="223536" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Blastoise ex - 200/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The second most expensive card in 151 is this resplendent vibe of a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWYJLA?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blastoise ex</a> card. Another by veteran Mitsuhiro Arita, there are multiple reasons this special underwater-themed card has drawn quite a high price. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as its very pretty illustration facing the final Squirtle evolution underwater, it’s just as Venusaur ex, with the ability to deal more damage. While its HP isn’t as high, its Solid Shell reduces damage, while its Twin Cannon attack can deal up to 280 damage at a time at the cost of two Energy cards, even though you have to discard Energy cards each time you use it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Charizard ex - 199/165</h2></div><div catalogid="c67f18cf-0db2-4d1d-b6be-06f80faf129c" id="223535"><div id="223535" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Charizard ex - 199/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At over $173 in market price in writing, the 199 full-art <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wR0dx?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard ex</a> is both the most expensive in the Pokémon TCG’s 151 set, but also the most exquisite in terms of design. The crowning jewel of Miki Kudo’s illustrations, this Charizard completes the trilogy: starting with Charmander at the bottom of the mountainous canyon, Charmeleon slightly higher up, and Charizard itself soaring above with a fiery volcano in the background. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That, combined with the natural nostalgia for the practically priceless <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/11/pokemon-just-hit-us-in-the-nostagia-with-updated-pokemon-base-set-cards"><u>Charizard from the base set</u></a>, is arguably why this is the most expensive card in 151 by over $100. Although its Brave Wing and Explosive Vortex attacks make it a strong damage-dealer, you might want to keep this one in a special case rather than a tournament deck if you manage to pull one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like in other current sets such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-back-in-stock-amazon-new-updated-2025"><u>Prismatic Evolutions</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-destined-rivals-cards"><u>Destined Rivals</u></a>, and even the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025"><u>upcoming Mega Evolution set</u></a>, 151 has plenty of rare holofoil cards that have driven up a high market price on sites like TCG Player. In this case, though, it’s all of the full-art holofoil editions of Kanto favourites, also known as “illustration rares”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

<p>A fusion of "belt-scroll action and fighting games expertise"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last year, Arc System Works lifted the lid on <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/double_dragon_revive">Double Dragon Revive</a></strong>, but one thing missing at the time was a Nintendo version.</p>
<p>Now, during the company's latest showcase this week, a Switch version has been confirmed for release alongside other versions of the game on <strong>23rd October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This new entry will "revive" this classic beat 'em up series in a new form tailored to modern playstyles. It will also be leveraging Arc System Works' fighting game development experience to deliver a modern beat 'em up "that pursues an exhilarating gameplay feel".</p>
<p>Development producer Tatsunori Ishikawa says the team is pouring its "full effort into development" to ensure the latest entry in this 38-year-old series is released in fighting form.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's been confirmed if you pre-order the game, you'll receive the exclusive classic <strong>Double Dragon Dodgeball</strong>. Pre-orders are also available for this upcoming release in physical and digital form.</p>
<p>Here's some additional PR from Arc System Works official game page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Double Dragon Revive - The Fusion of belt-scroll action and fighting games expertise"</p>
<p>"In Double Dragon Revive, players will find modern belt-scroll action and exhilarating gameplay. Both longtime fans and newcomers to the series will once again be able to experience the action-packed thrills of the Lee Brothers as they face off the powerful foes of their city!</p>
<p>"Players will find the beloved characters from the golden age of arcades recreated in modern 3D graphics with a unique style! Powerful foes from their past return to face off against the Lee brothers. <em>Double Dragon Revive</em> will feature familiar boss characters from earlier entries along with new bosses. Face the intimidating Shadow Warriors all in this brand new style!"</p>

With the recent release of Nintendo Switch 2, many players are jumping into the Nintendo Switch ecosystem for the first time, and there are dozens of amazing games waiting for them. There is no bigger Nintendo franchise than Super Mario, and the Nintendo Switch received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-mario-games-on-nintendo-switch">many of the plumber's best entries to date</a>. Today, you can save on select Mario games like Super Mario Odyssey, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>, and more. It's not every day that Nintendo games go on sale, especially from the Super Mario series, so don't miss your chance to save with these limited summer deals.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Deals on Mario Games for the Switch Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury brought one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/editors-choice/games/wii-u">best Wii U games</a> to Switch, and it's better than ever with a brand-new expansion. The base game has 12 different worlds to explore, with both local and online co-op available for up to four players. New to this version of the game is Bowser's Fury, an entirely unique experience that features 100 different Cat Shines to collect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even at $41.99, Super Mario Odyssey is well worth the price of admission. It's still arguably the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-super-mario-games">best Mario game</a> to date, featuring a giant sandbox to explore, hundreds of collectibles, and an unbelievable soundtrack. For 3D platformer fans, Odyssey is nothing short of a masterpiece, and it's a game you can replay time and time again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> is another game that was given a second life on Nintendo Switch, having first released on Nintendo 3DS in 2013 as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/21/luigis-mansion-dark-moon-review">Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon</a>.

                <p>A really cool parkour game is being delisted from Steam on June 30, but you still have a chance to grab it for dirt cheap. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/supermoves/" data-ref-id="5000-612689">Supermoves: World of Parkour</a> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1959580/Supermoves_World_of_Parkour/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on sale right now for just $0.79</a> ahead of its removal next week.</p><p>Despite being a blast to play, Supermoves has had a bit of a tragic life following its release last year. Based on both critical and Steam review response, Supermoves is a blast, combining Mirror's Edge-inspired freerunning with some cool multiplayer modes. However, the game did not sell particularly well, and developer Makea Games was forced to shut down back in April.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a0SDDAIds" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W9a0SDDAIds" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Tomi Toikka, the founder and former CEO of Makea Games, stated that he has been in negotiations to try to retain control over the Supermoves IP, but to no avail. As he shared in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1959580?emclan=103582791474310960&amp;emgid=803443087671039373" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a final update</a> announcing the delisting, Makea's financing structure apparently prohibits any path for Toikka to keep the game on sale. He wrote, "After shutting down Makea Games, I had hoped I could salvage the game IP to be preserved in another game company, so players could still play the game they own online, and maybe it could see a resurgence in new players one day. But sometimes the cost of doing business is losing something you love."</p><p>As part of the process of removing the game from sale and the restrictions imposed by Makea's liquidation proceedings, Toikka is also shutting down all of Supermoves' multiplayer features. This means that the game can only be played offline, and while there is a single-player mode that will remain fully functional, much of the original game will be rendered unusable.</p><p>Being forced to essentially eliminate a large swath of his own game has, understandably, made Toikka frustrated and upset. "If you care about digital preservation, independent development, or public R&amp;D policy, I hope the fate of Supermoves sparks a wider conversation about how we keep creative work alive, even when the business behind it closes its doors," he wrote. "I'll cherish the time I spent working on the game with the greats at Makea Games forever. I just wish I could have played the game online with my future kids someday."</p><p>If you're interested in checking out the game, grab it as soon as possible, as it'll be gone for good on Monday, June 30. The base game goes for $0.79 right now, and the deluxe edition--which includes some cosmetics as well as a copy of the soundtrack--is available for $2.43.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here at Aftermath, we only pick winners, as evidenced by our decision to become the first video game website ever (to our knowledge) to <a href="https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-mayor-nyc-adrew-cuomo-eric-adams-minecraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endorse a political candidate</a> in newly minted NYC Democratic mayor-in-waiting Zohran Mamdani. The pick was a no-brainer: He speaks his mind, he wants to make the city cheaper, and he <a href="https://x.com/PanasonicDX4500/status/1937982130178691098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probably knows who Sephiroth is</a>. But, contrary to popular belief, he’s not our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/new-york-city-might-get-its-first-gamer-mayor-years-before-winning-the-democratic-primary-11-year-old-zohran-mamdani-had-his-heart-set-on-simcity-3000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>first</em></a><em> </em>gamer mayor. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we relay some unfortunate facts.</p><p>This time around, we celebrate Mamdani’s win by bringing on a whopping TWO guests: First, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxrn.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Max Rivlin-Nadler</a> joins us to talk about how <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hell Gate</a> – a fellow worker-owned publication – punched well above its weight during this election, <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/mayoralforum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">organizing a forum</a> that leading Democratic candidates (excluding Andrew Cuomo) showed up to and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFqqr2hmqZc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosting an election night livestream</a> that aired in bars across the city.&nbsp;</p><p>Then former Kotaku writer turned professional <em>Genshin Impact</em> advocate turned laid off person (hire them!) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/six6jiang.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sisi Jiang</a> comes on to share their experience knocking on over 1,000 doors for the Mamdani campaign – part of a wider canvassing effort that resulted in an unprecedented turnout for a leftist candidate. Lastly, using the <a href="https://x.com/souljagoyteller/status/1937816227692597617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scant information available</a>, we attempt to divine what kind of gamer Mamdani is.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can get Mamdani on the show, or at least pester his people until they let us ask him who he mains in <em>Super Smash Bros</em>.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Some people have been making the assertion that Zohran is going to be our gamer mayor, simply because of his age and because he knows what <em>FIFA </em>is. But I have really bad news: Unfortunately, our first gamer mayor – at least, in terms of policy – is Eric Adams, who did actually invest millions into gaming-related initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>Those include a degree program in game making, regular student <em>Minecraft </em>tournaments that were about combatting climate change, and most recently the NYC Video Game Festival, which took place in May and kicked off the so-called “Summer Of Games,” which encompasses a bunch of events that have happened in previous years, but packages them all together as a New York City initiative. Regrettably, considering his many other sins, Eric Adams has been kinda good on this.</p><p><strong>Sisi:</strong> You know what? This is exactly what gamers deserve. We don’t deserve a good gamer mayor; we deserve Eric Adams, gamer mayor – the same mayor who said random shit like “All my haters are the waiters at my table of success.” That is the most gamer mayor behavior.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> But I don’t think he knows games. If you tried to ask him Mario lore, he’d be like “Well, he’s the king of the Mushroom Kingdom.” He’d know enough culturally to lie about it, but it would all be just slightly off. [You’d have to tell him] “Mario’s not the king of the Mushroom Kingdom. It’s a different guy.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Even just the other day, he <a href="https://aftermath.site/kai-cenat-eric-adams-nyc-fanum-nypd-giveaway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met up with Kai Cenat</a>, one of the most popular streamers on Twitch. When he entered the room, you can hear Eric Adams saying “I just want my video game,” and it’s like, did you think you were gonna get a video game out of meeting with a Twitch streamer? Are you making a joke? The context is not fully there, but it’s a very odd thing for him to say when walking to shake hands with Kai.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’d be funny if he knew who Kefka was, but he doesn’t know who Sephiroth is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-dlc-success-bonus"><h3>Bucking The Industry Trend Of Post-Launch Layoffs, Lies Of P Devs Received $7,500 Bonuses, Switch 2s</h3></a><p>"This bonus payout is both a celebration of that achievement and a significant turning point as the Lies of P franchise progresses to its next stage.”</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/drumeo-youtube-covers"><h3>YouTube Channel Drumeo’s Freestyle Drum Covers Make Me Want To Take My Shirt Off And Yell “Hell Yeah”</h3></a><p>You haven’t lived until you’ve heard this particular cover of Bring Me The Horizon’s “Can You Feel My Heart”

                <p>If you're craving some FPS gaming this summer, you'll want to check out Humble's latest bundle deal, the 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle. The deal lets you grab each mainline entry in the BioShock and Mafia series on PC for just $18. Like other Humble Bundle deals, the company donates a portion of proceeds to charity--in this case, the bundle supports Covenant House, which provides food, shelter, immediate crisis care, and ongoing services to homeless and trafficked young people. You can also adjust the revenue split between Humble, 2K, and Covenant House before checkout.</p><p dir="ltr">Humble's 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle offers a tiered payment option, and the more you pay, the more games you get.</p><p dir="ltr">If you only want the Bioshock series, you can grab the base $10 tier that includes the Remastered Editions of BioShock 1 and 2, alongside the original BioShock Infinite. The enhanced editions of Bioshock 1 and 2 included in this bundle offer improved graphics and UI, with support for up to 4K resolutions. It's also worth noting that the version of Bioshock Infinite included in the bundle does not include the Season Pass DLC content, and must be purchased separately.</p><p dir="ltr">If you pay $18 or more, you'll also unlock the Definitive Edition versions of Mafia, Mafia II, and Mafia III. All three Definitive Editions feature upgraded graphics, as well as all story DLC and additional content from the original versions. Owning all three also unlocks bonus in-game costumes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4522700-4522023-mafia-bioshock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522700" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4522700-4522023-mafia-bioshock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522700"></a><figcaption>Humble's 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4522700-4522023-mafia-bioshock.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While all six games in the bundle are first-person shooters, BioShock and Mafia offer very different gameplay experiences. The BioShock series is a more cramped, atmospheric series set in fantastical alternate-history worlds. The original BioShock was a huge hit when it first released, thanks to its solid gunplay, improvisational combat abilities, and unique, deep-sea steampunk setting of Rapture City. Bioshock 2 returns players to Rapture, and casts them as one of the first game's most intimidating enemies, the Big Daddy. BioShock Infinite breaks away from the underwater adventures of the previous two games and sends players to Columbia, an airborne city of miracles with dark secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">Mafia, on the other hand, are open-world crime thrillers, each of which takes place in a different historical era. The first Mafia game is set during the 1930s in Illinois, Mafia II spans the 1940s and 1950s in New York, and Mafia III takes place in Louisiana during the late 1960s.</p><p dir="ltr">The 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle is available at Humble until July 9.

It also includes some bug fixes, tweaks, and improvements, such as a change to how stamina is consumed while skateboarding.</p><p>The off-road skateboard is added to the inventory on sale at the Shred Shack, where it'll cost you $1,500. While minor in the grand scheme of things, it lets you live out your mountain-boarding dreams. If you're of a certain age, it might even let you reminisce about the mountain-board levels in Rocket Power: Beach Bandits for the PS2.</p><p>This patch also tweaks a couple of other skateboarding-related things. First, the developer notes that it implemented some minor changes for skateboard animations. Second, stamina consumption while on a skateboard has changed from instantaneous to gradual, which will likely smooth out the skateboarding experience.</p><p>Other bug fixes and changes include fixing instances where players could not knock on certain doors, reducing stamina consumption while pushing on a skateboard, and improving some pricing issues. You can read all of the changes in the patch notes below.</p><p>Developer TVGS has recently stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/future-schedule-1-update-content-will-be-decided-by-players/1100-6532269/" data-ref-id="1100-6532269">big content updates will be decided on the basis of player input</a>, and that a first major update is coming soon.</p><h3>Schedule I version 0.3.6f6</h3><h4>Additions</h4><ul><li>Added off-road skateboard</li></ul><h4>Tweaks/Improvements</h4><ul><li>Skateboard stamina consumption is now gradual rather than instant.Tweaked some IK constraints for skateboard animations.</li></ul><h4>Bug fixes</h4><ul><li>Fixed not being able to knock on the door of the tall brick building next to the overpass.</li><li>Fixed not being able to knock on the doors of the blue apartment building.</li><li>Fixed skateboard pushing consuming excessive stamina.</li><li>Fixed mis-indexed loading bays at the docks warehouse.</li><li>Fixed broken font at the French restaurant.</li><li>Fixed customers accepting unpackaged product, even when displayed success chance is 1%.</li><li>Fixed the packaging station Mk2 being slower to use for NPCs compared to Mk1.</li><li>Fixed Salvador coca seed pricing.</li><li>Fixed a networth calculation bug.</li><li>Fixed a random generation bug causing 'Aspen Death' to be a very common output.</li><li>Modified the pawn shop's pricing algorithm to be a bit less predictable.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>One of the best perks of owning a Switch 2 is its exclusive <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/gamecube-games-are-coming-to-switch-2">GameCube library</a> on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. The service launched with three titles, and we’re getting our first new addition in the form of Super Mario Strikers next week.</p><p>Super Mario Strikers originally launched on GameCube in 2005 (making 2025 its 20th anniversary), and is an extreme soccer game starring the cast of the Mushroom Kingdom. The arcade-style sports title sees players executing over-the-top special shots and maneuvers, and features various game modes such as Grudge Match, Cup Battles, and Custom Battles. Like Mario Kart, players can use items such as shells and mushrooms to turn the tide of a match.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It's worth noting that Strikers was one of the confirmed "coming soon" titles shown during the GameCube library announcement trailer. Other titles shown that are slated to arrive in the near future (by Switch Online standards) include Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Chibi-Robo, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Pokémon Colosseum.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers can play Super Mario Strikers when it arrives on July 3. It joins the already available The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur II, and F-Zero GX. You can view the full list of currently available games on the entire Nintendo Switch Online classic games service <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2024/04/24/nintendo-switch-online-every-nes-snes-game-boy-n64-sega-genesis-gba-and-gamecube">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/super-mario-strikers-is-the-next-gamecube-title-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2 will bring new creatures to hunt, new weapons to forge, and new ways to deck out your hunter on Monday, June 30. A presentation during Capcom Spotlight last night detailed what the update has in store, while also teasing what’s to come in the months after.</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, director Yuya Tokuda, and art/executive director Kaname Fujioka revealed that Lagiacrus, a beast that debuted in Monster Hunter 3 Tri and last appeared in Monster Hunter Generations, will make its return in Wilds. You can watch the lengthy presentation at the 24:10 mark.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/omnl-EMxfYE?si=4I9NoMVVRcbwskHM" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As an aquatic creature, his inclusion introduces more underwater portions to the game, as well as exclusive new actions to defend yourself while submerged. Don’t worry, though, you’ll also spend plenty of time on land fighting it. Slaying Lagiacrus rewards new materials to forge themed weapons and armor.&nbsp;</p><p>Lagiacrus won’t be coming alone. Joining it is Seregios, a creature from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate who has been revamped for Wilds. Battling Lagiacrus and Seregios will appear as 8-star tempered monsters that require a minimum Hunting Rank of 31 and completion of the main mission “A World Turned Upside Down.” For Lagiacrus, players must also complete the side mission “Forest Doshaguma.”</p>

<p>In terms of crafting, Title Update 2 also lets players craft the final weapon in a tree to unlock its design as a layered weapon. New photo mode options are on the way, such as brightness settings and filter effects, and the ability to hide their Handler, Palico, and Seikret in the Character Display tab. Players will also have the option to choose which Support Hunters they bring to their party. Finally, the update introduces new paid and free DLC, such as four free dance gestures and the premium Cosmetic DLC Pack 2.</p><p>Looking ahead to the future, Capcom also teased the arrival of Arch-tempered Uth Duna on July 30. This creature will appear as a limited-time event quest and a free challenge quest, available at HR50.</p><p>Before that, on July 23, The Festival of Accord: Flamefete seasonal celebration kicks off. It will feature limited-time Grand Hub decorations, meals, gestures, equipment, and more. The Monster Hunter Rathalos Telecaster guitar created by Fender for the series’ 20th anniversary will also reappear in the game starting on August 27. Lastly, we get a tease for Title Update 3, slated to arrive in September.</p><p>For more on Monster Hunter Wilds, check out our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds/happy-hunting-playground">review</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/27/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-features-returning-beasts-new-cosmetic-options-and]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>If you’re looking for a webcam that works with the Nintendo Switch 2’s new GameChat mode that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/video/685229/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-c-button-mario-kart">lets you video chat with friends and see their faces within games</a>, it looks like the biggest brand in PC accessories is still your best bet.</p></div><p>Logitech is the first webcam maker to confirm to <em>The Verge</em> that the vast majority of its cameras work — all of them, in fact, save for the high-end Logitech Brio 4K.</p><p>“All of our webcams except Brio 4K work out of the box with Switch 2,” Logitech spokesperson Leila Lewis definitively tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>When the Nintendo Switch 2 launched three weeks ago, webcam manufacturers had no idea which cameras would be compatible with the new Switch, and some of the best-reviewed cameras simply didn’t work. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682008/which-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">It was a weird mystery, a wild west</a>, and webcam makers had to figure it out on their own.</p><p>Many didn’t even have a Switch 2 to test with, my sources tell me, and had to compete with consumers to buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">the fastest-selling game console of all time</a>. Nor did Nintendo provide compatibility guidelines, it seems, as manufacturers like Elgato and Ugreen had to reverse-engineer why their seemingly compatible cameras weren’t showing up when they plugged them in.</p><p>But that mystery now seems to be solved — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato">the answers are not what we expected</a>! — and manufacturers are now seemingly free to update any of their firmware-updatable webcams and make them compatible with the new Switch.</p><p>Logitech doesn’t seem to be promising an update for the Brio 4K. “Brio 4K is built with the security features of Windows Hello that are not supported on the Switch 2 anyway,” Lewis tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>But again, all its other webcams reportedly work — which won’t be all that surprising to anyone who’s been following the webcam saga. When Nintendo and webcam makers weren’t originally able to provide lists of working webcams, Redditors <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l5mgn0/tested_usb_cameras_with_switch_2_master_list/">crowdsourced their own list,</a> which includes far more working webcams from Logitech than any other manufacturer.</p><p>A few Redditors say you can even get the Brio 4K working if you want, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1lflhz6/logitech_brio_4k_webcam_working_on_switch_2/">with a firmware downgrade</a>. Do that at your own risk, though.</p><p>So far, Elgato and Ugreen have committed to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato#:~:text=USB%20transfer%20mode-,Ugreen%20says,-its%20CM826%20/%2055512">upgrading specific cameras</a> to work with the Nintendo Switch 2. Obsbot has generically confirmed it will do some sort of firmware updates, and Insta360 is still looking into it. Anker is non-committal.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/694565/logitech-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The video game industry has received a lot of bad news lately: Even at the biggest, most profitable companies, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MDc3Mjc0NiwiZXhwIjoxNzUxMzc3NTQ2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWUQ0VkxEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iMkVuxzB6m6hT_Rpwa-NQCTCvDapSt1DaRfpnGaqUSw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people are getting laid off</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studios are closing</a>, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/wonder-woman-video-game-canceled-gaming-studios-shut-down-1236146772/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and games are being canceled</a>. A small number of massive games — like <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>, which are both games and platforms — take up a lot of attention. It feels hard for any one new video game to succeed, which is why people were so excited to hear not only about the success of Neowiz and Round8 Studio’s <em>Lies of P</em>, but about the way the company was celebrating that success.</p><p>South Korean outlet The Elec <a href="http://.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a story last week</a> saying that Neowiz was marking the launch of its <a href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lies of P</em> DLC <em>Overture</em></a> by giving its employees two weeks of paid time off, Nintendo Switch 2 consoles, and a $7,500 bonus. Round8 Studio head Jason Park confirmed the bonuses to Aftermath, saying that these bonuses are “a special advance payment to celebrate [the] successful launch of the DLC,” but are only one part of the total bonus that employees will receive.&nbsp;</p><p>“The substantial, performance-based incentives will continue to be paid out annually,” Park said. “We base these yearly incentives on our operating profit and distribute them to the development team. We anticipate that early next year, when the 2025 performance incentives are paid, it will be a very exciting and rewarding time for our development team.”</p><p><em>Overture</em> was released on June 6, described by Neowiz as “a dramatic prequel to the acclaimed soulslike action RPG.” Chris Person, <a href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-is-good-overture-annoucement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted <em>Lies of P</em> enjoyer</a>, said in his review of <em>Overture</em> that the DLC is “the best parts of the game executed with confidence.”</p><p>The original game was a success by the typical metrics of sales, with three million copies sold <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/lies-of-p-sales-top-three-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the studio</a>. But Park said that Round8 Studio and Neowiz aren’t necessarily concerned with the sales or revenue of the game as a “primary goal.” Instead, they aim to create games that score above 85 by fans and critics on places like Metacritic or OpenCritic. “We firmly believe that if we focus on crafting games that resonate with and are acclaimed by our fans, sales and revenue will naturally follow,” Park said.&nbsp;</p><p>This was important to how the team approached <em>Overture</em>. “When developing <em>Lies of P: Overture</em>, our focus wasn't on specific sales figures,” Park said. “Instead, we aimed to tell the untold hidden stories from the past for the fans who loved <em>Lies of P</em>, and to provide an enhanced experience that improved upon any aspects that felt lacking in the main game. Ultimately, we believe the development team created a truly satisfying result, and we also achieved our goal critics-wise. This bonus payout is both a celebration of that achievement and a significant turning point as the <em>Lies of P</em> franchise progresses to its next stage.”</p><p>Park acknowledged that the success of <em>Lies of P</em> and the <em>Overture</em> DLC — <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/lies-of-p-overture/critic-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which has an 84 rating on Metacritic</a> and <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/18664/lies-of-p-overture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an 85 rating on OpenCritic</a> — is not the work of “a single director alone.” It’s a team effort, and that’s why the entire team is rewarded in this way.</p><p>“As you know, creating a truly great game isn't possible through the efforts of a single director alone. We believe that a truly excellent game is built through the collective dedication of every developer involved in the project, all striving to make the game experience rich and immersive,” Park said.</p><p>He continued, “Many team members have even said that receiving this kind of support and encouragement from fans was a dream come true for them as developers.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/drumeo-youtube-covers"><h3>YouTube Channel Drumeo’s Freestyle Drum Covers Make Me Want To Take My Shirt Off And Yell “Hell Yeah”</h3></a><p>You haven’t lived until you’ve heard this particular cover of Bring Me The Horizon’s “Can You Feel My Heart”

                <p>Details about new multiplayer modes for the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 may have been inadvertently leaked. One of the companies involved in development on Black Ops 7 accidentally posted information about a developer-only playtest in the Xbox Call of Duty app, potentially giving a glimpse at what players can expect from the next Call of Duty title.</p><p>First <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported</a> by CharlieIntel, someone apparently set a bunch of images and message of the day cards public for an internal playtest that is scheduled for this weekend.

Use your wingsuit to flank and reach objectives before your enemy. The first team to reach the score limit wins." </p><p>The leaked details also revealed a game mode called Overload, which seems to be similar to Halo's old Neutral Assault game mode.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-tested-a-bunch-of-gaming-laptops-and-these-are-the-best.1230561/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Gaming laptops come in various shapes and sizes, though many of the heavy hitters remain thick and beefy machines that maximize cooling to get the most out of their powerful chips. Most are awash in RGB lighting and edgy designs geared towards capital-G Gamers, but there are also thinner, lighter options that are more portable and less showy. </p><p>Our go-to recommendation that checks the boxes for most people is, and has been for a while, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. It’s a gaming laptop that doesn’t forget the “laptop” part. The G14 is a versatile machine for both play and work, and it travels exceptionally well.</p><p>Other great, though pricey, recommendations include the big and heavy Asus ROG Strix Scar and Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, or the Razer Blade 16 for lots of graphics power in a thin and sleek design.</p><p>The most important part of any gaming laptop, just like desktop PCs, is the graphics card. Laptop GPUs can’t stack up to full-size cards that reach much higher wattage in desktops, but that doesn’t stop the likes of Nvidia from making things a little confusing with the naming scheme on its RTX brand of GeForce cards. So keep in mind that, for example, an RTX 5090 laptop card doesn’t come anywhere near the performance of a desktop 5090. Desktops may always win out in raw performance, but gaming laptops are a simpler turnkey solution that can easily go places (yes, even the ones that feel like you’re toting around a cinderblock). </p><p>Even more confusing: the same GPU in one laptop may not perform as well in another if it’s throttled by thermal constraints. We try to test a wide range of gaming laptops, as well as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops">regular laptops</a>, and these are the ones we confidently recommend.</p><div><h2>What we’re looking for</h2><section><p>Our gaming laptop testing involves a mix of synthetic benchmarks and experiential testing (playing a bunch of graphically-intensive games). We run benchmark tests like Geekbench, Cinebench, and 3DMark; as well as in-game ones from titles such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Black Myth: Wukong. We also use the laptops in our day-to-day work to see how they fare with multitasking productivity apps and real-world battery life.</p></section><section><p>A gaming laptop is a pricey purchase, but we want to ensure you’re getting a good, capable machine for the money. If it has a super-high cost, it should offer something special.</p></section><section><p>Some people may be fine with a baseline of 30 frames per second, but we expect a gaming laptop to achieve a smoother 60 fps, or much higher, at high resolutions. </p></section><section><p>The higher the resolution and higher the refresh rate, the better. Games look their best when they’re crisply sharp and buttery smooth, as long as the laptop’s chips are up to the task.</p></section><section><p>Gaming laptops usually range from having a handful of ports to being littered with lots of I/O for external monitors, a mouse, keyboard, and other accessories.

It can be your full-time gaming machine as well as your commuter-friendly everyday laptop. Asus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24155889/razer-blade-14-2024-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-comparison">redesigned it in 2024</a> and toned down its more playful aesthetics for a sleeker, refined look, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338219/blink-and-youll-miss-these-zenbook-duo-and-rog-zephyrus-updates">for 2025</a> it just got a modest chip bump with RTX 50-series graphics and the ability to charge via USB-C on either side (but you still need to use its proprietary charger for max wattage). </p><p>It now starts at $1,799.99 instead of $1,699.99. But you get a little more for your extra money since even the base Zephyrus G14 comes with a lovely, high-res OLED display capable of a 120Hz refresh rate, and it still has a great keyboard and trackpad. Games play well on high settings, though due to the thin chassis, the G14 — and even its 16-inch sibling, the Zephyrus G16 — are known to get a little hot to the touch, and their fans are quite noisy.</p><p>Zephyrus laptops are never going to offer quite the same performance as much thicker models, like the Asus ROG Strix or other chunkers running equivalent GPUs — they just don’t have as much thermal headroom. But if you want a jack-of-all-trades notebook that puts gaming at the forefront, the G14 (or G16, if you want to go bigger and have the budget) is unlikely to steer you wrong.</p><div><p id="u4ab2G"><h2>The most powerful gaming laptop</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->4800</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Top-tier gaming performance in a laptop</li><li>4K Mini LED screen is massive, looks great, and gets very bright</li><li>Mechanical keyboard is loud but feels awesome to type on</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Astronomically expensive</li><li>Battery drains very fast, even during regular tasks</li><li>Fans get loud</li><li>120Hz refresh is half the speed of cheaper laptops with 2.5K OLEDs</li></ul></div></div></div><p><em><em><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>Nvidia Geforce RTX 5080, RTX 5090 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 64GB, 96GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 2TB, 6TB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 18-inch Mini LED 4K (3840 x 2400), 120Hz display, 1,000 nits, 100 percent DCI-P3 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 15.9 x 12.08 x 1.26 inches / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 99.9Whr / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 7.93 pounds</sub></em></em></em></p><p>The MSI Titan is your pick if budget isn’t a concern. It <em>starts</em> at a ridiculous $4,799.99 with Intel’s flagship Core Ultra 9 285HX CPU and Nvidia’s second-highest GPU, the RTX 5080. The RTX 5090 configuration costs $5,799.99 or more with expanded storage and RAM. The Titan pairs these flagship chips with a massive 18-inch 4K / 120Hz Mini LED screen that gets incredibly bright, along with 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD.</p><p>It’s loaded with RGB (including an illuminated haptic trackpad), a mechanical keyboard by SteelSeries, five USB ports (two of which are Thunderbolt 5), and a four-speaker / dual-woofer sound setup. It can tackle most games you throw at it on ultra settings. The screen may not be as fast as other laptops with 2.5K / 240Hz panels, but 4K at 18 inches looks so crisp. You have to pay out the nose for this no-holds-barred experience, but the nearly eight-pound behemoth is about as powerful as laptops get right now.</p><p>In the past, our choice for this tier of laptop was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23840504/asus-rog-strix-scar-x3d-gaming-laptop-price-review">Asus’s ROG Strix Scar 17</a> using one of AMD’s X3D chips. That model was especially unique since it was significantly cheaper (under $4,000). Perhaps the <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/Laptops/Gaming-Series/Raider-GE-Series/msi-Raider-A18-HX-A9WJG-052US">18-inch MSI Raider</a> with the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D and RTX 5090 could sway me away from the Titan, but we’ll have to try it out first. (At $5,099.99, the Raider isn’t exactly a budget pick either.)</p><div><p id="the-best-mid-to-high-tier-gaming-laptops-for-most-people"><h2><strong>The best mid-to-high-tier gaming laptops for most people</strong></h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->3200</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great graphics performance in the latest high-end games</li><li>Lots of ports and easy access to RAM / SSDs</li><li>Animated lid and wraparound RGB are fun</li><li>Very good QHD / 240Hz Mini LED screen</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Typical gaming laptop issues (pricey, hefty, and not great battery life)</li><li>Competition offers OLED screens</li><li>Customizing lid animations is a pain</li></ul></div></div></div><p><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 32GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 2TB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16-inch Mini LED 2560 x 1600, 240Hz display / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 13.94 x 10.55 x 0.9 to 1.21 inches / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 90Whr </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 6.17 pounds</sub></em></p><p>You don’t have to spend Titan money to land somewhere in the ballpark of excellent gaming performance. There are a few great options in the mid-to-high tier of gaming laptops, sporting RTX 5080 graphics (or the RTX 5070 Ti if you need to save a bit more). My top pick is the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16, followed closely by the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->2970</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great performance at 2.5K and even at 4K on an external monitor</li><li>Beautiful OLED screen</li><li>One of the best keyboards in this class of gaming laptops</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>No face or fingerprint unlock</li><li>Numpad makes things slightly cramped, with off-center trackpad</li><li>Lenovo’s apps are slightly more invasive with notifications than others</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-strix-scar-16-16-2-5k-240hz-gaming-laptop-intel-core-ultra-9-hx-32gb-ram-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-2tb-ssd-off-black%2F6632087.p%3FskuId%3D6632087" rel="sponsored">16-inch ROG Strix Scar</a> is decked out with a wraparound RGB light bar that creates a colorful underglow and a dot-matrix LED lid for adorning fun illuminated animations. The Strix Scar’s game performance is exceptional, with its RTX 5080 nearly matching the 5090 in the much thinner <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review">Razer Blade 16</a> — and for $1,200 less.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-pro-series/legion-pro-7i-gen-10-16-inch-intel/len101g0039">Lenovo Legion Pro 7i</a> is a similarly specced 16-incher, offering the same CPU and GPU in a better, metallic build. It’s got its share of RGB lighting, but it’s done a little more tastefully than the Asus. Meanwhile, the Strix Scar’s 2.5K / 240Hz screen is a Mini LED display that’s bright, colorful, and visually pleasing. It matches the resolution and refresh rate of the OLED on Lenovo’s Legion Pro 7i, but the OLED on the Lenovo is even better, with a punchier look.</p><p>It’s a bit of a toss-up between these two: the Lenovo has the better screen and build quality, yet it lacks face or fingerprint unlocking. But the Asus is $200 cheaper, and I prefer the trackpad and better key spacing of its numpad-less design. You can’t go wrong here, so picking one based on small nuances like that or just whatever you can get a deal on is fair. (The Lenovo has dipped to as low as $3,099 at retailers like <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1875949-REG%2Flenovo_83f50052us_16_legion_pro_7.html%2Fspecs" rel="sponsored">B&amp;H Photo</a>, and a savings of $400 is significant.)</p><div><p id="csm3NI"><h2>The best budget gaming laptop</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->850</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Good pricing</li><li>AMD or Intel CPU options</li><li>RTX 4050 is fine for 1080p gaming</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>16:9 aspect ratio is outdated</li><li>Not a ton of ports, and only one of them is USB-C</li></ul></div></div></div><p><em><em><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> AMD Ryzen 7 7445HS, Intel Core i5-13420H / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 512GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 15.6-inch IPS, 1920 x 1080, 144Hz, no touch option / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 14.09 x 10.04 x 0.93 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery</em></sub></strong><em><sub>: 70Wh </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 5.06 pounds</sub></em></em></em></p><p>Our previous pick among budget gaming laptops was the HP Victus 15 with an RTX 3050 GPU, which cost around $800 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23438982/hp-victus-15-gaming-laptop-review-specs-price">in 2022</a> when it wasn’t on a steep sale for less. It had a 60Hz screen and just 8GB of RAM, which feels a little paltry for gaming on Windows 11 in 2025. Now, you can get the same chassis with a 1080p / 144Hz screen, a newer RTX 4050 GPU, and either AMD Ryzen 7 7000-series or Intel 13th-Gen CPU for around $850 to $900.</p><p>Nvidia has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692045/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5050-desktop-laptop-gpu-gddr6-gddr7">recently announced its RTX 5050</a> laptop GPU, which is set to slowly trickle out into new laptops for about $999. We’ll have to see how that stacks up in future testing.</p><p>The Victus isn’t going to wow you with the best screen or highest-quality components for a keyboard or trackpad, but it does emphasize a solid graphics card in an affordable package. It’s the kind of laptop that will excel with live service games like <em>Minecraft</em> or <em>Fortnite</em>, as well as indie titles. Just don’t expect high or ultra settings on the latest AAA games. With the right expectations, a more inexpensive gaming laptop like the Victus can treat you well.</p><div><p id="VRjKsk"><h2>A sleek 16-inch gaming laptop</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->4900</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great fit, finish, and build</li><li>Slim and sleek design for a gaming laptop</li><li>Excellent OLED screen comes standard</li><li>Very good performance, especially in DLSS 4 supported games</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Starts expensive and gets expensive-er</li><li>Middling battery life</li><li>Thinness aside, minimal improvements over last year’s model</li><li>A cheaper 5080 laptop may be money better spent</li><li>The matte black finish smudges easily, and the Razer lid logo is still a little cringe</li></ul></div></div></div><p><em><em><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> AMD Ryzen AI 9 365, Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>Nvidia Geforce RTX 5060, 5070, RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080, RTX 5090 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16GB, 32GB, 64GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 1TB, 2TB, 4TB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16-inch OLED, 2560 x 1600, 240Hz / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 13.98 x 9.86 x 0.59 to 0.69 inches / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery</em></sub></strong><em><sub>: 90Wh / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 4.71 pounds</sub></em></em></em></p><p>The Razer Blade 16 has long been touted as the MacBook Pro for gamers, and after thickening up for a few years, it’s back to an ultra-thin chassis without much compromise to performance. It’s flush with ports, has a great keyboard and massive trackpad, and its AMD chips can be paired with a variety of Nvidia GeForce RTX GPU — ranging from the 5060 for $2,399.99 to the top-tier 5090 for a much steeper $4,499.99.</p><p>The Blade sports a lovely 16-inch OLED display with 2560 x 1600 resolution and 240Hz refresh, even for the entry-level configuration. The look of its stealthy matte black design and green Razer logo may not be to everyone’s liking, but pair that with its thinness, and you’ve got something that can travel and blend in almost anywhere.</p><p>I tested the RTX 5090 version in our review, and while it’s impressive, it can be a little hard to justify spending $4,500 without getting the maximum capabilities of that flagship GPU, since the Blade 16’s thinness throttles the 5090. But it’s such a nice overall package if you want your gaming laptop to do it all. The Blade also comes in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669500/razer-blade-14-gaming-laptop-rtx-5060-5070-specs-price">14-</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675146/razer-blade-18-price-hike-gaming-laptop">18-inch</a> sizes, but I think the 16 is the sweet spot.</p><div><p id="63PrM1"><h2>The best convertible gaming laptop</h2></p></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->2100</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Impressive game performance for an iGPU on a tablet</li><li>Capable 2.5K performance</li><li>Laptop-quality keyboard and trackpad</li><li>Battery can get through a day of work (with no gaming breaks)</li><li>Play games on your lap without heating up your legs</li><li>Excellent kickstand</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Still a pricey, niche device</li><li>Wish the keyboard cover had Bluetooth like the latest Surface Pro</li><li>Power / sleep button is too flush</li><li>No auto-brightness</li><li>Keyboard case sometimes not detected after waking from sleep</li><li>Single-zone keyboard RGB looks basic</li></ul></div></div></div><p><strong><em>CPU</em></strong><em>: AMD Ryzen AI Max 390, Ryzen AI Max Plus 395 / </em><strong><em>GPU</em></strong><em>: Integrated / </em><strong><em>RAM</em></strong><em>: 32GB, 64GB, 128GB / </em><strong><em>Storage</em></strong><em>: 1TB SSD / </em><strong><em>Display</em></strong><em>: 13.4-inch IPS, 2560 x 1600, 180Hz, touchscreen / </em><strong><em>Dimensions</em></strong><em>: 11.81 x 8.03 x 0.51 to 0.59 inches / </em><strong><em>Battery</em></strong><em>: 70Whr </em><strong><em>Weight</em></strong><em>: 2.65 pounds</em></p><p>Asus’s ROG Flow Z13 gaming tablet has always been a niche device, but the latest generation with AMD’s new Strix Halo APU is the best version yet.

Let’s talk about it.</p><h2 id="h39974"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Death Stranding 2</em>?</h2><p><em>Death Stranding 2 </em>is a sprawling open-world action adventure game that sees Sam Bridges make a bunch of cargo deliveries across Australia.

This clocked in about <strong>80 to 120 hours depending on how efficient you are with your cargo deliveries</strong><em>.</em> In <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, you’ll need to maximize your connection ratings for all facilities, and discover some of the secret areas to unlock specific Trophies.

At 35 inches long and 28 inches wide, this very tired Kirby is large enough to serve as a soft floor chair in your game room.</p><p>Given its enormity, Suya Suya Friend Kirby is very expensive at $150. It's also limited edition, as Club Mocchi-Mocchi only made 1,500 of these plushies. Suya Suya Friend Kirby released back in January. As of June 27, it remains in stock for full price and is shipped/sold by Amazon.</p><p>If you want to add a sleepy Kirby to your collection without spending $150, you have several other cute and much smaller options. You can buy the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mocchi-SuyaTM-Sleeping-Friend-Kirby/dp/B0CB47CQ9B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">same design as a 15-inch plush for $35</a>.

You can get Tomy's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TOMY-Nuiguru-Knit-Kirby-Plush/dp/B0DBXH6NKS?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nuiguru Knit 15-inch Sleeping Kirby plush</a> for $40.</p><p>For a Kirby plush that is ready for battle instead of a nap, check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088FYL6TH?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">12-inch Kirby x Link Mega Plush</a>. This one isn't made by Tomy, but it is officially licensed. A crossover with The Legend of Zelda, plush Kirby wields Link's sword and wears his iconic green hat.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-preorder-guide-amazon-exclusive-edition-bonuses-release-date/1100-6532712/">Little Nightmares 3 Amazon-Exclusive Mirror Edition Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legos-first-visual-history-for-adults-is-60-off-in-early-prime-day-deal/1100-6532717/">Lego's First Visual History For Adults Is 60% Off In Early Prime Day Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-earth-dancer-limited-edition-nintendo-switch-2-restock/1100-6526172/">Amazon Restocks Rune Factory: Guardians Of Azuma Earth Dancer Edition</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-four-discontinued-donkey-kong-lego-sets-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6532560/">All Four Discontinued Donkey Kong Lego Sets Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-collector-edition-launch-buying-guide/1100-6530003/">Death Stranding 2 Collector's Edition Is In Stock Ahead Of Tomorrow's Launch</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-preorder-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530595/">Donkey Kong Bananza Game &amp; Amiibo Bundle Available At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Now, the $3 billion startup is setting its sights on the gaming industry.</p></div><p>This week, I was granted access to a new interactive gaming experience that Runway <a href="https://play.runwayml.com/">plans to make available</a> to everyone as soon as next week, according to CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela. The consumer-facing product is currently quite barebones, with a chat interface that supports only text and image generation, but Valenzuela says that generated video games are coming later this year. He says that Runway is also in talks with gaming companies about both using its technology and accessing their datasets for training.</p><p>Based on his recent conversations, Valenzuela believes the gaming industry is in a similar position to Hollywood when it was first introduced to generative AI. There was considerable resistance, but over time, AI has been gradually adopted in more areas of the production process. Valenzuela says Amazon’s recent show, <em>House of David</em>, was made in part with Runway’s technology, and that his company is working with “pretty much every major studio” and “most of the Fortune 100 companies.” </p><p>“If we can help a studio make a movie 40 percent faster, then we’re probably gonna be able to help developers of games make games faster,” he says. “They’re waking up, and they’re moving faster than I would say the studios were moving two years ago.”</p><p>Naturally, I couldn’t let Valenzuela get off our Zoom call without asking him about his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-23/meta-held-deal-talks-with-startup-runway-in-ai-recruiting-push">recent acquisition talks</a> with Zuckerberg: “I think we have more interesting intellectual challenges being independent, and remaining independent for now.” </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/694531/runway-ai-video-games-generate]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fast-fusion-review.1230519/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Following in the jet trail of futuristic racing games like F-Zero and Wipeout, Fast Fusion’s blistering speed has all the hallmarks of what has made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/fast-racing"><u>the Fast series</u></a> so fun since its 2011 debut. Every muscle in my body tensed up as I blazed through its handful of sci-fi courses, boosting my way to the finish line while using the new jumping mechanic to find shortcuts. As one of only a very small handful of current <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review"><u>Nintendo Switch 2</u></a> exclusives, this is a dazzling technical showcase for the power of Nintendo’s newly minted system – but annoying progression choices and minimally inventive changes to a well-worn formula dull some of Fast Fusion’s shine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I had a dollar for every racing series that added the ability to jump as part of its arrival on Switch 2, I’d only be two bucks richer, but it’s still weird that it happened twice. That jump option is also just about the only thing Fast Fusion and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review"><u>Mario Kart World</u></a> have in common: where the latter takes things in a bold new direction with its open world, here developer Shin’en sticks to what it’s done well since Fast Racing League on Wii. There are a few new bells and whistles to mess with as you tear through its fifteen courses ( three of which were added in its first update on June 26), but this flavor of hypersonic speed will largely be very familiar to anyone who has played past entries.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fast Fusion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of F-Zero or Wipeout will also know the drill: Fast Fusion is set in a distant future where the only speed is fast and every road is dangerous. High-tech racing machines careen through obstacle-laden courses at blinding speeds. The Fast series sets itself apart with a unique boost system, where driving over boost pads or through other elements of the course will give you an extra push as long as you switch your vehicle to the corresponding orange or blue color. Making that swap only takes the press of a button and rewards you with a satisfying burst of speed. Fast Fusion knows how good it feels to go faster than the speed of sound, and it leans into it as its highly detailed, staggeringly impressive environments melt into a blur as you carve through them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also collect orbs to fill up an independent boost meter, and switching as you weave between tight turns before boosting through a straightaway to shave nanoseconds off your time adds just enough to focus on without becoming overbearing. But that has always been true of the Fast formula, and Fast Fusion’s jump button breaks from tradition in a smart but ultimately not too impactful way. Shin’en used this change to add more complexity to its courses with alternate paths stacked on top of each other, but I wish the Munich-based studio had leaned into the change even more, as it doesn’t amount to much more than adding small shortcuts and an extra way to dodge some obstacles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are still fun, but I feel like there’s just a bit too much rigidity in how and where you can use the jump to put yourself ahead. It has a ton of range, and you can cover some massive gaps with the right timing, but I never felt rewarded by pushing these mechanics to the absolute limit or mastering them beyond jumping where it felt natural or obvious.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is easily one of the most impressive-looking Switch 2 games available right now.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The mechanical changes from 2017’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review"><u>Fast RMX</u></a> on the original Switch to Fast Fusion mirror the similarly incremental jump in graphical power between these hardware generations, leaning into one or two specific improvements rather than attempting a complete overhaul. This is easily one of the most impressive-looking Switch 2 games available right now, with incredible lighting and gorgeously smooth visuals while playing in 4K docked, but it’s missing some of the initial wow factor that Fast RMX had. Don’t get me wrong, it still looks stunning, but the generational jump just isn’t nearly as exciting or surprising. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, Fast Fusion does at least offer a decent selection of different graphics settings, making it easy to favor framerate, graphical quality, or a balance of both. I usually went for the second-best quality setting that promised 4K output and some high-fidelity lighting while maintaining a consistent 60 frames-per-second, but then opted for a higher framerate choice when playing in splitscreen. I love that Shin’en decided to include this option, really letting me juice my Switch 2 for every last drop of processing power it has.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like Formula 1 or NASCAR, futuristic corporations have a mechanical horse in the race. Instead of racing bounty hunters and samurai clashing on the track, you’re controlling faceless cars made or sponsored by different manufacturers. That sterile, far-flung futuristic vibe has the same somewhat empty, tech-demo-like feeling you see in those videos of Unreal Engine fan mockups where a beloved character runs around a grey box and the comments are begging some publisher to, “Please hire this man.” But Fast Fusion moves so quickly that you hardly have any time to pay attention to those basic-looking spiky balls rolling around the course unless you’re doing your best to steer around them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Separated by standard racing stats like top speed, acceleration, and boost, Fast Fusion’s garage has a great selection of vehicle configurations that cater to tons of different playstyles. Maybe you’ll aim for a high boost stat, which rewards you for precisely switching between blue and orange when driving over boost pads or through color-coded zones. Alternatively, a high acceleration stat makes it easier to get your zero-G legs, allowing you to catch up to the herd more quickly as you contend with Fast Fusion’s somewhat punishing wipeouts. I usually went for a blend of high top speed and boost once I got used to each course, dodging obstacles and nailing hairpin turns while optimizing routes that allowed me to boost as much as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finding that perfect build isn’t easy at first because you start with a paltry three vehicles, and are forced to use the in-game currency won by completing races to expand your stable of zero-gravity racers – and eventually fuse them together. Fusing vehicles results in goofy corporate merger names and better vehicles with improved stats. You’re all but required to unlock higher-grade vehicles and fuse them to compete at the highest speeds and difficulties Fast Fusion will throw at you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each fusion is nebulously graded on a lettering system, which I still haven’t completely deciphered even after a dozen hours of racing. But as far as I can tell, it rewards saving up cash to unlock the most expensive vehicles you can and kit-bashing two high-ticket rides together more than anything else. Frustratingly, fusing racing machines removes the option to use either of the original, pre-fusion vehicles. I get this from a flavor perspective, but it doesn’t make sense within the context of an arcade-y racing game where you want to unlock many different options. Fusing and de-fusing cost in-game currency, making its artificial scarcity all the more annoying; this wouldn’t be as much of a problem if you didn’t also need to use that currency to unlock new cups to compete in. To make things even worse, Fast Fusion forces you to unlock the second, third, and fourth cups in each speed class, which doubles as a difficulty setting. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I understand that Fast Fusion isn’t meant to be as forgiving or easy to pick up as a kart racer; gating higher difficulties behind reaching the winners’ podium in every cup would make sense. But obscuring cups I’ve already completed by making me unlock them at every difficulty – while also making me buy nearly every car and then additionally pay to fuse them into better ones – unnecessarily stalls Fast Fusion’s economy. It’s like putting training wheels on a Harley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Side modes can at least make for fun alternate ways to earn extra cash beyond just repeating the same cup over and over again, like the sudden death-style Hero Mode where your vehicle’s boost and health are linked. That’s neat, but I wish the challenges offered in these other modes had a little bit more going on. Instead, they’re mostly just slight tweaks to a normal race with no change to the courses themselves, which doesn’t alleviate the repetitive grind of unlocking everything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to 2015’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review"><u>Fast Racing Neo</u></a>, Fast Fusion is smaller – but what it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality. Most courses offer clever designs that had me white-knuckling my controller, from a fun series of shortcuts on Yama Crest to dodging tornadoes on Tempesta. This laser-sharp focus on great levels is probably the best and most interesting part of Fast Fusion. Every time I’ve booted it up, I’ve found a new, satisfying way to shave a few seconds off of a lap I thought I’d mastered. Boost orbs make for compelling breadcrumbs in that pursuit, encouraging you to find new ways to approach a turn or hinting at a hidden path or more efficient way to handle an obstacle. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/fast-fusion-review]]></content:encoded>

Many collectors and longtime players have been on the hunt for the hottest printings of their favorite new cards, with some getting up to four versions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/magic/final-fantasy?Language=English&amp;productLineName=magic&amp;q=surge+foil&amp;direct=true&amp;view=grid&amp;ProductTypeName=Cards&amp;page=1&amp;setName=final-fantasy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surge Foils</a>, which appear in other MTG Universes Beyond sets like Fallout and Warhammer 40K, are a unique style of foiling that is significantly <em>prettier </em>than their regular foil counterparts. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL; DR: 10 Most Valuable MTG Final Fantasy Surge Foils</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The market prices for some of these are obviously a little bit insane, but I expect they'll go down a bit once the hype dies down. Though, that could be a while. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, the base printing of Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER is sitting at a <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/630950/magic-final-fantasy-sephiroth-fabled-soldier?Language=English&amp;direct=true&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">market price of $37.76 at TCGPlayer</a>, so if you're looking for a copy for Commander and not trying to break the bank, just stick with the base version - they're the same card at the end of the day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Make sure you know the difference in foiling; I opened a <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/631023/magic-final-fantasy-noctis-prince-of-lucis-borderless?page=1&amp;Language=English" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Noctis, Prince of Lucis</a> borderless foil thinking it was a Surge Foil (they have the same art) and went to sell it at a vendor, only to be disappointed at the $3 offer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in the old days of Magic (like ten years ago), single card prices were based mostly on their age, availability, and playability. For awhile, cards like <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/100191/magic-magic-origins-jace-vryns-prodigy?Language=English&amp;direct=true&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jace, Vryn's Prodigy</a> were $100+ extreme outliers due to its power and prominence in that Standard format. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with Universes Beyond sets, casual Magic fans buying into the game to chase these gorgeous treatments have driven up prices. Jace is now sitting around $4 since it's been a victim of power creep, but I'm not sure these Final Fantasy Surge Foils will follow the same trend. Time will tell. Whatever the case, let's have a look at these money cards. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">10. Emet-Selch, Unsundered</h3><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223655"><div id="223655" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Emet-Selch, Unsundered</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A fan-favorite character from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, Emet-Selch, Unsundered isn't the most powerful from a mechanics perspective, but we can't deny the character appeal. He's currently at a market price of $92.78, with some vendors offering as low as $77.99.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">9. Clive, Ifrit's Dominant</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223654"><div id="223654" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Clive, Ifrit's Dominant</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ben Starr's performance as Clive was one of the best parts of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, and his MTG counterpart captures his essence well. Transforming into Ifrit, Warden of Inferno is a great flavor win. This card is at a $95.38 market price, but you can grab a Japanese version for as low as $60.69.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">8.

I'm also a huge fan of this art, and the dozens (dozens!) of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy VIII</a> fans will scoop this up quick. Grab one at a market price of $97.57 and as low as $81.68.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">7. Aerith Gainsborough</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223652"><div id="223652" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Aerith Gainsborough</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting at a market price of $105.50, Aerith is the perfect example of artificial collector value compared to her playability. I can see this finding a home in some lifegain Commander decks, but not much else, and her design is pretty spot-on to her video game counterpart. Find one as low as $67.34 if you're ok with Japanese. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">6. Tifa Lockhart</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223651"><div id="223651" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tifa Lockhart</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tifa is quickly on her way to becoming a Standard powerhouse. With the right build, she can deal upwards of 300 damage in one turn. She's sitting at a whopping $142.30 market, but can be found as low as $130 for a lightly played copy. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">5. Kefka, Court Mage</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223650"><div id="223650" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kefka, Court Mage</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vi">Final Fantasy VI</a> is my favorite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-games-in-order">Final Fantasy game</a>, so I'm just happy that this guy exists. However, despite the powerful ability, the cost to get him rolling is high even by Commander's standards. Still, the transformed side is a great representation of the game's final boss. He's sitting at $179.54 market price, and can go for as low as $140. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">4. Lightning, Army of One</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223649"><div id="223649" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lightning, Army of One</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we're talkin'. I'm not much of a red or white player, but I can't deny that Lightning, Army of One has the potential to be broken in most formats.

Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223647"><div id="223647" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a card that gets its value through fashion and function. He's one of the most recognizable video game characters of all time, and his card is pretty great to boot. Doing his best <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/34444/magic-worldwake-stoneforge-mystic?Language=English&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stoneforge Mystic</a> impression, Cloud is an auto-include in any white Voltron Commander strategy. The downside is he's worth $387.49 market value, and as "low" as $260 for a Japanese version. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bonus: Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">These ten cards aren't the only Final Fantasy Surge Foils available. You can pick up a handful of other fan-favorite characters for a fraction of the cost compared to cards on this list. I adore Final Fantasy IV as much as I do VI, so I'm happy Cecil and Golbez aren't too pricey. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">1. Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223646"><div id="223646" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, you read that correctly, $718.89 market price. Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER (who is my most recent Commander deck project) has extremely powerful abilities, and is now a game-changer in Pioneer Sacrifice decks.

                <p>Earlier this week, Capcom shared a new preview for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the ninth game in the long-running franchise. According to Capcom, Requiem is already on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-already-has-over-1-million-wishlists/1100-6532670/" data-ref-id="1100-6532670">1 million wish lists across PSN and Steam</a>. But would the number have been that high if Capcom went through with its original plans to make Requiem an online game?</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi shared an online developer diary <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/video.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Capcom's official site</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-reveals-resident-evil-requiem-started-as-an-online-game-but-we-realised-fans-didnt-want-it/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>) and revealed that the game was originally developed as an online title. Nakanishi added that the team came up with "interesting concepts" for the game, but ultimately abandoned their online plans when the team realized that RE fans didn't want it. Instead, Requiem was re-envisioned as a single-player game like its eight predecessors.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Resident Evil Requiem (RE9) - Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Considering the origins of Requiem as an online title, that may explain why it features Grace Ashcroft, the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft from the franchise's first multiplayer game, Resident Evil Outbreak. The story is also picking up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-continues-overarching-narrative-that-began-in-raccoon-city/1100-6532781/" data-ref-id="1100-6532781">the narrative threads from the first three RE games</a> by returning to Raccoon City 30 years after it was bombed to end the zombie infestation. </p><p>During the Capcom Showcase, one of Requiem's devs explained why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-games/1100-6532769/" data-ref-id="1100-6532769">Leon Kennedy is a bad fit for horror games</a> like the current chapter in the franchise. Grace is an FBI agent in the game and she does have some firearm experience, but she's not an action hero like Leon. It's going to be more of a struggle for Grace to survive than it would have been for Leon. </p><p>Resident Evil Requiem will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 27, 2026. That date is just under a month shy of the 30th anniversary of the original Resident Evil game.</p>

The upside of successes with Monster Hunter, Resident Evil, Street Fighter, and Devil May Cry is that the developer is now reviving more legacy franchises for new projects. One such revival is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the upcoming reboot for the samurai action-horror series that made Capcom's first step into the next-gen era of the early 2000s a memorable one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At Summer Game Fest 2025, we got an early look at the first gameplay for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Way of the Sword </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and interviewed game director Satoru Nihei and producer Akihito Kadowaki about their creation, which ended up being one of the most talked about games from the showcase. Seeing the reboot's new combat and visual style in action, we talked about how the latest technology from Capcom was instrumental in bringing the series back to life.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A New Samurai's Destiny">A New Samurai's Destiny</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We started thinking about this new game in 2020, and one of the things that we really wanted was to have a deep focus on more cinematic and satisfying swordplay for the series, and we have better technology to utilize for this modern version of Onimusha," Nihei said. "We also put a lot of effort into the story, the setting, and characters as well—we're building something entirely new for the series."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/mike-bithell-s-journey-from-auteur-to-studio-boss-game-developer-podcast-ep-49" target="_self" data-discover="true">Mike Bithell's journey from Auteur to Studio Boss - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 49</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Onimusha</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was initially conceived as a PlayStation 1 spin-off for the Resident Evil series, aiming to take the survival horror experience to Sengoku-era Japan. It eventually became its own project and went on to become one of Capcom's early technical showpieces for the PS2 in 2001. With its stylish combat, strong environmental design, and realistic facial and performance capture—featuring actor Takeshi Kaneshiro as the protagonist, Samanosuke Akechi—the original game became one of the PS2's early breakout hits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reboot for Onimusha carries a similar promise of a rousing samurai action fantasy boasting impressive character and environmental visuals. Seeing the extended demo at SGF, the project appears to be an worthy showcase for the RE Engine, which has powered recent games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon's Dogma 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the reboot, the story is centered around historical Japanese swordsman Musashi Miyamoto (modeled after late actor Toshiro Mifune with approval from the Mifune estate), who becomes an unwitting owner of the Oni gauntlet that grants him the strength to face off against invading demons and absorb their souls for more power. Armed with his trusty sword, a demonic gauntlet, and a mysterious companion guiding him through Oni-infested Feudal Japan, Miyamoto will take on dangerous monsters and even rival swordsmen who seek to stake claim to a country in chaos.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/recreating-the-freedom-and-fantasy-of-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-4" target="_self" data-discover="true">Recreating Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4's sense of freedom and fantasy</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's an impressive level of detail within the design of the setting evident in the demo, which takes place in a crumbling village before moving towards a castle overrun. The developers at Capcom worked extensively to recreate Feudal Japan, including real-world locations such as Kiyomizu-dera temple—which was crafted from input from local historians.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Nihei, one particular area of focus for building a new Onimusha action game was to convey a sense of realism and cinematic shine. This was present in the original, but the reboot leans into this further, with the protagonist being both a remarkable and emotive swordsman as well as a reluctant hero who navigates encounters with a resolve that's still being hardened.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In terms of the cinematic feel and everything, we put a lot of effort into the facial capture for the characters," said the game director. "We paid a lot of attention to the wrinkles on the faces and different features of these characters, like when they scrunch up their faces and emotive details, [especially] during combat encounters. We really focused on the animation of combat and character expression, and the different types of terrain in the environment that the characters are in."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/after-years-of-preparation-ioi-is-ready-to-apply-its-lethal-learnings-to-007-first-light" target="_self" data-discover="true">Lethal learnings from Hitman prepared IOI for making 007: First Light</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="RE-defining Samurai action-horror">RE-defining Samurai action-horror</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The combat and general structure of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Way of the Sword</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> go for a more story-driven progression, which is an interesting departure from the series' Resident Evil roots. The devs stated that it's essentially a linear experience, but the game will still offer opportunities to explore, interact with townspeople, and take on optional activities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Combat is far more deliberate and methodical with its swordplay than it was in previous series entries. It's less about using combo attacks to whittle down enemy health and more about being efficient, cleaving foes in half with one or two strikes. However, one thing that the developers were clear in stating was that the combat was not inspired by Soulslike games, which have had a significant impact on the action genre over the decade.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We didn't really pay attention to other action games like Dark Souls and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sekiro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> when we were developing our take on an Onimusha game," the director said. "What was most important for us was how we brought the series and its ideas back in a compelling way. What truly makes an Onimusha game, and how can you utilize the latest technology to bring the charm and appeal of the series to modern gamers? Those questions were what was most important for us when we were building the game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The general flow of combat focuses heavily on engaging multiple enemies and anticipating their movements to expose their weaknesses. Parrying enemy attacks will open up their defense, allowing you to launch a counterattack.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever since we learned the Switch 2 would have an LCD screen instead of a fancier OLED panel, discourse around Nintendo’s latest console has often turned sour when it comes to its display. Of course, once folks were able to get the new hardware in their hands, the Switch 2 revealed itself to be packing an impressively bright and vibrant LCD. Those <em>do </em>exist; they’re still not as great as fancy as an OLED, but liquid crystal display tech is still more than capable of meeting and exceeding expectations for producing a quality image in 2025. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But now a new controversy over the Switch 2’s display has emerged, this time wielding scary terms like “ghosting” and “refresh rate,” as critiques spread asserting that fast-paced games look blurry in motion and concerns rise from some arguing that the HDR display packed in with Nintendo’s new hybrid console isn’t <em>really</em> HDR. Are they right? Kind of, yeah! Should you regret your decision to buy a Nintendo Switch 2? Probably not! Let’s talk. </p><h2 id="h191322"><a id=""></a>It’s really all just one picture at a time, but very fast</h2><p>I’m sorry to tell you that video games are an illusion. Mario isn’t actually moving when he jumps. As you probably already know, GPUs crunch out one image at a time and these images, when played very fast, create the illusion of motion. We’re seeing several images of Mario, with each image showing him in a slightly different location. And our screen needs to display those images cleanly, at a rapid, matching pace.</p><p>That’s a very brisk and incomplete explanation of how video games deliver the visuals we know and love, but it’s more or less how it all works. The way the image gets delivered to your eyes relies on coordination between how fast the GPU can pump out images and how often your monitor refreshes, which is measured in Hertz. Should those things be out of sync in some way, you’ll spot some screen tearing, which is when there’s a mismatch between how many images the GPU spits out per second and how many times the monitor refreshes too (in case you didn’t know, all monitors are actually turning on and off at very fast speeds that give the illusion of staying on).</p><p>But we can also measure the refresh rate in milliseconds, and that’s where we can really lock into some specificity and understand what’s going on. The lower the millisecond response time, the cleaner the motion of something moving across the screen looks. Ratchet that response time up and things start to look a little blurry in motion. </p><h2 id="h191323"><a id=""></a>Wait, the Switch 2 has a 120Hz refresh rate. That should be more than enough, right?</h2><p>120Hz is a swell refresh rate for a gaming display. The problem with the Switch 2, however, is that the millisecond response time of its screen is a bit slow compared to those of many other gaming displays on the market. Compounding the problem is that we actually can’t fully test the Switch 2’s screen as efficiently as we can other displays. </p><p>The Switch 2 doesn’t allow for external video input. So, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/nintendo-switch-2-screen-blur-hdr-analysis#&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/nintendo-switch-2-screen-blur-hdr-analysis#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as <em>PC Mag</em>’s Will Greenwald discusses</a></span> in his breakdown of the latest Switch controversy, folks have been taking to measuring how quickly pixels change color on the Switch 2 screen using optical sensors and cameras, among other tools. This is technically not the same thing as measuring the refresh rate as mentioned above, but it does offer insight into how fast the screen performs. </p><p>The results of these tests revealed a 17.1 millisecond response time on the Switch 2 in a best case scenario, and a 33.3 ms response time at worst. As Greenwald mentions, gaming displays should ideally aim for below 10 ms. </p><p>So no, it’s not just in people’s heads. Maybe they’re being picky! But in reality, the Switch 2’s response time isn’t great compared to other gaming displays. Knowing that fact, though, shouldn’t keep you from having fun with your console. </p><h2 id="h191324"><a id=""></a>What about HDR?</h2><p>By 2025, many are likely familiar with what High Dynamic Range is: an expansion of how just how bright or dark a screen can display colors. An HDR display (with a signal to match) looks far more vivid and lifelike than an SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) screen does. And it’s awesome. To my eyes, HDR is more of an upgrade than 4K resolution could’ve ever dreamed of being. </p><p>But comparing the Switch 2’s HDR to a fancier HDR screen is sort of like comparing organic food to certified organic food. Technically speaking, the Switch 2’s brightness range at less than 1,000 nits falls short of what is needed to portray a true HDR image. So it’s got a High<em>er</em> Dynamic Range than SDR, but is arguably <em>not</em> true HDR. </p><h2 id="h191325"><a id=""></a>What are you saying here? Is my Switch 2 just a hunk-a-junk?</h2><p>Yeah, you know what? Nothing’s ever good enough for you. Let’s just burn the whole thing down—<em>sorry</em>, I dunno where that came from. Silly me. </p><p>No, as anyone who’s seen a Switch 2 in person can attest, the screen looks great! Games look bright and colorful as we’d expect them to. Sure, if you have a serious eye for detail and you’re a numbers nerd, you may feel the screen could’ve hit higher benchmarks. And sadly, hooking your Switch 2 up to a better display via the dock doesn’t seem to fix the problem as, according to <em>PC Mag</em>, external display output of the Switch 2 seems to stay true to what its internal screen can display. </p><p>Coming from someone who has formative, joyous memories of <em>GTA IV</em>, <em>Halo 3</em>, <em>Mass Effect</em>, and <em>BioShock</em> from my old Xbox 360 hooked up to an old, tiny, somewhat faulty CRT in the corner of a basement, inferior tech doesn’t always mean an inferior experience. Objectively, the Switch 2’s screen might have some shortcomings, but your experience with it is subjective. So tune all the noise out if it upsets you, enjoy another lap on <em>Mario Kart World</em> and stop thinking about all this ms-time and HDR nonsense.</p><p><br>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-screen-hdr-response-time-1851785261]]></content:encoded>
