<p>The wonders of Paldea</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>You know we're closing in on the end of the month when The Pokémon Company lifts the lid on its next <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Trading Card Game Pocket</a> booster set, and today, we've got just that.</p>
<p>The Paldean Wonder themed booster packs will arrive in the app next week on <strong>26th February</strong> from <strong>1am GMT / 2am CET / 5pm PT (25th)</strong>. As you'd expect from that name, this set is all about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet and Violet</a>'s Gen IX and the Paldea region.</p>
<p>New Sprigatito, Fuecoco and Quaxly cards will be up for grabs, obviously, but the reveal has also given us a first look at a fresh full art Maushold, as well as two new Meowscarada and Gholdengo ex cards. Here's a closer look at a handful of the newbies:</p>


<p>It'll kick off what's likely to be quite a big week for Pokémon news. We're expecting the annual Pokémon Presents presentation on its usual date of 27th February, and with the 30th anniversary taking place this year, our fingers are crossed that it's going to be a big one.</p>

              <p><i><span>Toy Story 5 </span></i><span>is probably right behind </span><i><span>Toy Story 4 </span></i><span>on the list of movie sequels we didn’t need, but the movie’s first trailer feels surprisingly timely and relevant in the age of AI threatening everyone’s jobs because rich people keep insisting it’s the future.</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pixar-best-movies-toy-story-nemo-incredibles-inside-out-1851785148"><span>Pixar’s latest tale of toys and tablets</span></a><span> is coming to theaters on June 19, and picks up with most of Andy’s old toys living with their new owner Bonnie, who was first introduced as a toddler in </span><i><span>Toy Story 3</span></i><span>. She’s a little bit older now and she’s less interested in dolls and action figures than she is in the shiny new tablet her parents bought her. Like all the toys, Lilypad (voiced by </span><i><span>Past Lives </span></i><span>star Greta Lee) is a sentient object in the </span><i><span>Toy Story </span></i><span>universe, and she isn’t holding back about her intentions to replace Bonnie’s obsolete toys as her favorite plaything. A lot of kids are killing time with screens these days, so it’s a good, suitable setup for a </span><i><span>Toy Story </span></i><span>movie in 2026, even if this series should have ended twice already.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The trailer also reveals why Woody, who left the group to be with his long-lost love Bo Peep at the end of </span><i><span>Toy Story 4</span></i><span>, is returning for this outing. He seems to have been in contact with his old friends via a walkie talkie, and when he gets word that big tech is invading the playroom, he returns to try and help. The cowboy toy is starting to show some wear and tear, though, as he now has a bald spot where the brown paint of his “hair” has worn away over time. It’s a good bit.</span></p> <p><span>Check out the trailer below:</span></p>  <p><i><span>Toy Story 5 </span></i><span>isn’t the only Pixar movie coming out this year, as the </span><i><span>Avatar</span></i><span>-esque </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hoppers-trailer-pixar-animation-teaser-inside-out-2-1851786456"><i><span>Hoppers</span></i></a> <span>is coming to theaters on March 6. It is, however, the first in a line of sequels the company has announced, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-incredibles-jack-black-regrets-passing-on-syndrome-villian-role-pixar-2000656750"><i><span>The Incredibles 3</span></i></a><span> and </span><i><span>Coco 2</span></i><span> also in development and just as unnecessary as a fifth </span><i><span>Toy Story</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The voice actor of The Visitor, one of the returning members of The Seven, in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46">Fortnite</a>, has now been confirmed.</p>



<p>Ben Starr, known for voice work in Final Fantasy 16, Hades 2, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, has announced that he is joining Fortnite. In a social media post, he announced he will be voicing The Visitor, revealing he’s excited to bring back a member of The Seven.</p>



<p>“I’m so excited to bring back this iconic member of The Seven. I imagine I’ll be very normal about it,” he wrote on Twitter.</p>



<p>The Seven are slated to return on February 23. News of their return to Fortnite was first announced as part of the Fortnite: Love and Legends roadmap for February 2026. The full roadmap can be seen here.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-most-recent-activity-with-the-seven-in-fortnite">The Most Recent Activity with the Seven in Fortnite</h2>



<p>Most members of The Seven were taken over by The Herald’s Chrome in Chapter 3, Season 4. They were absent from the game for nearly 3 years before the February road map revealed their return. </p>



<p>One of the members of the group, The Order, returned to the game as part of a January 2026 update. Now, at least, it’s known that The Visitor is returning, with Ben Starr providing the voice.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games has cast Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 actor Ben Starr as a key in-game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> character, following in the footsteps of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Brie Larsen and Joel McHale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starr's turn as dashing Clair Obscur hero Verso is arguably his most famous role to date, and earned him a second nomination for best performer at both last year's Game Awards and the forthcoming BAFTA Game Awards. You may also have heard his vocal talents as Clive in Final Fantasy 16 and Prometheus in Hades 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Starr's set to star in Fortnite as The Visitor, one of the game's key NPC characters who will finally rejoin the battle royale mode's storyline (and speak!) later this month. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Visitor is one of Fortnite's heroic Seven, a band of intergalactic heroes who often turn up to save the day during its memorable live events. Indeed, the character of the Visitor was actually the focus of the game's very first live event — 2018's rocket launch — although he has seldom been heard, until now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, players were introduced to more of the Seven, including its lead member The Foundation (played by Johnson), The Scientist (McHale), The Paradigm (Larsen), The Origin (Rahul Kohli), The Imagined (Cherami Leigh) and The Order (Laura Bailey). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After being written out of the game's story in 2022, players were reintroduced to the team following the events of last year's climactic Zero Hour finale, which also featured a recap video setting up Fortnite's current Chapter 7 era — offering a quick reminder of who the Seven were and what they were up against. You can watch that again just above.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’m joining Fortnite as The Visitor.</p><p>I’m so excited to bring back this iconic member of The Seven. I imagine I’ll be very normal about it. <a href="https://t.co/cUNBkr2gWG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/cUNBkr2gWG</a></p></div>— Ben Starr (@The_Ben_Starr) <a href="https://twitter.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/2024515207775633510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, not all of the Seven are still standing, and Starr's incarnation of The Visitor is a different one to the original. In a clever twist, the game's OG mode, which offers Fortnite's original battle royale map, is considered a separate multiversal reality. It's from here that Starr's version of The Visitor will arrive in the coming days — following the OG version of that original rocket event — in order to help save the day and speak for the first time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Fortnite update included datamined dialogue lines where Starr's voice is unmistakable. Long-term Fortnite fans will also be pleased to hear the return of the Seven's AI assistant AMIE, who sounds like she is once again voiced by the prolific voice actress Erica Lindbeck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm joining Fortnite as The Visitor," Starr <a href="https://twitter.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/2024515207775633510" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> today on Twitter/X.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
God of War actor Christopher Judge, the rumbling voice behind beardy Kratos, has suggested more news on the series' future could arrive "late summer".
</p>
<p>
Judge shared the information during a signing session at Canada's Fan Expo, where his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RTJe0WGFuIM">words were captured</a> (it's unclear if was aware he was being recorded) by streamer Fuzhpuzy. In the video, Judge confirmed he won't be lending his vocal talents to Sony Santa Monica's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">recently announced God of War Greek trilogy remakes</a> - Kratos actor TC Carson will return for those, he claimed - but he did tease other news is coming.
</p>
<p>
According to Judge, who has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kratos-is-now-played-by-stargate-sg-1s-christopher-judge">voiced Kratos since 2018's God of War</a>, fans will "be hearing about what we're doing probably late summer", suggesting Sony Santa Monica might be ready to unveil a follow-up to 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> later this year. That, though, is far from a certainty, and it's possible Judge is working  with the studio in another capacity.
</p>
<p>
As yet, the most substantial hint toward Sony Santa Monica's next project emerged last year, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monicas-next-game-is-reportedly-not-a-new-ip-but-it-might-feel-like-one">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier teased</a> the studio's "next big thing" - headed up by long-time God of War director and producer Cory Balrog - won't be a new IP, but "might feel like one".
</p><p>
"Maybe that's why people are confused," Schreier wrote in response to rumours surrounding the studio's next project. "Please don't ask me more questions about this - if I wind up reporting more information at any point in the future it'll be in an article, not on a forum." He also noted "the sci-fi stuff (that people have apparently believed for years now?) is nonsense."
</p>
<p>
Could this be a radical reinvention of the God of War series or something else entirely? If Judge is correct, perhaps we'll learn more later this year. And what about Sony Santa Monica's "new IP", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monica-is-making-its-first-new-ip-in-over-20-years">hinted at by a developer</a> last August?

<p>Well this is a nice surprise! Nintendo popped up out of the blue today to announce <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>. The real treat? It's available <em>right now</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, you can now head over to the eShop and pick up the latest addition to the 'Switch 2 Edition' roster for £54.99 / $64.99 (or £4.19 / $4.99, if you already own it on Switch 1). There's no new content to speak of this time, but you can expect to see things running at a smooth 60fps, with a crisp 4K resolution in docked mode — assuming your TV offers it.</p>
<p>Naturally, you might be wondering what this upgrade looks like compared to the Switch 1 version. Well, wonder no more, because we've got you covered. In the above video, Mr Alex Olney showcases the two versions running side by side for a neat cutscene comparison, before highlighting just how smoothly things perform in open world exploration and combat.</p>
<p>It's a marked improvement, we must admit, even if the 60fps boost has been rumoured for just about as long as the game has been on Switch. Now, if you'll excuse us, we've got some mech exploring (<em>mechsploring?</em>) to do.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-ubisoft-toronto-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>1440694</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>Ubisoft Toronto</strong> team is at the helm of what is arguably one of <strong>Ubisoft's</strong> most significant projects, the long-awaited <strong>Splinter Cell Remake</strong>, and they're also the most recent team to get hit by the <strong>mass layoffs</strong> that Ubisoft has been conducting as part of its recently revealed<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"> "<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>."</a> This is Ubisoft's fourth layoff announcement in 2026.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">MobileSyrup</a>, Ubisoft confirmed the layoffs to Wccftech in a statement that marked this layoff as part of a "<em>final phase</em>" of the company's global cost-saving efforts. The company also confirmed that development of the Splinter Cell Remake continues at the studio, alongside its work on <strong>Rainbow Six</strong> and its co-development projects.</p>



<p>Here's the full statement Ubisoft sent to Wccftech:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Following the&nbsp;recent&nbsp;announcement&nbsp;of the&nbsp;final phase of&nbsp;Ubisoft’s global cost-savings plan and the&nbsp;discontinuation&nbsp;of&nbsp;projects, Ubisoft Toronto will be <strong>reducing its workforce by 40 roles</strong>.</em> <em>This decision was not taken lightly and does not in any way reflect the talent, dedication, or contributions of the individuals affected.&nbsp;Our priority now is to support&nbsp;them&nbsp;through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement&nbsp;assistance.&nbsp;The Toronto studio continues development on the Splinter Cell game and serves as a co-development partner on Rainbow Six, along with supporting additional co-development projects.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Splinter Cell Remake was first confirmed all the way back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-snowdrop-engine-linear-not-open-world/">December 2021</a>, after years of hopes and prayers from fans of the franchise that Ubisoft would one day return to it. While remakes always have the potential to make fans nervous since they're inherently always a bit of an attempt at recapturing lightning in a bottle, the ideal scenario where fans old and new get to enjoy a beloved game that also sparks development on new projects in that series is almost always too tempting to pass up.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-rewritten-updated-story/">But it's been years</a> since we've had any real update on the project's status, and despite rumours that the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-continuing-to-progress-according-to-rumors/">aiming for a 2026 release</a>, the company's recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">organizational restructuring</a> and the fate of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/"> <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong></a> point to Splinter Cell fans having to wait a lot longer for some good Splinter Cell-related news.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this remake doesn't go the way of Sands of Time. The most recent significant update on the project arrived in December 2025, when it was spotted that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-splinter-cell-remake-was-given-back-to-its-original-game-director/"><strong>David Grivel</strong> would be returning to the project as its game director</a>, after he initially left the role shortly after the project's reveal in 2021.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Mod That Makes The Sims 4 Sexy]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/sims-4-wicked-whims-turbo-cc-woohoo/</link>
            <guid>1440682</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Sims can have sex—or, rather, WooHoo—in the shower, a pile of leaves, or under a waterfall. More adventurous Sims can get busy in a cow barn, mausoleum, or dumpster. Then there's the classic option,&nbsp;under the covers in a bed: Two Sims toss the bedsheet over their heads and rustle around for a while, hearts and fireworks flying. After a while, the Sims reemerge, exhausted and fully clothed. (Naked Sims, using the toilet or showering, are censored with an abstract blur.) What makes the animations iconic in The Sims is the clever ways developer Maxis comes up with to keep the act modest—and still under the ESRB's T for Teen rating. But some <em>Sims </em>players want to go under the covers and beyond the blur. The Sims is a life simulator, after all, and realistic sex is part of life. And that's why one particular <em>The Sims 4</em> mod is so enormously popular: Wicked Whims.</p><p>Created by a modder who goes by Turbo, Wicked Whims is nearly 10 years old. It started simple, with nudity and sex. Over the years, it's grown to a massive mod with a bustling community. It's got thousands of sex animations, dynamic nudity with pubic hair that grows, birth control, menstruation, and an in-depth relationship system. Hundreds of thousands of people launch the mod each day, Turbo said.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Electronic Arts</span></figcaption></figure><p>Certainly people use the mod to make porn and get off, but they also use it to explore parts of their sexuality in a safe place, or as a storytelling tool. "I think there's a stereotype assigned to people who use these mods that they're sad, lonely perverts who are deviants in society's eyes," one mod user, Chris, told Aftermath. They turned to the mod because they wanted more than just Sims bopping around under the covers.</p><p>"My enjoyment really came from the full range of sexuality being on display rather than being behind a curtain with a 'WooHoo' label and a wink," Brenna, another Wicked Whims user, said. "I like my weird little queer artist polycule being able to have threesomes autonomously because they're just feeling the vibes. I think it's deeply funny when <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Landgraab_family?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the Landgraabs</u></a> show up at the lounge and end up hooking up in the bathroom."</p><p>Turbo has spent the last 10 years fiddling with <em>The Sims 4</em> and its systems. He said one of the first things he did was figure out how to get Sims to take off a single piece of clothing. A Sim can't just take their shirt off; if you want a new look, you're changing the whole outfit. "How do you even make a Sim just take off their shirt and keep the rest of the outfit the same?" he asked. "It's just not a feature of the game." Eventually, he got it to work.</p><p>Wicked Whims is the X-rated expansion of <em>The Sims 4</em>'s core tenet, which is the freedom to create all sorts of different lives, stripped free from the T for Teen rating. The . Turbo presents a lot of options, and players can pick and choose what they turn on. If you're not interested in your Sims sweating while using a bathroom glory hole, you can turn the sweating option off. (Or, more tamely, choosing whether Sims sweat while exercising.) If you don't want to deal with menstruation, that's something you can switch off, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Menstruation is not a system Turbo himself particularly wanted in <em>The Sims 4</em>, but when someone mentioned it, he realized it was a good idea. He broke it down into parts, both how to implement it technically but also how to make it <em>fun</em> as a feature. "If I can't understand [why a person wants this], then I won't be able to make it," he said. "That aspect of it being interesting is what made me want to work on it."</p><p>You can almost think of the Wicked Whims mod as a sexy framework for <em>The Sims 4</em>. It comes with a ton of stuff embedded as part of the main system, but Turbo also created <a href="https://wicked.cc/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a community marketplace</u></a>—where everything is free—in which other modders can upload compatible animations, translations, clothing, or custom body parts. That's where you can download all sorts of extras created by <em>The Sims 4</em>'s sexiest community: There's dozens of options for blowjobs, handjobs, and footjobs. You want your Sims to fuck a vegetable? Read a book while having their dick sucked? Have sex on nearly every surface imaginable? You'll find that here.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Wicked Whims</span></figcaption></figure><p>Turbo invites creators to upload their work there, and curates the experience as a way to create a safe place to download mods. You won't find anything illegal or, as Turbo put it in the content rules, "highly inappropriate," like mods that includes "animals, any form of underage representation, non-consensual actions, necrophilia, gore, feces, vomit, noticeable physical/psychological harm, or discrimination."</p><p>"You want to have a game that's playful, and you can have fun and have these elements that are sexual to play with rather than create these dark worlds with messed up things. That's the boundaries that you try to balance,” Turbo said.</p><p>A relatively new Wicked Whims user, who goes by azulot online and downloaded the mod within the past year, said she downloaded nearly 3,000 sex animations. "I don't even think I've seen a tenth of it," she said. One of her favorites, she said, is a sex animation that lets two Sims shower together. "That's something I think is so romantic and special," azulot said. "Sometimes my partner and I will have had a rough week and we just shower together before he goes to work. It's not even sexual, it's just a moment we have together. It's special that you can do that in a game. It's something small I wasn't expecting."</p><p>That diversity of options is a key part of why Wicked Whims is so popular. Wicked Whims is what you make of it. For Chris, they were able to experiment fantasies—"it's my own perverted doll house," they said—but also with gender.</p><p>"I love that I can play as a male or female presenting character which is ideal for my genderfluid self to be able to express how I want to look in any way I could imagine," Chris said.</p><p>Wicked Whims lets players center women's pleasure, too—something all media, including video games, hasn't always been comfortable with. Azulot said she's been so involved in her lesbian Sims couple's life that she hasn't seen any heterosexual animations yet. Sex mods and sex in games can get a bad rap for being derogatory towards women, even if that's not always the reality. "It's not something we see a lot of, women being the center of sex but not seen as an object," she said.</p><p>The state of sex in games is made all the more worse, continually pushed to the margins, as adult game creators see their work <a href="https://aftermath.site/itch-io-nsfw-adult-content-remove-payment-processors-collective-shout/"><u>removed from digital marketplaces</u></a>. It's largely because of payment processors lobbying for the removal of content deemed inappropriate; <a href="https://aftermath.site/itch-io-nsfw-adult-content-remove-payment-processors-collective-shout/"><u>they threaten a digital marketplace with cutting off their processing power</u></a>, and a storefront obliges. Turbo said the looming threat of payment processing issues has been around for a long time. "I use Patreon a lot, and Patreon had to fight that a lot as well, and introduce a lot of regulations to, I presume, convince these payment services that they're doing things properly," he said.</p><p>"We need mods and games like this," Chris said. "It's an expression of human desire and a part of being human."</p>

<p>Well, according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1r8c00w/tempered_gogmazios_and_zoh_shia_sw2_version/">Lener30 on Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fans-uncover-strongest-evidence-yet-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), there's a little more than a line of code pointing to a port this time. This time, a "Tutorial image for Local Communication" has apparently been found and (as posted by Universo Nintendo's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necro.universonintendo.com/post/3mf64ozbqes2j">Necro Felipe</a>) that sure isn't Sony or Microsoft hardware:</p>

<p>Pinches of salt and all that — and Capcom is obviously keeping quiet — but assuming it's legit, that's a smoking gun and a half. "Interestingly enough they scrubbed all the text mentions of the NSW2 Version," says Lener30.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> was a big hit on Switch, of course, but if you haven't been keeping track of Monster Hunter happenings outside the realm of Nintendo systems, Wilds launched back in February 2025 and became the fastest-selling game in Capcom's history.</p>
<p>It went down well with critics, too, although not <em>quite</em> as well as 2018's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/monster_hunter_world">World</a>; the latter is sitting on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/monster-hunter-wilds/">"Generally Favourable"</a> 88 on Metacritic versus the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/monster-hunter-world/">"Universal Acclaim"</a> of World's 90.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, we reported that the popular sci-fi action RPG looter-shooter <strong>Warframe</strong> would make its <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-android-mobile-devices-launch-canada-first-digital-extremes/">worldwide debut on <strong>Android</strong> devices on <strong>February 18, 2026,</strong></a> after arriving first in Canada. That was, of course, true at the time. But a last-minute, one-day delay pushed the release back by, well, a day. So as of today, <strong>February 19, 2026,</strong> developer <strong>Digital Extreme's</strong> game is now officially out on Android mobile devices across the globe, and it still has another platform to hit, as it'll be coming to the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>This new version of Warframe almost rounds out the full suite of available platforms, with the Nintendo Switch 2 now being the last major platform that you can't find Warframe on. That said, you can play it on Nintendo Switch; there's just no dedicated Switch 2 version yet.</p>



<p>"<em>To bring the Warframe experience to Android players has been a goal for quite some time in our efforts for total accessibility</em>," added <strong>Sheldon Carter</strong>, president of Digital Extremes, in a press release. "<em>This year is set to be a huge milestone for not only Warframe players, but our developers as well. The team is elated to welcome Android players to the full foid of cross-play platforms this year, including <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 soon</strong>. Warframe has become a gravitational force for gathering some of the kindest and most welcoming communities in gaming. Thanks to them, we've built an amusement park full of rides suited for any kind of taste; there's something for everyone to discover and enjoy here. It's going to be a big year, so come join us for the ride!</em>" </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Players with Android devices that are running 64-bit Android on an ARM64 processor, Android OS 12.0 or higher, with a minimum of 4GB of RAM, will be able to jump into Warframe right away. Those players who download the game ahead of <strong>March 4, 2026,</strong> will also get the <strong>Cumulus Collection</strong>, which includes special weapon and armour cosmetics and resource boosters as part of their welcome to the game.</p>



<p>For more on Warframe, check out our interview with the legendary MMO designer <strong>Jack Emmert</strong>, and see why he points to Warframe as<a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-model-future-western-mmo-jack-emmert-greg-street/"> the model that all MMO developers should look to.</a></p>

He spent six years spearheading buying guides and consumer tech coverage at Digital Trends.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Many modern gamepads have adopted a modular design in recent years, from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717573/turtle-beach-victrix-pro-bfg-reloaded-wireless-modular-controller">Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/857428/hyperkin-gamesir-x5-alteron-clamp-bluetooth-wireless-controller">Hyperkin’s clamp-on X5 Alteron</a> for the Nintendo Switch. However, few of them are quite as innovative as last year’s <strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282953/turtle-beach-may-have-a-better-way-to-swap-your-controllers-analog-sticks-for-more-buttons">Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot</a></strong>, which is now on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJTJDN73/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fturtle-beach-stealth-pivot-wireless-smart-pc-gaming-controller-with-rotating-modules-black%2FJXK5HFZJF7%2Fsku%2F6606997" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for an all-time low of $99.99 ($40 off).</p></div><p>The defining feature of the Stealth Pivot doesn’t lie with its drift-free Hall effects sticks or its built-in social notifications — though, those are nice additions. The controller’s main selling factor is a pair of rotating modules, which, when depressed and swiveled, turn an otherwise traditional button and thumbstick layout into one better fit for tackling retro titles and fighting games. You also get a set of programmable back buttons, adjustable trigger stops for a more customized feel, a 3.5mm jack, and the ability to save up to five distinct profiles on the fly.</p><p>As for compatibility, the Stealth Pivot works wirelessly with PC using the included 2.4GHz wireless transmitter, or via Bluetooth, which also lets you connect it to mobile devices and select smart TVs. Battery life is limited to about 20 hours per charge, though you can also use it with Xbox consoles via a wired connection, making it even more versatile.</p><div><p id="more-ways-to-save-today"><h2>More ways to save today</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24205955/lego-nintendo-super-mario-yoshi-snes-gaming-sdcc">Lego’s Mario and Yoshi set</a></strong> is currently on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYM2V9FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-super-mario-world-mario-38-yoshi-nintendo-figure-71438%2F-%2FA-90573772%2F" rel="sponsored">Target</a> for a $103.99 ($26 off), matching its best price to date. The 15-inch, 1,215-piece kit looks to be a pretty faithful recreation of the 16-bit sprites used in <em>Super Mario World</em>, which, with the help of a hand crank, move to replicate Yoshi’s original running animation. It’s pretty clever, even if the 2D creation will spend most of the time on your shelf with its various mechanisms hidden from view.</span></li><li><span><strong>Bose’s Ultra Open Earbuds</strong>, which are a somewhat hard sell at $299, are a lot more appealing now that they’re on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Immersive-Wireless-OpenAudio-Awareness/dp/B0CPFV77W4/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fbose-ultra-open-ear-true-wireless-open-earbuds-black%2FJ7C5V6T3CX%2Fsku%2F6568949%2F" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for an all-time low of $199.99. The unique open-style earbuds leverage the company’s OpenAudio technology to direct sound toward your ears while keeping your canals unobstructed, allowing them to deftly blend music with your daily life. They’re extremely comfortable and easy to control, too, though the trade-off for total awareness means you’re going to be giving up some of that low-end oomph in the process. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073019/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li><span>If you’re a Pixel phone owner who prioritizes their phone above all else, <strong>Google’s Pixel Flex Fast Charger</strong> is now available from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGNHN2HX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle-pixel-flex-dual-port-67-w-usb-c-wall-charger%2F" rel="sponsored">Verizon</a> for $35.99 ($24 off), its lowest price to date.

              <p><span>Sony and Santa Monica Studio announced a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/original-god-of-war-trilogy-getting-a-full-remake-2000668356"><span>remake of the original </span><i><span>God of War </span></i><span>trilogy</span></a><span> during the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-sony-ps5-god-war-castlevania-kena-castlevania-2000668291"><span>State of Play presentation</span></a><span> last week, and details about the project are still pretty scarce. However, we may have gotten some information from an unlikely source: Christopher Judge, the voice of Kratos. No, not the one who was in the State of Play talking about the remakes, the one who plays the god of war in the series’ more recent, Norse-themed games.</span></p> <p><span>YouTuber Fuzhpuzy posted </span><a href="https://streamable.com/baiuju"><span>a since-deleted video</span></a><span> from Fan Expo Vancouver 2026 in which she approached Judge and asked him a few questions about the upcoming remakes in which, the actor confirmed, he will not be playing Kratos, as original Kratos voice actor T.C. Carson is reprising his role.</span></p>

 <p><span>Judge confirming he won’t be playing Kratos is one thing, but it seems the actor is still privy to some unannounced details about the remake project. He said that the games will include a new “fighting system.” Could this mean that the remakes are leaning into modern </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span>’s heavier combat systems rather than going back to the hack-and-slash mechanics of old? Judge didn’t get any more specific, so </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ps5-remake-trilogy-sex-minigames-censored-2000669769"><span>we can only speculate</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The big reveal here, however, is that Judge says we’ll hear about what he is doing with Santa Monica Studio “late summer,” though he doesn’t say if this is a new </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> game or an unrelated project.</span></p>

 <p><span>While Fuzhpuzy has taken down the video, it has been </span><a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2024350952476856596"><span>shared on social media</span></a><span>. Hopefully Judge doesn’t get into too much trouble over this. Last year, Ubisoft apparently threatened </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed </span></i><span>actor Matt Ryan </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-remaster-matt-ryan-1851787469"><span>with legal action</span></a><span> for discussing the still-unannounced </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag </span></i><span>remake with a fan at a convention.</span></p>

<p>More layoffs have hit the gaming industry.</p>



<p>As first reported by <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">MobileSyrup</a>, Ubisoft has laid off 40 employees at its Toronto studio. The job cuts are reportedly part of larger cost-saving initiatives. Other parts of these initiatives have included the closure of Ubisoft Halifax, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" id="176792">cancellation of multiple projects</a>, and other major restructuring measures.</p>



<p>“This decision was not taken lightly and does not in any way reflect the talent, dedication, or contributions of the individuals affected,” Ubisoft said in a statement before confirming that they would help support these employees through their transition.</p>



<p>Ubisoft also confirmed that the company is still working on the remake of the original Splinter Cell game. The remake was announced in 2021, and no gameplay footage has been revealed yet.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ubisoft is not the only company facing major changes and cuts in 2026. Wildlight Entertainment, makers of Highguard, recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-failed-layoffs/" id="176078">announced mass layoffs</a> less than a month after that game launched.</p>



<p>Riot Games recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">downsized the team</a> developing the 2XKO fighting game. Moonshot Games, the developer of Wildgate, also recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wildgate-developer-moonshot-confirms-layoffs/" id="171549">confirmed several layoffs.</a> GTFO developer 10 Chambers was also hit with a significant restructuring, recently<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gtfo-developer-10-chambers-confirms-mass-layoffs-in-major-restructuring/" id="176851"> confirming a large number of layoffs.</a></p>







<p>The layoffs are not only exclusive to the game development side of the industry. Clickout Media, owner of sites such as The Escapist and Esports Insider, is undergoing mass layoffs amid a pivot to AI-generated content.

<figure data-uuid="ac56ce1c8a42f"><a title="EA Sports FC 26" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac56ce1c8a42f/ea-sports-fc-26.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: EA</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007t9y1">Match of the Day</a> commentator Guy Mowbray has been a staple voice in various football (soccer) games over the years. Having worked on the iconic BBC show for over 20 years, he's become one of the defining voices of the sport for a thousands.</p>
<p>But commentating real football game on live TV is <em>very</em> different to supplying voice lines for a video game franchise like <strong>EA Sports FC</strong>, and in a report from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4g40828ngjo">BBC Sport</a>, it's been revealed that EA uses an AI replica of Mowbray's voice to do some of the work. With Mowbray's permission, of course.</p><div><figure data-videoid="r2Zh6lJRTak" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytr2Zh6lJRTak" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed62bd51nrjgih&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>In the piece, Mowbray — whose first video game commentary can be heard on the UEFA Champions League Season 2001/2002 on PS2 — admits that doing voiceover for EA nowadays is a "never-ending job" as it "constantly needs updating" with new names joining the beautiful game constantly alongside additional game modes and new terms.</p>
<p>"Either recording or doing prep, it is part of my weekly routine - pretty much every week from November all the way through to the start of July", Mowbray says, meaning it takes up a huge chunk of the football season in the UK.</p>
<p>It's not just that Mowbray has to say hundreds of footballer names, however, more that he has to say each of them multiple different times in different styles, pitches, or tones, depending on where they might be on the pitch and what they're doing. With over 20,000 players in the FC, that's a huge ask. Which is where AI comes in, at least to help with some of the player names.</p>
<p>"AI has long been part of our development pipeline - from animation to gameplay systems - and continues to support our teams in making better, more responsive football experiences," EA tells the BBC, reiterating that the human touch is necessary for the experience: "...when it comes to commentary and content, it's always a collaboration with our talent - not a replacement."</p>

<p>Mowbray collaborates with EA on this, and advised that the commentary "has got to be at different levels depending where he is on the pitch, as I would do when commentating normally."</p>
<p>"It can't be scripted for me because it has got to be in my style and how I would say it in real life, so I have to think of those lines myself. It's the same for Sue [Smith] on co-comms — she will need 10 different ways of adding insight or colour too."</p>
<p>So it's a very in-depth process, but it's not clear whether EA uses AI for commentators other than Mowbray. We've reached out to EA for clarification on this.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a number of concerns about AI use around actors and voice actors in particular, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/bayonetta-star-jennifer-hale-on-the-sag-aftra-strikes-ai-is-coming-for-us-all">Mass Effect star Jennifer Hale speaking out about the issue back in 2024</a>, and a number of strikes held by voice acting unions over the years.</p>

			<p>For a good while now, the gaming industry has been grappling with the controversial integration of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">generative Artificial Intelligence</strong> in game development, with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-is-pushing-hard-for-ai-in-game-development-planning-to-let-it-handle-70-of-qa-by-2027/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">more and more studios and publishers</strong></a> implementing it in a variety of ways.

<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Howard</strong> likened the development process to that of a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"craftsman,"</strong> arguing that the human touch is what ultimately makes a project special.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s mid-expansion update<em> Shadow and Order</em> has been delayed by three months after weeks of silence leading up to its originally planned March 3 launch. Bungie blames the wait on “large revisions” to address months of player complaints but it puts the loot shooter in an even worse position after an already terrible year.</p> <p><em>Destiny 2</em> players are the fans who cried wolf. They’re always sounding the alarm even when things are going relatively well. But trust me when I say things have never been this bleak in the history of the soon-to-be 12-year-old sci-fi MMO. Its concurrent PC player count is at an all-time low. Last December’s <em>Star Wars Renegades</em> expansion was a neat story campaign but did little to fundamentally patch up the broader game’s crumbling framework. And a long-promised roadmap of the game’s future has been MIA for months.</p>

 <p>Normally, a message from Bungie going, “Hey, we get it, we’re working on fixing things, it’s just going to take some extra time” would be the kind of thing that soothes some of the panic. Instead, <em>Shadow and Order</em>‘s February 18 delay announcement has only made everyone even more worried. “Our next Major Update, <em>Destiny 2: Shadow and Order</em>, is undergoing large revisions and will be delayed,” it read. “This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will also be renamed.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our next Major Update, Destiny 2: Shadow and Order, is undergoing large revisions and will be delayed. </p> <p>This update is being changed and expanded to include sizable quality-of-life updates and as a result, will also be renamed. This update will now launch on June 9, 2026. We…</p> <p>— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/2024242522004836464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Bungie continued, “This update will now launch on June 9, 2026. We will provide exact details closer to release covering previously announced Weapon Tier Upgrading, but also additions like expanding Tiered Gear to all Raid and Dungeon activities, Pantheon 2.0, Tier 5 stats for Exotic Armors, and more. Through June, we will continue to have routine bug fixes and stability improvements, continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games (March), and the return of a more frequent Iron Banner cadence (April).”</p>

 <p>This will be Greek to most folks, including any lapsed <em>Destiny 2</em> fans that have been out of the loop for the last year, but it essentially suggests the studio is trying to overhaul some of the main loot chase complaints players have had since the current Year of Prophecy launched last July. We don’t get a clear idea of how that progression will be fixed, however, or a sense that Bungie itself knows yet.</p>

 <p>The normal thing for Bungie to do right now would be a developer diary that lays out the team’s evolving design philosophy and explains what the next three months will be spent fixing. Instead, the announcement reads like a grudging, last-minute “the dog ate my homework” acknowledgement following weeks of fans begging for an update. Bungie actually deleted a weekly reset post recently because so many fans were dunking on it.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cannot apologize enough for the delay here. Team's still jamming. Hope to have some comms out soon.</p> <p>Please continue to yell at me directly, and I say this without any sarcasm.</p> <p>They're focused on our immediate and long term future.</p> <p>I am happy to take 100% of the blame here in…</p> <p>— dmg04 (@A_dmg04) <a href="https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1985744704886227117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Some have wondered if Bungie is essentially trying to shift the spotlight from <em>Destiny 2</em>, its troubled but already long-established multiplayer hit, to the upcoming launch of <em>Marathon</em>, its first new shooter in over a decade. This way, the bad vibes surrounding the former don’t start contaminating the glowing potential of the latter. Maybe Bungie even hopes more <em>Destiny 2</em> players will give <em>Marathon</em> a shot now that they have nothing new to play for the next three months.</p>

 <p>Maybe, possibly, who knows? Either way, that only buys<em> Destiny 2</em> a little more time before it has to come out and impress players with&nbsp;<em>something</em>. June would normally be the time frame for fans to get excited for the next annual expansion rather than dreading a potential “too little, too late” approach to last year’s leftovers. The fact that the game’s current existential crisis has some players once again wishing for <em>Destiny 3</em> while others go back and re-grind through <em>Destiny 1</em>&nbsp;tells you how cooked things are right now.</p> <p>It doesn’t feel like there’s enough gas left in the tank to reignite the engine, and Bungie not coming out and confidently saying there is only adds to the doomerism.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[What Is The Prototype In Poppy Playtime Chapter 5?]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There aren’t many games out there with a more horrifying story than Poppy Playtime: orphans taken in only to be experimented on and converted into horrifying, life-sized toys. It’s enough to make anyone’s skin crawl, but there’s one that stands out from the rest—the Prototype.</p>



<p>Forget Huggy Wuggy and his grizzly smile, or Catnap’s hauntingly vacant eyes, it’s the Prototype that’s the real monstrosity. Although he’s long been teased throughout the previous chapters, he’s finally had his big reveal in Chapter 5, and it was well worth the wait. </p>







<p>But it wasn’t just his appearance that was shown off, as some significant lore was dropped, and it’s something every fan needs to know. If you’re interested, read on, but be warned! There are plenty of spoilers ahead for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-prototype-look-like-in-poppy-playtime">What Does The Prototype Look Like In Poppy Playtime?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sorry Huggy! Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>After years of waiting, the Prototype has finally been revealed in Poppy Playtime Chapter 5, and he’s as monstrous as you could ever imagine. </strong></p>



<p>The Prototype is a towering mechanical-organic monstrosity with a cracked porcelain jester face locked in a wide grin. Its thin torso reveals a faintly glowing core, while long skeletal arms end in sharp, needled fingers. Below the waist, its body fuses into a spider-like machine built from factory scrap, giving it multiple jointed metal legs and an unsettling, towering presence.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/did-huggy-wuggy-or-kissy-missy-die-in-poppy-playtime-chapter-5/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/did-huggy-wuggy-or-kissy-missy-die-in-poppy-playtime-chapter-5/">Did Huggy Wuggy Or Kissy Missy Die In Poppy Playtime Chapter 5?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>What makes the creature especially disturbing is how it upgrades itself by scavenging the remains of other toys. Embedded into its frame are salvaged parts like the arms of Mommy Long Legs, Kissy Missy, and Huggy Wuggy, along with a purple fur hide, red gas canisters, and the emitter taken from CatNap.</p>







<p>All in all, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the Prototype is a menacing villain, but it’s the creature’s origin that’s somehow even more haunting…</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-the-prototype-in-poppy-playtime">Who Is The Prototype In Poppy Playtime? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t hold her too tight, she might crack… Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s revealed in Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 that the Prototype is actually Experiment 1006, with the human identity of Oliver Ludwig, son of Elliot Ludwig and (likely adopted) brother to Poppy Ludwig, who was the inspiration for the Poppy Playtime dolls.</strong></p>



<p>It would explain why the Prototype is seemingly protective of Poppy, and he even appears confused and distraught when he cracks her porcelain head at Lily Longbraids’ tea party, as if it were an accident. </p>

</ul>



<p>Of course, there’s still confusion surrounding what the Prototype wants, but it could explain why they presented themselves to the protagonist as a child named Ollie in Chapter 3—maybe it wasn’t entirely fake after all, and there’s still some remnant of Oliver inside the Prototype?</p>



<p>That’s for the theorists amongst you to decide, although more is bound to be unveiled in what will eventually be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-the-final-chapter-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-the-final-chapter-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 6 of Poppy Playtime</a>. Until then, there’s plenty of room to speculate—that’s most of the fun, right?</p>
