			<p>When a developer chooses to take a long-running franchise and change its gameplay formula, it is a high-risk, high-reward situation. Taking Pac-Man and deciding to create a Metroidvania using the character is the risk Bandai Namco has taken to celebrate 45 years of the icon. Has that high risk come to fruition in Shadow Labyrinth? The answer is no.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadow Labyrinth - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j_KKX42-m5U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Shadow Labyrinth starts off with a huge opening action scene with a galactic war taking place, and ships being ripped apart. The outcome of this leaves Puck (So named because Pac-Man’s original name was Puck-Man), trapped on the planet of its enemy. To complete its mission, Puck summons your character Swordsman No.8 to assist in fighting the enemies and navigating this world to complete its objective. It is a pretty interesting premise, casting Pac-Man as a kind of military intelligence and it provides a good reason to fight enemies, and introduce characters from other Bandai Namco series to develop a shared universe.</p>


<p>As Swordsman No.8 you have, as expected, a sword to fight enemies by putting together combos and abilities. You also have access to a mech known as GAIA who can be summoned for brief spells to clear enemies or deal damage to bosses when you get into a tight spot. Things start off well enough as you get used to the combat, and when you are used to the way to fight you are left waiting to gain new perks and abilities. The progression system is nearly unforgivably slow, with Shadow Labyrinth holding back any interesting new abilities for hours between them.</p>


<p>This means combat become stale fast. You do have the option to level up your sword and ESP bar to make them stronger/last longer, and it helps to make progress through the world. However, using the same attack over and over without having to really change things up is boring. As you venture through the different areas you do come across various enemy types but, aside from a select few and the bosses, you quickly realise these new enemies are reskins of enemies from the first area down to movement and attacks. Not only does combat become stale, so do the enemies.</p>
<p>As a Metroidvania, Shadow Labyrinth needs to have a map worth exploring and the platforming to make that enjoyable. &nbsp;The layout of the map in Shadow Labyrinth is odd, with paths that lead to huge, empty areas in which there is nothing, and looping paths that don’t add anything to the experience. The opening areas look decent but eventually each area kind of blends together, with uninspired artistic design for the backgrounds.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the platforming is fine when you are No.8 but there are moments where you are going along the rails as Puck. You can choose to move manually or let Puck ride the rails autonomously, and you can attack with a spinning blade attack which helps clear enemies out of the way, but the jumping when on the rails leaves a lot to be desired, proving to be unnecessarily fiddly, often not panning out how you wanted it to. That’s okay in areas where you have time, but there are sections which are timed including the Maze stages, which are more like classic Pac-Man with lots of twists put in. They require absolute precision to complete and a couple of mistakes can lead to running out of time or lives.</p>
<p>You will make mistakes which will lead to No 8 dying, and when this happens you have the option to start from a save point or checkpoint. Save points can be considered checkpoints, but the reverse is not true. When you are at a save point you can spend oras to upgrade No.8’s skills and equip different perks, provided you have bought some from a shop, travel to different save points, and refill your health. Checkpoints are limited and will refill your health to what you had when you activated, but you can only transport to other save points, not checkpoints, and that’s it.</p>

<p>These checkpoints don’t let you upgrade equipment. It is such an annoying system especially since save points and checkpoints are so frugally placed around that if you die you could be sent back pretty far from where you fell. When you progress through levels you will eventually open up shortcuts to reduce the travel time, but even so the sparse save points and checkpoints feed into feeling like progress is slow.</p>
<p>The story of Shadow Labyrinth is not that interesting even with Bandai Namco using other properties to expand it, and make this a cross universe plot. Puck is not a likeable character, coming across as cold and calculating. No.8 is a silent character so you are looking to the side characters to provide some personality to the game, which they do, but you see them so rarely that they don’t have much chance to shine.</p>

<p>Return of the Kong</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last week Donkey Kong returned to the world of 3D platforming over 25 years since his last fully-3D outing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">DK64</a> - and what a return it was!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> scored an 'Excellent' 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Jim's review</a>, and most of Team NL has spent this weekend having a smashing time catching up with DK, Diddy, Dixie, and (Void) co. in what Jimbo described as "an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK, and arguably the Switch 2's first absolute must-play."</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184766 @ 1753097646 -->
<p>At the time of writing, the game is enjoying "Universal Acclaim" with a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/donkey-kong-bananza/">Metascore of 90</a>, but now everyone has had their chance to go bananas with it, we're wondering if you concur. How would you rate DKB?</p>
<p>While many of you might have blasted through the entire game over the weekend, if you're anything like us your minecart will have gotten derailed by the countless distractions and doohickeys away from the critical path. If you haven't finished the game, no sweat - voting in the poll below doesn't mean your score has to stay the same.</p>
<p>Yes, you can come back at any time to either change your score or add one when you've settled on a rating from 1-10. If you've already rated the game in our database, thank you kindly - your score already counts! If not, feel free to drop your mark below and let's find out how Bananza measures up to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-donkey-kong-games-of-all-time">DK's big bunch of other games</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Nintendo Switch 2 Fire Emblem Game May Be In Development – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ninetndo-switch-2-fire-emblem-development/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-nintendo-switch-2-fire-emblem-game-may-be-in-development-%E2%80%93-rumor.1248666/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new entry in the Fire Emblem series may be in the works for Nintendo Switch 2, judging from a recent online discovery.</p>



<p>As spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAPgmb2p7L8">Doctre81</a>, a veteran Japanese 3D character modeler who has worked with Square Enix, SEGA, and Cygames, among other publishers, revealed on LinkedIn that they have worked from January 2025 until April 2025 on the "sequel of Nintendo's SRPG (tactical role-playing game) on Switch 2". While the 3D character modeler hasn't mentioned the name of the game, or the series it belongs to, there's a very good chance this sequel is a new entry in the Fire Emblem series, as the other notable tactical role-playing series by the Japanese company, Advance Wars, hasn't seen a new entry in a very long time, and it may not be as popular nowadays as to warrant a sequel, considering how Advance Wars 1+2: Re‑Boot Camp did not set the sales charts on fire. The fact that the 3D character modeler only worked for a few months in the game may also suggest this isn't a new entry in the series, but possibly a Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade for one of the Fire Emblem games released on the original Switch.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Is this sequel a new Fire Emblem game for Nintendo Switch 2?</figcaption></figure>



<p>It has been some time since we saw a new entry in the Fire Emblem series, so a new game launching on Nintendo Switch 2 would make many fans quite happy, especially those who didn't exactly like the latest entry in the franchise, Fire Emblem Engage. The game launched in 2023 features very solid gameplay, bringing back some classic mechanics, but its mixed bag of character designs, disappointing storyline, and trite social elements left something to be desired. You can learn more about the game by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fire-emblem-engage/">review.</a></p>

Also, people were noticeably getting tired of Ubisoft’s repetitive formula across all its games, and <em>Outlaws</em> took the brunt of this. It was a whole bunch of stuff, but the game’s own failings were a significant part of it. What no one at all was saying was, “It’s because <em>Book of Boba Fett</em> wasn’t that great of a movie.”</p><p>During the shareholder meeting, someone in the audience stood up to ask an interminable barrage of questions, during which he asked&nbsp;of <em>Outlaws</em>, “What have you learned from the failure in terms of sales? Have you learned anything in terms of pricing, in terms of marketing?”</p><p> Guillemot replied, “We didn’t reach our sales targets. The game suffered from a number of items.” The first of these he listed was that “the brand that it belonged to was in a bit of choppy waters,” stopping before explaining exactly what he meant by that. He then added that “the game still had a few items that needed to be polished,” rapidly adding that they received polish in the early weeks of release, but saying that it “did affect sales volumes.” Guillemot then described the upcoming Switch 2 port as “a new version of the game.”</p><p>His underplaying of the bugginess of the game, dropped in as an afterthought after attempting to throw the entirety of <em>Star Wars</em> under the bus, is just odd!

While the movies had gone quiet since 2021, the TV series were otherwise flying high, with <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em>, <em>Ahsoka</em>, and of course the beloved <em>Andor</em> proving critical successes. And if the entire franchise is to blame, then why didn’t this affect EA’s 2023 title&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>? EA CEO Andrew Wilson described that game’s sales as “strongly” beating expectations, saying that EA was “overjoyed” with its performance. </p><p>Anyway, shareholders and stock values are the antithesis of creative pursuits, and <em>Outlaws</em> was a fine game released into a broken industry where only astonishing success is acceptable.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-ceo-shareholders-choppy-1851786615]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1946977090487923167">The Game Business' Chris Dring</a>, physical sales for DK's latest outing were three times that of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze on the original Switch. Dring also noted that Donkey Kong Bananza sold half of what Super Mario Odyssey did on its launch, but it is worth bearing in mind that when Odyssey released in 2017, the Switch had already been available for a little while. Additionally, Odyssey came out in October rather than July, when game sales are typically less ardent.</p>
<p>While digital sales are generally on the rise, and of course many such as myself will have purchased Bananza this way, <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1947064492627546281">Dring added many Nintendo owners still prefer physical media</a>. </p>
<p>"A brilliant core mechanic and clever design twists make Bananza a delightfully sticky 3D platform adventure topped off with a sweet central character relationship," our Alex wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Eurogamer's Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>, awarding Nintendo's newest Switch 2 release four stars.</p>

		<p>I’ve spent the last half dozen laps slowly closing up to the back of the Corvette in front of me, when suddenly the screen in my car lights up with the words ‘BLUE LMP1’ encased in blue. What comes next is minutes and laps of Hypercar prototypes zooming up to fill the mirrors of my GT3, the rules of World Endurance Championship dictating that I mustn’t hold them up for too long, but equally that they and their much faster vehicles have to choose a time to pass me safely. It’s edge-of-your-seat stuff, constantly having to shift my focus back and forth, and hoping that the Corvette loses a bit more time than I do. Once the last of the Hypercars as past, it’s back to the task at hand of closing up and resuming my fight for 14th place in class.</p>
<p>And then I lose concentration, get a bit too greedy on the throttle and spin out.</p>
<p><iframe title="It’s time, Le Mans Ultimate V1.0 is nearly here!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5-RdfpV1RfY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Endurance racing is a very particular kind of motorsports, and it’s one that I love. Where Formula 1 has to force its teams to make even a single pit stop in the name of minimal racing variety, the various endurance racing championships last anywhere from 3 hours to 24 hours, encompassing multiple pit stops, driver changes and often having multiple categories and classes of vehicle and competitor. We’re decades removed from the most romanticised eras of Le Mans, with modern technology, analytics and (obviously very necessary) safety considerations changing the tone of a 24 hours race – not to mention the increasingly controversial Balance of Performance adjustments adding some artifice to the results – but there’s still that thrill of watching two or three races happening all at once, seeing hours-longs strategies play out, and being able to go to bed and still have the race going on when you get up for breakfast.</p>
<p>Le Mans Ultimate is a fantastic ode to the World Endurance Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans in particular. Having been in Steam Early Access since last year, hitting v1.0 is a major milestone that sees the game and the built up collection of free and paid DLC able to fully replicate the current 2025 season, right down to track-specific liveries that some cars ran at the 6 Hours of São Paulo eight days ago.</p>

<p>If viewed as a more focussed successor to rFactor 2, having the full 2025 seasons available makes the v1.0 label feel appropriate, but from a broader gaming audience, it’s also clear that work is far from finished for Le Mans Ultimate. The European Le Mans Series (ELMS) is still in the works with a trio of additional tracks that this competition races at, updated LMP2 liveries, teams and specs, and the introduction of the LMP3 class. But there’s also the fact that a career mode is not expected until early 2026. Right now, Le Mans Ultimate is all about playing individual race weekends, heading online, and the baton-passing co-op mode. There’s not even a basic championship mode.</p>

<p>While you can of course play Le Mans Ultimate with a controller hooked up to a gaming laptop and peer at a 15″ screen, it scales up to full-throated esports set ups with high-end racing wheels and multi-screen views. There’s also full support for VR gaming, and since it’s been a while, I decided to dust off my PSVR 2 and its PC adapter to pretend like I’m one of those billionaire or film star gentlemen drivers.</p>
<p>This took a couple hours out of my life to actually set up. AMD’s drivers have introduced a SteamVR-breaking bug since the start of 2025 which is yet to be fixed, and which took far too long to diagnose through unhelpful error messages before I reverted older drivers. Then there’s the fuss of configuring a racing wheel on PC, and while Le Mans Ultimate recognised the ageing Fanatec CSL Elite I’m using just fine, manually configuring the buttons on the McLaren GT3 wheel was a chore of trial and error to figure out which buttons are numbered what way. It really is high time that everyone comes together to make this better somehow. Oh, and all of this needs me to use a mouse anyway, because the menus don’t recognise the wheel’s directional toggle. Thankfully the racing itself is far, far more immersive.</p>
<p>My first experience, quite foolishly, was to step into one of the Hypercars and join an organised reviewer online lobby just moments after finally getting everything set up and working. After struggling with the Alpine A424 for half a lap of Circuit de la Sarthe, I humbly dipped into the settings and stepped the assists preset down a notch to give myself ABS and other helpers while getting used to the game. It’s as granular as having the game hold brakes and clutch for you until an input is detected, can manage pit lane procedure, and more.</p>

<p>A much, much better way to actually start off (as in real motorsports) is with the LMGT3 class and offline. These cars all come with ABS as part of the spec, immediately making braking and cornering much easier to grasp for newcomers. It’s immediately enjoyable while getting up to speed and getting rid of some rust from not playing racing games for a while, and made stepping back up to Hypercars with the roaring V12 of the Aston Martin Valkyrie feel more manageable. Racing LMGT3 also immerses you within that multi-class racing style by, as mentioned above, having to deal with the full pack of Hypercar class rampaging through your race every few laps –&nbsp;the AI is good on the whole, if a bit too bullish, though that’s true of real drivers too!</p>
<p>There’s plenty to learn and adapt to within Le Mans Ultimate’s recreation of the WEC. Race starts have all the cars lined up at the side of the pit straight and then go on a formation lap, before settling into a grid for a rolling start –&nbsp;you can skip to a few corners before the lights go green. Naturally, this being endurance racing, the game simulates track evolution –&nbsp;branded as RealRoad – weather and changing time of day, tyre wear and temperatures can affect your performance at the start and end of a stint, there’s everything with managing energy usage –&nbsp;in Hypercar, most entrants have a hybrid system that affects braking and deployment.</p>
<p>The HUD is good, but perhaps not quite customisable enough for VR. You have all the expected timing boxes, speedo, a fixed rear view and radar when other cars are nearby, and a multi-function display box to shift through different elements and make pit stop decisions. They’re all toggleable on and off, but you can’t change their position in VR, making them feel a bit too intrusive for my liking. I ended up toggling the full HUD on and off to really situate myself in the car, but would have loved to position just the MFD, radar and penalty warnings, and rely on in-car elements elsewhere.</p>

<p>With a few more races and trying some more cars, I’ll be heading back online where there’s daily races for all-comers, and then the now standard twinned Safety and Driver rankings, branded under RaceControl, which you’ll need to build up to qualify for special and weekly events.</p>
<p>All in all, first impressions of Le Mans Ultimate are a little mixed. It’s certainly disappointing that a 1.0 launch doesn’t come with any kind of championship or career, but the authentic recreation of WEC, the full field of cars (if you’ve got the DLC), and the solid VR support all make this enticing for motorsports fans – it feels destined to become a staple of the genre on PC. I’m certainly keen to strap in and race some more. Maybe I can not spin out on the penultimate lap this time?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/starfield-second-expansion-unlikely-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-second-expansion-is-unlikely-to-launch-in-2025-%E2%80%93-rumor.1248650/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A second Starfield DLC expansion continues to be in the works, but it may not launch this year, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>A few days back, well-known insider Nate the Hate revealed on the ResetERA forums that Bethesda isn't quite done with its latest role-playing game, as another DLC is in the works, but it doesn't seem like it will release in 2025 at this point. While this may be disappointing for those who are eagerly awaiting a reason to return to Starfield, if the expansion is taking longer to develop than the Shattered Space expansion, which launched only one year after the base game, it could mean that it will be way more substantial than the first expansion.</p>



<p>The Starfield Shattered Space limited scope was hardly the only issue of the expansion. While the introduction of a more focused storyline was very welcome, the expansion left a lot to be desired, as the average map and quest design and the lack of new features turn it into a slog fast, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review</a>. Hopefully, the new expansion, which is rumored to be titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">Starborn</a>, will introduce the new features and tweaks Starfield needs to become a much better game.</p>



<p>Starfield and the Shattered Space expansions are now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. A PlayStation 5 port of the game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-announced-playstation-5/">rumored</a> to be in the works, and despite earlier indications suggesting its announcement would be imminent, has yet to be officially revealed.</p>

<h3 id="side-scrolling-tribute-levels">Side-Scrolling Tribute Levels</h3>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza features a whole bunch of cool side-scrolling levels that pay homage to DK adventures of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Hilltop Layer's Nostalgia Country</strong> gives us our first blast of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a> memories. Meanwhile the <strong>Resort Layer</strong> gives us a <strong>Mine Cart Country</strong> level, which of course also references those amazing sections in good old Donkey Kong Country</p>

<p>The <strong>Radiance Layer provides Arcade Country</strong>, a level designed around the 1981 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/donkey_kong">Donkey Kong</a> Arcade. And finally, <strong>Bramble Country, a bonus level found in the Forest Layer</strong>, gives Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong's Quest some sweet loving.</p>
<h3 id="rambi-returns-alongside-some-other-pals"><strong>Rambi Returns (alongside some other pals)</strong></h3>
<p>This layer packs in a <strong>Rambi Rumble</strong> game which, of course, directly references the level of the same name from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country_2_diddys_kong_quest">Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest</a>. Not only do you get to ride Rambi again (hooray!), there's also the words Double Trouble splattered along the hoardings at the side of the rack track in this area. Heck, even Candy Kong gets a mention in this area.</p>

<h3 id="fossil-maps-depict-characters-from-across-the-series-history">Fossil Maps Depict Characters from across the series' history</h3>
<p>If you've been keeping an eye on the fossils you gather up, you'll likely have noticed that some of them reference characters from past DK games. Now, we're not gonna spoil them all here, but so far we've found what appears to be Tricky the Triceratops from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/donkey_kong_racing">Donkey Kong Racing</a>, as well as Engarde the swordfish (Donkey Kong Country).</p>
<p>Besides these bigger characters, you've also got Banana Bird fossils, recognisably-shaped pigs and even a little DK fossil to be discovered along the way. Nice.</p>

<h3 id="paulines-lady-dress-and-diva-dress">Pauline's Lady Dress and Diva Dress</h3>
<p>Pauline has access to her diva dress from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> and her OG outfit from her first appearance back in the 1981 arcade game. The diva dress can be unlocked immediately <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-all-amiibo-unlocks">using the official DK Bananza amiibo</a>, but all of the dresses can also be picked up in-game!</p>

<h3 id="donkey-kongs-treehouse">Donkey Kong's Treehouse</h3>
<p>If you're anything like us, this will have been one of the first things you attempted to find. And you won't have been disappointed! Donkey Kong Country's iconic homestead appears in the Nostalgia Country level that you can find in Hilltop Layer.</p>

<p>Right at the start of this little tribute, turn back on yourself, as shown in our pics, and climb up to find DK's home in exactly the same way you'll have done in Donkey Kong Country. However, this time you'll find some sweet memories (and a banana). Oh, and feel free to smash the place to pieces on your way out. Cheers!</p>

            <p>Amazon's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> series is being helmed by many of those also involved in the service's acclaimed Fallout show.</p>
<p>The first season of Fallout - which starred Ella Purnell as the wide-eyed and somewhat naive vault dweller Lucy, and Walton Goggins as the rather charismatic noseless Ghoul - debuted in April last year. On its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">the adaptation was a huge hit for Amazon</a>, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">quickly picked up for a second season</a>.</p>
<p>So, what has all this got to do with Mass Effect? Well, in November of last year it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">confirmed Mass Effect was officially getting a TV adaptation at Amazon</a>, with Fast &amp; Furious 9 scribe Daniel Casey on writing and executive producer duties. Along with Casey, though, fans have just this weekend noticed that a number of the production team from Fallout are also going to be working on Mass Effect.</p>

<p>This little nugget of information was tucked away in an Instagram post shared by Casey last November, which <a href="https://x.com/WeAreMassEffect/status/1946667243858731420">has since resurfaced</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm working on a Mass Effect show for Amazon. We're greenlit to start our writer's room at the top of 2025. Doing this right is and has been top priority for nearly two years now (though we paused for the strike last year)," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCIXbiuSR5R/?igsh=a2IydzBvYmVwNGFp">Casey wrote back in November last year</a>. "We have a great pilot script and series outline, the team that Amazon has in place (same team as #fallout including the fantastic @scottfarris) is incredible. Standby for further updates. This is gonna be the next year/two years of my life. And it'll be special."</p>
<p>Scott Farris is a senior development executive at Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video, and has been with the company for over a decade.</p>
<p>"As one of the company's earliest hires, Scott was a founding member of its original scripted drama team and played a key role in launching marquee series such as The Man in the High Castle, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and Jack Ryan," reads <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-farris-16664a27/">Farris' LinkedIn page</a>.</p>
<p>"Over his tenure, Scott has helped guide the development and production of Amazon's most ambitious global series - most recently including Fallout, developed with Jonah Nolan, which became the studio's most commercially successful series to date and earned 16 Emmy nominations in its first season.</p>
<p>"Some exciting upcoming projects include an adaptation of Stephen King's Carrie with Mike Flanagan, the highly anticipated Fourth Wing, based on the bestselling romantasy series, and an adaptation of the multi-billion-dollar video game franchise Mass Effect."</p>

<p>In addition, last month it was announced that Doug Jung - known for his work on the upcoming Chief of War and as a co-writer for Star Trek Beyond - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-trek-beyond-co-writer-joins-mass-effect-tv-series-as-a-showrunner">had joined Amazon's Mass Effect TV series as a showrunner</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that, details of the Mass Effect adaptation for now are quite limited, but we do know former Witcher Henry Cavill at one time had an interest in the project. Back in February 2021, Cavill was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-teases-secret-project-that-appears-to-be-related-to-mass-effect">snapped alongside a script</a> apparently related to Mass Effect. Then, in December of that year, not long after Amazon was said to be nearing a deal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-would-love-to-discuss-being-in-the-mass-effect-tv-series">Cavill casually revealed he'd "love to have a conversation" about it</a>. However in the time since then, Cavill has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">confirmed to be involved with Amazon's Warhammer adaptation</a>, so it is likely things have changed.</p>
<p>As for Fallout, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/walton-goggins-celebrates-wrapping-fallout-season-two-by-peeling-off-his-skin">the second season wrapped filming earlier this year</a>, and Goggins has already assured fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says">it will blow the first season out of the water</a>. New cast members reported to be joining Goggins and co. for Fallout season two include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-reportedly-adds-marvel-actor-kumail-nanjiani-to-its-cast">Kumail Nanjiani as "a high-ranking official within the Brotherhood of Steel"</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-series-second-season-lands-home-alone-star">Macaulay Culkin as "a crazy genius-type character"</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-mass-effect-tv-series-shares-fallouts-successful-production-team]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to some reports, however, it seems a small minority have been experiencing some pretty severe motion sickness with the game. This came to our attention via a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1m1p5vm/playing_dk_bananza_atm_and_got_extremely_nauseous/">Reddit</a> thread in which user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vruchtenhagel/">vruchtenhagel</a> said that they "got extremely nauseous in the first 45 minutes".</p>
<p>The thread has since garnered over 250 comments, some from folks experiencing similar issues, and others kindly offering potential fixes to alleviate the effects.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4lgtnzp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bgrandis7/">bgrandis7</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was looking for someone who had a similar experience to mine! I felt really, really sick in the first area as well, never had something like that happen to me before.</p>
<p>"I think the zooming in and out from 1st and 3rd person on Ingot Isle might be the culprits. I really hope the next areas are less cramped and the camera can be a bit further away."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/donkey-kong-bananza-motion-sickness-settings/">Nintendo Everything</a>, you can try disabling the motion controls and screen shake via Bananza's options menu to potentially help with the problem. Some commenters in the Reddit thread have stated that such actions have unfortunately not helped, while others have said that it does indeed reduce the motion sickness.</p>
<p>So, we thought we'd put it to you fine folks and see if this really is a potential issue. Have you been feeling any motion sickness from Donkey Kong Bananza? Why not let us know by voting in the below poll and expounding with a comment while you're at it.</p>

            <p>A few of the UK's fanciest former indie developers are going indie again... with help from venture capital. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes The Deep</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dear-esther">Dear Esther</a> creators The Chinese Room have slipped the surly bonds of former parent company Sumo Digital in the course of a management buyout, with "facilitation" from Hiro Capital. Now "fully independent", they're focussing on the creation of original games, with two unannounced projects in the offing once they've finished developing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>Founded in 2007 by a group of academically minded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> modders, The Chinese Room made waves initially with Dear Esther, an introspective first-person exploration game that emphasised environmental storytelling over mechanics, aggressively and affectionately described as a "walking sim".</p>
<p>They later worked with Frictional on Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs - sequel to The Dark Descent and perhaps the best-written Amnesia game - and Sony's Santa Monica Studio on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture">Everybody's Gone To The Rapture</a>, in which you chase golden phantoms around a sorrowful English village. I once <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/dec/08/a-video-game-garden-the-delights-of-virtual-botany">took a botanist on a walking tour of Rapture</a> and we both thought the flowers were excellent. I also love the soundtrack, which makes me want to wander off into the hills of Shropshire and die tragically of, nudge-wink, "Spanish flu".</p>

<p>The Chinese Room were acquired by Sumo Digital in 2018, who were themselves later acquired by Tencent. The developers' most recent project is Still Wakes The Deep, a creature feature set aboard a Scottish oil rig: in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review">review</a>, Brendy concluded that it "doesn't push the boat out but still excels within its genre". Sadly, there has been some belt-tightening of late. Sumo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layoffs-at-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-studio-as-paradox-promise-rpg-will-still-release-in-october">confirmed layoffs at The Chinese Room and elsewhere in their operations this June</a>, as part of plans to move away from original game creation and "focus exclusively on development services for partners".</p>
<p>According to a PR email this week, Sumo put The Chinese Room up for sale earlier this year, with the expectation that it would be sold to private equity or an overseas buyer. The management buyout ensures that the studio will remain UK-owned, according to the email, though it's not clear how exactly Hiro Capital (who are based in London and Luxembourg) have "faciliated" the deal, and what they'll expect in return. Compare and contrast how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legends-how-amplitude-bought-their-independence-back-from-sega">Amplitude bought their independence back from Sega</a>.</p>
<p>According to studio director Ed Daly, "this management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision." Best of luck with it all, peeps. Please make another game about a subterranean hellfactory.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-current-developers-of-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-are-going-fully-indie-again]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Turtle Rock's Evolve was, for me, an almost-brilliant asymmetrical shooter straining to extract itself from the jaws of a live service kaiju maddened by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/evolve-wot-i-think-in-progress-conclusion">a sludgy diet of unlocks and micro-transactions</a>. It was a huge round of hide-and-seek featuring one, very large and fast, upgradeable alien monster and four hunters equipped with jet packs, trackers, forcefield nets and assorted demolition gear. I had a grand old time at launch as the Wraith, a godawful sneaklizard with warping capabilities, like a xenomorph moonlighting as Corvo Attano. But such thrills were sabotaged by the grindiness of the early game and by an infuriating deluge of paid DLC. Publishers 2K Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/evolve-shutting-down-dedicated-servers-and-f2p-version">delisted it in 2018</a>, after attempting to reboot Evolve as a free-to-play game. The beast clings onto a little life care of <a href="https://discord.com/invite/evolvereunited">a community Discord for existing owners</a>.</p>
<p>Even given the reaction to Evolve's nickel-and-diming, it seems unlikely a sequel would have stripped out the live service progression elements and reverted to something like the menu-light horror movie sandbox approach of the developer's previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>. After all, Turtle Rock went onto make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/back-4-blood">Back 4 Blood</a>, a zombie blaster marinated in grindogubbins. Still, I'd have liked to see them try it. And look, they almost did.</p> <!--more-->
<p>A <a href="https://www.tj-frame.com/evolve">concept artist portfolio</a> flushed out by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-evolve-2-was-once-in-development-concept-art-reveals-scrapped-sequel">MP1st</a> describes plans for a cancelled Evolve 2. These included ideas for what sound like more linear missions (boo!), and a level consisting of a massive spacerock-digesting facility that puts me in mind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>'s USG Ishimura (yes please). "After Evolve released, the studio began work on a sequel," writes TJ Frame, who was senior concept artist at Turtle Rock between 2011 and 2017. "Sadly that project was canceled after several months of pre-production.</p>
<p>"At one point the game design included locations such as a huge asteroid mining station, tentatively named The Akhenaten, as well as more sequentially oriented missions back on Shear," the post continues. "It would have been fun to really flesh out new locations and architectural styles within the world of Evolve, but the studio moved onto other projects and pitches."</p>
<p>TJ Frame's portoflio includes a bunch of art for the abandoned Evolve 2, which I will hold off recirculating here because I don't have the developer's blessing. Some of the images are labelled "Evolve II", though one "Scraptown" or "Slagtown" area appears to be an outline for some Evolve DLC. The concepts for the aforesaid Akhenaten map are definitely the highlights, in terms of inherent munsterliness. The subliminal theme TJ Frame and their colleagues appear to have been working with is "nasty insect biting/liquefying paralysed and helpless prey". Now picture yourself standing on that insect's abdomen, attempting to harpoon Godzilla.</p>
<p>Alas and alack, such antics will probably never come to pass. Turtle Rock were acquired by Tencent in 2021 - their current project is <a href="https://www.turtlerockstudios.com/games">TBA</a>. If you too mourn the extinction of Evolve, you might be interested to hear that one of its spiritual progenitors, Aliens Vs Predator, is enjoying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ancient-aliens-vs-predator-game-briefly-resurrected-by-steam-player-thirst-for-six-packs">a new lease of existence care of a sporadically reanimating community server</a>.</p></div>

            <p>The Chinese Room, the British studio behind the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, has gone independent from previous owners Sumo Digital following a management buyout.</p>
<p>The Brighton-based studio was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sumo-buys-everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-maker-the-chinese-room">bought by Sumo Digital back in 2018</a>, which was acquired by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> in January 2022 in a deal worth around £919m.</p>
<p>Now, The Chinese Room will continue developing original games independently, following its success with oil rig horror game Still Wakes the Deep that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">won the BAFTA for New Intellectual Property</a> at this year's awards, as well as both performer awards.</p>

<p>"This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision," said studio director Ed Daly.</p>
<p>"This is what we are doing and we want to carry on doing it, so we're happy to carry on in this vein."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-look-likely-at-sumo-digital-as-company-ditches-plans-to-work-on-its-own-ip">Sumo Digital announced it would refocus</a> on "development services for partners", which would "unavoidably... have an impact on our studios and people". The news followed layoffs in June 2024, where 15 percent of the company were let go.</p>
<p>Sumo Digital put The Chinese Room up for sale earlier this year, but it was likely the studio would be sold to an overseas buyer. This management buyout therefore allows The Chinese Room to remain as an independent British studio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Still Wakes the Deep publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-publisher-confirms-small-number-of-layoffs-as-its-sold-to-investment-firm">Secret Mode confirmed a "small number" of layoffs</a> earlier this year as it was sold to an investment firm.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room's next release will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, which it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-must-refocus-to-rebuild-trust-and-survive-bosses-say-after-life-by-you-cancellation">worked on with Paradox Interactive</a>. It's then working on two further new original projects.</p>
<p>Bloodlines 2 was previously aiming for a first half of 2025 release, but was delayed back in March. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-troubled-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gets-another-delay">now aiming for an October launch</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-goes-independent-to-continue-focus-on-original-projects]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6f9923c11682/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK charts data is in, and as expected, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is a hit, climbing all the way to the top to beat the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">EA Sports FC 25</a>.</p>
<p>How well it <em>actually</em> sold, however, is a little bit more difficult to gauge. According to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/">The Game Business</a>' Chris Dring, Bananza sold three times that of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a> on the Switch, but less than half of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>

<p>Now, the obvious conclusion that we could come to is that digital sales far outweigh physical in 2025, but while the balance has certainly tipped <em>ever-so-slightly</em> in favour of digital, Switch owners still really value their physical games. In response to a post stating that more people buy digital over physical, Dring stated "Not so much on Switch. A little more".</p>
<p>It's a weird situation, then. One other potential explanation is that by the time Super Mario Odyssey launched in October 2017, Nintendo had sold a lot more Switch consoles since its release in March the same year. We're looking at between 14-15 million Switch consoles sold by the time Odyssey launched.</p>
<p>Bananza releasing less than two months after the Switch 2 dropped means that there are simply fewer consoles in consumers' hands – thus fewer sales. We also have to consider that, despite Nintendo's efforts to boost DK's appeal in recent years, Mario as an IP likely still commands a lot more attention.</p>
<p>Still, we're pleased to see Bananza top the charts – may its success continue in the weeks, months, and years to come!</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>British developer The Chinese Room has gained independence back from Sumo Digital, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-announces-management-buyout-gaining-independence-from-sumo-digital" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports IGN</a>. As you might recall, Sumo Digital <a href="https://wccftech.com/sumo-digital-acquired-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought</a> the development studio nearly seven years ago, in August 2018, for an undisclosed sum.</p>



<p>Now, though, The Chinese Room has sought independence because Sumo Digital had recently switched to a development-for-hire model. Moreover, the studio feared Sumo would sell it to some other company. The team will be headed by current studio director Ed Daly, who received funding help from venture capital firm Hiro Capital. Here's a statement from Daly:</p>



<p><em>This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision. This is what we are doing and we want to carry on doing it, so we're happy to carry on in this vein.</em></p>



<p>Spike Laurie, a partner at Hiro Capital, added: </p>



<p><em>The Chinese Room is a huge British success story that has rightly been recognised as a unique creative force capable of competing on the world stage. From hiring British people to making games set in the UK, they've been one of our foremost creative studios and now they are once again in charge of their own destiny while remaining British. We are at risk of overlooking these creative gems and letting them be sold to overseas corporations. That is a travesty for the $5.5 billion British gaming industry which has a world-renowned reputation. We need to nurture this talent and support it through difficult times, because it is one of our leading creative exports.</em></p>



<p>The Chinese Room, which recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/paradox-confirms-layoffs-at-the-chinese-room-claims-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-development-is-unaffected-by-the-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off some employees</a>, is working on two unannounced IPs. However, by far its most anticipated game is Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, which the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took over from Hardsuit Labs on behalf of publisher Paradox Interactive</a>. Bloodlines 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is now set to launch in October 2025</a>, and we expect to learn a lot more about it next month at Gamescom.</p>

Valens says Vice’s owner, Savage Ventures, demanded the removal of the articles; Valens and several other Waypoint writers quit in response.</p><p>Two articles were removed from Waypoint Sunday morning: a July 18 article titled “<a href="https://archive.ph/USxe6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This Group Takes Responsibility For Steam's Payment Processor Censorship Policies--They Just Implied 'Pervert Nerds' Cause Society's Problems</a> and a July 19 article titled “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250719204151/https://www.vice.com/en/article/group-behind-steam-censorship-policies-have-powerful-allies-and-targeted-popular-games-with-outlandish-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Group Behind Steam Censorship Policies Have Powerful Allies–And Targeted Popular Games With Outlandish Claims</a>.” Valens told Aftermath she was informed by Waypoint managing editor Dwayne Jenkins Sunday morning that leadership at Savage Ventures had ordered Jenkins to remove the articles; Valens informed Jenkins that she would quit her Waypoint contributing role if this happened and, once it did, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hknazlbtwv5thavb7uw52xjz/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Faftermath.site%252Fpreview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced her departure</a>.</p><p>Valens said that both articles had been edited and approved by Jenkins, though did not go through pre-publication legal review. Valens told Aftermath that, as far as she’s aware, there was no legal threat from Collective Shout or other entities over the contents of the articles, though tells Aftermath it’s “possible that [Savage Ventures] simply were afraid of one coming eventually.”&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/australian-anti-porn-group-claims-responsibility-for-steams-new-censorship-rules-in-victory-against-porn-sick-brain-rotted-pedo-gamer-fetishists-and-things-only-get-weirder-from-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PCGamer</a> notes, “The two retracted articles from Waypoint appear to be the first among the games press to point out the connection between Collective Shout and the recent changes on Steam, a connection which is public knowledge⁠—by Collective Shout's own statements⁠—and not an allegation made by Waypoint against the group.”</p><p>Valens discussed the situation further in a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2517618111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch stream</a> Sunday morning, in which she claimed that Savage Ventures had previously worried about how Waypoint articles covering sexual or political topics might affect the site’s performance on Google. Valens said on stream that “I’ve been told very specifically with a number of articles that it’s an issue with… Google, Google overlords. We actually had to fight very hard to keep some of our more politically-oriented VTuber coverage up because [Savage Ventures] were nervous it was going to be too R-rated for Google… I was told especially [of issues with] Google Discover.” Valens pointed out on stream that the July 19 article had spread particularly widely on social media, including Reddit.&nbsp;</p><p>Requests for comment to email addresses for Vice and Savage Ventures bounced.&nbsp;</p><p>Following Valens’ announcement that she was leaving Waypoint, she posted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lug2bx34522v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a> that “Savage Ventures requested I no longer contribute to VICE… several hours after my announcement.” Later on Sunday, Waypoint writers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shauncichacki.bsky.social/post/3lug2qty7m227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shaun Cichacki </a>and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mattvat.bsky.social/post/3lug2ywbiuc23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt Vatankhah</a><strong> </strong>both announced they were quitting the site. “I can't sit back and watch Savage Ventures silence Ana and stifle actual journalism out of fear of being ‘too controversial,’” wrote Vatankhah, while Cichacki wrote that “I cannot stand by and watch [Valens] be censored for doing her job and doing it properly.”</p><p>“Dwayne was a great boss to me,” Valens told Aftermath, adding, “The team I worked with at Waypoint treated me with the utmost respect and care. They were great colleagues.” Jenkins voiced support for Waypoint’s current and former writers on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lejenk603.bsky.social/post/3lug4fsvt4k2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, noting “At further risk to myself, that's all I can say at the moment.”&nbsp;</p><p>Waypoint previously removed several articles by Valens about VTuber Kirsche Verstahl following Verstahl releasing an “<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ErvbtgZ4xU4UhCbJeTBeD6G9vnmT6kLq/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open letter</a>” about the coverage that read in part “I don’t want to go to court over this. But… what else am I supposed to do?” An <a href="https://archive.ph/40kfD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article by Jenkins </a>about harassment Valens faced surrounding her VTuber coverage was also removed. Waypoint also previously cancelled a <a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/vice-512785/4006265177530-friends-freaks-and-fans-look-forward-to-futa-fridays-featuring-on-um-fridays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">column</a> Valens planned to write about adult games, and, Valens says, Savage Ventures, “wanted to pull <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/your-mom-and-dad-now-know-what-a-vtuber-is-thanks-to-this-arrest-maybe-sorta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article I did on right-wing extremism in VTubing</a> due to its political content” and over how “such political extremism could impact our standing with Google Discover.” Valens noted to Aftermath that, despite this seeming concern over Waypoint’s content, articles about <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/zoophilia-zoophiles-animal-sex-interviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zoophilia</a> and “<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/welcome-to-the-age-of-gooning-where-porn-and-pleasure-blur-into-obsession/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gooning</a>” appear on Vice itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking down articles is considered one of the cardinal sins of journalism at many outlets, especially if the outlet believes the article to be factual and to meet its editorial standards. (No public reason was given by Vice for the recent articles' removals.) Most outlets will update, edit, or amend editor’s notes to articles rather than remove them wholesale. Many outlets will also have sensitive stories go through multiple rounds of editorial and legal review before publication, though the scope of this process varies from outlet to outlet.&nbsp;</p><p>Waypoint’s process is unusual in this regard, in that Valens told Aftermath most stories, once approved by Jenkins, are edited after publication. Some sensitive stories are edited beforehand, which Valens told Aftermath happened with the July 18 story but not the July 19 one. Valens told Aftermath that "I do think Savage Ventures did not give adequate editorial support to Waypoint and Dwayne. During my time there, there wasn’t a second editor on staff to help with shepherding out news stories on any sensitive subject matters, whether my own work or others.’”&nbsp;</p><p>A lack of editors at Waypoint (or <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/journalism-job-cuts-2025-tracked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many journalism outlets</a> these days) is unsurprising: Vice shuttered the original Waypoint in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/vice-shutting-down-waypoint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 2023</a>, and much of its staff went on to form worker-owned outlet <a href="https://remapradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remap</a>. Vice declared bankruptcy in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/02/22/vice-media-shuts-down-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2024</a> and laid off the majority of its staff, then was <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/vice-digital-joint-venture-savage-ventures-vice-news-1235997565/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaunched</a> in May of that year under the steam of Nashville-based “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/savage-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">venture operator</a>” Savage Ventures. In October 2024 <a href="https://aftermath.site/waypoint-vice-remap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Waypoint began publishing again</a> with new <a href="https://aftermath.site/vice-waypoint-site-news-reopen-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writers</a>. Valens said on her stream that she was paid $30 an article; a contributor to the previous iteration of Waypoint, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nickcapozzoli.bsky.social/post/3lugc46uya22r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Capozzoli</a>, said rates used to be at least $300.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Underpaid writers</a>, understaffed sites, and ownership that feels <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no allegiance</a> to the work their sites produce is pretty much <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-journalism-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">par for the course</a> in games journalism these days. As experienced reporters and editors leave or are forced out of the field, and as sites fall into the hands of <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-sale-keleops-go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">private equity</a> or traffic-obsessed <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conglomerates</a>, there’s less support for writers day to day, and less support for sites from above. Ownership that is distanced from their sites’ writers or sees those sites as revenue sources more than news outlets providing a service to readers has little incentive to stand by a site’s work or to provide it with the editorial or legal support it needs. And, as usual, it’s the writers who pay the price, whether that’s losing their jobs or feeling like it’s necessary to quit.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Aftermath co-founder Gita Jackson previously worked at Vice's Motherboard, and appeared on Waypoint's site and podcast.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon"><h3>Warframe, Still A Space Ninja Game (Technically), Is Now Drawing Inspiration From World War I</h3></a><p>"I liken it to the moment in World War I where you have soldiers playing football on Christmas day across the trenches"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse"><h3>‘Friendslop’ Isn’t Real, But People Love Posting About It Anyway</h3></a><p>But people are still intent on dunking on the idea of someone saying "friendslop" and meaning it.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/waypoint-quit-steam-vice]]></content:encoded>

<h2>DK and Pauline's Big Day Out</h2>

<p>The game opens where most Nintendo adventures do, a world at peace and our protagonist enjoying what they do the most. For Donkey Kong, this is to head into the mines to uncover Banandium Gems, a resource that seems to do everything from filling bellies or allowing you to power up your abilities, and even power gigantic drilling machines capable of reaching the center of the Earth.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-pauline.jpg?itok=95jo2BwU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-pauline.jpg?itok=CmVVoeUg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When Void Kong, CEO of the Void company, shows up with a massive vacuuming machine to absorb Banandium energy and begin drilling to the center of the Earth, DK first gets trapped, finding Pauline as a companion along the way. DK then learns about the Banandium Root, which will grant wishes and allow Pauline to get home and Donkey Kong to experience his greatest dream… more bananas.</p>

<p>This adventure takes DK and Pauline through a variety of themed layers as they descend through the Earth's crust. You've got the staple video game worlds filled with sand, lava, and ice, but also some fun and unique twists on the idea like a Resort Layer, Racing Layer, and even a Feast Layer (which immediately made me think of <em>Super Mario Odyssey's</em> Luncheon Kingdom).</p>

<p>This narrative is surprisingly deep as you learn more about Pauline, who at this point is just a child and prone to stage fright, and her dream to return to her city after being captured by Void Kong. You also get to learn about each of the different races that live in the different layers, how they've made homes for themselves, and what troubles they have.</p>

It was so nice to see the lifeblood of classic collectathon titles like <em>DK64 </em>and <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> live and well in the colorful world of <em>DK Bananza</em>.</p>

<h2>A Big Destructible World…</h2>

<p><em>DK Bananza</em> takes a lot of inspiration from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. Each Layer (the levels of this game) is themed with is own enemy types, common mechanics, and materials. They're also filled to the brim with collectibles.</p>

<p>The biggest change for <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is that a lot of the world is destructible. As DK, you'll be able to dig down, punch through mountains, and pick up and hurl chunks as a weapon. Immediately this gameplay change felt as groundbreaking as some of the building mechanics in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. A level of technical achievement and flexibility that I was not expecting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-breakable-environment.jpg?itok=IUnhW-sZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-breakable-environment.jpg?itok=xnGLUgGa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each world felt so much more complex, and confusing at times, as you'd sense a Bananium Gem through a wall and just start digging straight towards it.</p>

<p>A downside of the environment being so breakable was the number of times I found myself tripping into a Bananium Gem only to look around and realize that I'd missed some kind of platforming or laser puzzle by reaching the banana through the wall.</p>

<p>For a lot of players this ability to shortcut a puzzle or challenge could bring its own level of reward, but it felt like I was cheated out of a gameplay experience.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-puzzle.jpg?itok=1K8XZEfv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-puzzle.jpg?itok=W4nA8Bqw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While there were more than enough Bananium Gems I obtained by reaching them 'correctly,' I'd assume a good 20% of the bananas I encountered were ones I didn't even realize I had run into until I was already punching them.</p>

<h2>…Filled With Collectibles</h2>

<p>Each Layer is filled with the Bananium Gems collectibles, which can be used to upgrade DK's abilities, as well as fossils of varying levels that can be used to purchase and upgrade outfits that provide additional boosts to different abilities.</p>

<p>In my time playing <em>Donkey Kong Bananza,</em> I collected around 500 Bananium Gems by the time I reached the ending, and I think I would have been hard pressed to find a gap of longer than five minutes where I wasn't hearing the classic "Ooh, Banana!" to signify picking up a new one. [Editor's note: Some quick math on the 15 hour play time means our reviewer found a banana about every two minutes!]</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-ooh-banana.jpg?itok=CjXJn30i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-ooh-banana.jpg?itok=6bM4AcJ2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Much like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, especially when first reaching a new area, you can pan the camera and spot half a dozen objectives. By the time you reach one of those, you're normally able to whip your camera around and find another dozen.</p>

<p>While I was always progressing towards a goal marker, the path that I took to reach them probably looks like one created by a madman.</p>

<h2>Upgrade Your Outfit And Abilities</h2>

<p>As you pick up collectibles, you can level up DK's abilities with Bananium Gems, or purchase outfits that deal incremental increases to DK's powers, defence, or abilities.</p>

<p>The Bananuim Gem abilities were fantastic to unlock. You can punch faster, recharge your meter quicker, and take your <em>Bananza </em>abilities and turn them up to 11. The costume abilities were far more underwhelming.</p>

<p>You might move 20% faster in mud, or take 20% less damage. Each of these outfits can be upgraded further, but they're so situational unless you knew what was going to be ahead of you there likely wasn't much reason to change. Those slight increases in speed or defence could be helpful, but I feel the time to reach a shop and get changed would almost take as long as just getting through that muddy patch, especially when something like surfing can allow you to mitigate the speed loss regardless.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-feast-layer.jpg?itok=GFVilU6t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-feast-layer.jpg?itok=ZEm4rFuT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It also doesn't help that probably the most useful piece of DK attire, a tie that makes chests appear more frequently while digging, is arguably the best upgrade for the whole game and you get it in the first world. Chests appearing can net you additional gold or treasure maps that put collectibles on your map.</p>

<h2>Music To Make You Clap Your Bongos To</h2>

<p>To top off the fun gameplay and charming visuals, the soundtrack is always good to tap your toe to. Whether you're exploring a world as DK, getting to jam along to any of the <em>Bananza </em>vocal tracks, or you've warped into a <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>-inspired sidescroller and get to hear reimaginings of tracks like "Jungle Japes," you'll always be having a good time.</p>

<p>It was so important not just for the game, but also narratively to link with Pauline and her love of singing and confidence issues, that the soundtrack would be a large part of this, and <em>DK Bananza</em> absolutely nails it on every front.</p>

<p>For Donkey Kong, who hasn't had a true 3D platforming outing since <em>Donkey Kong 64, DK Bananza</em> is an incredible return to form. Capitalizing on everything that <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> did so well — unique open worlds, fun platforming challenges, and an over abundance of quick to obtain collectibles — <em>DK Bananza</em> then spins off to create its own novel genre-bending game with destructible environments and a return of DK specific features like transformations.</p>

<p>While I did feel the destructible environment robbed me of experiencing some of the platforming puzzles of the game, the destructible environment still did far more to enhance the overall experience.</p>

<p>If you own a Switch 2 and you are a fan of <em>Mario Odyssey,</em> then this should be a game you pick up immediately, whether you're wanting to marathon through the story or pick it up for 10-15 minutes at a time collecting a few Bananium Gems along the way.</p>
