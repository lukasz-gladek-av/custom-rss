			<p>Diablo IV just received its biggest update to date in the form of Diablo 4 Season 4 Loot Reborn, and we already know how long this season will run.</p>
<p>As said, Loot Reborn is a major update for Blizzard's most recent Diablo entry, packing major changes to both the Eternal and Seasonal realms. Players can now expect more meaningful item drops, greater control over item enhancement, and more. Additionally, leveling has been revamped for all world tiers via Helltide Reborn, featuring enemies and a new boss. Also, Blizzard has included updates to Uber Bosses, Greater Affixes, and the Codex of Power. As for the game's endgame, players can now experience the new Pit of the Artificers&nbsp;<span>challenge dungeon.</span></p>
<p>No new season without new seasonal activities - in Season 4 players can fight alongside the Iron Wolves in Khejistan. According to Blizzard, any Iron Wolf Events that occur in Helltide will persist past the end of the season. "Seek out the battle-hardened and stalwart Soudeh the Anvil, a stoic field commander of the Iron Wolves", Blizzard writes. "The Iron Wolves are a band of noble Mercenaries in the South, seeking to protect the common people of Sanctuary and hold themselves to a higher code of honor than other mercenary companies of similar mettle. Mysteriously, members of their ranks have been dying under suspicious circumstances—seek out the source of this slaughter to earn the Iron Wolves’ favor."</p>
<p>As this update is quite extensive, we highly suggest reading up on all the changes and new features that <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/diablo4/24077223/galvanize-your-legend-in-season-4-loot-reborn?utm_source=d4-14-d4-season-4-launch-lapsed-3-20240514&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=marketing-gb-3&amp;utm_content=button-link-learn-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come with Season 4 here</a>.</p>
<p>Although Season 4 has just kicked off, we already know when it will end, and Season 5 will start - August 6. This implies that Season 4 Loot Reborn is one month shorter than <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-3-starts-on-january-23-says-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Season 3</a>, but this is due to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-4-delayed-may-2024-itemization-endgame-ptr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay of Season 4 that the development team announced back in March of this year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/dead-by-daylight-x-dungeons-dragons-revealed-with-2v8-mode-and-castlevania-chapter-teased/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Behaviour Interactive’s 8th anniversary stream saw them make a slew of big announcements for their main game and franchise, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>. There’s the reveal of the next big event, themed after Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a new 2v8 game mode, and a tease of what’s coming down the pipe with a Castlevania collaboration!</p>
<p>First things first is the Dead by Daylight x Dungeon &amp; Dragons Chapter, which will bring the D&amp;D villain Vecna, AKA The LIch into the game as a new killer, while a Bard named Aestri Yazar is the new Survivor opposed to him. Alongside that will be the new map Forgotten Ruins, which is full of D&amp;D easter eggs such as getting loot, magical items and rolling dice.</p>


<p>All of this is now available in the Public Test Build, with a full launch on 3rd June 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | Dungeons &amp; Dragons | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dcizzog5WBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Another fan-pleasing announcement was the 2v8 game mode that will pit two killers against 8 survivors in a new super-sized map. This comes with various gameplay adjustments to rebalance the action, so there’s a class-like system instead of Perks and Cages instead of Hooks.</p>

<p>More details on this will be made available in July.</p>
<p>Rounding out the show was a trailer for the upcoming Castlevania Chapter, with Behaviour teaming up with Konami to bring the iconic game series into DBD. The teaser gives just a small glimpse of what the vampiric new Killer will be like when the chapter launches later this year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Behaviour also announced and launched a whole new game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/what-the-fog-dead-by-daylight/">What the Fog,</a> shared a new gameplay trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/checkout-the-gameplay-trailer-for-the-casting-of-frank-stone/">The Casting of Frank Stone,</a> and announced a new session-based PvE action-horror shooter currently <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/project-t-is-third-person-co-op-shooter-set-in-the-dead-by-daylight-universe/">codenamed “Project T,</a>” which is opening its doors to the community with an Insider Program.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a pretty horrible stream… in all the right ways for DBD fans!</p>

		<p>Behaviour Interactive have revealed a game they teased quite a while ago, Project T. Well, bits of a game, it is nowhere near finished but they wanted to show fans how things were progressing and get their input.</p>
<p>The titled is being created by Midwinter Entertainment and you will play as Trespassers who have been pulled from their own realities in to the word of Dead by Daylight, specifically a region called The Backwater. The Backwater has been designed so it can change over time and is so big the team are thinking of adding trucks to game so players can get around quickly.</p>


<p>Players will have to work together to survive The Thrall, demonic entities who roam the land and will attack the Trespassers with “deadly abilities”. The game is a 1-4-person PvE co-op shooter but formats have yet to be revealed,&nbsp; no doubt it will land on PC first.</p>

		<p>News of Amazon’s live action<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tomb-raider/"> Tomb Raider</a> show has been fluttering around the internet for quite a while but we now have the official confirmation of the series. The rather excellent Phoebe Waller-Bridge is set to write and executive produce the series.</p>
<p>“If I could tell my teenage self that this was happening, I think she’d explode. Tomb Raider has been a huge part of my life and I feel incredibly privileged to be bringing it to television with such passionate collaborators. Lara means a lot to me, as she does to many, and I can’t wait to go on this adventure. Bats ‘n all,” said Phoebe Waller-Bridge.</p>


<p>“I’m so happy to announce that we have ordered the epic, globetrotting series Tomb Raider from the incredibly gifted Emmy-award winner Phoebe Waller-Bridge and the team at Crystal Dynamics,” said Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios. “Fans and newcomers can look forward to exhilarating adventures that honor the legacy of this iconic character.”</p>
<p>The deal is between Crystal Dynamics and Amazon, and they are also working on a new multiplatform Tomb Raider game which will be created using Unreal Engine 5. Crystal Dynamics is currently part of the Embracer Group, but as they are selling off studios left, right, and centre who knows for how long. However, Tomb Raider is a massive franchise and Amazon will be paying Crystal Dynamics a lot of money for the license, so that probably keeps them safe from the Embracer clear out.</p>


<p>Amazon hit gold with their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/11/fallout-season-1/">TV adaption of the Fallout</a> franchise and will no doubt be hoping for a second strike with Tomb Raider. They certainly seem to be starting well, Phoebe Waller-Bridge is behind the excellent Fleabag television series and also starred in the most recent Indiana Jones movie and worked on the script for the same movie.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/ps5-now-at-59-million-sold-sony-announces-two-new-playstation-ceos/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> now stands at 59 million consoles sold, with 20.8 million in the last year, as Sony has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/28/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-2024/">former PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan’s</a> job will be divided between two new roles.</p>
<p>President of SIE Worldwide Studios Hermen Hulst will step up to be CEO of the new Studio Business Group, while Hideaki Nishino will be appointed CEO of SIE’s Platform Business Group, with his background as SVP of Sony’s Platform Experience Group. The pair will assume their roles on 1st June, while interim CEO Hiroki Totoki will step away from that role, though both will still report to Totoki-san.</p>


<p>Hulst and Nishino-san will have to tackle some significant challenges that face PlayStation in the next few years. In particular, while PS5 is now able to meet demand after its early years of supply constraint, and did sell over 20 million consoles in the last year, hardware sales fell short of the 24 million that had been expected. 20.8 million could well be the high water mark for PS5 sales, with the forecast being for 18 million console sales in FY25.</p>
<p>Sony is expected to launch an enhanced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/18/report-ps5-pro-specs-leak-reveals-big-gpu-bump-faster-ram-cpu-and-more/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> later this year, which could spur on console sales a bit, though it will play to a niche high-end gaming market with a higher price point likely, and might not be as impactful as the PS4 Pro was in 2016. As we’re now past the mid-point of the typical 7 year console generation, eyes will start to shift to the next generation.</p>

<p>Of course, the company is still very able to produce big hits. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/helldivers-2-sells-12-million-to-become-playstations-new-fastest-selling-game/">Helldivers 2 has raced to 12 million copies sold</a>, outpacing God of War Ragnarok through its first 12 weeks, full game sales are up from 264 million to 286 million, and monthly PSN users has increased to 118 million year-on-year – Sony no-longer reports the number of active subscribers to PSN.</p>
<p><em>Source: Sony [<a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/a-message-from-hiroki-totoki-a-new-era-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_supplement.pdf">2</a>]</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/helldivers-2-sells-12-million-to-become-playstations-new-fastest-selling-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The sensational success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has led to 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, making it the new fastest-selling game launched by PlayStation, and surpassing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/03/god-of-war-ragnarok-review/">God of War Ragnarok’s</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/SonySantaMonica/status/1620844673924227074">11 million sales</a> over the same period.</p>
<p>Obviously this is far from an apples to apples comparison. For one thing, Sony will skew and twist the statistics in any way possible so that pretty much every first party game is the biggest and best ever. Then there’s just the fact that Ragnarok was available across PS4 and PS5, while Helldivers 2 spread across PC and PS5, so you might argue that either one or the other has the advantage in market size, but price point is another big factor. Ragnarok launched as a full priced £70 game, while Helldivers 2 is just £35, making it far easier to justify picking up.&nbsp;The profitability from both games (and their development costs) is also going to be totally different.</p>


<p>Still, this is a remarkable achievement when looking at what Helldivers 2 is compared to Sony’s big budget pantheon of games.</p>
<p>“It’s crazy to think that there are more Helldivers than there are Swedes ????” <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1790300010401104124">quipped Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt</a>.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 launched across PlayStation 5 and PC on 8th February, with the multiplatform launch certainly going a long way to boosting the game’s sales over the last few months. It was also a major contribution to the sales and profits in Sony’s fourth quarter, ending 31st March 2024.</p>

<p>It’s also very likely that this tied in with other parts of the report. Game sales on non-PlayStation platforms (so Sony’s PC games business) more than doubled year-on-year to ¥54.4 million, and PlayStation Network monthly active users jumped 10 million year-on-year to 118 million (though 4 milion down from the previous holiday quarter). This predates <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/06/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-pc-psn-requirement-may-6th-update-cancelled/">the recent kerfuffle over Helldivers 2’s PSN requirement</a>, and it’s likely that there was an uptick in PSN sign-ups on PC around the game’s launch.</p>

		<p>Prison Architect 2 developer Double Eleven and publisher Paradox Interactive are parting ways after failing to come to a new commercial agreement for a continued partnership. Prison Architect 2 is still set to release later this year in September, with new developer Kokku taking over.</p>
<p>Double Eleven has been working on the Prison Architect games for the past nine years, first to produce a console version of the game, and then for all versions after Paradox acquired the rights to the popular prison management game from original creators Introversion Software in 2019. The last few years the company has shifted focus to creating Prison Architect 2, but Double Eleven will not be supporting the game post-launch.</p>


<p>While there is generally a bittersweet and warm tone to the statements being made by all parties – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1257610/view/4201372129464692603?l=english">Paradox thanking Double Eleven for their efforts</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/prisonarchitect/comments/1cr004q/a_letter_to_the_prison_architect_fans_fellow/">Double Eleven’s Gaz</a> talking about the studio’s excitement for the future and trust in Kokku to continue their work – there is also a very plain statement of fact.</p>
<p>“With the sequel passing certification on all platforms, the contract was fulfilled. However, we could not find a commercial agreement that worked for both parties moving forward and mutually agreed to part ways.”</p>
<p>It seems that the ship sailed quite a while ago, with Kokku being brought in to assist Double Eleven around the time of Gamescom last year, and then taking over development fully in January of this year. This would have been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/16/prison-architect-2-goes-3d-with-march-release-date/">around the time of the game’s announcement</a>, so Paradox has sat on this information for quite some time – perhaps because of evaluating this new working relationship and deciding to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/21/prison-architect-2-delayed-until-may/">delay the game first to May</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/19/prison-architect-2-delayed-again-new-release-date-in-september/">then to September</a>.</p>

<p>The additional four months is all about trying to optimise the game as much as possible. Since last month, Prison Architect 2 has been “certified” and “ready to release” on all platforms, but Paradox and Kokku felt that they could do better with optimising the game for lower-end hardware and cutting out more edge case crashes – rather prescient given <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/18/we-let-you-down-cities-skylines-2-dlc-being-refunded-amidst-player-dissatisfaction/">the difficulties that Cities: Skylines 2 is currently enduring</a>.</p>

<p>Prison Architect 2 will step into the third dimension with everything that this entails. You can now build a prison across multiple floors with more elaborate structures, and with building tools designed to accommodate this feat. Within that space, you’ve then got myriad management tools to define daily schedules for inmates, policies for how to handle them, and more.</p>
<p>While Double Eleven had a huge role in making this leap and setting out the future plans for the game’s post-release growth, it’s now up to Kokku to deliver on that potential.</p>

			<p>I love the <em>Hyperdimension Neptunia</em> series, but for a long time now it feels like I’m a fan of everything but the actual video games. Nep Nep and her crew of humanised game-console gals are unforgettably hilarious and consistently endearing, but there’s been nothing consistent about the Neptunia video games as of late. Each one has been a standalone spinoff adventure with their own canon and their own gameplay – and rather than building off the previous games to improve and expand, each one seeks to rebuild the wheel and comes out equally rough as a result. Despite lifting a lot of the combat and gameplay from its predecessor, <em>Neptunia Sisters VS Sisters, </em>the same issues persist with <em>Neptunia Game Maker (R)evolution.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Neptunia Game Maker R:Evolution - Teaser Trailer (NA) | PS4/PS5, Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAE-Mr9_ZxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For fans of the characters and lore in the Neptunia series, I’d say that’s the strongest aspect of <em>Neptunia Game Maker (R)evolution</em> <em>by far. </em>For one thing, longtime fans will appreciate that the protagonist of this game is Older Neptune, a dimension-hopping variant of the usual protagonist Neptune who we haven’t seen since she appeared in what’s arguably the last mainline entry in the game series – <em>Megadimension Neptunia VII. </em>This time around, she’s in a new dimension and helping three failed game console goddesses turn their luck around and form a thriving game company kingdom.</p>


<p>My favorite part of a Neptunia game is seeing what real-life consoles and game series they turn into an adorable anime girl, and this game might have some of my new favourites. Your three girl-failure goddesses are Pippeh, Jagaa, and Reedio – based on the real life Apple Pippin, Atari Jaguar, and 3DO consoles respectively. I’m obsessed with the sporty cat-girl look Jagaa rocks despite being a math-obsessed weirdo, and the playful quirky mad-scientist vibes of Reedio are top-notch.</p>
<p>It’s just a shame that these incredible new characters are strapped to such an unfun video game. <em>Neptunia Game Maker (R)evolution</em> is a blend of the dungeon-crawling action combat of the last game and a light, management-sim style game company management mode. Neither half is all that well developed, though, and they never come together to form a cohesive whole. For the dungeon-crawling side, combat is tedious, floaty, slow and repetitive. Your attack animations have no weight to them, and dodging is so inconsistent that your best option is to mash attacks and character-swaps rather than play in any kind of cerebral manner.</p>


<p>Some enemies will be twenty levels lower than you but be as tanky as an end-game boss. Others will be twenty levels higher than you and die in an instant. Everything about it is inconsistent and unrewarding, and my only highlights are the auxiliary features you get to toy around with outside of battle – like character costume customization or the genuinely fun driveable motorcycle Older Neptune can bust out in any dungeon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the management-sim section is incredibly light on management, simulation, and fun. You’re tasked with taking requests to develop new games, find the developers to make those games, and ship titles that will earn you points and acclaim for your goddesses. A lot of this flows through the dungeon-combat – you’ll get points from exploring those, and spend them on the company to recruit new developers and create game discs that both fulfill requests and also add buffs to your team. It’s full of charm, with all the developers you recruit and structures you build being packed full of references – it just isn’t very deep. It all comes across more like a mini-game than a major element of the package, and it’s the piece of the package that I desperately wish had more focus and depth.</p>

<p>I’m a Nep Nep lover for life, but if anyone is looking to get into the series for the first time or have a fun time revisiting the world, <em>Neptunia Game Maker (R)evolution</em> is not the best choice. These characters deserve so much better, and I can only hope with as many fumbles as they’ve been through with these last few entries, the next one finally does right by our game goddesses.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Neptunia Game Maker (R)evolution is another stinker in a long line of disappointing Neptunia series entries. I love these characters and their world, but this is a flat action-RPG with a barebones management game bolted onto it that do not do them right by any means.	</p></div>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/13/assassins-creed-shadows-to-be-revealed-on-wednesday-the-new-name-for-assassins-creed-red/">The full announcement</a> of what was previously known as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/10/assassins-creed-codename-red-is-going-to-japan-codename-hexe-infinity-also-confirmed/">Codename Red</a> will come tomorrow 15th May, but Ubisoft has the trailers already in place on their various global YouTube channels waiting for the 5PM BST go time. Unfortunately some of these pages were pushed live with more details than they should have had, <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1790079437662285907">letting slip ahead of time</a> that the game will be coming out on 15th November – these pages have since been edited to remove the information.</p>


<p>Additionally, a dataminer by the online handle of Frax (who&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft_Frax/status/1790016089226608779" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separately leaked the game’s name before Monday’s announcement</a>, has now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1cr0b7e/assassins_creed_shadows_season_pass_ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed to know AC Shadow’s DLC plans</a>.</p>
<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows Season Pass will come in at $40 / £40 and feature two expansions, some in-game currency, and an exclusive questline called ‘Origami Killer’ – presumably there will be a lot of Heavy Rain and kidnapped children during this quest. The Ultimate Edition will also give owners five ‘skill points’, and there’s a pre-order bonus called ‘Thrown to the Dogs’.</p>
<p>We’ll see if all of that pans out tomorrow.</p>

<p>A long-awaited, much requested game set in Feudal Japan, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is certainly an evocative name for a game about a Japanese assassin, with the game pretty much guaranteed to cast you as a neophyte ninja as you delve into local politics and threats to the status quo by getting up close for some AC-style stabbing.</p>
<p>The game was first teased in September 2022 under the codename Red, though obviously very little was revealed at that time outside of the setting and the overarching form. This will&nbsp;build on the open world RPG foundations of the last few mainline entries, though it will be interesting to see if <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/04/assassins-creed-mirage-review/">Assassin’s Creed Mirage</a> has any influence on it, as a DLC-turned-game that returned to AC’s roots.</p>

		<p>Evil Empire has announced a new Steam Early Access release date for The Rogue Prince of Persia, having nudged the game’s preview release back in the wake of Hades II’s own Early Access release.&nbsp;The Rogue Prince of Persia will now head into Steam Early Access on 27th May.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Rogue Prince of Persia: New Release Date trailer ????" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GN4ErNC4iw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Seeing as everyone and their mum is playing that game (including our entire team… and their mums),” Evil Empire wrote last week, “we have decided to let people have their fun with it before we release The Rogue Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>“While we have every confidence in The Rogue Prince of Persia, it’s not every day that a game in the same genre as you, which is one of the most anticipated upcoming games of 2024, will release into Early Access a week before you plan to do the same.”</p>
<p>The decision made an awful lot of sense, in the same way that publishers and developers will almost certainly flee whatever release window Rockstar settles on for GTA 6. On top of that, Hades II and The Rogue Prince of Persia both inhabit similar space within the roguelike genre, though Hades II blends it with an action RPG and The Rogue Prince of Persia with an action platformer.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/12/dead-cells-co-devs-reveal-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-roguelike-alpha-sign-ups-now-live-with-early-access-in-may/">Announced just last month</a>, the game traps the Prince in a never-ending cycle of roguelike death. His bola, which was gifted to him as a baby, constantly resurrects him to the last truly safe place he was in before he dies, with this safety net both allowing to master formidable acrobatic and combat techniques, but also leading to rash actions that have triggered an invasion by Huns.</p>
<p>There’s good reason to be excited for this, as developer&nbsp;Evil Empire was spawned out of original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> developer Motion Twin. Back in 2019, Motion Twin started work on a new project, but spun off the Dead Cells team into a separate entity to keep on supporting their hit game. It remained a cross-studio effort though, with Motion Twin and Evil Empire bringing numerous updates and expansions to the game in the years since, culminating the the fourth and final paid expansion <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/13/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-review/">Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania</a>, which launched in March 2023. The final significant update for Dead Cells was released in 2024, with both studios moving on to new and separate projects – Motion Twin on a game called Windblown, with Evil Empire now revealed to have partnered with Ubisoft.</p>
<p>They’re part of a resurgence for the Prince of Persia franchise, this game coming&nbsp;just a few months after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/11/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review/">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, and with Ubisoft keen to embrace a variety of different genres, experiences and production styles with the series once more.</p>

			<p>I’ve enjoyed handheld gaming ever since playing the original Game Boy while in secondary school – yes, I’m old – but I’ve never really engaged with mobile games outside of the occasional game of Candy Crush during a boring commute. There are a number of reasons for this, but the main problem I have is the clunkiness of on-screen controls for any kind of traditional game. Unless a game is specifically designed for a touchscreen (Monument Valley for example) it’s generally a no from me. This blind spot in my gaming is increasingly unfortunate as modern phones can be capable of standout experiences, whether through ports, streaming, or emulation. With this in mind I was excited to try out the Gamesir X2s, the latest in an increasingly competitive range of devices that can turn your phone into something more closely resembling a standard controller.</p>

<p>With most modern controllers working via Bluetooth connection, it’s relatively easy to use your Xbox, PS5, or Switch gamepad with your phone, but the ergonomics of such a solution offers its own set of problems, as you either need to prop up your device or have a cumbersome phone holder that totally throws off the weight balance of the controller. It’s for that reason that companies like Gamesir, Razer and Backbone have produced wrap-around controllers to transform a phone into something closer to a Switch or Steam Deck. The Gamesir X2s is the latest of these – iterating on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/07/gamesir-x2-mobile-controller-review/">Gamesir X2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/06/gamesir-x2-pro-mobile-controller-review/">X2 Pro</a> – and offers some great features and performance for a very affordable price of £59.99.</p>


<p>Unboxing the X2s reveals a well designed piece of kit. The pastel grey/violet colour scheme is nice and distinctive, paying just the right amount of homage to retro consoles, but most importantly, the buttons are all well placed, have the contemporary Xbox layout and ABXY labels, and feel responsive. The asymmetrical analogue sticks also use Hall Effect sensors to avoid the stick drift that has come to plague many modern controllers. These sticks are well calibrated and offer a good hand feel, especially in game ports that are clearly designed for regular controls. The one ding is that it’s a form factor with contours without full hand grips, which could lead to some discomfort – if that bothers you, look to the pricier Gamesir <span id="productTitle">G8 Galileo.</span></p>
<p>The X2s clamps around your phone with a rubberised cradle to ensure it keeps your much more expensive device in place, with support for phones up to 168mm long. It connects via USB-C, so will have almost universal support for Android phones, alongside the iPhone 15 and future generations of Apple phones. A pass-through USB-C port tucked under your left palm means that you can also charge while playing. This means that you could comfortably keep the X2s on your phone if you have a pocket or bag to pop it in, and it’s super convenient for commutes where you need to change bus or train (or get off and go to the office to actually work).</p>


<p>So the look and feel check the boxes but what about ease of use? Unlike a Bluetooth connection, the inbuilt USB-C makes for an instant connection with no lag, and there’s no separate battery to keep charged between gaming sessions. Most games I tested on my Samsung phone automatically detected the gamepad too, although you should make sure that you fully close down an application before opening a new one to avoid it remaining being linked to the old one. For testing I finally made use of the range of games that Netflix have to offer (given the strength of their recent output, it was nice to make full use of my subscription), and almost all worked flawlessly – unfortunately <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/17/deaths-door-review/">Death’s Door</a> didn’t want to install for me.</p>
<p>First up was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/06/dead-cells-review/">Dead Cells</a>, a game that requires smooth controls and fast reactions. Loading times on my phone were long, but once it had loaded, it played perfectly and is an ideal choice for commuting play. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">TMNT Shredder’s Revenge</a> was equally well suited and helped several commutes pass in a more entertaining way than usual. I then tried a couple of emulated titles and, once set up via the app settings, these were also flawless. Finally, I tested streaming via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> and PlayStation Remote Play and this was easily good enough that I think it justifies the price of entry alone – certainly, you’re getting more bang for your buck than with a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/playstation-portal-review/">PS Portal</a>!</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Gamesir X2S is a great option for mobile gaming, offering as it does fantastic controls and a well-designed form factor. My only real complaint is the lack of grips on the back, but that’s a personal preference rather than a flaw. If mobile gaming is a part of your routine – or you might want it to be – then this is well worth the price.	</p></div>

		<p>Bungie’s 1994 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398450/Classic_Marathon/">Classic Marathon is now free to download from Steam</a>, thanks to the fan development team Aleph One Developers. Marathon released all the way back in 1994, an early compatriot to Doom that was a Mac exclusive before spreading to PC with its sequel. It had a story focused on AI, time travel, and aliens, which laid the influential groundwork for Bungie’s Halo series.</p>
<p><iframe title="Classic Marathon [STEAM TRAILER]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tXK9axp-N1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Steam description for Classic Marathon says, <em>“Alien forces have boarded the colony ship UESC Marathon in the Tau Ceti system, in orbit around humanity’s first interstellar colony. The situation is dire, and as a security officer assigned to the Marathon, your duty is to defend the ship and its crew from the alien threat.</em></p>
<p><em>This classic 1994 Bungie™ FPS had a foundational influence on the genre, and is now maintained by the fan community. Experience authentic game play using the original data files, with optional widescreen HUD support, 3D filtering/perspective, positional audio, and 60+ fps interpolation, just in case the original is&nbsp;too authentic. Classic Marathon is powered by the Aleph One engine, which is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3.”</em></p>

<p>Classic Marathon is the first game of the Marathon trilogy to now be available on Steam. Both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398490/Classic_Marathon_2/">Classic Marathon 2</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398520/Classic_Marathon_Infinity/">Classic Marathon Infinity</a> have Steam pages too, but are not yet available. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/bungie-announce-some-kind-of-marathon-remake/">Bungie announced a PvP-only Marathon reboot for PS5, Xbox Series and PC</a>, last year. At the time of the announcement Game Director Christopher Barrett said, <em>“Marathon is designed from the start as a PvP-focused game and won’t have a single-player campaign. Instead, with the PvP experience as our foundation, we’re creating opportunities for player-driven stories to unfold, stories that are integrated with the overarching game narrative. We’re building a world full of persistent, evolving zones, where players create their own journey with every run they take. That might mean an unforgettable firefight against another crew vying for the same loot, or a last-second extraction while beset on all sides.”</em></p>

			<p>The wait for a third Homeworld game has finally come to an end. The pioneering 3D space RTS was a brilliant sun flare of excellence at the turn of the millennium, but faded into an almost mythological status amidst acquisitions, IP purchases and more. After a two decades wait, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/homeworld-3">Homeworld 3</a> is ready for launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Homeworld 3 | War Games – Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lmQ56YpYaAA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Homeworld remains one of the outright coolest strategy games I can think of, though that admittedly comes from a relatively juvenile male perspective on space and military actions, real and imagined – this game series lives in the same pantheon as the 2000s Battlestar Galactica’s most action-packed episodes. The crackle of unit comms, the professional and controlled tone of voice, the design of the ships and the cinematic mass fleet actions were excellent in 1999 and that same tone and style persists through to Homeworld 3.</p>


<p>It’s around a century on from the events of Homeworld 2, with the Hiigarans the presiding empire in the galaxy and an age of abundance thanks to the Hyperspace Gate Network, but all is not well. There’s the looming threat of The Anomaly, and Karan S’Jet’s expeditionary fleet disappeared decades ago. When massive planet destroying attacks hit a number of planets on the fringes of the Anomaly’s territory, a new fleet is launched with Karan’s granddaughter Imogen plugging herself into the new Mothership and overcoming her initial doubts and fears, teaming up with the steady Isaac Paktu (Ike Amadi) as the fleet’s Intel officer – he honestly has <em>exactly</em> the right voice for this role.</p>
<p>It’s another desperate journey across the galaxy, facing another unknown and daunting enemy in a retread of the arcs from the first two games, but Homeworld 3 puts a lot more personality into the tale than before. In contrast to the cool and detached nature of the fleet combat, this aims to be a more personal story, putting these characters before you through lavishly rendered cutscenes between missions. Doing that, though, leans very heavily into a messianic story arc for Imogen and the S’Jet family as a whole.</p>


<p>There’s a good flow of mission styles through the campaign. Starting off under pressure and on the run, you rebuild your military strength, start to strike back against the Incarnate and force a final battle against the Incarnate seat of power. Through this there’s missions big and small, there’s a defensive battle to hold a line almost like it’s a tower defence mission, a stealthier mission where discretion is the best path to follow, an epic confrontation with a whole shipyard that challenges you from multiple directions, and more.</p>
<p>Each and every mission here leans into the megalith structures that are the big new feature for Homeworld 3. Where earlier games were almost exclusively in the open void of space, level scenery is a constant in Homeworld 3, whether it’s vast Progenitor constructs or sometimes inexplicable natural formations. It helps bring some great set dressing to each level, providing some new tactical options and challenges in the process, as objects can provide cover for both stealth and avoiding damage, which units in certain modes will use on approach, and tunnels are often placed to provide covert flanking routes – important to use to get the drop on enemy Frigates and Capital Ships that have much less armour at the rear. That said, having such massive structures leads to some levels feeling very constrained and directed, which is a strange feeling for a space game.</p>
<p>This also puts greater demands on unit pathfinding and the controls for issuing commands, and the game doesn’t quite hit the mark here, as units feel sluggish to respond and commands a bit inconsistent. The contextual right click isn’t wholly predictable in whether it will bring up the move disc (which you can bring up with ‘V’) or direct units to a piece of scenery, and I was forever blighted by mis-clicks, because holding right click enables camera rotation. Obviously you can work around this, but it’s a bit of an annoyance. For the diehard series fans there’s options for Modern, Legacy and blended controls, with full rebinding of keys.</p>

<p>Then there’s the difficulty I felt in setting effective command groups or pinpointing specific units to give commands to. Units are overlaid with class-specific icons, and you can get a cleaner understanding with the Sensor view, but in the middle of battle it all descends into a bit of mush. On standard difficulty I split my fleet in two at most, once I had a secondary carrier that could support production elsewhere, and would largely just select all and do an attack box. The unit abilities are much simplified and more direct, focussing on special attacks and stat buffs as opposed to tactical support for a group, so I’d just break those out to target the highest priority enemy being thrown my direction.</p>
<p>One of the real saving graces here is the tactical pause and adjustable game speed – with 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% – which really helps with managing your fleet during the campaign… though obviously isn’t an option online. You don’t get proper feedback for commands issued at full pause until you resume, so 25% is often the best option if you’re under pressure.</p>

<p>Alongside the story campaign, you naturally have skirmish mode against AI and support for online multiplayer, but there’s also War Games, a roguelite mode that can be played in short one hour burst with up to three players.</p>
<p>Each run takes you through three stages, the first two of which give you different missions like retrieving power cores, trying to rescue civilian ships, and the like, before a final grand encounter with multiple firm objectives and a climactic encounter with a capital ship. Through this you can retrieve artefacts that let you pick from ship-boosting perks, feeding into an overarching progression that unlocks different fleet styles to choose from.</p>
<p>It’s generally a fine mode, and a good compliment to co-op skirmishes against AI, but the focus is rather narrowed by only having a small subset of ships to play with. The intention here, of course, is that you pick complimentary fleets in co-op and focus on particular frigates, helping you deal with the greater challenges provided by higher difficulties. A standard run might take around an hour, but as you ramp up the difficulty, gruelling battles might take longer.</p>
<p>Disappointingly, we saw some connectivity hiccups while playing for review – though this was ahead of the day one update. Our partner (who was actually hosting) got disconnected right before the final fight, and they ended up with nothing for their time and efforts. The game migrated over to me, giving control of both fleets all of a sudden. Hopefully this issue can be resolved by the launch update or shortly afterwards, along with further improved pathfinding and other snags. Blackbird was able to make good changes between the War Games demo in February and launch, and there’s a year-long plan for post-launch content updates with new maps, challenges, and paid DLC factions.</p>

			<p>Can <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/disney-speedstorm">Disney Speedstorm</a> be considered a rival to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo">Nintendo</a>’s near-unstoppable <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-8">Mario Kart 8</a>? While the kart-racing subgenre has seen a good few new entries since the moustachioed motorist and his entourage sped their way to glory on the Wii U almost a decade ago, few have come close to a podium finish, let alone besting what many consider the finest kart racing game of all time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Disney Speedstorm - CGI Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kIO2_rahZmA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Disney Speedstorm having just celebrated its first anniversary, I decided to give it another go. Not since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/21/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-review-ps4-xbox-switch/">Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled</a> have I put as much time into one of these games, especially one that is so unabashedly free-to-play. Speedstorm’s hook is impossible to miss: a supercharged kart racer from Asphalt developers, Gameloft, overflowing with Disney icons, old and new.</p>


<p>I’m no Disney die-hard yet I definitely saw the novelty value of having Donald Duck trading paint with the likes of Mulan and Mowgli while tearing around a besieged pirate ship circuit, dodging the tentacles of a giant Kraken. With that said, I didn’t stick around for long when Disney Speedstorm first launched last year. I didn’t have time for a free-to-play grind and knew that, if I returned several months later, there would be far more content for me to enjoy.</p>


<p>Getting back behind the wheel now was a smart choice, allowing me to enjoy a far greater number of tracks and racers, while also benefiting from recent updates that have streamlined the bloated character progression system. Speaking of characters, this is where Speedstorm shines the most, grouping Disney heroes and villains into one of several classes. It’s an approach we’ve seen in other kart racers – most notably <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/17/team-sonic-racing-review/">Team Sonic Racing</a> – but here it actually works. The type of racer you choose will determine which power-ups are available, their effectiveness scaling as you level up. For example, Brawler-type racers rely on combat skills to sow chaos whereas Defenders look to maintain their position by dodging and blocking any hazards that come their way. On top of that, each racer has their own unique pair of skills. Aladdin’s nemesis, Jafar, will spew great gouts of flame from his serpent staff while other heroes are slightly more technical. Take the newly-added Fix-It Felix, for example: one of his skills activates a flurry of hammers that will grant invulnerability to himself and nearby racers, catapulting him forward with a massive speed boost if he successfully repairs enough karts.</p>
<p>Speedstorm also manages to capture the look of its crossover cast wonderfully, mashing together decades of different Disney animation styles, both 2D and 3D. Clad in their uniquely designed motorsport jumpsuits, their rides are similarly inspired with an array of custom liveries, wheels, and vanity plates up for grabs. With a few exceptions, these characters are fully voiced, and though some sound a little off, other voices are pretty much spot on in their likeness. Gameloft also delves into decades of classic Disney songs for its Speedstorm soundtrack, remixing them to match the game’s own frenetic energy.</p>

<p>Once that initial novelty wears off from the first few races, where can you go next? Speedstorm offers a series of solo races that changes every season, gradually ramping up the challenge while offering better rewards. Most of the time you’ll be battling it out in standard head-on races though tracks and formats are liable to change: for example, there will be races that feature a higher number of aerial lifts, as well as races that exclusively focus on one power-up type.</p>
<p>The car handling is fairly forgiving and easy to pick up with a simple drift mechanic that feeds into your boost meter. However, as you push into the late game, Speedstorm becomes more technical: karts will be fast master, and obstacles come in thick and fast, requiring precise jumps, rail grinds, and other advanced moves. Once you’ve nailed the basics in solo play, you can also throw down against other humans online, in ranked or regulated matchmaking.</p>
<p>Compared to Mario Kart, races don’t feel half as long. There’s a fierce tempo to Speedstorm with racers typically belting around each track without anyone getting too far ahead of the pack. It can often feel scrappy and chaotic though the brevity of each race means you can cross the finish line, then immediately dive into the next one without needing to wait. For a game that has a large player base on mobile, that’s pretty important. In fact, there’s plenty here to suggest that Disney Speedstorm has always been a mobile-first title, without even mentioning Gameloft’s extensive track record. That’s not to say it doesn’t play well on other systems, and thanks to its seamless cross-platform progression, I’ve split my total playtime between the mobile, PS5, and PC (Steam Deck) versions, which has been a great experience.</p>

<p>So what about monetisation? Speedstorm has an in-game shop loaded with playable and cosmetic content as well as its own battle pass, loot boxes, and progression boosts. If there’s a particular Disney character you wish to unlock you’ll need to either grind out shards (which can take weeks of regular play) or buy them outright via in-game currency or character bundles. Some racers are especially elusive: for example, if you’re looking to add Frozen’s Elsa to your roster, you’ll need to wait for limited events and boxes to appear to even have a shot at earning shards. Unsurprisingly, the most effective way of collecting characters is to sntap up each season pass. After recent changes to how this system works, expect to gain easy access to at least two or three characters each season, as well as a smattering of shards for a seemingly random selection of other non-featured characters, unlocked by completing season chapters.</p>

		<p>Ever since <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a> started on their spending spree of acquisitions in 2018, gamers have feared the worst. Would Microsoft simply out-spend <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a> to secure market dominance? Would <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation">PlayStation</a> gamers be deprived of innumerable great games? Were they building <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/game-pass">Game Pass</a> into a video gaming Death Star?</p>
<p>It turns out we should have feared the opposite. Death Stars do have a tendency to blow up, after all…</p>
<p>The past six months – pretty much ever since Microsoft closed the staggeringly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/13/microsoft-now-owns-activision-blizzard/">huge acquisition</a> of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/activision">Activision</a> <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/blizzard">Blizzard</a> King – has seen almost every aspect of Xbox as a platform thrown into doubt. From first party games being console exclusives, to potentially quitting the hardware business, and now even the mere continued existence of their expensively acquired studios, there’s a complete lack of certainty to where the Xbox business is heading.</p>


<p>This week’s closure of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/tango-gameworks">Tango Gameworks</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/arkane">Arkane</a> Austin, and Alpha Dog Studios, and Roundhouse Games’ integration elsewhere came as a massive shock. Arkane Austin’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/redfall">Redfall</a> was a flop, there’s no denying that, and the fact of the matter is that, even if a studio has been pushed down a particular path by management, no team is truly immune to failure. But Tango’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> wasn’t a failure, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/05/hi-fi-rush-review/">far from it</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_405022"><p id="caption-attachment-405022">This time last year Hi-Fi Rush was held up as a shining example of what Xbox can do. Tango won’t have a chance to make a sequel.</p>
</div>
<p>Here was a game that potentially proved Microsoft’s plan from the end of the last generation. Hi-Fi Rush was a smaller production, a cheaper release and an eye-catching addition to the Xbox Game Pass library. It snagged <a href="https://x.com/hifiRush/status/1691846131548913781">3 million players in just a few months</a>, but it helps that it was a critical darling that ended up as a genuine Game of the Year contender, but it just did very well in general. “Hi-Fi Rush was a break out hit for us and our players in all key measurements and expectations,” Xbox marketing exec <a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1649431572137779203%7Ctwgr%5E74cd5ff9c5902cc2ef188d57605371b8edd4f677%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F5%2F8%2F24152137%2Fxbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">Aaron Greenberg tweeted</a> a couple months after its release.</p>
<p>Reports suggest that the nail in the coffin for both studios was that, as they pitched new games – a Hi-Fi Rush sequel and a new immersive sim, potentially in the popular <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dishonored">Dishonored</a> universe – they requested more manpower. Instead of saying they should adjust and make do with what they’ve got, they decided less manpower was the answer. Xbox Game Studios’ head Matt Booty’s internal email said that closing both teams will “create capacity to increase investment in other parts of our portfolio and focus on our priority games.” Head of ZeniMax studios Jill Braff, meanwhile, suggested Bethesda had become too big to manage – “It’s hard to support nine studios all across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do,” she said. “I think we were about to topple over.”</p>
<p>Maybe you could <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-a-staggering-1900-people-across-xbox-activision-zenimax/">hire back some of the people you let go in January to help out</a>?</p>
<p>What’s particularly galling about this claim is that <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1788356295667466320">Booty has since gone on to say</a> “We need smaller games that give us prestige and awards” during a Microsoft town hall meeting. A statement that presumably saw an awful lot of pillows being used to muffle screams from employees.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-446423">The first Hellblade was an indie success, but how will the sequel be judged? And what will that mean for Ninja Theory?</p>
<p>Between such statements and these actions, it’s looking ominous for almost every non-Activision studio owned by Microsoft. Closing down Tango wasn’t even from the “what have you done for me lately?” school of business like Arkane’s might have been – Booty claims otherwise – and suddenly you might be fearful for what awaits <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ninja-theory">Ninja Theory</a> after they ship <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/hellblade-2">Hellblade 2</a> in less than two weeks. Microsoft was confident enough to use the game alongside the Xbox Series X announcement, give the studio more time and more resources to work, and it’s expected to garner plenty of praise much like the original… but is that enough anymore?</p>
<p>By contrast, Obsidian’s recent track record feels like they should be comparatively safe. They’ve produced a couple of those desirable award-winning smaller games, and have a pair of bigger ones in the pipeline as well, but if Xbox also wants to focus on “priority games”, then Fallout could well be in their future after Avowed and The Outer Worlds 2.</p>
<p>But there’s also all the studios and projects that are reportedly struggling on their way through protracted development cycles. Perfect Dark is in all sorts of difficulties, and a “big, protracted mess,” <a href="https://x.com/Doctor_Cupcakes/status/1787973283486515599">according to video game historian Liam Robertson</a> and several other sources, we’ve heard nothing about Rare’s Everwild since a reported project reboot in 2021, and all we’ve ever seen about Undead Labs and State of Decay 3 is its 2020 CGI announcement – far from the only game which has had a single announcement trailer to pad out an Xbox showcase.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Perfect Dark - Official Announce Trailer - The Game Awards 2020" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S--lFTxAVs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Games take longer than ever to make, but&nbsp;we’ve now got no idea where Microsoft’s patience begins and ends. Do any of these teams feel particularly safe now? Certainly not when there’s already <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/xbox-studio-closures-microsoft-plans-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-layoffs?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxNTE5ODUzNywiZXhwIjoxNzE1ODAzMzM3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRDZOSzZEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Ae8Wc_YmUJla6VHol8aa5AIVOUAmdYTiRnQ2nKph6NY">reports of more cuts on the way</a>.</p>
<p>Really, the one bankable certainty is that <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> is going to do Call of Duty things later this year, and completely dwarf whatever the rest of Microsoft’s game studios is able to do. That’s potentially the problem, as the acquisition of Activision Blizzard has completely changed the scale on the quarterly revenues graph, the measure stick of success is suddenly much bigger.</p>
<p>We’re almost six years on from the start of Microsoft’s spending spree, and while there’s definitely some promising and enticing games in the works – we can expect a barrage of trailers, announcements at positive spin next month – but it’s far from clear what the plan really is anymore. The last six months have felt about as rudderless as the final days of a Tory government that (outside of spitefully salting the earth for their inevitable successors) has no purpose other than trying to shake every last penny out of the purse.</p>
<p>Video games might be a lucrative business, but they’re also a passion-filled creative endeavour. Whatever the next plan or the plan after that ends up being, try to remember that, Xbox.</p>

		<p>In one of the most double-think statements ever made outside of George Orwell’s 1984,&nbsp;Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty has told employees that “We need smaller games that give us prestige and awards,” just one day <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">after closing down the game studio that was responsible</a> for the prestigious award-winning game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">Hi-Fi Rush</a>.</p>
<p>The statement was made during a town hall meeting for employees with Booty discussing the future goals for Xbox Game Studios, with those internal remarks then shared with The Verge.</p>


<p>It’s not currently clear how many computers were immediately doused in jets of coffee and tea from attendees, but let’s just say that some people were surprised to hear Booty say this considering that Microsoft has just shut down Japanese developer Tango Gameworks.</p>
<p>The studio released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> at the start of 2023 during an Xbox showcase, and went on to be a surprise hit. Blending together rhythm action mechanics with Bayonetta-esque combat, a chunky cel shaded art style and a great licensed soundtrack, it struck a chord with the community and picked up <a href="https://x.com/hifiRush/status/1691846131548913781">three million players within its first few months</a>. It stuck in people’s memories come awards season as well, snagging <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/29/game-of-the-year-2023-best-xbox-game/">several Game of the Year awards</a> in various categories.</p>
<p>Microsoft was absolutely chuffed with the game through with Xbox marketing exec <a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203">Aaron Greenberg tweeting</a> that it “was a break out hit for us and our players in all key measurements and expectations.”</p>

<p>Sales figures have not been shared, and that player count was naturally heavily tied together with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>, with Microsoft launching first party games day and date onto the game library service. However, it also comes with a budget price that should help with sales volume for non-subscribers.</p>
<p>Tango Gameworks were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-2-potential-new-dishonored-were-reportedly-being-pitched-by-now-closed-xbox-studios">reportedly pitching a sequel</a> to their higher ups prior to being shut down. A sticking point was apparently that they were requesting more resources to back the project, which Microsoft decided against. When informing staff of the closures of Tango Gameworks, Arkane Austin and Alpha Dog Studios, Booty said that closing these studios will “create capacity to increase investment in other parts of our portfolio and focus on our priority games.”</p>
<p>Speaking of priority games and franchises, <a href="https://twitter.com/sam_snydes/status/1788414778253123985">someone nuked Phil Spencer’s base in Fallout 76</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/09/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-review-ps5-xbox-ps4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2</a> long-awaited release scheduled for later this year, there’s been an unsurprising spike in interest surrounding the original trilogy which debuted on PC almost two decades ago. Capitalising on this curiosity, Ukrainian publisher <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/gsc-game-worlds">GSC</a> recently launched <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy">STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy</a>, bringing the three games to Xbox and PlayStation for the first time.</p>
<p>The trilogy marks an opportune gateway into the STALKER series, but it comes with one major caveat. Despite the visual and quality of life improvements, these games have not really been rebuilt or redesigned with a console audience in mind. They also hail from an era in which first person shooters didn’t all ascribe to a similar, Call of Duty-like template.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5zKZTRNRSls?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As the developers claim, the trilogy has been preserved – warts and all – but with some of those rough edges rounded off to make the games playable with a gamepad on newer consoles. In that respect alone, it’s a success, and although some players might baulk at the lack of hand-holding and other modern gaming comforts, the STALKER trilogy will give you an appreciation for what the developers wanted to achieve back in 2007 and how the series’ mechanics, setting, and storytelling evolved. Most of all, it helps lay the groundwork for the upcoming sequel.</p>
<p>Heavily inspired by Andrei Tarkovsky’s Stalker – a 70s sci-fi film based on the novel, Roadside Picnic – this isn’t the kind of bizarre retro futuristic post-apocalypse portrayed in the Fallout franchise. STALKER is grim, grey, and lonely, with players left to fend for themselves within sprawling radioactive sandboxes where warring factions lay in ambush, mutated beasts roam, and where indescribable anomalies can materialise from out of nowhere.</p>

<p>Best described as first person survival games, you’ll run errands for various NPCs while also making sure you’re fed and free of radiation, building and maintaining loadouts of gear and weapons you’ve either scavenged or traded for. The survival mechanics aren’t as in-depth as we now see in most modern survival sims that heavily feature crafting and base-building systems. This works in STALKER’s favour, with survival elements helping to amp up the immersion without obstructing the player’s path between missions.</p>

<p>Shadow of Chernobyl is where the STALKER saga begins and it is, unsurprisingly, the toughest of the three games for PlayStation and Xbox players to acclimatise to. Although it does feature some handy signposting to help navigate its open world, the gunplay lacks finesse and inventory management and menus throw up obstacles. A lack of fast travel or vehicles also means that you’ll spend long stretches sprinting between distant objectives, though clear attempts have been made to populate the world with points of interest to make travelling across the Zone feel like a proper post-apocalyptic odyssey. You might come upon abandoned stashes of weapons and equipment, stumble into a gunfight between STALKER and military forces, or suddenly be chased by a strange ball of lightning.</p>
<p>Clear Sky launched around 18 months after the original STALKER and serves as a narrative prequel. As Scar, a hired gun originally tasked with escorting scientists into the Zone, you somehow survive a catastrophic blast emanating from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant that wipes out your squad. Rescued by Clear Sky, an organisation looking to unearth the secrets behind the Zone’s anomalies, you’re reintroduced to STALKER’s hazardous wasteland with new areas and survival mechanics to explore. The shooting gameplay feels a little tighter here, with Clear Sky adding a slew of weapon customisation options as well as full-on faction battles that will see survivor squadrons engage in tense gunfights as they scrap for territory across an ever-moving frontline.</p>

<p>Call of Pripyat closes out the original STALKER trilogy, and is easily the most polished and refined game of the three. It embodies the same isolated atmosphere and nonlinear, open world design seen in Shadow of Chernobyl and although menus can still prove fiddly for controller-wielding survivors, it’s a smoother, more forgiving all-round experience that dials up the story-telling and world-building while still allowing players to venture out and create their own unique survival stories through moments of emergent gameplay.</p>
<p>The closest comparison that comes to mind while playing the STALKER trilogy is <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metro-exodus">Metro Exodus</a>, which should come as no surprise considering that series developer, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/4a-games">4A Games</a>, was founded by former GSC developers. As we’ve already mentioned, the rusty gunplay in STALKER isn’t as frenetic or sharp as, say, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a>, though fans have come to appreciate this roughness as another immersion technique. Guns jam, monsters swarm, and human enemies showing a surprising amount of adaptability as they outflank you and search for cover –&nbsp;something that becomes increasingly more dynamic throughout the trilogy. It all combines to add a level of desperation to each scrappy skirmish you run into.</p>

<p>On the sliding scale of remasters, the Legends of the Zone Trilogy is more of a port rather than an attempt to give these games a total makeover. Performance-wise, they run smoothly though character models, animations, environments detail, and lighting have been left almost entirely unchanged. To reiterate, the trilogy presents console players with an opportunity to play through these STALKER titles in the same condition that PC players have been able to experience them for the last decade and a half. As someone who struggled to get them running on my own PC back around the time they launched, being able to finally venture into the Zone on console has been immensely satisfying, even if these ageing first person shooters don’t cater for modern gamer sensibilities.</p>
<p>As for STALKER 2, after many years of waiting, fans will once again be reunited with the series when it launches later this year on September 5, 2024 for PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

		<p>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code+ is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC. With a ‘+’ at the end of the game name, this is an enhanced version of the game that first launched on Nintendo Switch last June, giving it around one year of timed exclusivity.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> The game is launching on 18th July in Japan, with a Western release on 1st October 2024. Strangely, the Western release was picked up and reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-launches-october-1-in-the-west">Gematsu</a>, but the Spike Chunsoft page and trailer are not live.</em></p>


<p><em><strong>Update 2:</strong> We’ve received a press release and new trailer confirming the Western release on 1st October.</em></p>

<p>Coming from the minds behind the Danganronpa series, Master Detective Archives: Rain Code casts you as an amnesia detective in training named Yuma, haunted by Shinigami who helps to tackle unsolved mysteries in a city that’s subjected to constant rain. As you investigate mysteries, the Mystery Labyrinth is gradually opened up to you, giving you a path to the truth at the heart of the case, though with the danger that reality does not apply within this realm.</p>
<p>We had a grand old time with the game on Switch, with Reu saying in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/30/master-detective-archives-rain-code-review/">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code review</a> “If you can look past (or appreciate) the brazen clichés and huge levels of fan service, Master Detective Archives: Rain Code is a phenomenal murder mystery visual novel. The gorgeous world, wonderful characters and genuinely well-constructed mysteries combine into a thoroughly enjoyable if bizarre experience. If other similar games like Danganronpa or Ace Attorney are your bag, this is definitely worth investigating.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/08/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-preview-escape-the-klownpocalypse/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As a lover of both asymmetrical multiplayer games and horror in general, the idea of Killer Klowns from Outer Space really caught my imagination. Co-developers&nbsp;IllFonic are no strangers to this style of game, having previously tapped into other 80s film franchises and adapted them to asymmetrical multiplayer with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/friday-the-13th-the-game-is-being-removed-from-sale/">Friday the 13th: The Game</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/27/predator-hunting-grounds-review-ps4-pc/">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/26/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed-review/">Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed</a>.</p>
<p>Each game shares a lot of common ground – the goal is still for the Klowns to track down the humans, prevent them from escaping and kill them – but Killer Klowns puts its own spin on things. It of course bears a similar game style to Friday the 13th, but on a grander scale, with a team of three Klowns hunting seven humans.</p>
<p><iframe title="How To Survive A Killer Klowns Invasion" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Dq3NrszLYQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>My first match had me head into the carnival at night as a human, but I quickly felt at home with the controls and game’s fundamentals. I ran around and scavenged what I could – a baseball, a brick and even a handgun – and that helped me feel like I could fight back. That’s something that other asymmetrical horror games have let you do, but Killer Klowns feels like it gets the balance right. In a 1v1, you should probably run unless you’re feeling pretty adept and well equipped, but if there’s a group of you? Then it’s hunting season on the Klowns.</p>
<p>I found this out quickly after finding a shotgun, and banding together with a few fellow humans. We were comfortably able to send the Klowns packing… for a while. Once a Klown is stunned, it’s a race between them button-mashing to get back up, and anyone with a weapon trying to pop their nose and send them to the afterlife. Death is just a mild setback for the Klowns though, as they will soon respawn and come back to terrorise you again.</p>


<p>While a couple Klowns down, this gave us a chance to focus on our main goal: to escape. While rummaging around, I managed to find a key to a gate which was one of the exits. There are a few different ways to escape – by boat, by opening the gate and crossing the bridge, or even through a special bunker.</p>
<p>Approaching the gate and opening it presents its own special minigame which sees you removing or breaking wooden planks before you can actually use the key to unlock the gate. Of course, doing these timing-based minigames alerts the Klowns to your location, so you need to be quick before they come for you. The Klowns can slow you down by spreading their special brand of cotton candy all over the escape route. It can be removed, but it’s time consuming and time is never on your side.</p>
<p>Failing to escape before the fifteen minute timer runs out means you’ll be present for the impending Klownpocalypse which I’m pretty sure no one wants to experience. In my situation, I was able to get the gate open and escape across the bridge, but not being careful as I ran meant the boards on the bridge broke, making it very difficult for those behind to escape alongside me.</p>

<p>What was cool, however, was that even though I escaped, I was still able to contribute for the rest of my team. If you escape early or are unlucky enough to get killed, you can take part in a series of minigames, granting the living humans extra items in order to aid them in their escape. This feature in particular is fantastic as it means getting tunnelled out the game too early doesn’t leave you twiddling your thumbs waiting for your mates to finish. If you’ve died, rather than escaped, the items earned can also be kept for yourself, meaning you’ll get a fighting chance when coming back from the dead. You only get to revive once however, so use that life wisely.</p>
<p>Of course, being the sadist I am, I was very excited in my second game playing as a Klown.</p>

<p>The Klowns are all armed with a raygun which they can use to turn pesky humans into cocoons made of cotton candy. This is an alternative to killing them outright, as they can then be taken and hung on one of several Lackey Generators. These spawns little minions which walk around the map and attempt to hunt down the humans. There are also some giant cotton candy cocoons just laying around the map, and the more candy on a generator, the faster minions are spawned.</p>
<p>The main trick comes when you manage to hook up sixteen cocoons to machines. Doing this triggers an early Klownpocalypse, making all the humans meet a sticky end.</p>

<p>Of course, this is just one way to win. During our game, I went on a bit of a killing spree. Smashing humans with your mallet enough times downs them and enables you to perform a Klowntality, a brutal yet hilarious finishing move to send the humans to their graves.</p>
<p>That’s not all, as the Klowns have an abundance of skills at their disposal. The Klown I was using had access to the Klown jump, which let me look at the map and jump to a spot of my choosing. I used this skill to my advantage and managed to head off a running survivor, catching up with them and taking them out for the win.&nbsp;The full game will allow for customisable loadouts, unlockable weapons, tricks and cosmetics with plenty of future support planned.</p>
<p>Killer Klowns from Outer Space brought plenty of goofy silliness to 80s horror cinema, and that’s honestly a perfect fit for asymmetrical multiplayer. That’s especially true because you’ve always got some other players alongside you, whether you’re humans or Klowns, to share in the close escapes, the hopeless chases, and the usual online shenanigans.</p>
<p>With the game out in just under a month on 4th June,&nbsp;I for one can’t wait to see what comes next in the Klownpocalypse!</p>

<p data-characters="364" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The new <em>Diablo 4</em> Season 4 Loot Reborn is live, and the changes have put the Sorcerer class in a decent spot going into the season. If you are looking for a fast-clearing AoE-centric class with some of the best mobility and great survivability, you’ll want to try Sorcerer. Here is the best leveling build and end-game build for Sorcerer in <em>Diablo 4</em> Season 4.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-best-sorcerer-leveling-build-in-diablo-4-season-4" data-injectable="false">Best Sorcerer Leveling build in <em>Diablo 4</em> Season 4</h2> <p data-characters="525" data-current-count="825" data-injectable="true">The best leveling build for the Sorcerer class in Season 4 of <em>Diablo 4</em> is the <strong>Firewall Sorcerer</strong>. Utilizing this build you will have amazing AoE potential which allows you to kill things fast and move on; an efficient strategy when leveling. Unfortunately, this build doesn’t quite scale well at the end game due to its lack of single-target boss damage. But for leveling, there’s few builds that can compare to the Firewall Sorcerer.

                <p>Nintendo has added a new batch of classic games to the Nintendo Switch Online service. Subscribers now have access to three additional Game Boy titles, including the beloved <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-land/" data-ref-id="5000-16072">Super Mario Land</a>, which has been conspicuously absent from the service up until now.</p><p>Notable for being the first Super Mario game not developed by series creator Shigeru Miyamoto, Super Mario Land follows the plumber as he journeys through the bizarre Sarasaland on a quest to rescue Princess Daisy from the alien invader Tatanga.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeYLP5uerGQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LeYLP5uerGQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Joining Super Mario Land are two other Game Boy launch titles: Alleyway and Baseball. The former is a Breakout clone that tasks players with maneuvering a panel to deflect a ball and destroy grids, while the latter is a straightforward sports game with two-player support.</p><p>All three titles are available as part of Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy library, which is included in a base Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Individual memberships cost $4 USD for one month, $8 USD for three months, and $20 USD for one year, while an annual family plan runs for $35 USD and covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts across multiple systems.</p><p>Nintendo also offers a premium "Expansion Pack" tier that includes additional perks, such as access to classic Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Advance games, as well as Sega Genesis titles and some Nintendo Switch DLC. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-adds-these-n64-games-for-expansion-pack-subscribers/1100-6522900/" data-ref-id="1100-6522900">Two more N64 games</a> were added for Expansion Pack subscribers in April, while Game Boy Advance launch title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f-zero-maximum-velocity/" data-ref-id="5000-3277">F-Zero: Maximum Velocity</a> was added in March.</p><p>Nintendo recently announced that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-confirmed-for-june-but-dont-expect-to-see-switch-2/1100-6523221/" data-ref-id="1100-6523221">new Nintendo Direct</a> will air in June.

As Mario, pilot your spaceship at the gate of the Alleyway and destroy the space grids by deflecting the energy ball toward them. Keep your vessel moving and the ball in play until every block has been cleared to finish the stage. As you progress through each level, you’ll be confronted with the challenge of alternating stages, bonus rounds and more. Speed and quick reflexes will become your strongest allies as you reach to beat the top score. You’re in command in the Alleyway.</li><li><strong><em>Baseball</em></strong> – Pitch in and batter up in this 1989 Game Boy classic. As the pitching team, deliver a series of fastballs while adjusting curve and speed—but be careful not to wear out your pitcher. If the batter connects, your outfield or infield can back you up. Strike out the opposing team, and it’s your turn at offense. As the batting team, shift your batter on the home plate and time their swing at the incoming ball. Try to safely reach the next base, or score for a home run. Strategize your team’s moves and lead your team to victory. Play ball!</li><li><strong><em>Super Mario Land</em></strong> – Relive Mario’s first Game Boy <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,466 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>! Obstacles and enemies of all sorts await you in the scenic kingdoms of Sarasaland, where you’ll travel through ancient ruins, stay afloat in tempestuous waters and navigate challenges aplenty. As Mario, you’ll run, jump and bounce your way to glory on his mission to save Princess Daisy (in her first appearance!) from a mysterious alien and restore peace to the land. This game features some distinct gameplay quirks to discover too, including the Superball Mario powerup and even levels where Mario pilots an airplane and submarine.</li></ul></blockquote><p>In Japan, <em>Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru</em> was also added to the <em>Game Boy – Nintendo Switch Online</em> app.</p><!-- AD: content -->

That's why you might want to jump on the deal Walmart is currently running. The retailer is offering <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FKirby-Star-Allies-Nintendo-Switch%2F909816989%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-your-kirby-fix-with-this-extremely-good-deal-on-kirby-star-allies-for-nintendo-switch%2F1100-6523451%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kirby Star Allies </a>for $30, half its $60 list price, and the lowest price Walmart has ever offered for the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Setting Kirby Star Allies apart from other games in the series is that the "allies" part is literal--while other Kirby games have also offered cooperative play, Star Allies makes co-op a major focus. You'll get the usual enemy-eating, power-stealing, platform-jumping gameplay Kirby is known for, but with an emphasis on recruiting enemies to your side along the way. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirby-star-allies-review-take-it-easy/1900-6416874/">GameSpot's Peter Brown gave the game an 8</a> when it released, saying, "Star Allies is yet another Kirby game, but it's up there with some of the best. It's an artistic showcase, and a great opportunity for co-op platforming."</p><p dir="ltr">That's not the only Kirby Switch game that Walmart is offering on sale, although Star Allies has the best discount.
