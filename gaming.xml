			<p>Today, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> earlier this month, CD Projekt RED has released <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/redkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher 3 REDkit</a> to the public. It is now available for free download on PC across GOG, Epic Games Store, and Steam.</p>
<p>The modding tool, created with the help of Hungarian co-development company Yigsoft, was successfully tested with over 18K users before the public release. The goal is to unleash the creativity of modders with a much more robust modding tool than what was previously available for the game.</p>
<p>Ahead of the launch, we reached out to CD Projekt RED's Global Community Director Marcin Momot and Yigsoft's Lead Bence Hambalko to discuss the feature set of The Witcher 3 REDkit (there's full controller support, surprisingly) and what's coming after launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 3 REDkit — Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMKZQLRkyfU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The REDkit for The Witcher 2 was released only two years after its launch, whereas nine years have now passed for The Witcher 3. Why the delay?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marcin Momot:</strong> The truth is that, initially, we planned to release it much sooner, but, as usual, reality altered our plans. As we fully transitioned to working on Cyberpunk 2077, we had to adjust our production timeline. After its release, we began reevaluating some of the projects we had in the pipeline beforehand. Around that time, we started forming a closer partnership with Yigsoft, who have been helping us with certain elements of Cyberpunk 2077. As the old saying goes, better late than never, and here we are, releasing The Witcher 3 editor into the hands of players in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you deem it worthy to release it after all these years?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MM:</strong> The Witcher 3 is one of those games that, even nine years later, is still thriving in the modding scene. Every week, new mods keep popping up as people tinker with various aspects of the game. After releasing the next-gen version in December 2022 and all subsequent updates, we offer this as a sort of parting gift — the final touch, if you will. We hope that now, with everyone having access to an editor that’s as close to being on par with what the game’s developers used to make it as can be, the game can continue to live on for years to come, with even more content being added by the community.</p>
<p><strong>Can you explain the difference between the already released ModKit and the upcoming REDkit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bence Hambalko:</strong> The already-released ModKit was a simple set of command line tools derived from the internal tools we use for some processes in the engine. Compared to this, REDkit is a full set of tools close to what CDPR used to actually make the game, which means people benefit from having a comprehensive GUI to assist them in creating mods. The community was quite ingenious and figured out ways to create many kinds of mods over the years, but for less technical-savvy people it was difficult to get started. Compared to this, despite how complex of a game engine it truly is, people can get into creating new content for the game much easier and without as many limiting factors.</p>
<p><strong>Does the REDKit support the latest technical features introduced with the next-gen update, such as ray tracing, allowing modders to create ray traced content?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Yes, REDkit is using the improved toolset used for the Complete Edition of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, so you can preview your content with ray tracing and all the amazing graphical and gameplay settings enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Did you make any usability improvements compared to the REDkit for The Witcher 2 with modders in mind?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> So, actually, quite a few people from the Yigsoft team come from a modding background. Before working on REDkit, together with one of our engine programmers on the project, Moritz Baron, we have been leading the WolvenKit project and have been quite involved with the community for many years. So, when we started working on REDkit, we decided to collaborate with them, learning what kind of features gamers would like to see from a modding tool. A few months before the release of REDkit, we had a small group of people that we were working with, discussing how REDkit was progressing and how we could make it even better.</p>
<p>Once we felt the tool was in good shape and ready to share with more people, we started the Steam Playtest. It’s hard to list all the feedback we received. One interesting point I’d like to touch on, however, was that none of us used REDkit with a controller, and we had a lot of requests to introduce controller support. The end result is that now you can play the game in the editor using a controller. We also wanted to make REDkit as open for everyone as we could, so we decided to port all of our techart tooling to Blender so people could enjoy it for free.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to gather feedback from the community to make further changes post-release?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MM:</strong> Absolutely! The community has been an integral part of the REDkit development process. Earlier this year, we brought some members of The Witcher 3 modding scene on board to help ensure we deliver the best possible experience with the editor. Last month, we launched a closed playtest on Steam, allowing users to test drive The Witcher 3 REDkit. During this phase, we received a lot of very useful feedback that we were able to implement over the past few weeks. We also opened dedicated rooms on our forums and on Discord where people can report any issues they encounter and submit their ideas on how they think we can further improve the tool. The modding community has been incredibly helpful in bringing REDkit to life, and we would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their contributions to the project. Moving forward, we definitely want to build on this and keep listening to the players, taking their feedback into consideration to ensure The Witcher 3 REDkit is the best tool it can be.</p>
<p><strong>Do you believe the new REDKit will allow modders to create whole new regions and storylines within The Witcher universe, like in Bethesda games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Yes! Allowing gamers to create almost anything they can imagine using REDkit, be it a small piece of content or a full-fledged expansion for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, was our main goal throughout development. We will be sharing a proof of concept project inside our tutorials, which contains a bigger quest with some cutscenes and a new location. We hope it gets the creative juices flowing for the people who watch it!</p>
<p><strong>Some of the most awaited Elder Scrolls modding projects are recreations of previous games in the new engine. Would you be okay if someone decided to remake The Witcher 2 with the REDKit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> I think it would be quite interesting to see. Some of us in the development team actually did some tests of importing maps and models from a variety of projects, and it was quite fun to see how they look in The Witcher 3 engine.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be an easy way to install mods within the game and without, such as with Steam Workshop support?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> REDkit does feature full Steam Workshop integration, which is a big win for gamers playing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on Steam. That said, aside from what Steam Workshop offers natively, there is currently no UI element in-game allowing for installing mods directly. We’ve also been in contact with Nexus Mods and The Witcher 3 Vortex extension will be updated on REDkit’s launch day to make the experience as smooth as possible from Day 1 for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to highlight the best mods in various ways, such as with contests or articles on the official website?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MM:</strong> Just like with every other project we work on, you can safely assume we will give The Witcher 3 REDkit proper attention on our social media and across our community channels. The modding community is incredibly creative, and we want to ensure that we provide them with a platform to elevate their creations and make sure players around the world hear about them. We have been working on a series of extensive video tutorials tackling the most important aspects of the editor, as well as building a wiki page that will make the onboarding process easier. As for challenges and contests, we are thinking about some ideas. All I can say is — stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[This $14 Humble Bundle features seven excellent Steam Deck-ready Metroidvanias]]></title>
            <link>https://www.polygon.com/deals/24161686/humble-metroidvania-steam-deck-bundle-deal-sale</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-14-humble-bundle-features-seven-excellent-steam-deck-ready-metroidvanias.877671/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/deals/24161686/humble-metroidvania-steam-deck-bundle-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9qIPsJ">Characterized by their non-linear design, labyrinthine maps, and challenging bosses, the side-scrolling Metroidvania seems perfectly tailored for handhelds like the Steam Deck. Right now, you can add seven standout titles from the Metroidvania genre to your handheld library for just $14 from <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/polygon/https://www.humblebundle.com/games/metroidvania-mania" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/___pl__p_23925727__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder/https://www.humblebundle.com/games/metroidvania-mania&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:64,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;sid&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;sid&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23925727__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Humble</a>, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24130852/best-metroidvania-games-play-nintendo-switch-steam-playstation-xbox-pc">some of our personal favorites</a>.</p>

<p id="2Em520">The highlights of the seven-game bundle are definitely <em>Axiom Verge</em> and its excellent follow-up, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22629138/axiom-verge-2-review-metroidvania-nintendo-switch-ps4-pc-epic-games-store"><em>Axiom Verge 2</em></a>. Both games were created solely by Thomas Happ and remain classic examples of the Metroidvania genre, thanks to their distinct environments, memorable soundtracks, varied abilities, and pixel-heavy aesthetics. </p>
<p id="XoByiE">This collection also features some more contemporary additions to the expanding genre, like the fast-paced and irreverent <em>Cookie Cutter</em>, and the deckbuilding-inspired <em>The Knight Witch</em>. Also included are <em>9 Years of Shadows</em>, <em>Ghost Song</em>, <em>Death’s Gambit: Afterlife</em>, and a 50% off coupon for the <em>Ashes of Vados</em> DLC for <em>Death’s Gambit</em>.</p>
<p id="eViPfG">While this bundle doesn’t feature other essential titles like <em>Dead Cells, Hollow Knight</em>, or <em>Blasphemous</em>, we’d still recommend checking out this $14 collection if one of its games hasn’t already found its way into your Steam library. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/medieval-war-sim-kingmakers-shows-what-happens-when-an-abrams-tank-enters-the-battle.877668/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161849/kingmakers-tank-vs-castle-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Vqwftr">As the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24078520/kingmakers-medieval-warfare-twist-redemption-road">first <em>Kingmakers</em> gameplay trailer illustrated</a>, an army of heavily armored medieval soldiers is no match for a man from the future armed with a shotgun, grenade launcher, and   sniper rifle. The matchup becomes even more lopsided when you can call in an attack helicopter to strafe an entire battalion into red mist.</p>
<p id="JaRjK2">A new trailer for <em>Kingmakers</em> answers an equally important question of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/who-would-win-week">who would win</a>: a huge medieval castle or an Abrams tank? Yeah, the tank wins in all situations, whether it’s versus Tudor architecture or a company of knights. It appears the latter just becomes hamburger stuck in the treads of that tank. Gruesome stuff. Also, there’s going to be a lot of virtual horse death in this game, for which I have extremely mixed feelings.</p>
<p id="chvVya">What <em>Kingmakers</em>’ latest trailer is actually intended to illustrate is how well it handles the destruction of buildings, from humble cottages and taverns to towering stone castles. <em>Kingmakers</em> developer Redemption Road promises that these dynamic collapses and explosions all happen in real time, with realistic physics, which will make the shooter-medieval-military-strategy-simulation fun to watch if nothing else.</p>
<p id="wGR9jb"><em>Kingmakers</em> is due to arrive sometime later this year on Windows PC via Steam.</p>

Ultimate</em></a></span> director Masahiro Sakurai talked about game balance. In the video, Sakurai says that game design is about “push and pull” and that he advises developers and designers to avoid making everything feel or play the same. Instead, characters should be unique, and their weaknesses should balance their strengths. Of course, this means that some characters might seem more powerful, with extremely useful abilities or devastating moves. But Sakurai had data to prove that, overall, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate"><em>SSB Ultimate</em></a></span><em>’s</em> roster of over 80 unique characters is extremely balanced. <br></p><p>“For <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, we have data regarding win rates in online battles,” said Sakurai. “This is actual data gathered from around the world, so it’s safe to say this is impartial global data, without any bias.” </p><p>While he couldn’t share “real specifics” about the data, he was free to provide some reference points.</p><p>Out of all the fighters in the game, Sakurai says the highest win rate any character possesses is 51.43%. Meanwhile, the lowest win rate is 47.18%. (He was unable to reveal who these characters are.) What this means is that the win rates of <em>all </em>the fighters in <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> land within a very narrow range of about five percent. </p><p>“This tells us that any fighter has a shot at winning a match,” explained Sakurai. “In fact, it would be difficult to make them much closer.”</p><p>The director and creator of <em>Smash </em>did add that “win rates aren’t everything” and further explained that the “true metric” is how each fighter feels and plays. But still, this is interesting data. </p><p>And as for all those online tier lists claiming certain characters are broken or too powerful, Sakurai had this to say: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“The internet can tend to be an echo chamber of sorts, so if people start saying something is strong or weak, that assessment will gain momentum and make people think it’s truer than it is.”</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-details-on-valve%E2%80%99s-new-game-%E2%80%98deadlock%E2%80%99.877662/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>First rumors and leaks about Valve’s new game, Deadlock, appeared online last week. They primarily originated from Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GabeFollower</a>, who posted some information and images of the new game. Seemingly, GabeFollower has since been told not to share any further details on the game, likely because he shared images that were NDA and has potentially received a legal notice.</p>



<p>However, Insider Gaming has been provided further information on the game, including gameplay footage, which has been shared with us under the condition that it does not go public. We can confirm that claims from GabeFollower are legitimate and that the game is named Deadlock and is currently in the alpha stage. Officially, the game is described as an “early development build with lots of experimental gameplay features and art assets.”</p>



<p>As already leaked, the game is a 6v6 third-person hero-based shooter. Heroes include magicians, robots, creatures, humans, and more. There are currently 19 different heroes, each with different abilities and playstyles that you’d come to expect from a MOBA including ranged, healers, tanks, assassins, etc.</p>



<p>Players have described the game to me as being very similar to DOTA in terms of its gameplay loop and mechanics. This includes killing enemies and creeps to get the in-game currency of “souls,” which allows you to buy items to make your hero stronger. According to sources, both creeps and enemies will spawn a soul upon death, which floats up and away when they die. You collect the most souls by shooting at them (souls that float away still provide a small amount of souls currency). As for the creeps, they are spawned randomly throughout the map, including a larger AI boss in the middle of the map. Some players also outlined that there is also “spirit urns”, which players can deposit in the middle of the map to give the whole team more souls (the spirit urn carrier is visible to all players on the minimap).</p>



<p>It is unclear when the game will be released, but based on its current state, I wouldn’t be surprised to see it released sometime in 2025. </p>

<p>After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-release-date-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous delays</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/behind-xdefiant-toxic-work-culture-crunch-and-years-of-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hiccups surrounding its development</a>, Ubisoft’s free-to-play shooter XDefiant is finally available for everyone. Unfortunately, XDefiant’s servers have seemingly been plagued by problems causing players to not be able to play.</p>



<p>Almost immediately after the game went live, <a href="https://x.com/WHOH/status/1792971353534148865" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players began</a> to take to social media to complain about not being able to get into a match.</p>



<p>“Where TF is everyone,” <a href="https://x.com/TravWasTaken/status/1792966320247677161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one user said</a>.</p>



<p>Said <a href="https://x.com/JR5_Crypto/status/1792970238977282328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a>, “Having issues with finding a game…. RIP.”</p>



<p>The problems led to the <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1792971101233959058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s official Twitter account</a> making a statement on the matter.</p>



<p>“We’re aware that some players are unable to join a game- please bear with us while we look into servers and matchmaking,” the developers said.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even game head Mark Rubin <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1792971368629412177">made a post commenting</a> on the servers.</p>



<p>“Matchmaking servers go boom!” he said. “We are working on it.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft to see if there is any time table for a fix or if there was a specific issue causing players not to be able to connect. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>



<p>For what it’s worth, however, XDefiant is the second-most popular game being stream on Twitch as of publishing. The only game ahead of it is Grand Theft Auto 5.</p>

In the below video, Dave Klein, Lucy James, and Tamoor Hussain break down all the secrets sown throughout the three-minute trailer, and what questions this DLC could possibly answer in the existing game.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer features a good amount of voiceover and narration, but our experts focused more on the imagery and the nature of the events shown. For example, at the beginning of a trailer, we see an unknown hand pull something out of a bag--possibly golden threads. Lucy compares this image to that of childbirth--a well-known theme in From Software games, particularly Bloodborne--and wonders what exactly it might represent.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Story Trailer Breakdown and Lore Discussion</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Our three experts speculate that the hand may belong to Queen Marika, with Tam stating that the snake bangle on her wrist represents blasphemy in existing Elden Ring lore, and that we may learn how Queen Marika first became a god (as opposed to a regular Numen) in Shadow of the Erdtree. This could be the "seduction and betrayal" that the voice-over refers to, as Tam and Dave argue.</p><p dir="ltr">The discussion then turns to the image of a woman figure with long hair (likely Queen Marika) holding golden threads in her hand in what our experts call the Crucible. Dave and Tam speculate that this scene may be the creation of the Erdtree, possibly in the aftermath of a great war. Dave further states that the mysterious "Greater Will" could be involved in this process, which is often considered one of the Outer Gods by Elden Ring fans. Lucy and Tam call the image "pro-Erdtree propaganda," joking that it promotes the Golden Order's perspective.</p><p dir="ltr">Our experts next focus on the next part of the trailer, which refers to an "unseen war" waged by what appears to be new character Messmer the Impaler's army. Dave, Lucy, and Tam all agree that these must be Messmer's men, given that they all use spears, as well as the abundance of fire imagery.</p><p dir="ltr">Tam and Dave further debate the possible origin and implications of Messmer's flame powers, with Tam noting one theory that states that the flame that burns the Erdtree near the game's conclusion could come from Messmer himself. Later, Lucy points out that the impaled apparent "lion dancers" seen silhouetted against the flames appear to be bodies grafted together, and may belong to the culture that Messmer (and possibly Marika) are burning down.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, the trio discuss why Miquella would "abandon everything" (in the words of the trailer) in order to return to the Lands of Shadow. Tam notes that Miquella may be returning to the original Great Tree (or Crucible) in order to help his sister Malenia overcome the rot inside her, since it seems that Miquella's Haligtree isn't enough for her to escape the Rot God's curse.</p><p dir="ltr">That's just the tip of the iceberg as far as the discussion, so for more details, check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer-breakdown-and-lore-discussion/2300-6464124/">full video</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant-how-to-turn-crossplay-off-and-on.877650/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-how-to-turn-crossplay-off-and-on/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-how-to-turn-crossplay-off-and-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="400" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Newly released free-to-play shooter <em>XDefiant</em> comes with the ability to play cross-platform between the PlayStation4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Players on all platforms are able to play <em>XDefiant</em> with each other, or, you can disable the setting and play only with the platform you are on. You will need to know how to turn crossplay off and on to enable the feature in <em>XDefiant</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-enable-crossplay-on-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">How to enable crossplay on <em>XDefiant</em></h2> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">You can enable crossplay in <em>XDefiant</em> by from the settings menu, which can be accessed from the main menu screen. From here, hit the F3 key or click the cogwheel and settings button in the top-right of the screen, as shown in the screenshot above.</p>
 <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">Next, click the Matchmaking &amp; Account settings on the left, which will display your Matchmaking settings. From here, you can turn Crossplay on or off which will toggle the ability to matchmake crossplay. Save your settings and join a playlist to queue with the new crossplay settings.</p> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">Keep in mind that you cannot enable or disable crossplay or input-based matchmaking when you are in a party, and will need to leave your party to do so. Afterwards you can rejoin the party and the settings will be active.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-is-input-based-matchmaking" data-injectable="false">What is input-based matchmaking</h2> <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">Another option in <em>XDefiant</em> is to enable or disable input-based matchmaking. This is essentially a sub-genre of crossplay/cross-platform, in which you can enable the option to only play with players using the same input type as you. This means if you are using a controller, you will only play with other players using a controller. If you are playing on keyboard and mouse, you’ll only play against other players on keyboard and mouse.</p>
 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">This option expands the player pool that you can get matched with, while also removing some of the perceived unfairness between controller-based players having aim assist and keyboard and mouse players having more flexibility and faster movements based on mouse sensitivity.</p> <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="false">If you enable input-based matchmaking you will only play with this on your same input-type. With the option off, you can be matched with everyone regardless of input-type.</p>

            <link>https://www.destructoid.com/best-5-star-selector-weapon-in-wuthering-waves/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=best-5-star-selector-weapon-in-wuthering-waves</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-5-star-selector-weapon-in-wuthering-waves.877647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-5-star-selector-weapon-in-wuthering-waves/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-5-star-selector-weapon-in-wuthering-waves<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, all players will be able to select one five-star weapon once they reach Union Level 45. The weapon you should choose does depend on the state of your account, but there is a little nuance to consider before choosing.</p> <h2 id="h-which-5-star-weapon-should-you-select-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Which 5-star weapon should you select in <em>Wuthering Waves?</em></h2> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">The 5-star weapon selector allows you to choose from a selection of five weapons from the standard weapon banner. These five weapons represent the five weapon types available in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> and each one has a secondary stat and effect that sets them apart from each other.</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Emerald of Genesis (Sword) – </strong>Critical Rate</li> <li><strong>Lustrous Razor (Broadblade) </strong>– Attack</li> <li><strong>Abyss Surgers</strong> <strong>(Gauntlet) </strong>– Attack</li> <li><strong>Static Mist</strong> <strong>(Pistols) </strong>– Critical Rate</li> <li><strong>Cosmic Ripples</strong> <strong>(Rectifier) </strong>– Attack</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">For all five of these weapons, their special effects are just nice additional bonuses and really aren’t major factors in the choice. What does matter, though, is the secondary stat they all have listed above, and the number of characters that can make use of the weapon. It is for these two core reasons that I recommend you pick up the <strong>Emerald of Genesis</strong> as your five-star weapon of choice. Why?</p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">Here’s the thing: Critical Value stats (CRIT RATE, CRIT DMG) are always more difficult to obtain in significant amounts than Attack (ATK). This is because ATK tends to have a lot more sources, and is more easily accessible because of that. As such, Critical Value stats should be highly prioritized whenever possible, automatically ruling out all but Emerald of Genesis and Static Mist.</p> <figure data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wuthering-Waves-5-Star-Weapon-Select-Featured.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">Now, Emerald of Genesis wins out over Static Mist only because more characters can use it, at least for now. At the time of release, there are more Sword users than any other type, therefore more opportunities to equip Emerald of Genesis.</p> <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="false">All that said, if you have a particular character you favor above the others, and want to get them a five-star weapon, you should feel free to do so. Just be aware that by not taking a CRIT-based weapon, you will be doing less damage overall, as critical hits are an additional multiplier on top of your ATK stat. Basically, it’s a matter of relying on one multiplier (ATK) versus three (ATK, CRIT RATE, CRIT DMG). CRIT DMG only works when you CRIT, so the value of it goes up the more CRIT RATE you have, thus equating to more damage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161061/terry-pratchett-thunderbolt-iron-sword-meteorite-star<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="tSSzIb">Roll the phrase around your tongue with me: Starmetal sword. <em>Starmetal sword</em>. The lost secret to Damascus steel could totally have been meteorites! Attila the Hun had a sword like this, right? Or Excalibur was one, yeah? Tutankhamun was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun%27s_meteoric_iron_dagger">definitely buried with one</a>. <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em>’s heroine has a starmetal sword, and so does Sokka in <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, and the Redwall series practically revolves around whoever’s got the meteorite-forged sword of Martin the Warrior in their paws. </p>

<p id="dbzq1z">Man, starmetal swords are cool. Until you actually look them up in real life. </p>
<p id="gmidxp">Would it surprise you to know that there’s no material advantage you can forge into a sword using metal from a meteorite? Eh, probably not, you’re smart and skeptical, so you know that while the iron-nickel alloys in meteorites have distinctively different traces of other elements than those found in Earth’s own iron ore, none of those meteorite elements are regularly found in any quantities that would affect the properties of a forged object. </p>
<p id="r0tN5x">Tutankhamun’s meteorite dagger was exceptional in materials, not in capabilities. Excalibur isn’t real. Attila’s “sword of Mars” was folklore. Also, we’ve developed some really solid ideas of how Damascus steel was made, and none of them involve metal from space. </p>
<p id="GGzi4y">Starmetal swords are just normal swords. </p>
<h2 id="3Qeg1v"><strong>But are they really?</strong></h2>

<p id="kXZbsW">Of <em>course not</em>. They’re made with <em>metal</em> from <em>space</em>! And every list of starmetal swords that were no sharper, harder, or hardier than their earthly counterparts is also a list of human yearning — yearning to connect an earthly tool, and therefore its wielder, to the celestial realm. </p>
<p id="cu9r7e">And you don’t even have to go as far afield as heaven. The earliest known prehistoric iron objects are made from meteoric iron. Before we developed the techniques that could refine iron ore into usable metal, we made things out of iron from space. A starmetal sword doesn’t have to connect you to the sky when it can connect you to the origins of ironworking on this planet. </p>

<p id="x9D0Ys">And nobody knew that better than satirist Terry Pratchett. Upon being knighted in 2009, Sir Terry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2009/feb/22/10">told the Guardian</a>, “You can’t ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I’d get myself a horse and a sword.” </p>
<p id="bMHzC7">A year later, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425013731/http://www.news.com.au/technology/terry-pratchett-creates-a-sword-with-meteorites/story-e6frfro0-1225926584339">did just that</a> (OK, not the horse part). He gathered iron ore from surface deposits near his England home, smelted and hammered it into bars with a handmade clay forge, and delivered the bars to a blacksmith to have them worked into his own sword, finished with silver. And he tossed pieces of meteorite into the fires of that forge as well, telling <a href="http://news.com.au/">News.com.au</a>, “Thunderbolt iron, you see — highly magical, you’ve got to chuck that stuff in whether you believe in it or not.” </p>
<p id="EQSOR3">In one of the most famous passages Pratchett ever wrote, he opined on the value of casual belief. In his characteristic silly and profound, satirist manner, a scene in the novel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hogfather-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0061059056?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hogfather-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0061059056?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23925102__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23925102__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Hogfather</em></a> features the figure of the Grim Reaper telling his adopted granddaughter that human beings have to believe in little things without hard evidence, like Santa Claus — and swords made of stars. </p>
<p id="CwbUHf">They had to, so that they could believe in the big things without hard evidence, like justice, and hope. </p>
<p id="o8Y3iY">So if it’s all the same to you, I’m going to keep believing that starmetal swords are cool. Terry Pratchett thought they were. </p>

Here are ten great <em>X-Men</em> comics to try out if you loved <em>X-Men ‘97</em>.</p><h2 id="h11532"><a id=""></a><strong>The crash course: <em>Grand Design</em></strong></h2><p>Is <em>X-Men ‘97</em> your first foray into the world of Marvel’s Mutants? Are you looking to learn more about the decades of history behind the characters? Well, then <em>X-Men: Grand Design</em> is for you. The six-issue series from creator Ed Piskor is made precisely to act as a crash course in the <em>X-Men</em>. Beginning in the ‘60s and going all the way into the ‘90s, <em>Grand Design</em> is a streamlined greatest-hits story chronicling the entire history of the <em>X-Men</em>. Instead of reading hundreds of issues, you can read just six and get a pretty good idea of who the major players in the world are and what their deal is. From there you can pick out specific eras you want to go back and dive deeper into. </p><figure id="" data-id="9dc2c7439af2e592cb410b6eef800416" data-recommend-id="image://9dc2c7439af2e592cb410b6eef800416" data-format="jpg" data-width="1264" data-height="711" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jean Grey, Hank McCoy, and Scott Summers jump into action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jean Grey, Hank McCoy, and Scott Summers jump into action" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9dc2c7439af2e592cb410b6eef800416" data-recommend-id="image://9dc2c7439af2e592cb410b6eef800416" data-format="jpg" data-width="1264" data-height="711" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jean Grey, Hank McCoy, and Scott Summers jump into action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h11533"><a id=""></a><strong>The beginning (but better): <em>First Class </em>and<em> Season One</em></strong></h2><p>Now if you want to get acquainted with the <em>X-Men </em>starting from the very beginning in a more in-depth manner than <em>Grand Design</em>, you have a couple of options. Yes, you could read the original run of <em>X-Men</em> but it isn’t very good. What you can do instead is read either <em>X-Men: First Class</em> or <em>X-Men: Season One</em>. Both are modern retellings of the adventures of the original five team members in their teenage years. I personally lean toward <em>Season One</em> as I think it still captures some of the retro campiness of the original while modernizing the story and art for current readers. If you want, though, you can read both; there is some narrative overlapping but they’re different enough to keep you interested.</p><h2 id="h11534"><a id=""></a><strong>More of the same: <em>X-Men ‘92</em></strong></h2><p>Maybe you don’t care enough about the origins and history of the X-Men to fully fling yourself into the wild world of the comics, and you really just want more stories featuring the animated series’ cast while you wait for season 2. That’s fair. In that case, I recommend trying out <em>X-Men ‘92</em>. This limited series takes place in the universe of the animated series and tells an interesting meta-story about censorship using the villain Cassandra Nova. It’s a fun read that isn’t bogged down too hard with decades of stories before it. Also, it might be an inspiration for the upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-theory-cassandra-nova-x-men-92-1851432053&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-theory-cassandra-nova-x-men-92-1851432053"><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em></a></span>, so that’s two birds with one stone for you.</p><h2 id="h11535"><a id=""></a><strong>Reading ahead: <em>Onslaught</em> and <em>Age of Apocalypse</em></strong></h2><p>Season one of <em>X-Men ‘97</em> ended on a pretty big cliffhanger that teased some major storylines for next season. You could wait for the show to get around to those, <em>or</em> you could just read ahead! Based on the season finale, which saw the team separated across time and space and encountering a certain big blue baddie, it seems clear that the seminal<em> Age of Apocalypse</em> will have a major influence. The classic story saw an alternate future ruled by the villain Apocalypse and an X-Men team led by Magneto. You could also read <em>Onslaught</em>, which precedes <em>Age of Apocalypse</em> and deals with the relationship between Charles and Magneto. Season one drew on many iconic storylines, like the Trial of Magneto, but tweaked them in interesting ways, so if you do read these two comics, don’t expect season two to exactly follow the blueprint they lay out, either.</p><figure id="" data-id="ce32543a5f18338473675e6402607905" data-recommend-id="image://ce32543a5f18338473675e6402607905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1659" data-height="933" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wimpy kid cowers while the x-men get ready for battle behind him" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wimpy kid cowers while the x-men get ready for battle behind him" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ce32543a5f18338473675e6402607905" data-recommend-id="image://ce32543a5f18338473675e6402607905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1659" data-height="933" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wimpy kid cowers while the x-men get ready for battle behind him" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h11536"><a id=""></a><strong>A self-contained oddball: <em>Worst X-Man Ever</em></strong></h2><p>Not every mutant is created equal. That’s the premise of the wonderfully absurd <em>Worst X-Man Ever</em>. While most of Marvel’s mutants are beefcakes with cool powers, protagonist Bailey Hoskins is a wimpy kid who has the ability to blow his entire body up…. once. He doesn’t have regenerative powers or immortality, so he would just… die. The book takes that premise and runs with it for five incredible issues that become an interesting investigation of what it means to be a mutant and a hero in the Marvel Comics universe. If you want an <em>X-Men</em> book unlike any other, this is the one for you.</p><h2 id="h11537"><a id=""></a><strong>Magneto was right: <em>Magneto (2014)</em></strong></h2><p>The star of <em>X-Men ‘97</em>’s first season was undoubtedly Magneto. By putting him in charge of the team at the beginning of the season and unraveling a dialogue about mutant philosophy and the unending struggle for survival, the show pulled on the best comic depictions of the character as an altruistic anti-hero whose number one concern is his people. If you left the show thinking, “Wow, Magneto is cool as hell!” then pick up his 2014 solo series. In it, Magneto essentially goes on a revenge tour, and it’s a thrilling showcase for the character.</p><h2 id="h11538"><a id=""></a><strong>Just give me what’s new (but good): <em>Ultimate X-Men</em></strong></h2><p>I’ll be the first to admit that reading traditional superhero comics… kind of sucks. It never feels like a good time to jump on, and with constant reboots and crossovers a lot of storylines never get the time they need. But if you just want to dive into the current <em>X-Men</em> with as little bullshit as possible, there is an option for you. Don’t read any of the main 616 universe comics; instead, read<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ultimate-x-men-marvel-comics-peach-momoko-1851333139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ultimate-x-men-marvel-comics-peach-momoko-1851333139"><em>Ultimate X-Men</em></a></span>. Currently, only three issues in, the new series from Peach Momoko is a completely fresh take on the <em>X-Men </em>that requires no prior knowledge. It strips <em>X-Men</em> down to its most basic building blocks and is slowly building it back up in the form of something better. It might not be <em>X-Men</em> as you expect it, but you’ll be glad you picked it up. Trust me.</p><figure id="" data-id="8d8aaeb08f354ae477547c595e158d07" data-recommend-id="image://8d8aaeb08f354ae477547c595e158d07" data-format="jpg" data-width="1267" data-height="712" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The X-Men line up in cool leather jackets" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The X-Men line up in cool leather jackets" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d8aaeb08f354ae477547c595e158d07" data-recommend-id="image://8d8aaeb08f354ae477547c595e158d07" data-format="jpg" data-width="1267" data-height="712" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The X-Men line up in cool leather jackets" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h11539"><a id=""></a><strong>The best there is at what they do: <em>New X-Men</em></strong></h2><p>Finally, if you just want to cut to the chase and read <em>X-Men </em>at its peak, then you want Grant Morrison’s <em>New X-Men</em>. The seminal run quite literally brought the<em> X-Men</em> into the 21st century in the form of a major reinvention that placed a new focus on the school aspect of the series as well as the overarching use of the characters as a metaphor for marginalized communities.

<p>Following the exceptional Elden Ring DLC trailer, in which we saw more of the upcoming expansion’s world, story, and characters, we all have questions. Namely, who is Messmer in Elden Ring? He’s clearly an important part of the DLC’s storyline, so let’s delve in and find out more!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-messmer-the-impaler">Who is Messmer the Impaler?</h2>



<p>Messmer the Impaler, an upcoming character in Shadow of the Erdtree, is a tall, red-haired individual with twin snakes circling his unique armor. He casts fire spells, wields a polearm, and moves quickly, thanks to his extended gait. </p>



<p>In the trailer, along with many of the press shots we’ve been shown by the studio, we see Messmer sitting on Morgott, the Omen King’s throne. According to Miyazaki, this is meant to show players that Messmer is equal to the demigods.</p>



<p>As part of Shadow of the Erdtree, we’ll delve into Messmer’s story further, learning who and why he exists in the Lands of Shadow, along with his role in the creation of the mysterious realm.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most recent story trailer</a>, which you can watch below, we see Messmer and his army razing a city. He’s clearly not a hero character; that much is known!</p>

</p></figure>







<p>How Long Will Shadow of the Erdtree Be?</p>



<p>According to current estimates, it will take approximately 20 to 30 hours to complete Shadow of the Erdtree. However, if you play like I do, it’ll likely take twice as long to finish the expansion.</p>



<p>As always, play at your own pace and enjoy the experience!</p>

<p>This new version of what's arguably Kingdom Hearts’ de facto theme song is part of Utada’s greatest hits album, Science Fiction, which was released last month and features multiple re-recordings of their hit songs. Last month, Utada <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/10/hikaru-utada-has-released-a-new-recording-of-kingdom-hearts-best-song">released the re-recorded version of “Hikaru</a>”, the Japanese version of “Simple and Clean”.</p>

  <p id="bJnx9b">The cast of <em>League of Legends</em> is so vast that the best way to find a character of interest is to just scan the roster of champions, looking for a distinctive feature. One easy archetype for gamers to understand is someone with a cool sword; that makes sense, because “cool sword” is basically on the bottom pyramid of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. </p>
<p id="wFBU7O">There are fifteen champions who wield swords; we excluded characters who just use very big daggers. We also didn’t include skins; this is all mainline Runeterra lore. With such an arsenal of swords to admire, we realized that we needed to rank them, so we could determine which of these blades reigns supreme for Cool Sword Day. Here they are, from least cool to coolest.</p>

<p id="5LstQ6">Very large, but not the source of Tryndamere’s rage powers, so not very impressive. Doesn’t seem to have any special crafting; it’s not a True Ice item like his peers in the Freljord, or a cursed weapon, or anything like that. It doesn’t help that Tryndamere needs a visual update badly. Maybe when they give him one they can give him a sword that doesn’t suck.</p>

<p id="3A9nuX">Samira’s extremely cool, and she gets a novelty point based off the fact that she switches handily between gun and sword for style points. Her weapons aren’t automatically cool by association, though. If Samira dropped her sword and someone else picked it up and the camera moved to focus on them, I would immediately fall asleep. Not a cool sword.</p>

<p id="JZToZL">Yasuo’s blade is fashioned after his wind powers, which is a nice detail, but as far as we know the blade is not inherently magical. Yasuo does use it to guide his wind powers, similarly to a magic wand, so it gets a cool point thanks to that being a strong visual image in cinematics.</p>

<p id="4yqtUh">Leona’s blade can turn into pure sunlight and teleport her to her foes; it also has a snazzy solar theme. This is pretty cool, but in the lore of <em>League of Legends</em>, the Solari are currently engaged in a genocide of the moon-worshipping Lunari, and using a cool blade for such an evil purpose means Leona scores a low ranking on the cool scale.</p>

<p id="V2OmkE">Shen’s giant spirit sword is a link to a realm that runs parallel with reality, and it allows him to control the environment around him. Shen is also kind of boring — he’s a taciturn fellow who believes in balance — but it’s impossible to look at his giant spirit sword zooming around on the Rift and not be a little impressed. This is a pretty cool sword.</p>

<p id="oOX9T8">At first glance, Garen’s sword is functional and shiny, but not particularly cool. But his Ultimate ability is where things get really neat; he summons a giant golden version of his sword down from the heavens on an enemy’s head to execute them. This is actually a gift from the Aspect of Justice, and he is channeling her power. Garen looks like just a normal soldier, but he’s capable of summoning a great golden blade from the heavens — that’s indisputably cool.</p>

<p id="XxBMAm">Viego’s an interesting case because his sword, the Blade of the Ruined King, showed up in the game well before he did. In fact, the Blade of the Ruined King was so strong at one point that the meta-game was for everyone to just build multiple of them. In the novel <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22989562/league-of-legends-ruination-novel-kalista-viego-story"><em>Ruination</em></a>, we find out a lot of lore about the blade’s history as Sanctity, the ancestral weapon of the royalty of Camavor. Viego unleashing a torrent of hell-energy in an attempt to resurrect his dead wife turned Sanctity into the sword we know today — and that’s pretty neat.</p>

<p id="QFO8LZ">Kayle is the Aspect of Justice who empowers Garen, and she wields her mother’s sword. As Kayle levels up, so too does her sword, and in thein the late game she uses it to send out waves of righteous fire. There’s also some sisterly drama there; Kayle can pull her sword into two smaller swords, and one belongs by right to her sister Morgana. Morgana turned down her duties as the Aspect of Justice because she disagrees with Kayle’s unrelenting policies. Kayle’s sword(s) represent her ideological disagreements with Morgana, but they’re also just cool.</p>

<p id="4r9obK">Riven’s sword does a lot of work. It was forged with Rune magic in her homeland of Noxus, and she went to war with the great blade. When she realized the invasion of Ionia was unjust, she shattered her blade, and carries around a diminished, broken remnant of the sword. Her ultimate reforges the blade, which is taller than she is, and allows her to send out a wave of wind energy. Riven’s sword is relevant to her character, and it has tons of deep lore attached to it — that’s very cool.</p>

<p id="6L0Kdi">League of Legends lore is a patchwork of stories and concepts, some of which have been stitched over several times with retcons. Aatrox is one of these characters; he started out as a generic demon guy, and he’s since been turned into a much more interesting villain through rewrites. </p>
<p id="5HTJtt">Aatrox was one of the Ascended, massive warriors fused from the Shuriman Empire’s greatest warriors with the divine power of the Sun Disc in the capital. Ascended are half-human, half-beast, and many of them draw clear inspiration from various members of the Egyptian pantheon. </p>
<p id="DrJcg0">The <em>League of Legends</em> version of Ra, the hawk emperor Azir, built a vast empire using slavery. One of those slaves, his advisor Xerath, chose to betray him out of spite for this sin. There was an ensuing disaster that wiped out most of Shurima, and the remaining Ascended descended into blood magic and civil war. Eventually, they were sealed into weapons by ancient heroes, and those weapons serve as their prisons.</p>
<p id="n5og70">Aatrox doesn’t just <em>have</em> a cool sword, he <em>is</em> a cool sword. Whenever someone grasps his hilt, he can claim their body temporarily, building himself a pale imitation of his past glory out of meat and blood. But eventually, he runs out of war, and he goes back into the oblivion of sword prison. Aatrox is a Cronenberg body horror nightmare; it’s the best. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24161698/fortnite-new-lego-games-free<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="e1ec6A"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a><em> </em>continues its growth into a platform for experiences beyond the battle royale shooter, and now its adding another Lego game to its roster. Could it start to become the default home for Lego game experiences? On Tuesday, Lego Group and Epic Games released another game to its growing library of games: a space exploration adventure called Lego Smoothie Odyssey. </p>
<p id="V9F5zy">Lego Smoothie Odyssey’s name perfectly describes its gameplay. You explore the plastic-y cosmos and collect ingredients to make smoothies that are, shall we say,<em> out of this world</em>. Based on a description of the game, it appears to emphasize exploration and allows players to venture forth into a variety of locales featuring landmarks like ancient caves and bubbling geysers. Its goofy, neon pink and purple worlds perfectly match <em>Fortnite</em>’s aesthetic. </p>
<p id="qyCKxq">Prior to all the Lego <em>Fortnite </em>games, Warner Bros. Games served as the main publisher behind a lot of Lego games with licensed IP. This included its most recent release, <em>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em> in 2022. Now, Epic Games has become a major purveyor of Lego games. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23020450/epic-games-owners-shareholders-valuation-sony-lego-tencent-tim-sweeney">Sony and Lego Group invested $2 billion in Epic Games</a> back in the spring of last year. Now we’re starting to see the fruits of that investment, as the catalog of Lego games on <em>Fortnite </em>grows<em> </em>in number and in scope. </p>
<p id="ozAQRq">It started with the Minecraft-esque Lego Fortnite, which paired classic Lego brick building with survival gameplay. Since then Lego Group and Epic Games have continued to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24079480/lego-fortnite-fishing-minigame">expand upon the world in Lego Fortnite</a>, but also release a bunch of other games within the <em>Fortnite </em>launcher.

<p>Following the recent trailer showcasing the game’s gorgeous environments and weapon designs, we’re more excited than ever for Delta Force: Hawk Ops. So, when exactly is the release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-delta-force-hawk-ops-release">When Does Delta Force: Hawk Ops Release?</h2>



<p>We don’t have an official release date for Delta Force: Hawk Ops yet. The moment we do, you can bet we’ll update this guide to ensure you have the information before you!</p>



<p>That said, Delta Force: Hawk Ops appears to be progressing smoothly. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-delta-force-hawk-ops-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent trailer showcases</a> the environmental design, weapon systems, customization, and destruction, which look absolutely on point. </p>



<p>That said, it appears eerily similar to Battlefield. It’ll be tough to shake the comparisons if developer TiMi Studio intends to stand apart from the competition—if they even want to stand apart!</p>



<p>Furthermore, the studio revealed that this is, of course, nothing but a teaser. There’s more to come at next month’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a>!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-delta-force-hawk-ops-releasing-on">What Platforms is Delta Force: Hawk Ops Releasing On?</h2>



<p>In what’s an absolutely baffling move, honestly, Delta Force: Hawk Ops will launch on the following systems:</p>



<ul>
<li>PC</li>



<li>PlayStation 5</li>



<li>Xbox Series X|S</li>



<li>Android</li>



<li>iOS</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you see something off with that list? It’s entirely possible to launch a first-person shooter of this scale, with the level of detail on display, on PC, current-gen consoles, and mobile phones, right?</p>

<p>Longtime gamers (and/or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamegrumps">Game Grumps fans</a>) likely know that even single-player games can be a lot more fun with a friend hanging out nearby to offer advice, shoot the breeze, or just offer earnest reactions to whatever's happening on screen. Now, Microsoft is promising that its GhatGPT-4o-powered&nbsp;Copilot system will soon offer an imitation of that pro-social experience even for <em>Minecraft</em> players who don't have any human friends available to watch them play.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792625882634281231">pair</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792626848641274342">social media posts</a> Monday, Microsoft highlighted how "real-time conversations with your AI companion copilot" can enhance an otherwise solitary <em>Minecraft</em> experience. In the first demo, the disembodied copilot voice tells the player how to craft a sword, walking him through the process of gathering some wood or stone to go with the sticks sitting in his inventory. In another, the AI identifies a zombie in front of the player and gives the (seemingly obvious) advice to run away from the threat and "make sure it can't reach you" by digging underground or building a tower of blocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Real time conversations with your AI companion Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o. <a href="https://t.co/Ug7EWv2sah">pic.twitter.com/Ug7EWv2sah</a></p>
<p>— Microsoft Copilot (@MSFTCopilot) <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792626848641274342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>These kinds of in-game pointers aren't the most revolutionary use of conversational AI—even a basic in-game tutorial/reference system or online walkthrough could deliver the same basic information, after all. Still, the demonstration stands out for just <em>how</em> that information is delivered to the player through a natural language conversation that doesn't require pausing the gameplay even briefly.</p>
<p>The key moment highlighting this difference is near the end of one of the video demos, when the Copilot AI offers a bit of encouragement to the player: "Whew, that was a close one. Great job finding shelter!" That's the point when the system transitions from a fancy voice-controlled strategy guide to an ersatz version of the kind of spectator that might be sitting on your couch or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/a-newbies-guide-to-why-so-many-people-are-watching-twitch/">watching your Twitch stream</a>. It creates the real possibility of developing a parasocial relationship with the Copilot guide that is not really a risk when consulting a text file on GameFAQs, for instance (though I think the Copilot reactions will have to get a bit less inane to really feel like a valued partner-in-gaming).</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Just hanging out with my AI buddy</h2>
<p>It's unclear from the video clips whether Copilot is reading data directly from the <em>Minecraft</em> instance or simply reacting to the same information the player is seeing. But the social media posts came the same day as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-new-recall-feature-will-record-everything-you-do-on-your-pc/">Microsoft's announcement of "Recall,"</a> a coming feature that "take[s] images of your active screen every few seconds" to provide a persistent "memory" of everything you do on the computer. That feature will be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">exclusive to Copilot+ PCs</a>, which use an integrated Neural Processing Unit for on-device processing of many common generative AI tasks.
</p><p>Microsoft's <em>Minecraft</em> copilot demo brings to mind some of the similar conversations that OpenAI showed off during <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">last week's live demo of ChatGPT-4o</a>. But the artificial game-adjacent conversation here sounds significantly more robotic and direct than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/05/is-the-world-ready-for-an-ai-assistant-that-can-laugh-in-your-face/">the lifelike, emotional responses in ChatGPT's presentation</a>. Then again, ChatGPT has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/openai-pauses-chatgpt-4o-voice-that-fans-said-ripped-off-scarlett-johansson/">come under fire from actress Scarlett Johansson</a> for using a voice that sounds too much like her performance in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/people-are-speaking-with-chatgpt-for-hours-bringing-2013s-her-closer-to-reality/">a 2013 movie about a conversational AI</a>. Microsoft might be on safer ground sticking with a voice that is more obviously artificial here.

<p>Speaking of <em>Her</em>, we can't help but think of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8zDDPP3REE">one particular scene in that movie</a> where Joaquin Phoenix's Theodore asks for gaming advice both from the titular AI and a hilariously potty-mouthed NPC. Maybe Microsoft can add a casual cursing module to its Copilot gaming companion to really capture the feeling of hanging out with a dorm room buddy over a late-night gaming session.</p>

The preseason includes five factions from various Ubisoft's games. The first four are the Cleaners, Libertad, Echelon, and Phantoms, which will be available to everyone immediately. The fifth faction, Dedsec, will be available to unlock or purchase. The preseason also includes 14 maps, five game modes, and 24 weapons. While most game modes will be 6v6, the preseason will also include a 4v4 ranked practice playlist, which includes the same rules as the real ranked mode coming in Season 1.</p><p>As a free-to-play game, XDefiant makes money from microtransactions.

One of the first things you should hit is the Aim Response Curve Type, determining the movement of your aim. The Standard is reasonably balanced; however, I prefer the Reverse S-Curve for more mobility. Of course, it all depends on your playstyle, where you may even opt for Linear, a spec reserved for more experienced shooters.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true">One of the most&nbsp;crucial controller settings in <em>XDefiant</em> is&nbsp;the Horizontal and Vertical Sensitivity, which I recommend setting to 60. When I had it at the default, the movement speed felt sluggish. However, with this setting, the gameplay becomes smoother and faster. Similarly, adjusting the Acceleration Speed Multiplier to maximum can enhance your look speed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="false">The rest of the&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>controller settings, including the Dead Zone and controller vibration, are mainly tailored to your preferences. The same goes for the Gameplay and UI settings, which can tweak mechanics like speed, crouch, and weapon maneuvers. For a wider view, boost the Field of View to a maximum. You can also tweak this to fit your needs since higher settings can negatively impact the frame rate.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Did you know an iOS/Android game can be worth playing? Shocked me, too, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/seanbabys-calculords-is-a-free-ios-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but 2014’s <em>Calculords</em></a> made me re-evaluate my opinion, and now I know that <em>one</em> game is worth playing. However, now you can play <em>Calculords </em>without greasing up your screen, as it can now be played on <a href="https://richjoslin.itch.io/calculords">PC via Itch.io</a>.</p> <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">Did you know a game about math can be fun? Facts all around! I personally hate numbers. They’re the source of most of my misery. But it turns out that mashing them together can be used for good instead of evil. That’s right. <em>Calculords</em> core concept is waging space war using arithmetic.</p> <p data-characters="555" data-current-count="845" data-injectable="true">It succeeds by mashing together one of those popular attack/defense games that there are about a million variations of. You’ve seen them. They’ll literally have “attack” or “defense” in their names. This one, however, has you play your units by using cards with numbers on them. If you don’t have a card that is the exact amount as required by your unit, you then have to use arithmetic to calculate that amount. I think that technically means it’s algebra, but if you think I actually paid attention in math class you are laughably wrong.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="583" data-current-count="883" data-injectable="true">I played <em>Calculords</em> back in 2014 and thought it was pretty fantastic. It was designed in part by the internet’s Seanbaby, who made fun of crappy NES games on the world wide web before it was cool. He then had a column in EGM back when it was a magazine and still existed. Now he does 1900HOTDOG with other comedy writers, which is <a href="https://richjoslin.itch.io/calculords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supported through Patreon</a>. Full disclosure, Seanbaby was an inspiration to me back when I was just starting to write, and I probably wouldn’t be here if I didn’t follow his example. Also, I back 1-900-Hotdog’s Patreon, because why wouldn’t I?</p>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="false">That shouldn’t really matter, though, because <em>Calculords </em>is available for <a href="https://richjoslin.itch.io/calculords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free over on Itch.io</a>. It’s playable via a web browser. Originally, there were in-game microtransactions ($10 was about all you could spend on the game for everything), but the paid content is just included in this one. The idea seems to be preservation since it was apparently delisted some time ago. Gosh, the future sucks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modern-horizons-3-previewed-by-wizards-of-coast<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released new material on <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>. This official preview of the upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/magic-the-gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set provides fans a glimpse at what cards and mechanics will return, skips over elements already revealed via the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modern-horizons-3-leaks-addressed-by-wizards-of-coast">April leak</a>, and shows off some updated card artwork.</p>

<h2>The MTG Modern Horizons 3 Preview</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Wizards of the Coast covers a lot of ground as to what <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> will contain. First, the press release confirms that the set will contain Special Guests cards. These are 10 borderless mythic rares in Play Boosters (non-foil) and Collector's Boosters (foil).</p>

<p>Roughly 1 in 64 Play Boosters and 1 in 15.5 Collector's Boosters will contain a Special Guests card.</p>

In addition, 19 cards will receive the borderless profile treatment, 30 will feature the borderless frame break treatment, and 58 will receive the fan-favorite retro-frame treatment.</p>

<p>For Eldrazi fans, <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> has some heavy hitters. The titans Emraskul, Ulamog, and Kozilek return in non-foil and foil in Play Boosters and Collector's Boosters and serialized double rainbow foil printings contained in Collector Boosters. There are only 250 printings of each of them. Good luck.</p>

These cards will showcase the origins of <em>Magic's</em> more iconic characters. An example given is Tamiyo changing from Inquisitive Student to a Seasoned Scholar, complete with different abilities.</p>

<p>For fans of Commander format, Wizards of the Coast revealed more info on the sets' Commander Decks. Specifically, we now know the signature leader cards behind the four decks.</p>

<p>The Black/Red/Green deck, <em>Graveyard Overdrive</em> is lead by <em>Disa The Restless</em>, which can bring certain permanents to the battlefield if they are discarded. The Green/Blue deck <em>Tricky Terrain</em> showcases <em>Omo, Queen of Vesuvia</em>, a shapeshifter that can put counters on permanents making them count as every land or creature type.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/modern-horizons-3-commander-card-artwork.jpg?itok=SGz1wDPF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/modern-horizons-3-commander-card-artwork.jpg?itok=T48v4gll 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Behold the lynchpins of nasty deck strategies.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Creative Energy</em>, the Blue/Red/White deck centers on <em>Satya, Aetherflux Genius</em>, an artificer that can make copies of creatures you control when he attacks, albeit with some strings attached. Lastly the rainbow deck <em>Eldrazi Incursion</em> features <em>Ulalek, Fused Atrocity.</em> This Devoid legendary creature lets you copy spell effects and activated and triggered effects.</p>

<p>The press release confirms that <em>Modern Horizons 3</em> will have forty returning mechanics. Those mechanics include Energy, last seen in the Universes Beyond <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/mtg-x-fallout-mutant-menace-review-and-improvements"><em>Fallout</em> Commander Decks</a>, Umbra Armor, and Kindred. Those last two were formally called Tribal and Totem Warrior, but have been changed following the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/card-updates-coming-with-khans-of-tarkir-on-mtg-arena" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MTG Arena release</a> of <em>Khans of Tarkir</em>.</p>

<p><em>Modern Horizons 3</em> officially releases worldwide May 21.</p>

A new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23742799/warhammer-40k-leviathan-review-10th-edition-release-date-price">10th edition</a> Codex was announced alongside a new Battleforce starter army and a smaller format <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23743845/40k-studio-manager-interview-10th-edition-combat-patrol">Combat Patrol</a>.

<p id="xeWtIy">We’ve praised the Genestealer Cults before here at Polygon as one of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/16/17704024/warhammer-40000-genestealer-cult-cheapest-way-to-play">the most inexpensive ways to get started with <em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, and the little purple critters are back with a vengeance in 2024. A new 10th edition Codex is on the way and, just like the Sororitas above, that’s being paired with a new Battleforce starter army and a Combat Patrol. It’s the smaller Combat Patrol box that’s really turned our heads here since it comes with a standard vehicle, a heavy weapons-enabled quad bike, and no fewer than five cultists on dirtbikes. That should make this one of the most mobile small-unit forces in the game! Pricing and availability are forthcoming, with <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/18/warhammer-preview-the-genestealer-cults-get-a-big-brained-new-benefictus/">more information promised</a> in the weeks and months to come.</p>
<h2 id="Y9ZqjL"><strong>Plastic Adeptus Mechanicus units for The Horus Heresy</strong></h2>

<p id="nwBW17"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23153625/horus-heresy-age-of-darkness-price-availability-release-date-review"><em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</em></a> is getting a boatload of new plastic miniatures for the Cult Mechanicum — the first in the history of the line. That includes a dashing, art deco-inspired transport vehicle to ferry them all into battle and <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/18/warhammer-preview-the-mechanicum-turns-its-love-of-metal-to-plastic/">the promise of even more unique units to come</a>. Again, no pricing or availability information was shared, but these products are nonetheless expected soon.</p>
<h2 id="eEapyX"><strong>Necromunda gets a major new expansion</strong></h2>

<p id="rlTnxY">Finally, perhaps the biggest news from the weekend is the continued expansion of Games Workshop’s <em>Necromunda</em> universe. Already one of the most <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22458895/necromunda-warhammer-40k-getting-started-miniatures-kitbashing-conversions-terrain">vibrant and engaging</a> sectors of “the hobby” as it’s called, <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/18/warhammer-preview-plunder-the-haunted-depths-of-necromunda-hive-secundus/"><em>Necromunda: Hive Secundus</em></a><em> </em>looks for all intents and purposes like a new starter set. Games Workshop is describing it as “a full game in a box” however, noting that it contains a linked campaign for two players. Pricing and availability — Say it with me! — will be announced at a later date.</p>

When Mario first meets the witch, she’s a member of the antagonistic Shadow Sirens group alongside her sisters Beldam and Marilyn. It’s clear she doesn’t get along with her sisters and that they bully her, but the specifics of how and why were slightly different in the English and German localizations on the GameCube than they were in the original Japanese version.</p><p>In that version, Vivian was often referred to with male pronouns as an insult, despite her asserting that the Shadow Sirens were made up of three sisters. The group’s introduction in Japanese and several other localizations had Vivian introduce the group as sisters, which led to her sisters insulting her and referring to her as a man. The English localization, however, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crElVSsXyHY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crElVSsXyHY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rewrote the scene</a></span> to make her misstate the group’s name as the “Shadow Beauties,” which prompted angry, but non-gendered insults regarding her appearance from her sisters.</p><p>In the Switch remake, Vivian explicitly discusses her gender identity and her sisters’ transphobia with Mario. She says she realized she “was their sister...not their brother,” and that her sisters’ bullying has gotten worse since. The constant berating from her sisters is what prompts Vivian to join Mario’s party, and now new and old players can see the original context in 2024.</p><p><em>Nintendo Life</em>’s video review has the full exchange at about the five-minute mark. Vivian’s story only takes up a few scenes, but now you get the satisfaction of taking down transphobic assholes on the Switch.</p><p><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> remake comes to Switch on Thursday, May 23.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Deep dive and drill down on those deliverables by investing in a mix of barracks, factories and new tech during the day to keep your colony strong and reach the planet’s core. Make important corporate decisions like building up your platform’s defenses with turrets and guards to keep everyone safe, or pushing on for glory and greater rewards by focusing on the dig. Be mindful though, as when night falls aliens will attack from both above and below and endanger your precious revenue.</p><p>Each mission is unique, with procedurally generated planets, monsters, and conditions to test your strategy prowess. Will you move the needle and disrupt your approach or is it all above your paygrade? Collect valuable resources as you mine downwards to spend on upgrading your rig and employing new workers to optimize your dig. Each successful mission will unlock new upgrades for your platform so be sure to plan carefully and pick the right tools for the job.

<p data-characters="310" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following critical hits with <em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim </em>and <em>Unicorn Overlord</em>—which has done <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/vanillawares-unicorn-overlord-clears-the-500k-shipment-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty well for itself</a>—developer Vanillaware has some hints as to what it’s working on next. According to a recent tweet, the studio is actively recruiting staff for a “new fantasy action-RPG.”&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">The recruitment flyer says Vanillaware is on the hunt for programmers, 2D animators, and background designers (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/vanillaware-recruiting-development-staff-for-new-fantasy-action-rpg">Gematsu</a>). While details are understandably light, you can see the notice below. It describes the genre, notes that they’re recruiting development staff, and lists the above roles.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">Vanillaware has spent the better part of the past 20 years jumping back and forth between a few different genres. Its latest efforts, <em>13 Sentinels </em>and <em>Unicorn Overlord</em>, were a time-spanning adventure and a medieval strategy-RPG, respectively. Members of the Vanillaware team and Atlus <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/unicorn-overlord-devs-talk-history-card-games-and-that-delicious-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently spoke with Destructoid</a> about the development process, where they got the inspiration for <em>Unicorn Overlord</em>‘s scenario and setting, and more.</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">Prior to those, Vanillaware partnered with Atlus to release fantasy action-RPG <em>Dragon’s Crown</em>. Most of their games have some degree of fantasy to them, fitting the requested bill for the next project nicely. <em>Grand Knights History </em>hit PSP as a Japan-only title in 2011, and before that they put out titles like <em>Muramasa: The Demon Blade</em>, <em>Odin Sphere</em>, and <em>GrimGrimoire</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="false">Some of those games have been re-released via remasters and enhanced ports, which is why the “new” before “fantasy action-RPG” is doing a lot of the heavy-lifting in this listing. Since they’re still looking for staff, it might be a while before we hear anything else about it. Whatever Vanillaware is cooking up, it will most definitely look gorgeous, at the very least.</p>

<p data-characters="314" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the fabled launch of <em>Wuthering Waves</em> directly on the horizon, we already know a majority of what events will be available at the time of release. If you’re interested in knowing where a good portion of your premium currency will come from, keep reading, as I’ll detail each event as much as I can.</p> <h2 id="h-every-wuthering-waves-official-release-event" data-injectable="false">Every <em>Wuthering Waves</em> Official Release Event</h2> <p data-characters="160" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false">According to the most recent developer livestream for <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, we can expect four major launch events once the game officially releases on May 22, 2024.</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Depths of Illusive Realm</strong></li> <li><strong>Overdash Club</strong></li> <li><strong>Alloy Smelt</strong></li> <li><strong>Second Coming of Solaris</strong></li> </ul> <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true">The Depths of Illusive Realm and Overdash Club events were both available during <em>Wuthering Waves’ </em> CBT2, so I can give you some extra details on them. Alloy Smelt and Second Coming of Solaris are newly announced events, so my information on those comes directly from the aforementioned livestream. As always, any information I provide from the CBT2 is subject to chance on release.</p>
 <h3 id="h-depths-of-illusive-realm" data-injectable="false">Depths of Illusive Realm</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="822" data-injectable="true">Depths of Illusive Realm is a highly repeatable combat event that features a roguelike-style game mode where you transverse various randomly generated rooms, fighting enemies until you reach the boss at the end. Each room comes with a set of enemies you must defeat to proceed to the next, and each victory rewards you with the option to select from several strong buffs to make progression easier. Once you progress far enough, you’ll face a powerful boss on a timer, and must defeat said boss to conclude the run. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="766" data-current-count="1066" data-injectable="true">Before all that though, when you enter Depths of Illusive Realm, you must select <strong>one </strong>main character out of a small roster of currently featured characters for the event. Now that we know <strong>Jiyan</strong> is the first limited character banner in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>; expect him and the four-star characters apart of his banner to be the ones you can use in this event. This does mean, however, that your selection of characters is very limited if you don’t pull on banners to get featured characters. I’m hoping this has changed for the release, but this is how it relatively functioned in CBT 2. You also get to select <strong>one </strong>support character that can lend aid via their Ultimate ability. You won’t be able to fully swap to this character at any point during a run.</p>
 <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false">You can expect this event to be somewhat <strong>permanent</strong>, as it is set to be updated over time as new characters are released.</p> <h3 id="h-overdash-club" data-injectable="false">Overdash Club</h3> <figure data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">Overdash Club is a very simple event meant to showcase <em>Wuthering Waves’ </em>robust parkour system. In this event, you’ll be free-running through pre-determined tracks on a timer, navigating obstacles using the parkour system. Once you reach the end of a track, you’ll be rewarded with a small amount of Astrite. There are several tracks to run, but they won’t all be unlocked at the same time, instead unlocking on a pre-determined timer. </p>
 <h3 id="h-alloy-smelt" data-injectable="false">Alloy Smelt</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="864" data-injectable="true">Based on information gathered from the official Livestream, Alloy Smelt is a combat event focused on fighting many enemies at the same time. Unlike with Depths of Illusive Realm, you’ll be using a full team lineup to defeat as many enemies as possible to earn points. Based on the wording, I suspect you’ll be able to use your own account characters or have access to trial characters to participate. This is merely speculation, however, so take it with a grain of salt. Earn enough points during the event, and you’ll be rewarded with Astrite. </p>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">More combat events are always good and my book, and, from what I’ve been told, this event appeared inspired by <em>Punishing Gray Raven’s </em>Norman War event, which is a permanent mode in that game. Considering <em>Wuthering Waves</em> and <em>Punishing Gray Raven</em> are developed by Kuro Games, I’d expect this one to be permanent with updates as well.</p> <h3 id="h-second-coming-of-solaris" data-injectable="false">Second Coming of Solaris</h3> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="false">Second Coming of Solaris is a simple event where you’ll be accepting item commissions for delivery. Maqi, the NPC in charge of the event, will be requesting daily item deliveries. Successfully delivering commissioned items to Maqi will reward pull currency, among other small trinkets. While this isn’t the most exciting event, more pull currency is always a good thing.</p>
