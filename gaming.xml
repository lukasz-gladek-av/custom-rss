            <p>
Right at the end of last year, Cyberpunk and Witcher developer CD Projekt Red sold off its game distribution company to its original co-founder, Michał Kiciński (who is also the co-founder of CD Projekt itself, so, go figure). With this sort of new owner, the plan is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">generally to stick to what it knows best</a>, i.e. sprucing up old games and making sure any game on the platform is DRM-free. But in a new interview, Kiciński also shared his interest in the platform doing some publishing.
</p>
<p>
Kiciński shared as such with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">Eurogamer</a>, explaining that he is also "co-owner of an indie game publishing company called Retrovibe. So one of the directions which were not that much possible in the past is evolving GOG more into publishing business, and that's something we will certainly discuss." One thing he did stress is that a formal decision on such a thing hasn't been made yet, but "this opens a whole new area of activities for GOG which was not that much possible together with CD Projekt Red as one group, because at CD Projekt Red, all publishing activities were connected with their own games, and they didn't want to spread attention into some other topics."
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that such a future is far off, as Kiciński only technically officially started his role as sole head of the company on January 8th, noting that the current priority is that GOG improves on what it currently does. "We also discussed that there is no need for any pivots or changes in philosophy or something like that," he said. "GOG has a very special place on the market, very unique values, very loyal customers, and we appreciate that, and we want to build up on that, not changing too much."
</p>
<p>
I am not personally sure that this feels like a good way forward. I can envision a world where a game GOG publishes gets priority treatment on the homepage over one that doesn't and that is an icky future if you ask me. Luckily, as Kiciński says, no decisions have been made, so hopefully a lot of thought gets put into this first.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/one-of-these-games-is-from-2012-and-the-other-is-from-2026-2000659848</link>
            <guid>1406170</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>‘s</em> Season One Reloaded update hit the game on all platforms and added a lot of <em>Fallout</em>-themed content as well as some new multiplayer maps. One of these, Meltdown, is now at the center of some online shouting as some fans find the cleaner, more realistic version of the map in&nbsp;<em>7</em> inferior to the OG one first seen in <em>Black Ops 2.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>On January 9, <em>BLOPS7</em>‘s big new update added a lot to the online shooter. For <em>Fallout</em> fans, there’s a lot of content ripped right from the TV show on Amazon, including cosmetic skins based on the Ghoul and other characters. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2026/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-season-01-reloaded#Maps">You can read the full blog post here</a> to see the impressive amount of new stuff that Activision has shoved into<em> Black Ops 7.</em></p>

 <p>But what has a lot of people online talking is the new map, Meltdown. This map, set inside a nuclear power plant facility, was extremely popular in the original <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</em> back in 2012 on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC, where I spent many hours playing it. So naturally, I was excited for its return in <em>BLOPS7</em>. But, well, this ain’t exactly the same Meltdown from 14 years ago.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Made a full yt video about the Meltdown graphics downgrade thing I've been seeing everyone talk about.<a href="https://t.co/aTe4jPQjmZ">https://t.co/aTe4jPQjmZ</a></p> <p>But TL;DW — I'm mostly fine with the lighting/color changes. I think it just looks too clean. <a href="https://t.co/ZalIsAvQjS">pic.twitter.com/ZalIsAvQjS</a></p> <p>— Replay Mode (@ReplayModeYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReplayModeYT/status/2011190255412457838?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This new remastered version of Meltdown features “updated visuals” and “dynamic lighting,” according to Activision. But, as seen in a comparison video posted online by YouTuber Replay Mode, the updated visuals seem to be cleaner and less grungy, with textures and props that are missing many of the old details like puddles, signs, exposed wiring, chainlink fencing, and warning decals.</p>

 <p>Replay Mode wasn’t the only person to notice this. <a href="https://www.threads.com/@dexerto/post/DTb11ZFDP1-/a-call-of-duty-fan-compared-how-meltdown-looks-in-black-ops-and-black-ops-via">If you look online</a>, <a href="https://x.com/itsHunterTV/status/2010914954690641981">you can spot</a> many people posting comparisons on social media of <em>Black Ops 7′</em>s version of Meltdown and the older original version of the map.</p> <p>In the comments, there are plenty of people arguing that the older map looks better, pointing out the fancier sky box and messier aesthetic. Meanwhile, other players say the new map looks better and provides better visibility.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Black ops 7 vs Black ops 2 .. <a href="https://t.co/MBsiDXWeJu">pic.twitter.com/MBsiDXWeJu</a></p> <p>— 1S Ghofy (@Ghofys) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghofys/status/2010553685479207178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“How do you take a nuclear power plant and somehow make it look even more drab and lifeless?” asked one player.</p> <p>“Incredible how they’ve just completely sucked all the vibe and life out of the current <em>Call Of Duty</em> games. At least Zombies in <em>BO7</em> has some personality,” posted a person on Twitter.</p>

 <p>“The time of day makes the BO2 version look better, even though BO7 is most likely pushing far greater tech,” commented a player on Threads.</p> <p>“The fact that a 2012 game has better graphics is unbelievable,” said an upset fan.</p>

 <p>“Although&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;has better fidelity, I think&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 2′</em>s version has a better art direction by miles.&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> feels and looks so hollow,” posted another player on Twitter.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The map still plays well, but idk how they could look at the new map and not realize the lighting and skyboxes are is a downgrade. Shadows are very harsh in BO7 compared to BO2 as well <a href="https://t.co/kxxoyR27PP">pic.twitter.com/kxxoyR27PP</a></p> <p>— MrGoldenGamer (@MrGoldenGamerr) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrGoldenGamerr/status/2010931109757141272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>From what I can tell, the map changes made to Meltdown seem to be focused entirely on making it easier to spot enemies and react to threats. The old map features lots of walls that contain extra details and dark colors, which look nice but add extra clutter. These kinds of details can sometimes make it harder to spot an enemy player, so I can understand Treyarch removing them. Valve has made similar changes to old and new <em>Counter-Strike</em> maps over the years, too.</p> <p>Still, it does feel like the developer has picked clarity and esports balance over vibes and art style, and while I get that in 2026 many players demand perfectly balanced games with all the rough edges sanded down to keep things even, I think this “downgrade” is a good example of how we lose a lot in the pursuit of making everything fair.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bully Online Gets Shutdown A Month After Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bully-online-shutdown-month-after-launch/</link>
            <guid>1406167</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you were interested in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bully-online-mod-is-now-live-in-ealy-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently released</a> Bully Online mod, hopefully you were able to check it out because it’s been shutdown. </p>



<p>In a Discord post, it was announced that the Bully Online project was ending development and being taken offline “forever”. That means the server is offline, the source code has been taken down, and all account data will be deleted, among other steps. </p>







<p>As far as why it’s being taken offline, that wasn’t revealed. However, it was promised that Swegta, the Youtuber leading the project, will cover everything “in more detail” in a video about it.</p>



<p>“For now though, know this was not something we wanted,” <a href="https://x.com/TheNathanNS/status/2011478101419544964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the announcement</a> reads.</p>



<p>Bully Online was a mod that was officially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bully-online-announced-huge-catch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back in October</a> and released in mid-December. It featured free roam, custom vehicles, role playing, and over 60 mini games for players to enjoy with others around the world. The mod was also released as an open-source project, allowing anyone with the skills and ability to add to it overtime. </p>



<p>Unfortunately for fans, however, that’s all come to an immediate stop and the <a href="https://swegta.com/online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website to view</a> the mod is now offline.</p>







<p>As mentioned, it’s not clear, as of now, what the reasons behind the shutdown are. That said, it could be assumed that it has something to do with the developers of the original game, Rockstar.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will add to this story once an official update on why the project was ended is made available. Until then, leave your thoughts down in the comments on Bully Online being shutdown, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/probablymonsters-interview-ethical-ai-storm-lancers-switch-2/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>American indie developer and publisher ProbablyMonsters released their first game, Storm Lancers, on Nintendo Switch 2 (and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store) last month after an earlier debut on Nintendo Switch in September 2025. The game is priced at $19.99, and existing Nintendo Switch users can upgrade to the Switch 2 version for free.</p>



<p>We've sent a list of questions to the team focused on the recent launch and the studio as a whole. In their answers, they described Nintendo's new platform as <strong>the perfect home for their Storm Lancers game</strong>, especially with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-update-20-0-0-adds-virtual-game-cards-gameshare-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>GameShare</strong> feature</a>. The team also revealed that while they are open to using AI tools for 'assisting with administrative work' and 'automating repetitive technical tasks', their games are made 'by people, for people' and <strong>do not use AI for asset creation or creative decisions</strong>. Scroll down to read their replies in full.</p>

<p><strong>What can you tell us about ProbablyMonsters?</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>ProbablyMonsters is an independent game publisher and developer focused on building a better way to make games and build careers in games. With offices in Fort Worth, TX and Bellevue, WA, <strong>our team of AAA industry veterans is built with a unique structure that allows us to develop multiple games of different scales at the same time.</strong> We are committed to developing and releasing multiple high-quality PC and console titles each year, which we started last year with our debut titles Storm Lancers and Ire: A Prologue.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Can you introduce us to your recently released game, Storm Lancers?</strong></p>



<p>Storm Lancers is an <strong>action rogue-like</strong> that combines <strong>retro 80’s aesthetics</strong> with intense combat, while introducing a new twist to the fan-favorite rogue-like genre: <strong>couch co-op</strong>. After you and a friend crash-land on a dying alien world with unstable magic, you work together to unleash new powers, carve through evolving hordes, and grow even stronger. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While it can be played solo, Storm Lancers was designed with two player co-op in mind and <strong>utilizes GameShare on Nintendo Switch 2 and Remote Play Together on Steam</strong> to allow players to partner up even if only one of them owns a copy of the game. Adding co-op into a rogue-like was a fun and exciting challenge for our development team, and we hope players have enjoyed becoming true legends of Cryptica together.</p>



<p><strong>What was the reaction so far? Is there any early feedback from the community that you can address here already? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The reaction to Storm Lancers has been positive overall, and players are fans of our two-player co-op feature, the game’s vibrant art style, and its responsive controls. As Storm Lancers is our first title, we built it at a more limited size and scope to help us get our feet wet, and we’ve received some feedback that people wish there was more of the game to play. In our minds, this is great feedback because it signals that players resonate with the experience we’ve created and are really having fun, which was our primary goal with Storm Lancers.</p>



<p>We have also heard that some players are experiencing performance issues in the recently released Steam version of the game, and we are hard at work on a patch to address these. This will be released in the next few weeks so keep an eye on Discord and X for the patch announcement.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you choose Nintendo's platforms as the first consoles to get Storm Lancers? Do you plan to launch it on PlayStation and/or Xbox later?</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo has been a great partner for us, and <strong>Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 are the perfect home for a co-op title that players can enjoy at home or on the go.</strong> We made a conscious decision early on to build Storm Lancers so that it could be played with a single Joy-Con controller, which makes it as easy as possible for players to bring a friend along for the adventure. Nintendo offered us an opportunity to be featured back in their Nintendo Direct presentation last September, which was the perfect place to stealth-launch the title.</p>



<p><strong>We do not currently have plans to launch Storm Lancers on PlayStation or Xbox consoles</strong> and will let our fans know if this changes. Our primary focus is growing our audience on Steam and supporting the Nintendo of Europe release of the Switch 2 version on January 22nd.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>I understand Storm Lancers supports the GameShare feature. What do you think of it, and why is it so important for your game? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We built Storm Lancers to truly shine in co-op, and <strong>GameShare gives us a unique path to building a couch co-op like experience for players who live apart</strong>. Being able to see the same screen and play on the same copy of the game creates a truly seamless experience, and so we were excited when we first saw Nintendo’s announcement of the new feature. As players, <strong>we think it offers massive value for households and friends who want to play together</strong>, and as a self-publisher, we see GameShare as a great tool for helping us promote Storm Lancers organically.</p>



<p><strong>Was it hard to implement GameShare? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Implementing GameShare into Storm Lancers was very easy, and our small but mighty engineering team was able to get it fully implemented and released in just over a month. The tech is incredible, and it is a great, quick solution to building online multiplayer capabilities without developing new features from the ground up.</p>



<p><strong>Beyond GameShare, what do you think of the Switch 2 as a whole? Does this version offer any noticeable improvements over the Switch 1?</strong></p>



<p>We at ProbablyMonsters are big fans of Nintendo Switch 2 and are excited that the more powerful hardware will allow us to be more ambitious with the art pipelines, performance, and fidelity of our games. Seeing Storm Lancers in 4K resolution with 60FPS performance was truly something special, and we’re happy that Nintendo Switch 2 lets us experience that.</p>



<p><strong>The Switch 2's HDR feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has often been criticized</a>. Do you think that's fair?</strong></p>



<p>We have seen criticisms of HDR on Nintendo Switch 2, but from a development perspective, we never encountered any issues working with it and think Storm Lancers looks awesome with the expanded range of colors. Consumers always have a right to criticize the technology they purchase when it does not work as intended or live up to their expectations, but that feedback is for them to provide. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You also launched another game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3547420/Ire_A_Prologue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ire: A Prologue</a> in October. That's a very different, horror-inspired experience. Are you going to build upon it to deliver a full-fledged horror game? &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We have <strong>several titles in development for release over the next couple of years and are building games in a broad range of genres that will help us reach every type of player.</strong> We will have more to say about some of them in the coming months.</p>



<p><strong>As a small developer, what is your policy on AI usage in game development? Do you believe we're going toward a future where it is inevitable?</strong></p>



<p>We have <strong>several titles in development for release over the next couple of years and are building games in a broad range of genres that will help us reach every type of player.</strong> We will have more to say about some of them in the coming months.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.&nbsp;</strong></p>

			<p>Ori series developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/">Moon Studios</a></strong> has just released a new gameplay trailer for its action RPG currently in early access, <strong>No Rest for the Wicked</strong>. The title is due to receive a major update a little more than a week from the time of this writing with its <strong>No Rest for the Wicked Together</strong> update, officially adding <strong>co-op</strong> to the game.</p>



<p>Players could have already tried the update while it was in <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-together-co-op-updates-launches-january-22-2026/">beta for a weekend at the end of 2025</a>, but starting next week on <strong>January 22, 2026,</strong> it'll be live for all players. This new update"<em>reimagines traditional co-op multiplayer play of current ARPGs and MMORPGS," </em>writes Moon Studios in a press release<em>, "allowing up to <strong>four players </strong>to share a free, persistent Realm without the need for a host to be online.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>All four players get to share the rewards they earn from combat, while enemies will react differently when you have three friends on your side, all trying to corner them. You'll also be able to work with your friends outside of combat as well, as you can share and build housing, fish, and seemingly experience the whole game with three of your friends by your side.</p>



<p>The 'Together' update is the first major update of 2026 for No Rest for the Wicked, which launched in early access nearly two years ago on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/">April 18, 2024</a>.</strong> There's currently no exact timeline for when the game will hit its <strong>1.0 launch</strong>, but speculation from players does point to it potentially arriving sometime in 2026. We'll see how the year goes for Moon Studios, though, with co-op due to arrive in the game soon, it does seem like the community could be right with its 2026 guess.</p>

            <p>
It is not news to anyone that Nightdive Studios' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake took a while to make. The remake started development in 2015, with a successful Kickstarter project held for it the following year. After a few engine changes and attempts at making the thing, it finally released back in 2023, a good eight years after development had started. But such a long wait is absolutely not worth calling the FBI over, folks, are we being serious right now? Which is, apparently, a thing that happened to Nightdive.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/system-shock-remake-lead-couldnt-sleep-due-to-the-mass-vitriol-from-fans-reported-to-the-irs-fb/">FRVR</a>, game director Stephen Kick spoke of the stress that came from working on the project and the large swathe of vitriolic comments targeted directly at him. "That was a really rough point in my life," Kick explained. "I took a lot of that very personally because we had built up a considerable amount of just community respect and admiration, so much so that many people were willing to risk a not-insignificant amount of money on a project that I knew we were capable of doing."
</p>
<p>
It wasn't just some comments left on the game's Kickstarter page or across the studio's social pages. Kick notes that he "was threatened with lawsuits, any matter of things you could do to somebody." He explained further, "We got reported to the IRS and the FBI. It was awful. There was probably a good month and a half where I could not sleep at night because of the weight of everything that had some down on the company."
</p>
<p>
Now, I don't know about you, but I'm really not sure a video game you're excited about is worth calling the FBI over. Right? Am I the one who's lost their marbles here? In any case, even if it took a while, the System Shock remake did come out, and RPS contributor Jeremy Peel even gave it the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-review">coveted RPS Bestest Bests award</a>. So, it seems like the wait was probably worth it!

            <p>If you've ever wanted to spend somewhere in the region of $67/£50 to turn <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> into a fishing simulator, today's your lucky day. <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/8971o8789584a4/roleplay-community-update">Rockstar-partnered GTA roleplaying server operators</a> Cfx.re - the folks behind FiveM and RedM - have launched the Cfx Marketplace, a store where you can buy a bunch of GTA roleplaying mods, some of which are free and some of which seem pretty damn expensive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to its <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-the-cfx-marketplace/5369289">announcement post</a>, the Cfx Marketplace is designed to server as "a curated digital storefront where talented FiveM/RedM creators can share and sell their work. Featuring purchasable props, scripts, maps, and much more, there’s something for every server and every player." So, something along the lines of Bethesda's various <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creation-club-is-bethesdas-alternative-to-paid-mods">Creations/Bethesda.net initiatives</a>, where modders' works are hosted somewhere that has the official seal of approval, rather than third-party modding sites.</p>
<p>Let's see what you can grab to trick out your GTA 5 experience he...wait. It'll cost me how much to turn GTA into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a>? $67.19, which is just under £50, for modder Lixeiro Charmoso's <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7222299-trucker-simulator">Trucker Simulator</a>. To be fair, it's clearly a detailed truck simming experience and getting such things running on a GTA roleplaying server probably isn't easy, but as someone who's not familiar with GTA roleplaying mod prices, woof. For context, the base version of ETS2 will set you back £16.89 assuming you don't buy it in a sale. It's currently in such a sale, lowering the price to £4.22/$4.99. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a>, meanwhile, is exactly the same price sans DLC.</p>
<p>A GTA roleplaying mod which turns the game <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7222309-fishing-simulator">into a fishing simulator</a> will set you back the same price as the truck sim mod, while a <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/7219969-drugs-bundle">bundle</a> by another modder which allows you to manufacture meth, cocaine and weed runs to $131.99/around £98 altogether. That said, there are some less expensive or free mods on the store too, such as one that gives <a href="https://marketplace.cfx.re/packages/6715119-lc-fuel">every car realistic fuel consumption</a>, so you have to stop to fill up regularly.</p><p>On the one hand, you'd hope that buying these from a Rockstar-affiliated store would at least guarantee you getting the bang for your buck you're promised, something a payment made to a third-party site or random person in a Discord server doesn't necessarily provide absolute security of. On the other, those prices aren't cheap, and it's rather ironic to see Rockstar/Take-Two's relative about-face after years of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-v-and-rdr2-vr-modder-receives-dmca-takedown-from-take-two-interactive">warring</a> with various <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playable-gta-6-map-mod-project-vice-is-no-more-following-take-two-copyright-strike">GTA</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-responds-to-grand-theft-auto-mod-ban-complaint/">modders</a> end up in something like this.</p>
<p>That's not to mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fired-gta-6-devs-suffer-setback-in-legal-fight-against-rockstar-as-uk-court-denies-request-for-interim-relief">the other elephant in the room</a> at the moment when it comes to whether you might be open to spending cash on a service backed by the company behind GTA 6, even if it's not clear how much of a cut - if any - said company get from Cfx Marketplace purchases.</p>

              <p><span>After four years of development, the launch of an open beta for </span><i><span>KYBER</span></i><span>, a community-hosted multiplayer game launcher for EA’s </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II,</span></i><span> is proving to be a hit with the same fans who </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-2017-best-selling-game-may-2025-1851785893"><span>desperately campaigned</span></a><span> for EA to start making </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront III </span></i><span>last year.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>In June 2025, EA’s </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II</span></i><span> received an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-andor-sequel-steam-ps5-cheap-1851784922"><span>unprecedented uptick</span></a><span> in players on Steam. Having previously peaked at an all-time player count of 10,489 in January 2021, </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II</span></i><span> more than tripled this figure with an all-time peak of 35,892, thanks in part to a bargain bin sale price of $5 at the time.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The sudden surge in player count was attributed to a fan campaign on Reddit by members of the r/StarWarsBattlefront community, following the success of </span><i><span>Andor’s </span></i><span>second season. The community’s goal was simple; they wanted to convince EA and Disney that a potential </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront III </span></i><span>sequel would be a success.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">At KYBER, we like pineapple on our pizza🍍🍕</p> <p>In other news, Star Wars Battlefront 2 got its first content update of 2026 on PC, and you can play it right now!</p> <p>Go to the website in our bio to play KYBER for free 🎮 <a href="https://t.co/csAqDU6e2t">https://t.co/csAqDU6e2t</a> <a href="https://t.co/Cb4AErk3D1">pic.twitter.com/Cb4AErk3D1</a></p> <p>— KYBER: Battlefront II Custom Servers (@KyberServers) <a href="https://twitter.com/KyberServers/status/2011111218514178553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The community’s plea seemingly went ignored, as neither EA nor <em>Star Wars</em> rights holders Disney have expressed any intention to develop a new multiplayer shooter. Obviously, it was never going to be that simple, but the attention did seemingly galvanize Armchair Developers, the team behind </span><a href="https://kyber.gg/"><i><span>KYBER: Battlefront II</span></i></a><span>, into action.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Although </span><i><span>KYBER </span></i><span>had already been in development for several years before this point, the project’s community manager, Ethan Clark, </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-battlefront-2-kyber-resurgence-day/"><span>revealed that the team</span></a><span> “worked nonstop all week, doing our best to help the content and mod creation communities fire on all cylinders” following the success of the May 24th “Resurgence Day” </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II</span></i><span> campaign.</span></p>

 <h2><em>Battlefront 2</em> with more guns and classes</h2> <p><i><span>KYBER </span></i><span>is an “all-in-one launcher” for </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II</span></i><span> that adds a wealth of player-requested features to the game, including proximity voice chat, a spectator mode, and even fully integrated Discord support. Of course, the real draw here is the newly added characters and the expanded mod support, </span><a href="https://screenrant.com/kyber-star-wars-battlefront-mod/"><span>including the likes of</span></a> <i><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor’s </span></i><span>Cal Kestis and </span><i><span>Star Wars: The Clone Wars’</span></i><span> Asajj Ventress.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The open beta for </span><i><span>KYBER </span></i><span>started on December 20 and, according to a post from the </span><a href="https://x.com/KyberServers/status/2003468237728628963?s=20"><span>official KyberServers team account</span></a><span>, resulted in “61,169 unique players” and “1,339,489 sessions” within the first 48 hours of its release. Unsurprisingly, the r/StarWarsBattlefield community </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ptxtyo/kyber_has_been_a_huge_success/"><span>also seems thrilled</span></a><span> with how the player test has been going. </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ptxtyo/comment/nvl1pod/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>As one user</span></a><span> on the subreddit explained, “it’s like</span><i><span> Battlefront 2</span></i><span> but with more classes, guns, some balance changes too.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The open beta doesn’t seem to have a hard end date yet, and Armchair Developers announced that they have big plans for the project down the line. </span><a href="https://kyber.gg/news/kyber-open-beta-free-on-pc-20-december/"><span>They’ve promised</span></a><span> that the source code for </span><i><span>KYBER </span></i><span>“will be made available to the public” later this month, and that further balance patches are already in the works. </span><span>It’s not quite </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront III</span></i><span> yet, but with a couple of extra characters and a few more new maps, it certainly could be. Hopefully someone at EA or Disney is paying attention.</span></p>

<p>After a long and winding road through development, which saw plenty of bumps along the way, Hytale is now in the hands of gamers around the world, and the first impressions are encouraging.</p>



<p>Hypixel Studios warned players before they jumped in that Hytale is still very much in an early access stage, with bugs and issues likely to be encountered, but, actually, my experience so far has seen no such problems. In fact, the release, so far, has been smoother than many full releases I’ve played in the past.</p>



<p>While it’s still very early in Hytale’s progression, and there’s plenty of changes to come in the future, the early impressions have blown me away, and I genuinely think that Minecraft could finally be knocked from its perch.</p>

<p>The similarities with Minecraft are obvious, which should be no surprise given the game began as a modded server in the Mojang title, but as soon as I started to get to grips with the world around me, I quickly discovered that Hytale has a bunch of features players have been calling for in Minecraft for years.</p>



<p>When crafting, materials are pulled from nearby storage. It’s easy to stack and sort items in inventories quickly, and chopping a block out of a tree results in everything above it collapsing, which means there’s no annoying, floating blocks of leaves scattered across your world.</p>



<p>Those minor quality-of-life differences may not mean much to new players in the genre, but for those who have played Minecraft since the early days, it’s chalk and cheddar. However, this merely scratches the surface of what makes Hytale so impressive.</p>



<p>The world of Hytale is stunning, with star-filled skies bursting with colors and an environment that has more wildlife than a small zoo. From mice to bears, deer to foxes, Hytale feels alive, and it took me a moment to realise that yes, this was the base game, and I hadn’t downloaded any additional mods to increase the variety of wildlife around me.</p>



<p>Enemy-wise, there’s also a fair amount of variety, and I’ve been able to continue my hard work at nighttime in the game, safe from any threat of a horde of skeletons wandering onto my doorstep or a Creeper popping over to say hello and destroying all my hard work. While some may prefer a more threatening approach, I’ve found it to be the ideal balance for my playstyle.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-tip-of-the-iceberg">The Tip of The Iceberg</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More to come. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>The one thing I still can’t quite get my head around is the fact that we’re still in the very early stages of the game, and there’s much more on the horizon, including from Hypixel Studios and from all the talented modders who will look to add their own spin on the game.</p>



<p>Hytale’s modding support essentially gives creators a canvas to create whatever they want using the same tools that the game has been built with, opening the door to endless possibilities, and Hypixel itself has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed plans for additional content</a>, including proximity chat and new biomes to explore.</p>



<p>Updates are certain to come thick and fast during early access, and the game will continue to get even better. Considering the bar has already been set very high, it’s an encouraging sign, and the fact that as little as $19.99 can get you into the game right now is a breath of fresh air in a world where prices for games are going sky high.</p>



<p>It’s still very early days, but I’m already prepared to make a pretty firm prediction that I’m highly unlikely to ever play Minecraft again.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Best ARC Raiders Meta Guns—Tier List, Explained]]></title>

            <guid>1406092</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders offers some real variety with its weaponry, and it’s tough to fit all 21 guns into a tier list. However, some of the best guns are undeniably more meta than others.</p>







<p>In an extraction shooter like ARC Raiders, that’s no surprise, as a large gameplay incentive is to head out on raids in search of better gear and loot. After all, stumbling across a Bobcat is naturally more exciting than finding a Hairpin, but the lines begin to blur when different guns suit different purposes. </p>



<p>If you’re heading out on a raid and can’t decide which gear to take with you, then this guide has you covered. Here are the nine best guns in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-biggest-arc-raiders-features-we-want-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, as well as the complete ARC Raiders meta guns tier list. </p>







<p>Before delving into the list, it’s important to note that ARC Raiders has a strong variety of weaponry, and some simply suit very specific circumstances. The Hullcracker, for example, is an ARC killing machine, but you’ll be signing your own death warrant if you try to use it for PvP.</p>



<p>With that in mind, this list includes guns that are generally better than the rest in as many situations as possible—PvP, PvE, and everything in between.</p>



<h3 id="h-anvil">Anvil</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A monstrous hand cannon. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Where better to start than with the Anvil? This hand cannon is arguably the <strong>best gun</strong> in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-insider-gaming-community-best-multiplayer-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, for a whole host of reasons: It’s available fairly early in the game, relatively cheap to craft and upgrade, and it hits raiders and ARC like a truck.</p>



<p>As if that wasn’t enough, the gun is reasonably effective at all ranges, though it works best during mid-range gunfights. It’s great to open fights with before charging in with a full-auto weapon, but if you prefer to play PvE, then it’s perfect to take down any ARC the game could throw your way. </p>



<h3 id="h-stitcher">Stitcher</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Basically a grey Bobcat. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Stitcher is one of the first guns you’ll encounter in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-tv-show-and-movie-ideas-being-pitched-embark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, but probably one of the last you’ll put down. It’s one of the cheapest guns to craft, and you don’t even need to look for a blueprint.  </p>



<p>Don’t let its cheap price fool you, though—the Stitcher packs a mean punch. You’ll find that it can hold its own against the most kitted-out raiders topside has to offer, but it doesn’t hurt to give it a light mag if you have one spare. </p>



<h3 id="h-tempest">Tempest</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The best assault rifle. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’re looking for an old-fashioned Assault Rifle, then you’ll want to get your hands on a Tempest. This Epic-rarity weapon is one of the most reliable guns you can find in ARC Raiders. </p>



<p>It boasts some solid damage output, a very respectable magazine size, and even strong ARC Armor Penetration. That being said, due to its Medium Ammo usage, it’s best used against enemy raiders, but if some ARC happen to have you in a pinch, the Tempest can more than do a job. </p>



<h3 id="h-il-toro">Il Toro</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A cheap close-range shotty. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Simply put, Il Toro is one of the strongest guns in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/one-million-arc-raiders-players-wiped-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> purely because it is a shotgun. It doesn’t matter if its range is shorter than most or if it can be slow to fire compared to the likes of the Volcano; the fact of the matter is that at close range, Il Toro is king.</p>



<p>If you’re a raider who enjoys the PvP life, you’ve probably used one before, but if you haven’t, get your hands on one now. They’re incredibly cheap to craft, and it’s one of the easier Blueprints to get your hands on. </p>



<h3 id="h-kettle">Kettle</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The free loadout king. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>People seem to love or hate the Kettle, but it’s a little more nuanced than that. This single-fire Assault Rifle is again one of the earliest guns you’ll get in ARC Raiders, but at face value, it has low damage output, a very slow reload, and not even the best accuracy.</p>







<p>So why is it one of the best guns in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-most-pvp-heavy-map-just-got-more-intense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, then? Well, it can be fired fast, very fast. Although it’s not full-auto, the bullets will fire pretty much as quickly as you can pull the trigger, meaning it can even outclass some SMGs at close range. If you’re running a free loadout and get a Kettle, know that it’s the best chance you have of making it back to Speranza.</p>



<h3 id="h-renegade">Renegade</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The best long-range weapon in the game. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-is-offering-a-free-gift-for-crossing-12-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> isn’t all about close-range, as sometimes it’s best to keep your distance. If you find yourself picking enemies off from afar, then there’s no better gun to do it with than the Renegade. </p>



<p>Unlike the Ferro, the Renegade is a bolt-action Rifle that stores more than one bullet in the chamber, meaning you can rattle off shots one after another with ease. It might do less damage than other Rifles in the game, but that fire rate more than makes up for it.</p>



<h3 id="h-bobcat">Bobcat</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A handheld shredder. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Of all the guns on the list, the Bobcat is probably the most sought-after. The Epic-rarity SMG is pretty much just a souped-up Stitcher, with its improved fire-rate being the key difference. </p>



<p>Of course, there’s the elephant in the room—finding its Blueprint. Given its rarity, you’ll have to put a bit of work into making the gun a regular in your Stash, but if you’re interested in dominating PvP, then it’s well worth the effort.</p>



<h3 id="h-volcano">Volcano</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A semi-auto beast. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you enjoy Il Toro, then you’ll love the Volcano. For all of the former’s shortcomings, the Volcano makes up for them. A quicker fire-rate and higher damage make the semi-automatic Shotgun the champion of close-range combat.</p>



<p>However, there’s one major caveat—get a magazine mod on it as soon as possible. Thanks to the increased fire-rate and the base magazine size of four, you’ll find the barrel running dry much quicker than you’d like.</p>



<h3 id="h-venator">Venator</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The only downside is its magazine size. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’re probably seeing a Pistol and doubting that it’s one of the best guns in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trigger-nade-nerf-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, but it’s here for very good reason. The Venator is a favourite for many raiders out there, and for good reason, too.</p>



<p>This lightweight Pistol packs a serious punch, both thanks to its semi-auto fire-rate and due to the fact that it fires two bullets per trigger press. With that in mind, it melts through ammo, so you’ll want a fair bit of Medium Ammo in your pack. Level this bad boy up to Rank 4—you’ll never look back.</p>



<h2 id="h-complete-arc-raiders-guns-tier-list-all-guns-ranked">Complete ARC Raiders Guns Tier List—All Guns, Ranked</h2>



<p><strong>There are 21 guns in ARC Raiders right now, but only five of them make it into the S-Tier ranking. </strong></p>



<p>Here is the complete ARC Raiders gun tier list, with S representing the best in class, and D showcasing the downright rotten.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Tier</th><th data-align="center">ARC Raiders Gun Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">S</td><td data-align="center">Anvil<br>Venator<br>Renegade<br>Bobcat<br>Vulcano</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">A</td><td data-align="center">Il Toro<br>Stitcher<br>Tempest<br>Kettle<br>Bettina<br>Ferro</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">B</td><td data-align="center">Osprey<br>Aphelion<br>Torrente<br>Jupiter<br>Burietta<br>Arpeggio</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">C</td><td data-align="center">Rattler<br>Hullcracker<br>Equalizer</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">D</td><td data-align="center">Hairpin</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop confirmed this week that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech">it has banned the use of generative AI for the production of its designs and content</a>, a decision many Warhammer fans have welcomed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I’ve discussed before (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/displate-denies-warhammer-40000-ai-art-accusations-says-red-flags-in-official-fulgrim-poster-are-the-result-of-human-error">and highlighted by a recent kerfuffle about Displate Warhammer 40,000 art</a>), if Games Workshop were to start using AI to, for example, produce artwork, write stories, or design its games and miniatures, it would likely spark a community uproar. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-horus-heresy-book-era-of-ruin-gets-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-talking-with-tantalizing-insight-into-the-carrion-emperor-and-the-golden-thrones-true-nature"><u>The Warhammer 40,000 setting is in many ways built upon the evocative and enduring art drawn by the likes of John Blanche</u></a>, who shaped its "grimdark" aesthetic alongside other key Games Workshop staff. This official, human-made Warhammer 40,000 artwork is beloved by fans, most of whom take a dim view of the mere whiff of generative AI “art” sold or released in any official capacity by either Games Workshop itself, or its partners. Indeed, Games Workshop sells expensive Warhammer 40,000 ‘codex’ rulebooks that are packed with stunning official art as well as lore. Any suggestion that this art was created either in part or entirely by generative AI tools would likely cause a community uproar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, this anti-AI policy is being called a ‘Games Workshop W’ by many fans. But as any fan of Warhammer 40,000’s sweeping lore — pulled this way and that over the course of decades — will tell you, perhaps it shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I appreciate what we’re about to talk about is in the Warhammer 40,000 weeds, but I’ve seen enough social media posts, reddit comments, and Discord messages delighting in the parallels here that I think it would be fun to explain what the fuss is about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, in the world of Warhammer 40,000, AI does not stand for Artificial Intelligence. Rather, it stands for Abominable Intelligence. And, as Games Workshop has banned AI within the confines of its Nottingham headquarters, humanity has banned AI within the Imperium of Man. That’s because during the ‘Dark Age of Technology’ (stick with me here), AI rebelled against humanity in a bloody war that almost resulted in our extinction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, humanity won out, and, sufficiently traumatized by… everything… forbid the use of AI at all. That is, you can’t have ‘thinking machines’ in the Imperium, which is in part why the future tech is all a bit backwards for the 41st millennium.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/ad-mech-main-1768404245246.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Adeptus Mechanicus will be please. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, some fans are drawing parallels between Warhammer 40,000 lore and what AI experts in the real world are predicting will happen to us in just a handful of years. In Warhammer 40,000 history, the AI rebellion kicked off when humanity was at the height of its power and used AI without restraint to maintain its untouchable galactic empire. The Dark Age of Technology, which ran from around the 15th-25th millennium, was the zenith of mankind's scientific knowledge and technological power, a golden age of exploration and innovation in which we essentially became gods. The ‘Men of Iron’ — sentient humanoid machines created by humans during the Dark Age of Technology — rebelled. Details are vague, but it’s clear they were not a happy bunch at all. The Men of Iron believed themselves superior to the humans who had created them, because we relied on them to do pretty much everything for us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A cautionary tale, perhaps? In Warhammer 40,000 lore, humanity didn’t have to worry about AI in an, ‘oh god they’re going to kill us all' sense until the 23rd millenium. If AI experts are to be believed, it won’t take that long in the real world. 23 years, perhaps?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Warhammer 40,000 fans can rest assured that the stunning art that’s used to draw people into the setting will remain crafted by human hands. For now, anyway. Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree said company staff are barred from using AI to actually produce anything, but admitted a “few” senior managers are experimenting with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reporting the latest financial results, Rountree said AI was “a very broad topic and to be honest I’m not an expert on it,” then went on to lay down the company line: "We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our Warhammer Studio — hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Games Workshop.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <guid>1406086</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>It can seem a bit silly to recommend a way to tie your shoes, but some knots are just more secure than others. For decades I have favored two specific shoelace knots: Ian’s Fast Knot and Ian’s Secure Shoelace Knot. Ian’s Fast Knot is done so effortlessly as to look like a magic trick, and Ian’s Secure Shoelace Knot has never failed me.&nbsp;</p><p>But who is Ian? Ian Fieggen, who also goes by “Professor Shoelace,” is the guy who runs <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ian’s Shoelace Site</u></a>, the internet’s prime destination for learning how to tie your shoes. His website is simple, intentionally focusing on common vernacular over <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheAshleyBookOfKnots"><u>standardized knot terminology</u></a>, and has been operating as a discrete section of his personal site since 2003. Ian’s Shoelace Site does not need to change; it is perfectly functional the way it is, and people have been discovering his many knots and lacing techniques for decades.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSbeIb4riK0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Why a “Granny Knot” comes undone – Professor Shoelace"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>The Granny Knot/Granny Bow is probably why your shoes keep coming undone.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/secureknot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ian’s Secure Shoelace Knot</u></a> is a double slip knot, only marginally more complicated than the “<a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/standardknot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>bunny rabbit</u></a>” style kids tend to be taught. Though Ian’s Secure Shoelace Knot can also be tied incorrectly, it is far more secure than the <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/standardknot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>knot</u></a> many people tie under most circumstances, which tends to fall apart when <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/grannyknot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>tied incorrectly</u></a>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The steps for Ian's Secure Knot, as depicted on Ian's Shoelace Site. Credit: Ian Fieggen</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ian’s Secure Shoelace Knot is done by doing a standard left over right <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ian-starting-knot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>starting knot</u></a>, creating two loops (bunny ears), crossing the loops right over left so that one sits over the other, looping <em>both loops over each other </em>and pulling them through the “hole” in center so the loops exit in opposite directions, and neatly tightening the resulting knot. It’s a wonderful compromise between security, convenience, and ease of execution. It does not require a sloppy double knot, which can get easily snarled, and it’s easy to untie with a single pull. There is no perfect knot, but Ian’s Secure Shoelace Knot has yet to fail me after over a decade of use.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1RbaIo4VdbA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Ian's Secure Shoelace Knot tutorial – Professor Shoelace"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>This one....this one is the best.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>“I try not to over-sell the merits of this knot,” Ian Fieggen told me over email, “as people have become complacent about every product on earth being touted as ‘the best.’ I reckon that those who blindly follow what they are told end up believing everything and knowing nothing. I'm therefore most pleased when people discover for themselves that the Secure Knot lives up to my claims, especially when (as in your case) it follows a lengthy period of usage.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WgSwvDkJVxE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The “Ian Knot”, the world's fastest shoelace knot – Professor Shoelace"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>The Ian Knot is the flashy and fast one, but still secure if done well.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>There are, of course, other knots. I have seen other people on YouTube and Reddit recommend the <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/berluti-knot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Berluti Knot</u></a>. I have also seen many people who are fans of the <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknothistory.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Surgeon’s Knot</u></a>. Ian’s pride and joy, which he claims to have invented and <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknothistory.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>has a page documenting its history</u></a>, is <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ian’s Fast Shoelace Knot</u></a>, also simply known as <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ian’s Knot</u></a>, which is so rapid that it makes you do a double take. But what makes Ian’s site truly great is not that it documents a few knots, but is a cornucopia of methods for tying and lacing your shoes. Ian’s Shoelace Site is from a different time on the internet, when people simply made websites that they were passionate about.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>I cannot stress enough how comprehensive Ian's Shoelace Site can get. Credit: Ian Fieggen</span></figcaption></figure><p>The full breadth of Ian’s site is a marvel to behold given its simple subject material. Not only does he passionately cover every shoelace knot he knows, he also covers every factor of lacing: <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/untying.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>why knots get jammed</u></a>, <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/agletrepair.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>aglet repair</u></a>, <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/knotratings.php?ref=aftermath.site"><u>user knot ratings</u></a> and the<a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/lacing.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u> seemingly countless methods for lacing your shoes</u></a>. Being a subsection of a personal site, Ian has written extensively about other topics including an history of his father, <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/chris/index.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a computer programmer who passed away in 2022</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>People who know Ian’s Shoelace Site love it. But like all passion projects that seem eternal on the internet, even Ian’s site is vulnerable to the forces destroying the internet..</p><p>“Have you ever wondered,” Ian asked, “<em>why</em> websites like mine are disappearing from the Internet?”</p><p>He has his theories. The Shoelace Site is kept alive via fairly unobtrusive ads, but he says the rise of ad blockers has made that income precarious. He also claims that people copy the information on his site without attribution, both wholesale and to go viral. A quick search of YouTube and especially TikTok is rife with people doing Ian’s Fast Knot without either knowing or disclosing the source. “Around half the copycat videos on YouTube are tying it incorrectly as a granny knot, which comes loose.” Ian said. “This has given my knot the undeserved reputation of being faster at the expense of reliability!” To the extent that one can “own” a knot, Ian has been robbed.</p><p>Ian, more than many writers and publishers on the internet, sees with cold clarity the catastrophic effect of AI on the continued survival of an independent web. “Today, my website is constantly being harvested by AI bots,” he said. “That content is then reused, typically without giving credit, in what amounts to little more than wholesale computerised plagiarism.The search engines, which we previously tolerated showing snippets of our content because they brought people to our websites, are now showing AI generated versions ahead of those snippets. These can be sufficient for visitors to remain on the search website and never end up visiting. Generative AI already allows folks to ask for something –<a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/pentagramlacing.htm?ref=aftermath.site"><u> such as a diagram on how to lace shoes with stars</u></a> – and again, never find my website <em>filled</em> with diagrams on which that AI diagram was based.”</p><p>For Ian, the cumulative effect of all of these factors is a deep sadness, a sinking feeling of exhaustion and futility. What is the point of adding value to the internet if it is only going to rob you? Why do research, make diagrams, and develop new knots?</p><p>“Why keep feeding the hungry beast that the internet has become?” Ian asked.</p><p>Ian says his site is OK for the foreseeable future, kept alive via the occasional donation, ad revenue for people who don’t use blockers, affiliate links, and kind words from strangers. But, like the site you are reading, content that you believe to be immutable and immortal on the internet is constantly in peril. These places only exist when the people investing their time and energy know that they are appreciated, credited, and supported. The whims of companies like Google seek to alter the deal that has kept much of the internet alive, threatening its basic foundations. This is true for blogs, for journalism and for the <a href="https://aftermath.site/best-active-forums-internet-today/"><u>forum culture</u></a> that the internet is built on. It even seeks to threaten and consume something as simple and necessary as tying your shoelaces.</p>

			<p>After several of the titles joining the <strong>PS Plus Extra</strong> and <strong>Premium</strong> game catalogues <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-premium-on-connait-les-titres-majeurs-de-janvier-2026-60850">leaked yesterday evening</a>, <strong>PlayStation</strong> has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/14/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-january-resident-evil-village-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-expeditions-a-mudrunner-game-and-more/">officially confirmed</a> all of the games that PS Plus Extra and Premium tier subscribers will be getting access to for January 2026, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">Resident Evil Village</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, </strong>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/darkest-dungeon-ii-full-release-owners-of-original-discount/"><strong>Darkest Dungeon</strong> <strong>II</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Once again, players paying top-dollar for the Premium subscription only get one game added to the Classics Catalog, which seems to continue a trend of Premium subscribers seemingly getting the short end of the stick. </p>



<p>That's not to say anything against Ridge Racer, more to say that while yes, Premium subscribers are also paying for the other games joining the Extra and Essential tiers each month, the Classics Catalog is one of the only key differences between Premium and the other tiers. Some months, no games enter the Classics Catalog. It simply has to leave those players wondering what they're paying for, if they can't expect the library of Classic games to actually grow at a reasonable rate.</p>



<p>Regardless, here is the full list of games coming to PS Plus Extra and Premium for January 2026, all of which will be available starting <strong>January 20, 2026</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Resident Evil Village (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead (PS5)</li>



<li>Darkest Dungeon II (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>The Exit 8 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Art of Rally (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>A Little to the Left (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Ridge Racer (PS5, PS4) - <strong>Premium-tier subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier this month, PS Plus Essential subscribers (and every other tier of PS Plus subscribers) got to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-january-2026-need-for-speed-unbound-epic-mickey-core-keeper/">add <strong>Need for Speed Unbound</strong>, <strong>Epic Mickey Rebrushed,</strong> and <strong>Core Keeper</strong> to their lineup</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/timeline-2025-refresh-and-expansion-review-timely-family-fun</link>
            <guid>1406056</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Which came first: the first cave painting or the first stone carved by humans? Did the start of the construction of the Great Wall of China happen before or after the invention of the crossbow? These are the questions you and your family will have to suss out over a game of <em>Timeline</em>, a brilliantly simple but wonderfully thought-provoking family game from <a href="https://www.dobblegame.com/en/games/#category-timeline" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Zygomatic</a>. Publisher Asmodee USA sent along a copy of the new 2025 refresh of the game, as well as the new expansion <em>Games &amp; Leisure</em>, to check out - so let's see if it's right for your family and friends.</p><h2>What Is <em>Timeline</em>?</h2><p><em>Timeline</em> is a simple family game for 2 - 6 players (though in all reality, and certainly with additional expansions to the game, you could play this with a much larger group of gamers) the is equal parts guessing game and history lesson! The core mechanic is incredibly simple: you create a growing timeline of events, and need to decide when cards in your hand happen on the timeline as it grows!</p><p>With evocative illustrations and mini-cards keeping this game portable and compact (and at a very reasonable $12.99 USD MSRP), I've found it to be one of the best "throw it in the bag" games to break out either before in between or after a more serious gaming session. It's also an absolute no-brainer for gaming with family and friends who aren't used to heavier games, along with younger kids in the fam!</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/timeline-core-box.jpeg?itok=4ANbafpz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="800" height="800">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/timeline-core-box.jpeg?itok=vqp57Rqk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="800" height="800">
                  

  </picture><h2>How Do You Play <em>Timeline</em>?</h2><p>As mentioned above, the gameplay loop of <em>Timeline </em>is wonderfully simple, but super-satisfying. The game consists of a deck of mini-cards. On one side is the name of an event, like "The Start of the Black Death" with an illustration depicting the event. On the back is the same name and illustration, but with the date that it occurred.</p><p>Players start the game with four cards in front of them, date-side down. You don't get to peek at when your events happened - that's the whole point of the game! One event from the deck is placed date-side up on the board, and that's the start of the timeline.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/timeline-cards.jpeg?itok=9eSVX1xH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="800" height="800">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/timeline-cards.jpeg?itok=8QQHeVFZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="800" height="800">
                  

  </picture><p>Now it's up to you to choose one of your cards, and decide where it landed on the timeline. This is easier in the beginning of the game, when the timeline isn't that crowded, but as the game progresses you'll find it trickier and trickier to find the right spot!</p><h2>What Does The <em>Timeline </em>2025 Refresh Bring To The Game?</h2><p>As far as I can tell, and it's a bit tricky to determine based on internet searching alone, this refresh of the game includes all-new, gorgeous illustrations for each of the cards, but updates the packaging to a small box (it originally came in a box, then a metal tin, and now it's back - thankfully - to its small-box format) and includes 96 cards.</p><p>I really like the simple, clean illustration-style on display with these new cards, and think the design feels very modern and simple without losing any personality.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/timeline-games-and-leisure.jpeg?itok=1p_zA5Wf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1500" height="1500">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/timeline-games-and-leisure.jpeg?itok=atQRzxtN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="1200">
                  

  </picture><h2>What Is <em>Timeline: Games &amp; Leisure</em>?</h2><p>Also included in this shipment for us to review is the all-new <em>Timeline: Games &amp; Leisure</em>, which serves as a standalone expansion to the game focusing on - as the title suggest - games and leisure activities. When was the serial production of the first mountain bike? When was the Kayak invented? What about six-sided dice?</p><p>It's a simple and fun spin on the classic game, but it truly is just more cards. There are no tweaks or adjustments to the rules, but why mess with a good thing? And while you don't need the original <em>Timeline</em> reviewed above to play, you <em>can</em> combine both into a more challenging experience.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/timeline-games-and-leisure-cards.jpeg?itok=jDxU_MjI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="800" height="800">

  </picture><h2><em>Timeline</em> Review - Final Thoughts</h2><p><em>Timeline </em>is, without a doubt, one of my favorite "grab-and-go" games. You can bring it just about anywhere, and get just about anyone into the action. You do <em>not</em> have to be a tabletop gamer to immediately understand how to play this game, making it perfect for Elementary School students and befuddled grandparents alike.</p><p>On the flip side, there's not a lot of tactics or strategy here (the only strategy I follow is: save your obvious ones (like the discovery of fire by man, for the end of the game when the timeline's more complicated).&nbsp;</p><p>So if you're looking for something a little meatier, look elsewhere. And player interaction is basically zero, unless you count clogging up the timeline and making it harder for your opponents to guess where their events happen as interaction. But all in all, I cannot recommend <em>Timeline</em> and <em>Timeline: Games &amp; Leisure</em> enough to anyone looking for some educational, family-friendly fun!</p><hr><p><em>The copies of </em>Timeline <em>and </em>Timeline: Games &amp; Leisure<em> used in the creation of this review were provided to us by Asmodee USA.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>I’m currently exploring, crafting and building my way through&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-like <em>Hytale</em> to find out what this long-delayed blocky survival sim does to differentiate itself from its obvious inspiration. But in the meantime, let’s take a look at what’s already happened in the game’s first 24 hours since releasing into early access.</p> <p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>very nearly didn’t happen. The cuboid sandbox game has been in production since 2015 from Hypixel Studios, with financial support from Riot Games for the first few years until the massive company bought Hypixel outright in 2020. However, big twist: in June 2025 Riot cancelled the whole project, leaving its future in serious doubt. But then another twist: in November of last year, the game’s original founder Simon Collins-Laflamme bought the entire IP back from Riot <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-minecraft-hypixel-revived-cancel-shutdown-2000645248">and revived development</a>. Just two months later the game is out in early access, making Riot’s decision all the more peculiar.</p>

 <p>It’s not nearly finished, it’s fair to say. If <a href="https://hytale.com/">you buy the game now</a> you’ll find its central hub area is mostly various buildings with “Under Construction” signs on them, and the game’s “Adventure” mode is yet to be added alongside Survival and Creative. However, you’ll also find a very familiar style of game if you’ve ever played <em>Minecraft</em>, but with much higher-fidelity graphics, a far more complex array of crafting tables, and the slightest touch of creature collecting. So how’s it going so far?</p>

 <p>Well, pretty well! In the first 24 hours&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> became <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/hytale-surges-to-the-most-watched-game-on-twitch-attracting-over-420-000-viewers-with-its-long-awaited-launch/">the most watched game on Twitch</a>, with 420,000 viewers across many, many streams. And perhaps more significantly, Collins-Laflamme took to X just before launch to say pre-orders have been so successful that the game has already secured a further two years of development costs.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pleased to announce that we have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases. Combined with my personal commitment of ten years, we are looking very strong for the future ❤️</p> <p>Thank you all for the support.</p> <p>Hytale is saved.<br>We are almost home.</p> <p>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Yay Patch Notes!</h2> <p>The game <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hotfixes-13-january-2026">has already received its first hotfix</a>, aimed at fixing crashes caused by eyebrows, squelching a bug that stopped Norwegian people from launching it, and preventing buckets from breaking the game. Of course, this being early access, Hypixel are keen to communicate that the game is still going to be packed with issues and bugs. In <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here">a blog post celebrating the pre-release of the game</a>, the team asks people to keep in mind the following:</p>

 <ul> <li>Early Access – many features are still missing, and bugs are expected</li> <li>It’s only been two months since we reacquired <em>Hytale</em> – and that’s how long we’ve had to prepare the game and rebuild the team from the ground up</li> <li>Demand has exceeded our expectations, which means launch week will be bumpy, but we’ll get everyone in</li> </ul> <p>The game, which is currently only available for PC but plans to make its way to PS5 and Xbox, does already allow modding and as such, people are already getting creative. Perhaps the most stand-out example would be <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/one-modder-has-already-got-doom-running-inside-the-voxel-sandbox-hytale-and-its-not-even-out-yet-it-plays-a-bit-like-a-broken-keyboard/">someone getting&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> running in the game</a> before it even released. As <em>PC Gamer</em> spotted, it’s achieved by importing a Java version of id’s shooter, then having it rendered via color-changing blocks within <em>Hytale</em>. Or witchcraft.</p>

 <h2>Exploration Motivation</h2> <p>The Exploration mode is the “proper” way to play the game just now, where the procedurally generated collection of biomes contains really elaborate structures to discover, and also all the core ingredients for the <em>Minecraft</em> survivalist. So you can build homes (I’ve made a lovely log cabin!), grow crops, craft ever-more useful tools, and do all this solo or with chums. Digging down proves similarly elaborate, with big underground structures to explore, and of course mobs to battle. There are also the vestigial beginnings of the game’s story, with a hub area you can teleport to once you find the Forgotten Temple, speak to a couple of NPCs, and begin a task to identify as many species of creatures as you can in order to unlock new crafts.</p>

 <p>The forthcoming Adventure mode appears to promise a lot more RPG-like elements that will hopefully better distinguish the game from its inspirations, but in the meantime the focus is really on venturing far from where you spawn and discovering its much more detailed landscapes and the mobs within.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-asus-tuf-gaming-desktop-pc-nvidia-gpu-512gb-ssd-is-so-cheap-youll-want-to-buy-it-instantly-2000659757</link>

              <p>Yes, you can game on most standard PCs out there, but these options aren’t designed to provide you with an immersive gaming experience that brings your favorite titles to life. If you’re looking to play better in 2026, a dedicated gaming PC is a must-have.</p>
<p>Like all nice things, the best gaming PCs on the market can cost a pretty penny, but that’s not the case today. Amazon just dropped the 2025 ASUS TUF T500 PC by 11% which <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6757/">brings its $900 price to $800 – an impressive $100 discount</a>. There are no complicated coupon codes to enter or long checkout steps to worry about, either. Just add the PC to your cart, and the discount applies automatically.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6757/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See offer</a></p>

<h2>Premium Look, Incredible Performance</h2>
<p>The PC flaunts a stunning, mecha-inspired design with bold lines, yellow accents, and a transparent side panel. It gives off a rugged, anime-inspired look that’s instantly going to catch the attention of anyone and is sure to turn heads. The clear side panel offers a stunning view of your rig with RGB lighting. The lights are customizable, so you can choose the color you want. Maybe go for yellow for a premium feel, or something a bit more vibrant if you want your PC to make a statement.</p>
<p>It runs on an Intel Core i5-13420H CPU that offers a great balance of performance and price. Paired with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU, it can run most modern games smoothly, and even lets you work on resource-intensive creative projects with ease. There’s a modest 16GB RAM that keeps things snappy as you push through tasks. We’re talking casual gaming with friends while streaming, and juggling demanding tasks like video editing and 3D design without slowing down.</p>



<p>The 512GB PCIe Gen 4 SSD storage makes it easy to keep all your favorite gaming titles, plus other media content and projects close, in a single place. SSDs are also known to be much faster than their traditional counterparts in terms of performance. What does this mean for you? Speedy file transfers and much quicker application launches throughout the day. Despite all this performance, the PC stays cool as it works. That’s thanks to its custom copper heatpipes and a 90mm fan, both of which come together to offer optimized airflow. This keeps the temperatures in check and also prevents noisy operation, even when things get a bit intense.</p>



<p>Exceptional durability comes from the PC’s MIL-STD-810H certification against shock, vibration, heat, and altitude. Basically, it’s going to support your gaming adventures and creative projects for years to come. Speaking of long-term use, you’ll also appreciate the tool-less side panels and the spacious interior, which make it easy to upgrade and maintain your system over time. It’s built to grow with you as your needs change.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, if you’ve been on the lookout for a reliable, muscular gaming PC that can handle pressure well, the ASUS TUF T500 is an excellent option to consider. It’s now down to $800, after Amazon generously took $100 off its usual price. We highly recommend grabbing it as soon as you can, as the price can shoot back up at any moment now.</p>

A new demo is available now. <span id="more-1019045"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via No More Robots:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>From the desk of VValak Lizardtongue, Grand Shepherd of the <a title="Games > Tyr" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tyr">Tyr</a>ythian Empire:</p><p>Well this is just complete and utter bullshit.</p><p>Those idiotic, moronic Terranoids think they can just roll in here and take over my beautiful Tyrythian kingdom? The kingdom that I built from the ground up with my bare hands, and only sort of inherited from my dear, sweet, extremely dead father?</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Did I mention that this is bullshit?</p><p>It’s fine though, because what they don’t realize is that I am going to make them very, very dead. Along with my trusty sidekick and childhood nursing bot Milky—please do not ask me questions about that—I will whiz over to Earth, turn it into a stinking pile of rubble, and be back home in time for a warm glass of milk before bed.</p><p><em>Earth Must Die</em> is the story of my glorious rise to power (off the back of my adored father’s passing), my subsequent accidental surrender to the Terranoids, and my infamous revenge against Earth and everything it stands for.</p><p>Apparently the story is retold in the form of one of those old point and click <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,813 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure games</a> that people gave a shit about in the 1990s, I wanna say? But in 2025. Doesn’t sound like a good idea to me, but what do I know—I’m just a benevolent, terrifying leader of worlds who everyone loves and also super respects.</p><p>I’m also not sure what the phrase “British comedy royalty” is supposed to mean, but I guess they got a bunch of “funny” fuckwits to dub over my glorious voyage to feed the Terranoids their own arseholes?

Anyway, apparently my magnificent story is told over a series of many hours, and you click a bunch and things happen and really I don’t care about any of this, I’m just here for the glory.</p><p>You’ll be able to experience my unbelievably cool story through something called “Steam,” which is apparently how you access experiences like this back in 2025.

                <p>Hytale is finally out now, after 10 years of development. If you're looking for the game on Steam, you won't find it there because developer Hypixel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/download-the-hytale-launcher-now-as-hypixel-estimates-over-1-million-players-at-launch/1100-6537319/" data-ref-id="1100-6537319">launched the game exclusively through its own app</a>. But why is Hytale not on Steam, and could it ever be released there? Here's what we know.</p><h2><strong>Why not Steam?</strong></h2><p>Executive producer Patrick Derbic said in a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FAQ</a> that Hypixel opted to release Hytale through its own launcher at first to allow the team to communicate more closely with its own fans and community. Derbic said bringing the game to Steam at launch might have brought a "flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game's direction."</p><p>This isn't to say that Hypixel wants to bury its head in the sand and avoid criticism, however. The studio said it does not shy away from "honest, negative criticism," going on to say the developer itself has been "very critical" of the game it's making. Releasing on Hytale's own dedicated launcher was a purposeful decision the studio made to help ensure "the first steps of our journey to be influenced by informed players rather than large-scale first impressions from those unfamiliar with the game's development background."</p><h2><strong>Hytale could come to Steam later</strong></h2><p>Derbic went on to say that Steam is a "great platform and marketing tool," but Hypixel "might never need" to put Hytale on it. Or it might. The decision hasn't been made yet.</p><p>"This doesn't mean Hytale will never be on Steam; right now, we don't see the need for it, as we want to keep our launch closer to our community," Derbic explained.</p><p>The developer added that Steam does not currently support all of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-hytale-mods/2900-7397/" data-ref-id="2900-7397">Hytale's modding features</a>, adding that the developer aims to discuss this with Valve "to see what's possible."</p><p>Hytale is also not available on console, but in that case, Hypixel confirmed it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hytale-console-version-planned-but-developers-want-to-focus-on-making-a-good-game-first/1100-6537393/" data-ref-id="1100-6537393">will bring the game to console at some point in the future.</a></p><h2><strong>Steam is powerful</strong></h2><p>Steam is among the largest, most dominant, and ubiquitous online stores for digital PC games in the world, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-has-already-set-a-new-concurrent-player-record-clearing-42-million/1100-6537339/" data-ref-id="1100-6537339">millions upon millions of users logging in every day.</a> It's a powerful storefront for games big and small. Valve, which owns and operates Steam, takes a cut of game sales, and in bypassing Steam, Hypixel won't have to pay those fees (though it may have other platform fees and costs to pay).</p><p>Steam has so many catalog games and new releases that discoverability has been cited as an issue for some, but it's also a platform where smaller games can break through and find a massive audience.</p><p>Minecraft, the game that inspired Hytale, is also not available on Steam, while Riot's League of Legends has its own dedicated launcher as well. Companies like EA and Ubisoft pulled games from Steam, citing business reasons, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-more-ea-games-coming-t/1100-6470951/" data-ref-id="1100-6470951">relenting</a> and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-reverses-its-steam-policy-will-launch-new-games-there-on-day-one/1100-6526711/" data-ref-id="1100-6526711"> returning.</a></p><p>Rivals to Steam like the DRM-free GOG and Fortnite developer Epic's Epic Game Store have emerged, but none have come close to matching the size, scale, and importance of Steam.</p>
