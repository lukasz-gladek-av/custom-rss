Here's The Chance To Make Your Voice Heard 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/af10206becfb1/what-are-the-100-best-nintendo-games-heres-the-chance-to-make-your-voice-heard-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has been in this business for a <em>long</em> time, so when you're attempting to decide on what the 100 best games released on its consoles and handhelds are, it's little wonder that it's <em>quite</em> the challenge.</p>
<p>However, we've teamed up with our friends over at <a href="https://www.ign.com/">IGN</a> to do just that – and we're in the process of concocting a list of the best games ever released on Nintendo's systems.</p>
<p>You may wonder how this list differs from the one <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/top-100-best-nintendo-games-of-all-time">already on this site</a>, but the remit here is somewhat different; this collaborative ranking will include third-party games that are either Nintendo hardware exclusives or are synonymous with Nintendo consoles.</p>
<p>"IGN and Nintendo Life have come together to build the definitive list of The 100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-100-best-nintendo-games-ever-faceoff">says IGN's Simon Cardy</a>. "We'll be rolling that ranking out from Monday, November 10 to Friday, November 14, revealing 20 picks a day until one game is crowned Number One."</p>
<p>Be sure to check out IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/nintendo-voice-chat">Nintendo Voice Chat</a> for a rundown of the selected games. Who knows? You might even spot a familiar face...</p>
<p>Before the final list is published, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-100-best-nintendo-games-ever-faceoff">IGN is running a face-off campaign</a> that allows you to cast your votes and shape a separate, reader-curated list.</p>
<p>Ahead of the final list going live, why don't you make your voice heard by heading over to IGN and helping to determine the running order for this in a user-generated ranking – you might help get your favourite game to the top of the tree!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Talk to any <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review-in-progress-difficulty-1851782700"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> fan lately and you’ll find a tarnished husk eager for a reason to jump back into their favorite obsession of 2025. Even after spending hundreds of hours toiling across the same map and fighting the same bosses we’re hungry for more, especially after the game’s new <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hard-mode-deep-night-ranked-2000620376">Deep of Night ranked mode</a> ended up being a dud. Well, we apparently only have to wait a little longer. FromSoftware’s parent company has confirmed the game’s first official paid DLC will arrive by April 2026.</p> <p>That morsel of good news came in Kadokawa Corporation’s <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/190133/00.pdf">latest financial earnings report</a>. In it, the company said the <em>Elden Ring</em> spin-off exceeded sales expectations but fell off steeply in the second quarter. It’s hopeful an expansion can revive the game’s momentum the same way <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> did with the original game.</p>

 <p>“FromSoftware is currently developing <em>Elden Ring Nightreign DLC</em> (planned for release in FY2025), <em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition</em> (planned for release in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2), and <em>The Duskbloods</em> (planned for release in 2026),” Kadokawa Corporation confirmed. Is FromSoftware working on anything else for next year? <a href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-3-remaster-armored-core-6-fromsoftware-1851786550">Previous rumors</a> suggested it’s next game isn’t as far away as some fans might think, with hints that it could be a new <em>Armored Core</em> or a remaster for <em>Dark Souls III</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Nightreign</em> needs a new map</h2> <p>But for <em>Nightreign</em> sickos like myself, the DLC will be more than enough to keep us occupied, at least if it’s on par with the studio’s previous expansions. What does that wishlist include? A new map, for one. I’ve grown quite <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-items-wending-grace-flask-1851782963">fond of Limveld</a> during my time there, but it represents only a small, randomized portion of the original game’s big open world. There are so many other parts that could be adapted into similarly sized, procedurally generated maps.</p>

 <p><em>Nightreign</em> is, first and foremost, a game about logistics and cost-benefit analysis. Much of that decision making has become streamlined and rote as players have become experts in all of the tradeoffs and probabilities underlying the current map. A new one, in addition to a fresh visual palette and new enemies and points of interest to draw upon, would almost feel like a sequel.</p>

 <p>Fans have also been begging for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-renant-summon-necromancy-faith-1851784379">more character classes</a> to try. There are currently eight in the game and most players have settled in on their favorites. Two new classes, especially ones that favor different weapons and abilities than the existing ones, would be another draw. New bosses also seem like a must for any DLC. FromSoftware has its entire Soulsborne back catalog to draw from, and the time it takes not just to learn new encounters but master them is no small investment.</p> <p>That’s especially the <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereign-libra-fissure-1851786568">case for the Nightlords</a> that cap off each run. The game currently has eight. Add four more and their Everdark variants and we’ll essentially have <em>Nightreign 2</em>. But I’ll settle for anything at this point. I just want a reason to send out party invites, round up the crew, and get our asses kicked like it’s launch all over again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has updated the main GTA 6 website to reflect the game’s most recent delay, and it’s sticking with its console-only launch for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 was delayed from May to November 2026, with Rockstar saying the extra half year “will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some had wondered if this latest delay — its second since it was officially revealed in December 2023 — would cause Rockstar Games to revise its launch plans, which so far include PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only. But, as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1986784619530801294" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@videotechuk_</a>, now Rockstar has updated the official GTA 6 website to mention the November 19 release date, it lists the consoles as the only launch platforms.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/07/screenshot-2025-11-07-131810-1762522553789.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 6 is still set for console only at launch.

They already faced the prospect of having to wait longer for GTA 6 — back when GTA 6 was planned for release in the fall of this year, some thought the game would come out on PC in 2026. That now looks impossible, and some PC gamers are worried they won’t get to play the game until 2028. Late 2027 feels like a safe bet, but this is Rockstar. It’s hard to predict what the company will do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN last night, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-is-highly-confident-on-new-gta-6-release-date-but-says-when-games-are-released-too-early-bad-things-happen">Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he was "highly confident" that this is the last time GTA 6 will be delayed</a>. “We wanted to give Rockstar the appropriate amount of time to polish the title and make sure it can be the very best it can be," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Previously, GTA 6 was announced for a fall 2025 release, which Zelnick was confident in at the time. The game was later delayed to May of 2026, with Take-Two and Rockstar similarly citing a need for polish. Zelnick sounded confident then, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for launch platforms, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response">last year Zelnick was asked if the lack of a PC version of GTA 6 was set in stone</a>. Here’s Zelnick’s response in full:</p><blockquote>Well, the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement, I guess that could happen too. It doesn’t seem to me that either would be set in stone.</blockquote><blockquote>But Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before, and they will make more announcements in due time. I do believe that the right strategy for our business is to be where the consumer is, and historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That was Zelnick dancing around the inevitable PC version of GTA 6, but he did point to Rockstar’s release strategy for its previous games. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/place-your-bets-will-gta-6-release-on-pc-on-the-same-day-it-does-on-consoles/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fans of Rockstar games</u></a> have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude, only to have those hopes dashed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question is how long PC gamers will have to wait for the biggest entertainment launch of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6 in the meantime, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/publisher-jokes-concern-and-a-lot-of-memes-the-internet-reacts-to-the-gta-6-delay">how the internet reacted to the GTA 6 delay</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history">why it’s no surprise it was delayed in the first place</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rockstar Games website</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">GTA 6 is delayed again</a>, this time from May to November 2026. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history">Perhaps we should have seen it coming</a>. After all, aren’t all Rockstar games delayed multiple times before they eventually come out and break sales records?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of coverage on the delay already, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-is-highly-confident-on-new-gta-6-release-date-but-says-when-games-are-released-too-early-bad-things-happen">comments from Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick</a>, who told IGN in an interview he was “highly confident” in the new release date (I’m sure he’s said that before?). And, if you need a reminder, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2">a whopping 89 details from GTA 6 Trailer 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how has the internet reacted to the GTA 6 delay? Fans are, as you’d expect, in tatters. And spare a thought for PC gamers, who now face the prospect of having to wait to play GTA 6 in 2027 at the earliest. But video game publishers — some, publicly at least — are having fun with it, while some are expressing concern for any game that might have earmarked a fall 2026 release window. And then there are the memes. Lots of memes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt, which took the opportunity to remind everyone that it once promised no more delays to Cyberpunk 2077, and look how that turned out when its sci-fi action RPG came out in December 2020. What CDPR is saying here is trust in Rockstar to deliver — it’s better to delay the game and ensure it’s great than launch it when it isn’t ready.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/SqC2ZYRK6s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/SqC2ZYRK6s</a> <a href="https://t.co/l5o58PULml" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/l5o58PULml</a></p>— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1986547061886427406?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Hotline Miami and Cult of the Lamb publisher Devolver Digital, meanwhile, continued the bit by continuing to promise (threat?) to release a game on the same day GTA 6 comes out. Now it’s moved whatever game it had in mind to GTA 6’s new release date: November 19, 2026. Devolver won’t — can’t at this point — stop. It even cheekily asked Rockstar if it needed help getting GTA 6 out the door, tweeting: "DO YOU NEED A PUBLISHER TO GET THIS THING BACK ON TRACK? DMs are open. Our work on @BALLxPIT speaks for itself." Those scamps!</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Devolver Digital (@devolverdigital) <a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1986545399910289732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking more seriously, Christofer Sundberg, founder of Liquid Swords and former boss of Just Cause developer Avalanche, <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1986705793048031697" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called the delay</a> “a gravitational shift.” He continued: “When giants move, the ground shakes. That’s not competition. That’s opportunity.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a comment about how publishers will be left scrambling to adjust their own release dates in the wake of GTA 6 moving from May to November. Some may be able to hit May or thereabouts now GTA 6 has moved out of that window. Others already locked into fall 2026 may now be set for crisis talks. Will next year’s Call of Duty be okay, for example? COD usually launches in November, so we're potentially set for a GTA 6 vs Call of Duty showdown in 2026. I know what my money's on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the delay may even impact games set to launch in 2027. John “Bucky” Buckley, Communications Director and Publishing Manager at Palworld developer Pocketpair, <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1986583034326622227" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X / Twitter</a> to say "expect to see many games (especially AAA ones) swerve to avoid the 2027 awards season," now GTA 6 is set for a November 19 launch, which puts Rockstar's game outside the nominaton window for most game awards in 2026.

These battles may be more challenging than in other modes and have special gameplay experiences unique to this mode, so we definitely encourage you to give it a try.</li><li><strong>Hero’s Diary</strong> – Unlocked after clearing Team Mission. In this mode, you can watch never-before-seen character moments with each other with voice acting that depict the unknown daily lives of the U.A.

From training with Deku and Bakugo to practice exercises featuring unexpected combinations like Mineta, Ashido, and Koda, there are various episodes where you might discover new sides to your favorite characters. By experiencing what may be surprising sides to the characters, we hope you will deepen your own relationship with Class 1-A students, the growth fostered by the Hero Academy, and the world of <em>My Hero Academia</em>.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The trailer also offers a deeper dive into the game’s battle system.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>The next BioShock game has been in development for the better part of a decade, but 2K Games parent company Take-Two Interactive has confirmed that there are no plans currently to cancel it. In a new interview, CEO Strauss Zelnick addressed the lengthy development cycle, promising that BioShock will eventually be released.</p><p>"It's going to come out. That I can say hand on heart, without question," Zelnick said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. The CEO added that with longer development cycles for AAA games, it had become more challenging to build a game that can stand out from the pack as part of its quality-over-quantity mindset. "The strategy of this company has always been to make the best entertainment, not necessarily the most entertainment. Of course, sometimes we've fallen short, but frankly, a precious few times," Zelnick boasted, adding that Take-Two is aiming to release "exceptional" games.</p><p>Zelnick's comments come in the wake of a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg report about BioShock 4 undergoing a partial overhaul</a> to improve on key areas. Meanwhile, Take-Two president Karl Slatoff also addressed the status of BioShock during this week's earnings call and spoke about changes at Cloud Imperium following layoffs at the studio. This led to the departure of studio head Kelley Gilmore, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-studio-laying-off-devs-as-diablo-boss-takes-over/1100-6534080/" data-ref-id="1100-6534080">with former Diablo boss Rod Fergusson taking ove</a>r.</p><p>"We've made some changes in the organization," Slatoff said (via <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839738-take-two-interactive-software-inc-ttwo-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript" rel="nofollow ">Seeking Alpha</a>). "We're shifting some things around. But right now, we feel that the game is on a great track for us to deliver something that's going to exceed consumers' expectations. So not much more to update other than that and the fact that the next BioShock is going to take the franchise to the next level, which is always our ambition with all of our franchises."</p><p>In other news from Take-Two's earnings call, the company confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/">GTA 6 had been delayed to November 2026</a>, and despite being the third-highest-selling game of the year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-came-in-below-take-twos-sales-expectations/1100-6536020/">Borderlands 4 has fallen short of sales expectations</a>.</p>

                <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is climbing up the sales charts, surpassing Nintendo's best-selling Mario Kart game ever. As part of Take-Two's latest earnings report, the company disclosed that the 2018 open-world Western sold another 2 million copies in the past three months to climb to 79 million overall.</p><p>In reaching that mark, Red Dead Redemption 2 has surpassed 2014's Mario Kart 8 on the list for all-time game sales. Mario Kart 8 has sold 78.02 million units--this includes 69.56 million units sold for Switch with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and 8.46 million copies of Mario Kart 8 for Wii U.</p><p>Of note, however, is that the Mario Kart 8 sales figure is inflated in a way that can't be said for Red Dead Redemption 2, as the Mario Kart 8 sales numbers include pack-in sales. Given that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the centerpiece of Nintendo's annual Black Friday and holiday bundles, copies of the game sold in bundles are surely numerous.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now the No. 5 best-selling game of all time, only beaten by Tetris (520 million), Minecraft (300 million), GTA 5 (220 million), and Wii Sports (82.9 million).</p><p>Given the immense success of Red Dead Redemption 2, many are expecting Rockstar to make a third game in the series.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, and it’s proved to me that most people just want to get along. Everyone is helping you out, almost no one is shooting at you who isn’t a robot, and you can party up with other players and just have a lovely time (while you hide and skulk from increasingly difficult robots). Its presentation is also pitch-perfect, and it’s so far been something of a revelation. Unfortunately, this now means I’m no longer playing Overwatch, but I have snuck in some Lumines: Arise, Plants Vs Zombies and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which has given me plenty of variation.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has just started on Ghost of Yotei. It’s early days mind you, as he tells us, “I’m only an hour in, so it’s still super fresh, but I’m enjoying it so far!” But for <strong>Aran</strong> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/football-manager-26-review/">Football Manager 26</a>? The verdict is well and truly in, as he says it “needs lots of improvements,” There was also some Umami for review.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> is somewhat lost with what to play right now. He tells us, “I am wandering lost between games, unable to find anything I really want to sink my teeth in while teetering on the edge of buying Final Fantasy XVI, FF7 Remake 2: The Second Coming Of Shoulder Shimmying, Mordor Mark 2: This Time It’s Even More Morally Grey, and a few roguelikes. Also, I’m playing Arc Raiders, which is fun.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> is another who’s on the Arc Raiders train. He says, “I love the music and setting and it’s genuinely a new experience in that most people aren’t out to kill you, in fact I’ve never been shot by a player. Everyone seems to be working together and helping each other out which is probably not what the devs wanted, but given how the real world is, it’s really quite comforting.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> finished PowerWash Simulator and started Tormented Souls 2 but he’s been away at a family wedding and so that’s slowed him down from his usual tear, opting instead for the new Garth Merenghi book. Meanwhile, Ade got a bit bored of Ninja Gaiden 4. He says, “It was finally getting to play as Ryu, only to be stuck going through all the same levels and fighting the same bosses that I’d already just beaten whilst playing as generic emo Ninja guy that polished me off. Felt like a very cheap way of padding out the game’s length. Overall, a bit disappointed with Ninja Gaiden 4, especially considering the pedigree of the developers.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the team, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Sweet Surrender for review, as well as Deep Rock Galactic Survivor and Fights in Tight Spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been squealing at baby dinosaurs in Jurassic World Evolution 3 and shrieking at legs jumping out at her from under tables in the Silent Hill 2 Remake. She says, “It’s quite the combination, but when I’m exhausted trying to get 5 stars by getting all of my dinosaurs up to 100% comfort (why are the Ankylosaurus so damn picky?!) I switch over. Then when I’m tired of constantly walking around yet another grimy looking apartment block I switch back!”</p>

<p>Next up, <strong>Jim</strong> is making slow but steady progress with Ghost of Yotei. He tells us, “Instead of blitzing the main story missions, I’m finding too many distractions! The fact that they don’t feel obtrusive or repetitive is always the true sign of a good open world game. I’ll definitely be going for the platinum trophy.” He continues, “I also played more Battlefield 6 which is easily the most fun I’ve had with the series since Bad Company 2. Initially I started as a Support main though I’ve since warmed towards the Engineer, having racked up quite the kill count with my cheeky anti-tank mines.”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tef’s</strong> had a few matches in Battlefield 6, though it’s much more casual time filler than it was around launch for him. He’s also had another hands on session with Kirby Air Riders, ahead of this weekend’s online tests, and you’ll see his thoughts on this rather soon!</p>
<p>Now then, what about you? Played anything good?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Chinese developer miHoYo, the studio behind the popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/genshin-impact-gacha-highjacked/">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/zenless-zone-zero-the-perfect-gacha-game-for-those-who-dont-like-gachas/">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, is working on a new game that will be much different from anything it has released so far.</p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">As spotted on the&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mihoyo-is-working-on-new-open-world-game-mmo-pvp-ue5-ai.1346665/" target="_blank">ResetERA forums</a>, the developer is currently working on a fantasy open-world MMO featuring realistic graphics, PvP, an AI-stimulated ecological system, large-scale boss fights, and advanced AI-powered NPCs.</span> These new features will mark a significant shift in gameplay terms, and a considerable step forward from the games the developer is currently supporting.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The teaser shared by miHoYo as part of a recruitment effort for their Unreal Engine 5-powered new game</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides sharing the first information on the yet to be named game, miHoYo released a video providing a very early look at the visual style the studio is aiming for has also been released, and it looks more technically advanced than anything it has done to date. Hopefully, the developer will also be able to address the known performance issues that plague games powered by the engine to deliver an experience that can be on par with its previous games.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The upcoming project from miHoYo, alongside other open-world games such as Where Winds Meet, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ps5-pc-release-date/">launching globally on November 14</a>, seems to signal a radical change for free-to-play open world games, which are doing away with colorful and stylized visuals to offer experiences that are edging ever closer to the PC and console premium AAA experiences. As such, it will be fascinating to see how players will react to these experiences, and if the realistic visuals and advanced AI-powered features will make these games as big a hit as Genshin Impact.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-ea-fc-open-world-gameplay-has-leaked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-ea-fc-open-world-gameplay-has-leaked.1346821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you didn’t know, EA announced a while back that it was working on an open-world addition to the EA FC franchise. Recently, a new FC playtest has been underway, and it’s been revealed that it’s indeed for the open-world content. Gameplay footage has leaked and been shared already.</p>



<p>All publicity is good publicity. Yes, the EA FC open-world game mode playtest is supposed to be private, but the community is desperate to see what it looks like, what you can do, and how it plays. Internal documents have already revealed the expected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fcs-new-open-world-mode-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC open-world mode release window</a>, and there’s gameplay to keep you ticking over.</p>



<h2 id="h-ea-fc-open-world-gameplay-leaks-early">EA FC Open World Gameplay Leaks Early</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Even Cole agrees the footage is cold. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>There were rumors that an EA FC open-world mode would be akin to NBA 2K’s open-world hub. It would include fun mini-games and ways to interact with other players.</p>



<p>This seems to be the case. You can check out leaked videos and gameplay, especially through <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/ea-fc-open-world-map-has-already-leaked-during-playtests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ, as they first reported that gameplay had leaked</a>. You can also find snippets across all forms of social media.</p>



<p>Check out the initial media here, but be warned, there’s every chance EA will have the content removed.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players can dip in and out of several mini-games, watch from the sidelines if needed, walk around, and talk to other users, and the initial maps look quite sizable. Rumor has it that there <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/exclusive-ea-fcs-open-world-will-have-several-maps-to-explore-based-on-major-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be several maps to explore based on major countries</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Again, a quick search on X, TikTok, and YouTube is bound to give you the footage you’re looking for. It’s certainly out there. EA is presumably doing its best to clamp down on leaked clips and have the gameplay footage removed. You might need to be quicker than Mbappe to see certain videos!</p>



<p>Does an open-world EA FC gameplay mode interest you? Should EA be concentrating its efforts on other areas of EA FC, such as Career Mode or Clubs? The place to dissect all of this and more is the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, which continues to grow each day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The zombie horde returns to face off against players in Black Ops 7, and, as has become customary in the mode, there are a wealth of Perk-A-Colas available that assist in the battle to fend off the undead army.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches worldwide on November 14</a>, bringing a new campaign, complete with four-player co-op, multiplayer action, and Zombies, the latter of which will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expanded further with the addition of new maps</a> throughout the game’s lifespan.</p>



<p>Perk-A-Colas have long been a core part of the mechanics of Zombies in the Call of Duty franchise, and we’ve got all the details on what will be available to save up for in Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-perk-a-colas">All Black Ops 7 Perk-A-Colas</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Collect them all. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 7 Zombies launches</strong> <strong>with 12 Perk-A-Colas available, 11 of which are returning to the franchise, with the other being brand new.</strong></p>



<p>Wisp Tea is the only new Perk-A-Cola added to Black Ops 7 Zombies at launch, with a unique benefit that summons a companion wisp after killing zombies. All other Perk-a-Colas in the game have featured in the franchise in the past, with the majority having been available in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Zombies will be regularly updated throughout the game’s lifespan, however, so new and returning Perk-A-Colas could come later down the line with seasonal updates.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the available Perk-A-Colas at launch in Black Ops 7 Zombies, along with a description of the bonus they provide.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest stories in gaming this year is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">EA's pending $55 billion deal to be sold to a investor consortium</a> led by Saudi Arabia. The sale could have ripple effects across the wider industry, and now Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has weighed in with his thoughts about it all.</p><p>Speaking during <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839738-take-two-interactive-software-inc-ttwo-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Take-Two's latest earnings briefing</a>, Zelnick said he is "not sure" about how the competitive market could shake out if EA does indeed go private. This would leave Take-Two the last publicly traded company--of a certain scale--in the American video game business, an analyst pointed out.</p><p>Some have theorized EA going private could be a boon for Take-Two, but Zelnick isn't keen to assume that will be the case.</p><p>"We're always running scared around here. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success. And I do think we're in a terrific position. We're performing much better than expected economically, and that's because we're performing better than expected creatively, and that's always our story around here," he said. "And if we can maintain that, then we have a wonderful future ahead of us. It is true that at year-end, we're really very under-leveraged."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Zelnick said it may be true that EA going private could give Take-Two "a bit of room from a competitive point of view," but that isn't clear at this point.</p><p>"We wish our competitors well. A good business is well served by having powerful players, not just one powerful player. So, it's possible that the competitor landscape shifts a bit; it's also possible nothing changes at all. Either way, we have to do our job, which is make the very best entertainment on earth."</p><p>EA's sale to Saudi Arabia's PIF, Affinity Partners, and Silver Lake has only been announced; the deal is not done yet and is not expected to close until 2026. </p><p>Take-Two's biggest announcement from the earnings results was that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">Rockstar's GTA 6 had been delayed yet again</a>. The game was originally slated to release in Fall 2025 before it was delayed to May 2026 and now it's been pushed to November 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar said.</p><p>Rockstar has found itself embroiled in controversy, as the studio recently fired dozens of employees for what it called "gross misconduct." Rockstar said employees were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-says-it-fired-workers-for-leaking-secrets-not-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6535987/" data-ref-id="1100-6535987">leaking company secrets</a>, but a labor union says this is baloney and that the affected staffers were fired for attempting to unionize.</p>

		<p>Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu has held a video call with staff outside Japan and announced a “fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization”. Jobs will be cut and those left will be expected to spend more time working in the office. The move is part of a cost-cutting exercise to save 3 billion yen ($19.6 million), although the last attempt at restructuring the company ended up costing the company 9.8 billion&nbsp;yen.</p>
<p>Square Enix has not announced how many people will be let go and said that affected staff will be notified today. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-says-it-wants-generative-ai-to-be-doing-70-of-its-qa-and-debugging-by-the-end-of-2027/">VGC</a> are reporting that over 140 people are at risk in the London office, including those working in marketing, QA, and sales.</p>


<p>Alongside this, the company also released a financial statement along with a commentary that stated that they are working with the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo on a project “aimed at improving the efficiency of game development processes through AI technologies”. Their goal is to “automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027”.</p>
<p>The financial report shows that game sales for the company are down 15% year-on-year but despite this, operating income has increased by 28.8% due to reduced marketing and development costs.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/next-bioshock-now-on-great-track-take-franchise-next-level/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-bioshock-is-now-on-a-great-track-to-take-the-franchise-to-the-next-level-says-take-two-ceo.1346785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been twelve and a half years since Irrational Games launched BioShock Infinite, the last installment in the immersive single player first-person shooter franchise. Franchise creator Ken Levine notoriously decided to disband the studio and form the much smaller Ghost Story Games, which is now working on Judas. Levine recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-similar-bioshock-some-ways-radically-different-in-others/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that Judas shares some similarities with the BioShock franchise, but it is also different in many ways.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Take-Two's publishing label 2K <a href="https://wccftech.com/cloud-chamber-taking-care-of-the-next-bioshock-game-2k-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in late 2019 that a brand new studio called Cloud Chamber, headquartered in Novato, California, would take stewardship of the BioShock IP. Cloud Chamber had its own fair share of troubles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rebooting the project in 2023</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-late-2027-release-cloud-chamber-layoffs-80-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffering a big round of layoffs</a> (affecting around 80 employees) as recently as this August, which delayed the new BioShock to the latter half of 2027, according to credible sources.</p>



<p>The former Studio Head, Kelley Gilmore, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-cloud-chamber-developer-suffers-layoffs-diablo-rod-fergusson-studio-head/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replaced by industry veteran Rod Fergusson</a>, who previously worked at Epic Games, The Coalition, and Blizzard, among others. Fergusson is known to be well-versed in taking over and focusing a studio's resources toward the successful completion of a game, and that's precisely what's needed here. Indeed, speaking during Take-Two's Q2 2026 earnings call (the same one that announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-delay-help-rockstar-exceed-expectations-take-two-ceo-never-regretted-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the delay of GTA VI</a>), CEO Strauss Zelnick said the game is now on a great track to take the franchise to the next level. Here's the quote:</p>



<p><em>We’re very excited that we brought Rod on to lead Cloud Chamber. He is the new head of the BioShock franchise. He’s obviously an incredible industry veteran. He’s got history with the BioShock franchise, specifically with Infinite. He’s also been involved with Gears of War and Diablo. We’re just so grateful that he’s come to work with us at Cloud Chamber. BioShock is a very important franchise for us. It’s one of our biggest franchises. We’re very excited about the release of the next BioShock. We’ve made some changes in the organization. We’re shifting some things around. Right now, we feel that the game is on a great track for us to deliver something that’s going to exceed consumers’ expectations. Not much more to update other than the fact that the next BioShock is going to take the franchise to the next level, which is always our ambition with all of our franchises.</em></p>



<p>It may take a while, as mentioned above, but franchise fans will be able to tide themselves over with Judas (which is 'coming up', according to Zelnick, and is likely to be ready before the BioShock game) and the BioShock Netflix film adaptation, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-film-adaptation-will-be-directed-by-hunger-games-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be directed by The Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence</a> and should begin production after Lawrence finishes shooting the next movie in that franchise (Sunrise on the Reaping).</p>

            <p>I was nosing around for a feelgood story to perk you up after this morning's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">depresso</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-say-goodbye-to-nic-reuben-chief-librarian-and-rps-staff-writer">news</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-announce-mass-layoffs-with-over-100-uk-staff-reportedly-expected-to-be-at-risk">stew</a>. But then I thought: what have you done for me lately? So instead, we're going to write up the release of Diggergun, a life sim platform game about burrowing for lithium, in which you lose a portion of your take-home pay to costs based on real-world current UK tax, national insurance, debt and household expenses. Glorious! That'll teach you to show up here, expecting some kind of escapism.</p><!--more-->
<p>In my defence, it seems possible for Diggergun to become more of a feelgood game if all of the aforesaid realworld statistics improve. But I'm not sure this will ever transform into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wandersong">Wandersong</a>, exactly. One of the first things I did in the Steam demo was develop symptoms of what I assume is lithium poisoning. There may also be supernatural threats ahead: white eyes in the dark, and little green men (self-described, anyway - the visuals are monochrome) who talk of ancient evils below. Is a Balrog worse than the cost-of-living crisis? This we may discover.</p>

<p>As in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>, you start the game owing a hefty sum to a giant corporation, the operators of a weird Cornish mining operation on the isolated and therefore, unregulated Bal Island. To pay off the debt - or so you're told by your employers - you must jump and gun-dig through a "diverse range of randomly generated mines and intricately hand-designed levels", all of them presented as 2D platters of destructible blocks, gems and hostile critters. It's sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a> but with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minit">Minit</a>'s art direction, and each floor is (so far) more of a single-screen puzzle than a procedural ecology.</p><p>You're bound by an energy gauge that decreases for every floor you descend, and punishes you in various ways for overdoing it. You can deposit your lithium load and return to the surface by heading to the exit on each level. Also on the surface: a gloomy town's worth of miners, managers, loansharks and shabby apartments, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tristram">Tristram</a> if it were founded by Weyland-Yutani. There are people here you can bond with to pursue a multiple-ending storyline. I feel like my best friends so far are the toilet and shower in my apartment, which restore a precious point of energy apiece.</p>
<p>Diggergun is the work of solo developer Kabloop, and has an autobiographical underbelly. "I started working on the game three years ago, after a very unpleasant experience working at a video game publisher," the developer told me over email. "Something I didn't expect was that Diggergun's themes about workers rights and the minimum wage have become <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/nov/03/nigel-farage-reform-uk-economic-policy">more relevant today</a> than when I started." </p>
<p>"Whilst things are looking bleak, it's my hope that Diggergun can be a part of a much needed discussion about workers rights, and our duty of care to one another," the dev went on. "As opposed to ranting at people, my game attempts to highlight its themes through its emergent gameplay. For example, if the player does their job correctly they're rewarded with more work... something I'm sure we can all relate to."</p>
<p>If all this sounds <em>too</em> relatable, know that the game has some uncomplicated upsides. The setting is pleasantly mysterious and there's some wonderful audio design. Signboard text unfurls with a warble of Morse code, and your character makes a digital plinky-plonk noise when they walk that I found immediately endearing. Still, none of that's going to pay the rent. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968180/DIGGERGUN/">Find out more on Steam.</a></p>

              <p>Have you heard the whispers? According to my sources, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> has been delayed again.</a>&nbsp;It’s weird, because <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-strauss-zelnick-ceo-take-two-interview-rockstar-games-2000617237">a guy&nbsp;<em>promised</em> me this wouldn’t happen</a>. Anyway, PlayStation Plus subscribers can somewhat console themselves with word from the extremely reliable leaker billbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766">over at&nbsp;<em>Dealabs</em></a>:&nbsp;<em>GTA V</em> seems to be making its way back onto PS Plus yet again later this month.</p> <p>This is the third appearance of <em>GTA V</em> on PS Plus, last disappearing from the service in May this year. It seems likely that had the game met its original release plan of fall 2025, it would not have returned, so as to push all focus onto <em>GTA</em> VI without a surrogate “free” earlier entry for people to play instead. Then the game was <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799">surprise-delayed</a> in May this year to May 2026, and none of that made much sense any more. So, then with the intention of seeing the game come out in May 2026, Rockstar seemingly made plans with Sony to return it to the sub for a bit.</p>

 <p>Except, now that’s gone wrong too! However, what seems definitely impossible is that this news of <em>GTA V</em>‘s return to PS Plus has anything to do with last night’s shock announcement—such things would have been organized long ago. Instead it’s perhaps a rather timely coincidence for Rockstar, given it gives the appearance of saying, “Look, play this one for ‘free’ for a bit to cushion the blow.”</p>

 <p><em>GTA V</em> <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/03/grand-theft-auto-v-game-pass-gtav-enhanced-april-15/">was also added to Microsoft’s Game Pass last year</a>, and has remained their since, rather than following the odd six months on, six months off pattern the game’s had with PlayStation. And even if there had been plans to yoink it from the Xbox subscription some time soon, that’d be a pretty disastrous PR move at this point. So it seems reasonably likely that both PS5 and Xbox players will be able to keep playing for the foreseeable. Although definitely expect it to disappear from both should the game actually manage to come out November 2026, with Rockstar wanting everyone as hungry as possible to spend money on the shiny new game.</p> <p>Or perhaps we’re just six months away from the announcement of the next delay, when&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em> gets slated for May 2027, just in time for it to then get held back again as a PS6 release, and everyone who loved <em>GTA V&nbsp;</em>ages out shortly before the heat death of the universe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Advent calendars turn the December countdown into a daily ritual of surprise and anticipation, and LEGO’s Star Wars version delivers on exactly that with a galaxy far, far away twist. This year’s LEGO Star Wars Advent calendar <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5387/">has dropped to an all-time low of $26 on Amazon, slashed from its original $44 price tag</a>.</p>
<p>The calendar is <strong>packed with 24 surprises behind its doors</strong>, and turns each day in December into a mini building adventure that brings iconic droids and characters into your home. LEGO clearly wants to move inventory before Advent begins and that urgency creates an opportunity for anyone planning their holiday celebrations.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5387/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Twenty-Four Days of Galactic Discoveries</h2>
<p>Behind each numbered door waits a Star Wars surprise that builds anticipation throughout the month. You get C-3PO and a Holiday Jawa as minifigures and gives kids immediately recognizable characters to play with right out of the gate. Babu Frik makes an appearance as a LEGO figure, bringing the tiny droidsmith from The Rise of Skywalker into your collection. Five droid figures round out the character lineup including R7-A7, BD-72, a Scrap Battle Droid, BB-8 dressed as a snowman for the holidays, and a Super Battle Droid ready for action.</p>
<p><strong>Eight buildable droids</strong> across several days keep hands busy with construction challenges. Kids will assemble a Pit Droid, Gonk Droid, and Buzz Droid, each with different building techniques that develop spatial reasoning skills. Holiday versions of a Medical Droid and Mouse Droid add festive touches to familiar Star Wars machinery. B2EMO from the Andor series joins the roster alongside a Treadwell Droid and Probe Droid, giving fans droids across different eras of Star Wars storytelling.</p>



<p>Of course, the calendar is not limited to characters and droids. Mini builds create Babu Frik’s workshop piece by piece, with a workbench, chair, tool rack, and shelves making an appearance as the days progress. It also includes a box of extra parts, crane, and bucket to enhance the workshop setup for kids to play out the busy work of the droidsmith fixing and upgrading mechanical companions. A Jawa buildable vehicle expands play possibilities, and a Christmas tree brings holiday cheer to the Star Wars universe.</p>
<p>With <strong>263 pieces in total</strong>, this calendar allows the building experience to be spread out throughout the month rather than overwhelming kids with one huge construction project. Every day, a manageable build is accomplished, which feels rewarding without hours of focus, perfect for children aged 6 and up who are still developing their LEGO skills.</p>

<p>Players diving into Zombies in Black Ops 7 have a long to-do list to unlock all of the available items, as some of the most powerful pieces of equipment and Field Upgrades are restricted to level unlocks—and we’ve got all the details.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on November 14</a>, equipped with a brand new Zombies adventure to work through from the off, and there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plenty of additional content planned for the future with new maps</a> and more.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-zombies-level-unlocks-listed">All Black Ops 7 Zombies Level Unlocks, Listed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to get. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is a wide range of level unlocks for Black Ops 7 Zombies, with minimal items and equipment available immediately.</strong></p>



<p>Better gear makes it easier to advance deep into the later rounds in Zombies, so grinding for them is recommended. Some are much more powerful than others and should be immediately topping your wish list.</p>



<p>Unlockables in Black Ops 7 Zombies include Lethal Equipment, Tactical Equipment, Field Upgrades, Gobblegums, Support Items, and Ammo Mods.</p>

		<p>Call of Duty games have gradually been increasing in size over the years and now take up a significant chunk of your hard drive.&nbsp; Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is not expected to buck the trend, as it is going to land somewhere between 130GB and 166GB on PS5.</p>
<p>The back of the physical box states the game requires 166GB, but a report from PlayStation Game Size, who dig about in the back end of the PSN, reveals that the main game is 96.677 GB, with the co-op campaign adding 15.594 GB and Warzone an additional 19.734 GB. There is no mention of Zombies, which may be part of the main file or an additional download that has yet to be listed.</p>


<p>The Xbox download size has not been revealed, but PC gamers are going to need a minimum of 116GB. By comparison, the rather good Arc Raiders is 16Gb on PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>How is it holding up?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> is out now for the Nintendo Switch 2, and our pals over at Digital Foundry have presented their tech verdict on the new title from developer AAA Games Studio.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it's pretty decent! With its 40GB+ file size, the game utilises dynamic resolution scaling, with docked mode putting out anything between 720p and 900p, while handheld mode delivers between 468p to 648p. DF states that these resolution targets are generally pretty good considering the effects-heavy gameplay.</p>
<p>The Switch 2's improved specs over its predecessor means its able to render a whole bunch of overlapping effects alongside dozens and dozens of enemies on-screen, all running at 60fps. Meanwhile, enemy complexity is much improved over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a>, and multiple effects light up the surrounding terrain impressively.</p>
<p>Frame rate, as mentioned, sticks to 60fps for the most part, however DF states you'll "easily" spot moments in which the performance drops slightly. It's nothing egregious, mind you, and you're not really going to get anything below 50fps, so it seems to be a pretty stable game overall.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that if you jump into local co-op mode via split-screen, you're going to be getting 30fps instead of 60. That said, if you have two Switch 2 consoles at hand, or even if you use GameShare, you can play co-op with a much smoother 60fps.</p>
<p>For even more in-depth analysis, be sure to check out Digital Foundry's video and article down below. You might notice that we've not included such articles in our recent DF pieces, and that's because the team has recently joined forces with Hookshot Media to create its own website – huzzah! Congrats to all involved.</p>

            <p>Amid announcing another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">delay</a> during their latest earnings call, Take-Two also raised a glass to comparatively less earth-shatteringly huge crime committer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>. As it turns out, there's enough of an appetite for more "contained" tales sold at a lower price point than the usual all-singing, all-dancing affairs big publishers keep pushing more and more of their eggs into the baskets of.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said the Sicilian sojourn convincingly outperformed expectations, putting to be any questions about the series' future, at least for now. "What we suspected was confirmed," the exec told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">The Game Business</a>. "Which is just...if you give consumers a great narrative experience that’s a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result."</p>
<p>While I'm not sure I'd go too over the top in congratulating Take-Two for taking the unprecedented gamble of, er, not having every game be a massive, unwieldy beast which is expected to deliver the GDP of a decently-sized country just to not be a branded a faliure, it's nice to see The Old Country's approach did pay off.</p>
<p>As I said in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mafia-the-old-country-review">my review</a>, it's a path I was glad to see Hangar 13 take, even if in my estimation the short Mafia romp they ended up creating is a bit too by-the-numbers narrative-wise and could maybe have to done more to blend both the old and the new into its pint-sized soup. If you're prepared to accept caveats like those going in, it's well worth picking up for a fun weekend or so of chases in old timey cars and people talking about oaths of omerta.</p><p>I'd certainly not want every game I played to set its sights on only being the sort of thing The Old Country is, but it's important that games like it keep on getting made, because there'll always be a place for them. Here's hoping Take-Two don't turn around and forget that the moment they finish their celebratory wine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another of the corp's summer releases, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, didn't have any beverages cracked open for it. Instead, Zelnick cited it as having faired less well than planned this far, something the company are blaming on the technical issues which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-the-new-recommended-settings-for-borderlands-4-and-oh-no-they-dont-actually-fix-its-stuttering">plagued its PC version early doors</a>. What that in mind, they expect a game that conformtably had the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/">biggest US launch</a> in its series' history to pick up going forwards. This industry, man.</p>

<p>According to the numbers provided in Take-Two Interactive’s latest earnings release, Red Dead Redemption 2 has become the fourth best-selling game of all time in terms of units sold. </p>



<p>Rockstar Games dominates the gaming industry, a fact widely acknowledged due to the developer’s remarkable portfolio. However, they have outdone themselves this time around by having not one, but two games in the best-selling titles of all time list: Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2. </p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2-has-sold-over-79-million-units-surpassing-mario-kart-8">Red Dead Redemption 2 Has Sold Over 79 Million Units, Surpassing Mario Kart 8</h2>



<p>As revealed during Take-Two’s latest <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/2b782ec8-e583-4f7b-a213-86f2d1dbce40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earnings call</a>, Red Dead Redemption 2 has surpassed 79 million units, and the series has sold a total of 106 million units globally. Moreover, analyst data reveals that RDR2 has been the “best-selling title of the past 7 years in the US based on dollar sales.” Additionally, Red Dead Online comes free with every copy of Red Dead Redemption 2, and a standalone online version was also released in 2020.</p>



<p>Mario Kart 8 was previously at the fourth spot for best-selling games of all time (units sold), with the title pushing 78.02 million copies across the Wii U and Nintendo Switch. Now Red Dead Redemption 2 has taken its place, and the only games ahead of it are Wii Sports with 82.9 million units (bundled with Wii U consoles), Grand Theft Auto 5 with over 220 million units sold-in to date, and in the first spot, we have Minecraft with over 350 million sold.</p>



<p>In other news, Red Dead Redemption 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-doubted-budget-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met with skepticism</a> due to budget and timeline issues. Additionally, GTA 6’s delay <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-delay-could-impact-halo-remake-gears-e-day-next-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could impact games</a> like Halo Remake, Gears E-Day, and the next Call of Duty.

<p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is releasing digitally on the Nintendo Switch 2 on December 4, 2025. </p>



<p>Mario Kart is the franchise that has dominated Nintendo’s consoles in the racing genre for the longest time, with the latest entry to the franchise, Mario Kart World, already nearing 10 million units. However, a new competitor is entering this space, and it will make its grand debut on the platform next month. </p>

Moreover, players who already own the Switch version can purchase the upgrade pack for the latest console. The Switch 2 version of Sonic Racing CrossWorlds will offer players improved graphics resolution and higher frame rates. The release date for the physical version has not been revealed; however, we do know it will use a game card. </p>

Additionally, if the upgrade pack is purchased from 8:00 AM on December 4, 2025, to 7:59 AM on December 11, 2025 (UTC+8), it will cost half the price. </p>



<p>Furthermore, suppose players are looking to purchase the the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and Season Pass at a discounted price. In that case, they can do so by purchasing both Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Digital Deluxe Edition for Nintendo Switch, which includes the base game, season pass, and upgrade pack. Also, saved data can be transferred from Switch 1 to Switch 2. </p>
