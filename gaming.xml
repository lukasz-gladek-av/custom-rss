<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was a critically acclaimed smash in 2025. It was also the debut release from French video game development team Sandfall Interactive.</p>



<p>Now that they have had time to reflect on the work that went into the successful RPG, senior members of the team are praising their staff for making such a beloved game.</p>











<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-basically-did-twice-the-work-of-a-more-experienced-team-to-get-the-hit-french-rpg-out-the-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Edge Magazine (via GamesRadar+), </a>the game’s lead designer, Michel Nora, explained that one of the benefits of working with a younger staff was the lack of expectations of what a studio should be and how a game should be made.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[The younger staff] didn’t have any expectations about how a studio should be run and how a game should be made, and they brought fresh ideas that were very valuable for the rest of the project. So it ended up being a good decision, but it was also kind of by force, because it’s almost impossible to hire any senior people if you don’t have the money, which wasn’t there at the beginning.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Game producer Francois Neurisse also chimed in, saying that working with such a young team meant there were no bad habits brought to the project from other gaming companies, and the team had the benefit of learning alongside one another.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[We were] trying to create something new, and even new skills, from scratch. I’d say we basically did twice the work, because we were doing things for the first time to that scale. [But we had] the opportunity to research and execute the best practices. I also worked a lot of collaborating and exchanging [ideas] with other teams in France, and in Montpellier where many other indie studios are based. I find this industry great, it’s so collaborative among companies, rather than competitive. We benefited a lot from sharing experiences.”</p>
</blockquote>

			<p>Gaming's 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was largely marked by great indie</a> or double-A releases, but our list of most anticipated games of 2026 <strong>is filled with triple-A games</strong>. That's not to say there won't be great indie launches, or that all of these AAA releases will succeed, but the calendar suggests <strong>a resurgence for big-budget titles coming from well-known studios</strong>. From Rockstar's long-awaited Grand Theft Auto 6 to the return of highly popular characters long missing from the gaming scene (James Bond, Wolverine), this year could belong to blockbusters, although we did add a couple of wild cards.</p>



<p><em>All of Wccftech's Most Anticipated 2026 Games per genre:</em>&nbsp;<em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-role-playing-games-of-2026-legends-and-legacies/">Role-Playing Games</a></strong></em>,&nbsp;<strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">Indie Games</a></em></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-platformers-of-2026-new-adventures-in-familiar-worlds/">Platformers</a></em></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-dlc-expansion-of-2026/">DLC/Expansion</a></em></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Action</em></a></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-2026-the-year-of-xbox-studios/">Shooters</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2026-a-new-era-of-dread/">Horror</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-racing-games-of-2026-from-japan-to-a-galaxy-far-far-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sports/Racing</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2026-tag-fighters-dominance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fighting</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-most-anticipated-adventure-games-of-2026-against-fire-air-water-mind/">Adventure Games</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2026-the-year-of-warhammer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Strategy/Simulation</a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-multiplayer-games-of-2026-new-online-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multiplayer</a></em></strong></p>

<h2 id="h-nioh-3-february-6-2026-pc-playstation-5"><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nioh-3-everything-we-know-about-team-ninjas-supernatural-action-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a> (February 6, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5)</h2>



<p>2026's calendar kicks off with <strong>Team Ninja</strong>'s third installment in its masocore action RPG series. This entry features protagonist <strong>Tokugawa Takechiyo</strong>, a historical figure from the Tokugawa dynasty, battling his envious brother and his army of yokai and supernatural beings to ascend to his rightful place on the Shogunate. The game introduces dual playstyles: traditional Samurai (three weapon stances, Ki Pulse stamina recovery) and new <strong>Ninja</strong> (fast-paced evasion, aerial attacks, Mist clone-creation ability). Unlike its predecessors, <strong>Nioh 3</strong> features expansive, less-linear level design with larger explorable spaces, side quests, and points of interest discovery. Players switch between playstyles freely, utilizing guardian spirit transformations and Soul Cores. After playing the game at a recent event, our own Francesco De Meo <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swears this is shaping up to be Team Ninja's culmination in the action RPG area</a></strong>. Everyone will soon get a taste, anyway, thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-demo-ps5-pc-january-29-2026-carries-full-game-crossplay-missing/https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-demo-ps5-pc-january-29-2026-carries-full-game-crossplay-missing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>free demo launching on January 29</strong></a>, with save data carrying over to the full game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-february-27-2026-pc-ps5-xss-x-ns2"><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> (February 27, 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS|X, NS2)</h2>



<p><strong>Capcom</strong>'s ninth mainline horror title returns to post-apocalyptic <strong>Raccoon City</strong> 30 years after the US government unleashed a nuclear missile to try, and largely fail, to contain the zombie outbreak. The game features a return to multiple protagonists: there's the new character, <strong>Grace Ashcroft</strong>, an introverted FBI analyst haunted by her mother's death, who's investigating murders at the Wrenwood Hotel, and then there's the returning fan-favorite, <strong>Leon S. Kennedy</strong>. The developers of Requiem have openly stated that they're trying to balance the horror elements seen in entries like Resident Evil 2 with the action elements of games like Resident Evil 4, with Grace providing the former and Leon ensuring the latter. The goal is <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-complete-rollercoaster-ride-never-before/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to provide a 'complete rollercoaster ride' like never before</a></strong>, with greater peaks of horror tension and valleys of peaceful exploration or more relaxing action combat.</p>



<p>Perhaps the biggest addition is <strong>the ability to switch between third and first-person views at any time</strong>, which also allows players to slightly customize the degree of tension they're willing to experience. The game, powered by RE Engine, will support NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Multi Frame Generation and path tracing on PC. The Gamescom 2025 demo <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was very promising</a>, and there's no doubt this is one of the most anticipated games of the year in most players' lists, too.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Crimson-Desert-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-crimson-desert-march-19-2026-pc-ps5-xss-x">Crimson Desert (March 19, 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS|X)</h2>



<p>Most games on this list are from acclaimed developers who are either releasing a sequel to an established IP or working on a brand new IP while still staying well within the boundaries of their proven area of expertise. <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> is one of two exceptions. Sure, <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> proved they can create a successful MMORPG with <strong>Black Desert</strong>, but this is something else entirely.</p>



<p>Originally announced as another MMO at G-Star 2019, the game quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shifted to an 'open world action/adventure game with multiplayer support'</a>. Back then, it was still slated for Winter 2021, but it was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed indefinitely</a>. After it resurfaced, Pearl Abyss has never mentioned multiplayer again, focusing entirely on the single player component and revealing the game's massive scope.</p>



<p>The open world is gigantic: the developers said it's <strong>twice as large as Skyrim</strong> and also <strong>larger than Red Dead Redemption 2</strong>. Powered by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom BlackSpace Engine</a>, it is entirely seamless, featuring advanced simulations for water, volumetric fog, cloth, hair, and even destructible elements. Players can even fly around the continent of <strong>Pywel</strong>, riding massive dragons. </p>



<p>The game was playable at Gamescom 2025, showing off an intricate combat system that allows for numerous moves, drawing inspiration from fighting games. This meant it didn't demo very well, but on the other hand, it could become a major asset for the final game, contributing to its depth. The biggest unknown is the story, but everything else about Crimson Desert already looks very, very juicy.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/007-First-Light.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-may-27-2026-pc-ps5-xss-x">007 First Light (May 27, 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS|X)</h2>



<p>It's been ages, at least as far as the gaming industry goes, since we've gotten a new game based on <strong>James Bond</strong>. The previous one was 2012's 007 Legends, a mediocre Call of Duty clone developed by Eurocom (which was shut down after that game's release). <strong>007 First Light</strong> brings much loftier promise.</p>



<p>Developed by <strong>IO Interactive</strong>, the acclaimed studio behind the HITMAN series, <strong>it is an origin story portraying a young Bond</strong>, who is 26 years old and fresh out of his assignment as an Aircrewman in the Royal Navy, looking to earn his 00 status in MI6. The character, who's voiced by Irish actor Patrick Gibson, is a bit reckless, as already shown in released footage.</p>



<p>From a gameplay standpoint, HITMAN fans should not expect the same level of freedom that Agent 47 is awarded in those games. After all, it wouldn't make sense for 007 to do the same things. Instead, <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-uncharted-x-hitman-qa-narrative-drives-things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it resembles a blend of HITMAN and more linear action/adventure games</a>, such as <strong>Naughty Dog's Uncharted</strong>. If the studio can deliver on the narrative front while still offering some of its trademark gameplay, it may have a winner on its hands.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Phantom-Blade-Zero.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-phantom-blade-zero-september-9-2026-pc-playstation-5">Phantom Blade Zero (September 9, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5)</h2>



<p>I mentioned earlier that there are two exceptions to the 'established AAA studio' rule on this list. The second is, of course, <strong>S-GAME</strong>'s <strong>Phantom Blade Zero</strong>. Founder Liang Qiwei (known as <strong>Soulframe Liang</strong>) started making small indie projects, like the Rainblood trilogy (which was developed with RPG Maker), and then achieved success with the Phantom Blade trilogy of mobile games. Phantom Blade Zero is, however, the studio's first foray into the triple-A PC and console market.</p>



<p>First <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-0-is-a-new-unreal-engine-5-powered-dark-action-rpg-coming-to-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> at May 2023's PlayStation Showcase event, the game immediately caught our attention and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-qa-dev-says-bosses-are-the-games-highlights-confirms-hardware-ray-tracing-ps5-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we brought you an exclusive interview just two months later</a></strong>, where Soulframe Liang talked about the game's inspiration from Chinese Wuxia culture in terms of setting, while the gameplay takes elements from games like Ninja Gaiden, Nioh, and Sekiro, blending action RPGs with Soulslike and Hong Kong action films to create a style called <strong>kungfupunk</strong>.</p>



<p>More importantly, our Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played the game</a> at two consecutive Gamescom conventions, coming away from his sessions <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>more excited each time</strong></a>. If S-GAME can also deliver a decent narrative (which revolves around a warrior with a mission and only 66 days left to live), this could turn out excellent.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Grand-Theft-Auto-VI-scaled.webp"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6-november-19-2026-playstation-5-xss-x">Grand Theft Auto 6 (November 19, 2026 - PlayStation 5, XSS|X)</h2>



<p>Does it really need explaining why <strong>GTA 6</strong> is on a list of most anticipated games? <strong>Rockstar</strong>'s historical pedigree would warrant that on its own, never mind the fact that the previous installment is the second best-selling game of all time with <strong>over 220 million units sold</strong> at the latest count.</p>



<p>It's been thirteen years since the latest release of a Grand Theft Auto game. Despite the continued expansion of GTA Online, the vast community of fans is overdue for a new game. They're going to get it (unless there's a third delay, which Rockstar has never done before) late this year, when the award-winning studio will bring gamers to a fictional version of <strong>Florida</strong>, where <strong>Jason Duval</strong> and <strong>Lucia Caminos</strong>, the new duo of playable characters, encounter a statewide conspiracy and are forced to protect each other. </p>



<p>Rockstar hasn't really shared anything about the gameplay, but the developers have <strong>continuously innovated the open world genre since GTA 3 and they are expected to do so once again with GTA 6</strong>. When it comes to the online mode, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have <strong>our own rumor</strong> based on Rich Vogel's statement</a> that the multiplayer <strong>might evolve toward an MMORPG-like experience</strong>. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Blood-of-Dawnwalker-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-tba-2026-pc-ps5-xss-x">The Blood of Dawnwalker (TBA 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS|X)</h2>



<p>Following the highly successful release of The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, several <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> employees split to form their own studio, <strong>Rebel Wolves</strong>. After getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some investment from NetEase</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a publishing deal with Bandai Namco</a>, they unveiled their first project, the vampire-themed dark fantasy open world action RPG <strong>The Blood of Dawnwalker</strong>.</p>



<p>The game clearly shows its roots in The Witcher III, but there are several key differences. For one thing, the protagonist, <strong>Coen</strong>, is given <strong>30 days and nights to save his family</strong> from the cadre of vampires that has exploited the plague and the ineptitude of the local lords to take control of <strong>Vale Sangora</strong>.</p>



<p>Time does not advance linearly, allowing players freedom to explore without too much stress. But the most significant innovation, at least on paper, is that <strong>the game's narrative sandbox supposedly treats all quests in the same way</strong>, instead of splitting main and secondary quests. Everything that you do furthers the goal, and you can complete the missions in various ways. For example, during the day, you might get easier access to certain areas, but you'll only have the ability of a regular human, whereas at nighttime, Coen can leverage his Dawnwalker-derived vampiric skills. You can also choose to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-qa-vampiric-nature-impact-coen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">give in to Coen's vampiric side</a></strong> or not.</p>



<p>Rebel Wolves admitted that it won't be nearly as vast a game as The Witcher III in terms of scope, but then again, quality is more important than quantity. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Control-Resonant-Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-control-resonant-tba-2026-pc-ps5-xss-x">Control Resonant (TBA 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS|X)</h2>



<p>Finnish developer <strong>Remedy Entertainment</strong> has long provided gamers with fantastic titles, like the first two Max Payne titles, Alan Wake, and more. Despite this fact, they have often struggled financially. Now, with <strong>Control Resonant</strong>, they're trying to get their first smash hit in over 30 years in the industry.</p>



<p>There's good reason to be hopeful. Control was by far their most successful game, having <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-admits-disappointing-sales-fbc-firebreak-control-sold-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold <strong>more than five million units</strong> to date</a>, and Resonant has been repositioned in the even more popular <strong>action RPG genre</strong>, potentially opening the IP to a larger audience.</p>



<p>Resonant also focuses on melee combat with the shapeshifting Aberrant weapon, which can change in a variety of forms. The protagonist is Jesse's brother, <strong>Dylan</strong>. With Jesse mysteriously vanished, <strong>he's the only one who can deal with a catastrophic invasion of Manhattan</strong> thanks to his reality-bending powers. Control Resonant also <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offers more open-ended exploration of Manhattan</a>, where players can find optional quests to help other humans and fellow members of the FBC.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/The_Duskbloods_KeyArt-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-duskbloods-tba-2026-nintendo-switch-2">The Duskbloods (TBA 2026 - Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<p>Kind of like with Rockstar, it's impossible not to put a game made by <strong>FromSoftware</strong> on the year's most anticipated games list after all their successes. Last year, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></strong> proved they can even produce a kick-ass multiplayer game, although <strong>The Duskbloods</strong> may be even more ambitious.</p>



<p>This was apparently <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-gameplay-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the longest gameplay prototyping cycle in their history</a></strong>. In this PvPvE game, eight-player matches pit <strong>Bloodsworn</strong> (vampire-like characters, of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-duskbloods-will-feature-over-12-playable-characters-fromsoftware-isnt-abandoning-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there are more than twelve to choose from</a>) against each other and AI enemies with dynamically variable victory conditions: last player standing, rival elimination, ally cooperation, and boss defeat, among others. Legendary director <strong>Hidetaka Miyazaki</strong> personally pitched this to Nintendo, prioritizing player freedom over mandatory mechanics. Combat emphasizes superhuman abilities (double-jumps, jetpack traversal, dashing), with boss encounters designed for tactical complexity. There's also a <strong>dynamic event system</strong> that will alter match conditions to prevent repetitiveness. As a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, if it is even remotely as good as FromSoftware's latest projects, The Duskbloods could be a killer application that drives millions to purchase the system.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marvels-Wolverine-Key-Art-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-marvel-s-wolverine-fall-2026-playstation-5">Marvel's Wolverine (Fall 2026 - PlayStation 5)</h2>



<p><strong>James 'Logan' Howlett</strong> hasn't had the privilege of a dedicated game since 2009's <strong>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</strong>, a mediocre tie-in of the eponymous movie. Just like with James Bond, Logan is in much better hands, as <strong>Marvel's Wolverine</strong> is being developed by Insomniac Games, the acclaimed studio behind Spyro, Resistance, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and most importantly, the great <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man</strong> series, which convinced Marvel to let them take a stab at the Ol' Canucklehead. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniacs-wolverine-announced-for-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Announced more than four years ago</a>, the game was among those most exposed following the Insomniac <strong>ransomware hack</strong> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">occurred in December 2023</a>. Following that incident, the Californian developer went into stealth mode for a bit, and for a while, we only <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-looking-fantastic-according-playtesters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard rumors</a> saying the game would be fantastic. At last, during September 2025's State of Play, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got our first look at in-game footage</a>. That's where we also learned that Wolverine will be voiced (and mo-capped) by actor Liam McIntyre, and that in the game we'll see characters like <strong>Mystique</strong> and <strong>Omega Red</strong> as well as locations like <strong>Canada</strong> and <strong>Japan</strong>. We'll know a lot more in Spring, ahead of an estimated <strong>Fall </strong>release window, but if Insomniac can keep the same quality of the Spider-Man games, Marvel's Wolverine could be a GOTY contender.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Former Nintendo of America employees, Kit and Krysta, have provided some insight as to why the “Nindies” branding went away in favor of showcasing independent games coming to Nintendo consoles via Indie World presentations. Largely, it’s due to Nintendo’s careful protection of its core branding.</p>



<p>In the late 2010s, Nindie Showcases shone a spotlight on games like My Friend Pedro and Yooka-Laylee as they were coming to the Nintendo Switch platform. The Branding of “Nindie” was a playful, creative mashup to showcase indie games coming to Nintendo. Ultimately, despite the creativity and an overall positive energy around the branding, it would be that mashup that would ultimately raise concerns for Nintendo’s legal department.</p>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-doesn-t-want-any-part-of-its-name-being-used-to-create-a-new-word">Nintendo Doesn’t Want Any Part Of Its Name Being Used To Create A New Word</h2>



<p>In a clip from The Kit &amp; Krysta Podcast, the namesake hosts revealed that while Nintendo’s Publisher and Developer Relations Department came up with the term and was very proud of it, they were ultimately told that they’re not allowed to warp the Nintendo name in any way, as it runs the risk of hurting the protection of the brand’s intellectual property.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“You definitely cannot, kind of, cut the Nintendo brand in half and tack it to another word. It dilutes the brand, in the words of legal. It makes it so that you cannot defend your brand later on for some sort of legal dispute,” Krysta said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was said that a representative from Nintendo’s PDR team tried to fight the mandate, but he ultimately lost.</p>

<p>There you have it, you can’t fight City Hall. Unless you’re Rocko Wallaby, that is.</p>

            <p>US game retailer GameStop has reportedly shut hundreds of stores.</p>
<p>While CEO Ryan Cohen gets set for a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/07/business/gamestop-ceo-ryan-cohen-compensation-package">$35 billion ($26bn) pay package</a> if he successfully gets GameStop's market cap to $100 billion - ten times its current value - <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-closing-stores-as-ceo-payday/">Polygon</a> reports hundreds of workers have been let go in a series of abrupt store closures.</p>
<p>Some employees are claiming that the closures came as a "shock" and with very little notice, affecting even well-performing staff and stores.</p>

</span></p><p>According to the <a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/">GameStop Closing List</a>, more than 400 stores have confirmed they have closed or plan to close in January 2026. It's the highest for any month on record and equates to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q80n3u/so_on_the_topic_of_closures/">20-25 percent</a> of all GameStop stores across the United States.</p><p>"I had heard [my local GameStop] was closing and wanted to stop by for the last time because that store was my childhood. Once I arrived it had already been closed," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q7j34w/thank_you_to_my_local_gamestop/">wrote</a> one unhappy customer. "I wanted to say thank you to the one manager there. He had been there since I was a kid and I always recognised him when I went to the store. Thank you for the memories. It may have just been your job but that store gave me some good memories."</p>
<p>"Only one store left within about an hour of me and I'm sure that's going to be next," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q7j34w/comment/nypkmfl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> another. "Really sucks because I enjoy walking in and buying physical on launch day, or poking through the used shelves."</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/583322/eb-games-proposes-closing-all-new-zealand-stores">RNZ</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-gamestop-closing-hundreds-of-stores-in-the-united-states">GamesIndustry.biz</a>) reports that the company is also eying up closures to its EB Games subsidiary in New Zealand, too. Staff have reportedly received emails notifying them that they're in scope of redundancy, although no "final" decisions will be made "until we have completed a full consultation process in good faith with affected team members".</p>
<p>If true, New Zealand will join Ireland, Germany, and Austria as countries where GameStop has recently closed its local operations.</p>

One way to hit that target is by cutting costs, and one way of cutting costs is to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/gamestop-reportedly-shuts-down-more-than-400-us-stores-210632743.html">close down a bunch of stores</a>. The company closed 590 stores in fiscal year 2024, and said in a recent <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638025000098/gme-20251101.htm">SEC filing</a> that it anticipates “closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025.” With the fiscal year set to end on January 31st, it appears the race is on, and according to a blog <a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/">tracking closures</a>, GameStop is planning on shuttering (or already has) over 430 stores this month.</p><p>As of Sunday, January 11th, the list of planned closures is at 435 stores across 42 states.

And this comes as the company is largely winding down its international operations, having already left Canada, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Switzerland, and Italy, with plans to exit France within the next 12 months.</p><p>To say the company has had a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/7/23199123/gamestop-layoffs-cfo-fired-blockchain">tumultuous</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22914855/gamestop-nft-marketplace-immutable-x-ethereum-announcement">few years</a> would be an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23377175/gamestop-eat-the-rich-diamond-hands-roaring-kitty-elon-musk-netflix">understatement</a>.

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed director Alexandre Amancio has shared his thoughts about AAA development, suggesting we need "smaller teams" and admitting that big-budget developers cannot "solve a problem by throwing people at it".</p>
<p>In an interview with our sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-assassins-creed-director-alexandre-amancio-explains-how-to-fix-aaa-development">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Amancio - who currently works at FunPlus - talked frankly about his time at Ubisoft, suggesting it's not "tenable" to keep making bigger and bigger games with more and more people.</p>

<p>"There's this theory that says that whenever humans create something that surpasses a hundred people, it completely changes the dynamic of it. As soon as you surpass that, the ratio of management to people working on the game explodes. You start having a very management-heavy structure: You need to have people to coordinate the people coordinating," he said.</p><p>"Something that a lot of AAA studios mistakenly do, or certainly did in the past, is think that you can solve a problem by throwing people at it. But adding people to a problem stagnates the people that were already being efficient on it. It just creates a lot of variable noise.</p>
<p>"So I think the future lies in smaller teams."</p>
<p>Amancio then reflected on how the film industry has "coalesced" into smaller, core teams, where each crew is "built for that project, it's a temporary crew", but gaming is different from films as in projects change and evolve over time, whilst in the film industry, "you have a script, it's solid, and then you just go and shoot it".</p>
<p>"Since its inception, I think that the gaming industry has treated itself as being part of the software industry, but it is kind of a weird hybrid," he added. "I think the future lies in taking that learning from the film industry, where you have core teams that are complimented with either outsourcing or with co-dev for specific needs. You get the right crew for the right project at the right time."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-assassins-creed-adaptation-cast">Don't forget that Netflix has an Assassin's Creed adaptation on the way</a>. It recently announced two more of the actors cast, although we don't yet know what character they will portray.</p>

<p>That’s not what I’m writing about today, however. I’m going to explain what Prime 4 does better than any other Nintendo-developed game. This isn’t about the game’s gorgeous visuals or silky smooth frame rate; it’s about its accessibility features.</p>
<p>If any of you can remember <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-straight-up-fails-in-just-one-respect-accessibility">my piece about</a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-straight-up-fails-in-just-one-respect-accessibility">Tears of the Kingdom</a></strong>, I’m paralysed from about the chest down with no finger movement. It’s obviously not ideal for gaming, but I’ve played thousands and thousands of hours worth of games across multiple genres without any adaptive equipment. Except for one genre, first-person shooters.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/metroid/related-articles:149509 @ 1768163104 -->
<p>The Prime games are different than standard action-focused FPSs and instead focus on exploring. They also feature a lock-on similar to the Zelda series. I would have never even attempted playing Prime 4 if not for that. The controls would still need to be remapped in my Switch 2’s system settings so I could tap the shooting and jump buttons while still holding the lock-on, though.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6be3a2a9f0a22"><a title="Switch 2 Pro Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6be3a2a9f0a22/switch-2-pro-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I began hatching my plan of attack while downloading my brother’s digital game card onto my system. What I came up with was moving the lock-on to 'A' so I could jump with 'B' and shoot the power beam and missiles with 'X' and 'Y', respectively.</p>
<p>I didn’t have to do that, though. Did I magically regain movement I have been without for over 15 years? No, something even more unlikely happened: a Nintendo-developed game had in-game remapping.</p>
<p>It might not sound like much, but the difference between changing remaps at the system level and doing it in-game is huge. This meant I didn’t have to delete one of my saved layouts (you only get five per controller) or deal with button prompts that contradicted my remaps. I can’t tell you how many times I failed taming horses in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> and TOTK because of the button prompt tricking me into pressing 'L' when I remapped that input to 'ZL'.</p>
<p>Prime 4 also separates control schemes for the morph ball and Vi-O-La, so they could be remapped independently. That’s another thing that doesn’t sound like a big deal but actually is. Imagine how annoying it would be having to change the controls every time Samus morph-balled or jumped on her motorcycle. Even thinking about that is giving me a migraine.</p>

<p>So after remapping everything to my liking and some trial and error with the camera and reticle controls (I settled on dual stick plus gyro), I set off for adventure. I swallowed my pride and played on casual mode which did some heavy lifting while I built up my energy tank collection. My progress took off after the initial struggles and I cleared the game right under 16 hours. I probably would have beaten it an hour quicker if Myles had just told me where Tokabi was in the desert. The one time I wanted some direction on where to go and I got nothing. What a dork.</p>
<p>A thought occurred to me while watching the credits: Do I think Prime 4’s inclusion of in-game remapping will lead to it being in other Nintendo-developed games? It wasn’t in Prime Remastered, so they must be rethinking the matter. Right?</p>
<p>The answer is obviously no. This was just Retro Studios acting on its own. No other game developed by any other Nintendo-owned studio will have it during the Switch 2’s lifetime. You might think that’s a pretty bold statement but high-ranking Nintendo officials have made it clear they aren’t going to do it. Read this back and forth from <a href="https://kotaku.com/breath-of-the-wild-is-getting-a-sequel-because-the-team-1835624233">Jason Schreier’s interview</a> with the master of the Zelda franchise, Eiji Aonuma, from 2019:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Aonuma:</strong> When we have a button arrangement, we very much put thought into how we do it, because there’s a specific way we want players to feel. In some ways, if we freely let players do customizations on key assignments and such, I feel like we’re letting go of our responsibility as a developer by just kind of handing everything over to the users. We have something in mind for everybody when we play the game, so that’s what we hope players experience and enjoy as well. But we understand also that players have a desire for free customization.</p>
<p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Also, physically disabled players might not be able to play the way developers intended.</p>
<p><strong>Aonuma:</strong> Definitely, that’s a very good point, and that’s something we’ll keep in mind going forward, thinking about that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Aonuma-san thought about it and then decided to not include a remapping option in the two Zeldas released after this interview, Tears of the Kingdom and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>. He didn’t even allow it in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Age of Imprisonment</a>! The lack of it in Age of Imprisonment is incredibly damning, as you can remap the controls in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_warriors_three_hopes">Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes</a>, which was built in the exact same engine (Koei Tecmo’s Katana Engine) three years prior.</p>

<p>Aonuma-san has since been promoted from Deputy Manager to Senior Officer at Nintendo EPD (home of Nintendo’s software development groups), which means his belief that developers shouldn’t allow players to remap their controls in-game is likely echoed throughout every team there. Metroid Prime 4’s development was only “overseen” by Production Group 6, which perhaps explains why Retro was able to get away with it.</p>
<p>Why Nintendo’s leadership is so weird about accessibility features when their peers do include them is beyond me. Sony and Microsoft wouldn’t make games more accessible unless the effort to do so was profitable. You’d think the company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/dont-let-nintendo-ruin-the-entire-industry-is-usd80-for-mario-kart-world-a-bridge-too-far">leading the charge</a> on higher game prices would know that.</p>
<p>This isn’t about money for Nintendo, though; it apparently is one of its core design philosophies. Retro Studios’ efforts in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond prove it’s a dumb ideal. The team's inclusion of incredibly basic accessibility features in Prime 4 did not negatively affect the gameplay at all. It was no different than any other Prime game in that regard. The actual mistakes Retro made were the momentum-killing open world, straight-as-an-arrow level design, and bad writing. None of those were related to making the game more accessible, plus, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-suggests-metroid-prime-4s-tortured-development-meant-it-was-divorced-from-the-changing-of-times">according to a recent Famitsu interview</a>, the open-world idea might have been forced on Retro.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8b46fe00d63c3"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Accessibility" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8b46fe00d63c3/metroid-prime-4-beyond-accessibility.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Hilliard Hendrix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It makes me almost sad that the most accessible Nintendo game I’ve played ended up being disappointing. A real monkeypaw situation for your boy. On top of that, Retro’s next original game may not release this decade based on how long it took to ship Prime 4. We aren’t going to see another Nintendo game with worthwhile accessibility features until then.</p>
<p>That’s not going to keep me from buying nearly everything Nintendo puts out, because it’s had its hooks in me since I was a little kid, but its choice to be this way gets more frustrating by the day.</p>

<p>The 2016 action role-playing title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_berseria_remastered">Tales of Berseria</a> is getting a remastered released on the Switch next month, and we've got some additional details to share about this version's performance and resolution.</p>
<p>As we highlighted in the original announcement last November, the game will target <strong>30fps</strong>. Some extra information from Bandai Namco further notes how the frame rate may change during certain moments of the game:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In comparison, the other versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_berseria_remastered">Tales of Berseria Remastered</a> on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will be running at 60fps.</p>
<p>As for the remaster's resolution on Switch, TV mode will run at <strong>1920 x 1080</strong>, and in handheld fans can expect <strong>1280 x 720</strong>. Other versions of the game will support up to 4K.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco also notes how it's been testing the compatibility of the game with the Switch Lite and Switch 2, so if there are any significant developments regarding the game on Switch 2, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>This follows the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_xillia_remastered">Tales of Xillia Remastered</a> on the Switch in October last year, which also ran at 30fps and was 1080p docked, and 720p in handheld mode.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[One Million ARC Raiders Players Wiped Their Accounts, Embark Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/one-million-arc-raiders-players-wiped-accounts/</link>
            <guid>1402774</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Towards the end of December, ARC Raiders’ first ‘Expedition Project’ went live, allowing players to leave the game’s map behind and reset their accounts in search of a fresh playthrough. It’s a balancing mechanic that allows players another go around at the game, and it’s set to recur once every two or three months.</p>



<p>The optional mechanic was explored by more than <strong>one million players</strong>, Embark Studios recently revealed. Given the game has sold an estimated 12 million copies, that means just 8% of players carried out the optional account wipe.</p>







<h2 id="h-embark-will-evolve-the-expedition-project">Embark Will Evolve The Expedition Project</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders is still sitting at the top of the extraction table, for now. It dropped back in October 2025 and quickly became a stellar, award-winning game adored by millions of players. The exposure the game received on streaming and social platforms was unparalleled, and it’s still beating some of the traditional games in the space at the time of writing.</p>



<p>In December, ARC Raiders players everywhere were invited to complete the game’s first Expedition Project. This optional step requires players to collect scores of specific items to build an ‘escape caravan’, migrating away from the game’s safe zone and walking off into the sunset.</p>



<p>They’re then handed a fresh character and must go back through the game again, this time with a few buffs acquired via the Expedition Project process.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Embark Studios revealed that ‘a little over a million players’ completed that first Expedition. That represents a relatively small minority, per sales estimates. There were a few issues with the Expedition Project, such as the grind required to get there and tick the final boxes to unlock <strong>all </strong>the benefits, so that likely explains why so few players completed the task.</p>



<p>Many players had an issue with the hefty requirements to unlock the five free skill points handed down upon the launch of a successful Expedition. They were charged with collecting a whopping <strong>five million credits </strong>in stash value, translated into one free skill point per <strong>one million </strong>credits.</p>



<p>This is one of the areas that Embark is working on, per the recent <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/first-expedition-wipe-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with PCGamesN</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the bigger topics of feedback was the requirements for the final stage to get the skill points, and probably going out a bit too late with that information, because we wanted to hold off until we could calibrate it around the actual economy of the player base, rather than trying to guess really early on.</p>



<p>So then, when we chose the number, which was the five million credits for the full thing, we set that as an aspirational goal that some players&nbsp;<em>might</em>&nbsp;achieve. But then I think a lot of players took that as like, ‘Well, now I&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to do that to get it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was then confirmed that around 35% or 40% of players running the Expedition Project received the full allotment of free skill points. The team also confirmed that they’re examining the Expedition process from every angle, scrutinizing the data and looking for opportunities to improve it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 lore fans are in overdrive after a single page of a new campaign book teased something that’s never happened before in the setting: the meeting of two loyalist primarchs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The primarchs are the overpowered, genetically-engineered demigod sons of the Emperor, the leaders of the loyalist Space Marine legions before they were broken up into chapters following the catastrophic civil war known as the Horus Heresy. Warhammer 40,000 as a narrative operated for decades with most of the primarchs either thought dead or lost in the warp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, only two primarchs are confirmed alive and active in the current Warhammer 40,000 setting: Ultramarines boss Roboute Guilliman, who returned to the galaxy during the Gathering Storm event in 2017, and Dark Angels chief Lion El'Jonson, who miraculously popped back into existence as part of the Arks of Omen storyline in early 2023. These were galaxy-shaking plot developments for the Warhammer 40,000 setting, and ever since Lion El'Jonson’s shock return to Warhammer 40,000, fans have wondered when he’d finally bump into his brother, Roboute. Now, it looks like that long-awaited family reunion will take place in the coming months, after a new campaign book teased a meeting of the Emperor’s sons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Word comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ArbitorIan" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer 40,000 lore expert Arbitor Ian</a>, who IGN has partnered with for a number of explainer videos, such as the one above. Arbitor Ian got an early look at 500 Worlds: Titus, a soon to be released Warhammer 40,000 campaign book and narrative expansion that features 80 pages of lore covering the beginning of the Ultramarian Reclamation, and <a href="https://youtu.be/LbzAifF0hlM?si=YovaOQ329eobksT2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a new video on its most explosive lore reveal</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To back up briefly, Lieutenant Titus from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii"><u>Space Marine 2</u></a> video game has become one of the most recognizable faces in Warhammer 40,000 following its enormous success. To capitalize on Titus’ newfound fame, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-just-promoted-titus-from-space-marine-2-with-a-fancy-new-trailer-that-sets-up-the-next-narrative-expansion-for-warhammer-40000">Games Workshop promoted him to Captain and made him Master of the Watch</a>, which means he’s in charge of defending the 500 Worlds of Ultramar, the realm of Space Marine poster boys, the Ultramarines. With Roboute Guilliman off gallivanting with his Indomitus Crusade, Titus is now in charge of keeping things safe and sound back home, where new Necron threats have emerged, as they always do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the new video from Arbitor Ian, 500 Worlds: Titus has a crucial piece of new lore, found right at the back of the book, that teases a meeting between Guilliman and Lion El'Jonson. It is an intergalactic message written by Lion El'Jonson and intended for Roboute Guilliman that reads: “Brother. We need to talk.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/10/skxwr6po7aseaulq-1768088002164.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lion El'Jonson wants a word with his brother, Roboute Guilliman, in a meeting 10,000 years in the making. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This seemingly innocuous message teases a momentous plot development for the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Never before have two loyalist primarchs met in the current setting. Of course they spent a great deal of time with each other <em>before</em> the 41st millennium. They were, generally, pals during the glory days of the Great Crusade, for example. All the primarchs (apart from the two we don't talk about) were active during the foundational events of the Horus Heresy, which took place 10,000 years before the current setting. And we just got our first novel set during the era known as The Scouring, which saw the loyalist primarchs enact their revenge on the traitor legions in the aftermath of the Horus Heresy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, how will this meeting between Lion El'Jonson and Roboute go? It’s hard to tell. Some fans are speculating the Lion will be a bit miffed at Roboute, who has alarmed more than a few inquisitive minds with his Indomitus Crusade. Others think (hope?) the brothers will join forces to help drive back the forces of Chaos and rekindle the glory days of the Imperium. Given this is Warhammer 40,000 and everything is… awful, I suspect that plenty will go wrong, no matter the Lion’s feelings about his brother.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s the speculation around the message itself: “Brother. We need to talk.” That doesn’t sound aggressive necessarily, but it does suggest a matter of some importance needs to be brought to Guilliman’s attention. What does the Lion know that his brother doesn’t? Does he carry a warning? Has he discovered some grand conspiracy about their father, the Emperor? Does he bring good news? Is another loyalist primarch about to return?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arbitor Ian speculates that the Lion may be upset with Guilliman because he believes his brother to be trying to usurp the Emperor with all this Indomitus Crusade and Ultramarian Reclamation business (there’s a whole thing about Roboute potentially doing something similar during the Horus Heresy when it looked like Chaos might win). Alternatively, Arbitor Ian suggests the Lion will reveal some new threat that becomes central to the plot of the next Warhammer 40,000 campaign book, perhaps to do with would-be fifth Chaos god Vashtorr the Arkifane.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever Games Workshop has up its sleeve, it looks like we’re set for some answers over the next few months. At least, that’s the hope. Fans have been waiting three years for the Lion and Guilliman to get together. If Games Workshop just sat on this tease for another few years, well… that would be very Games Workshop, wouldn’t it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Warhammer 40,000 story, such as it is, is a slow moving beast. The scribes at Games Workshop sometimes take years to inch the overarching plot forward. Tantalizing plot threads are left dangling, sometimes for decades. Answers remain frustratingly out of reach. Cliffhangers seem destined to hang in a perpetual state of anticipation, never to be fulfilled. Such is the nature of Games Workshop's grimdark 41st millennium, which has exploded in popularity over the last decade. At this point any news on how the story might actually move forward is analyzed to within an inch of its life, as if under investigation by the Inquisition itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Every once in a while, a game rocks up that so quickly finds itself in my Steam wishlist I don't even remember clicking the button. Today, that game is Rakshasa, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> inspired first-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> set in modern India where you must face off against demi-gods and "centuries-old flesh-eating monsters" inspired by Indian folklore. Yeah! Hell yeah! Yeah, yeah sign me up!
</p>
<p>
The reveal trailer for this thing absolutely drips with muck and grime, almost in that nasty cyberpunky kind of way, yet still grounded in a city setting we're all familiar with. But you'll also find yourself in ancient temples and rundown slums alongside the luxury apartments. Even from a short trailer there's a suggestion of a lot of texture environmentally.

<p>
Interestingly, despite being first-person, it actually takes a turn-based combat approach, with what appears to be a timing based element when pulling off an attack. Hard to get a read on how this functions moment to moment, but it being an RPG you have your usual upgrade trees to make different builds with, I just can't garner much more than that so I'll leave the combat there. Oh and you can throw snakes! Just, throw 'em. I like it!
</p><p>
Interestingly, this game is actually being made by a YouTube channel called Odd Compass, which makes animated history videos about "under-appreciated events and people in Asian history," predominantly in India. These videos look incredibly well-made too, definitely worth a look if you're a history buff. In the meantime, you can wishlist Rakshasa <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4285930/Rakshasa/">here</a>.

Wizard Pool! It is, probably, exactly what you think it is. You are a wizard, and you play pool. Well, admittedly there is a smidge more to it than that, alongside a healthy amount of charm. Styled in a way that looks like an N64 game in the kind of way you remember that era looking rather than how it actually looked, you play as Kue, a budding young wizard tasked by his uncle to complete a trial in the form of a tower filled with magical, illogical pool tables.
</p>
<p>
The tutorial levels are simple enough, giving you a taste of how it all works; each differently coloured ball has different magical properties. Upon impact one might swap places with the white ball, there's a ball that freezes the white ball temporarily so it slips and slides leaving it out of your control, another ball starts tiny but the harder you hit it the bigger it gets before reverting to its original, miniscule size.

Speaking of, the process of doing the ball hitting is archaic and difficult to get to grips with at first, but won me over steadily enough. You rotate your cue stick clockwise or anticlockwise by pressing the left or right mouse buttons, and then you must physically position the mouse and move it to hit the white ball, the speed with which you do so affecting the strength of your hit. As stated, odd at first, yet delectably tactile when you get used to it.
</p><p>
Things steadily get more and more mixed up as the tables change too, holes appearing in places anywhere but where you'd expect, encouraging you to put a bit more thought into how you position your cue and how hard you might hit the ball. It's neat! And a simple yet engaging little <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzley</a> arcade game, which even has an online multiplayer option.
</p>
<p>
In the game's quite simple story mode there's even these pre-rendered cutscenes that must be no higher than 480p in quality that for some reason very specifically call Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg in terms of vibes. Something about the lighting, can't entirely put my finger on it.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's just a nice way to muck about for a little while, and is cheaper than a cup of coffee on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4177880/Wizard_Pool/">Steam</a>, so well worth a shot!

<p>The next game in the Moonstone Island franchise has been revealed.</p>



<p>Moonstone Island was released on PC in 2023 and later ported to the Nintendo Switch in 2024. Developed by Studio Supersoft and published by Raw Fury, the game is yet another take on the cozy sim, which has proven very successful on the Nintendo Switch. Now, the next game in the franchise which isn’t a sequel, but isn’t not a sequel, according to a new social media post, has been shown off for the first time.</p>







<h2 id="h-introducing-moonstone-academy">Introducing Moonstone Academy</h2>



<p>In a Twitter post, the team behind the Moonstone Island game shared a brief 30-second preview of their work. What followed was a video of a character briefly exploring a tower, then getting on a bicycle with a propeller in front and flying away, before a title reveal reading “Moonstone Academy.”</p>



<p>In subsequent posts, it was clarified that this is a new game in the series, and that while there’s no set release date, more information will follow as updates are made. It’s claimed this isn’t necessarily a sequel, but it wouldn’t be fair to say it isn’t one.</p>
