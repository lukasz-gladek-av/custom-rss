<p>We thought developers and publishers would be winding down right before the holidays, but <a href="https://x.com/PATAPON__REPLAY/status/2001957426724282697">Bandai Namco has dropped</a> a little teaser for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a>, the collection of the two classic PSP games, for some brand new content on <strong>22nd December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the teaser gives us nothing but a cute little animation, before capping it off with the news. The update will give us a brand new game mode, with more details to come, giving us the perfect opportunity to dive back in next week.</p>
<p>And hey, if you haven't picked up Patapon 1+2 Replay yet, in the UK it's currently on sale for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/PATAPON-1-2-REPLAY-2804105.html"><strong>$19.99 on the eShop</strong></a> (until 31st December).</p>
<p>Releasing back in July of this year, Patapon 1+2 Replay bundles together two iconic PSP rhythm action games where you have to command an army of Patapons by beating drums. The key is timing each of your commands to the beat and knowing when it's best to Don or Pata. If you know, you know.</p>
<p>We had a pleasant time with the Switch version of the game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/patapon-1plus2-replay">scoring it a 7/10</a>: it's "a real blast from the past and more than proves why this series was such a hit for Sony."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony Honda Mobility has announced that Afeela will become the world’s first vehicle to introduce PS Remote Play, and it will arrive in California next year. </p>



<p>Yes, cars are being integrated with gaming capabilities over time. We already saw that Xbox Cloud Gaming is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/your-car-can-soon-be-an-xbox-thanks-to-lg-and-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to select internet-connected vehicles</a> thanks to a new partnership with LG. Now, Sony Honda Mobility’s first car is ready to arrive with PS Remote Play next year. </p>







<h2 id="h-remotely-use-your-ps5-or-ps4-through-afeela-s-infotainment-system">Remotely Use Your PS5 or PS4 through Afeela’s Infotainment System </h2>



<p>Announced in a new <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-12-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Afeela will begin deliveries in California in 2026, becoming the first vehicle with PS Remote Play, allowing users to play their PS5 and PS4 games through the car’s infotainment system. The games are not like cloud gaming; instead, they let players play remotely from their console via the vehicle’s integrated display and premium audio system. Check out what the Representative Director, President, and COO, Sony Honda Mobility Inc., Izumi Kawanishi, had to say: </p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>The introduction of PS Remote Play embodies AFEELA’s vision for mobility: transforming the traveling space into a captivating and emotional one. Through this integration, we are elevating the customer’s entire travel experience to an unprecedented level of entertainment.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The blog post also reveals that players will need a broadband connection of at least 5 Mbps, and a stable connection of at least 15 Mbps is recommended for a smooth PS Remote Play experience. Additionally, players will require a PlayStation 5 or PlayStation 4 to access Remote Play. </p>







<p>In other news, Sony and Tencent have settled their lawsuit out of court, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-clone-lawsuit-settled-with-light-of-motiram-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Light of Motiram being delisted</a> from major storefronts.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima has made new comments about AI, stating there’s no point in saying things like ‘We shouldn’t use AI’ or ‘AI is useless.’</p>



<p>&nbsp;AI in the gaming industry has been a subject of contention since the community started learning about the new tech. Most recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Larian Game Studios has been under fire</a> for using AI. Now, a highly regarded game director has shared his thoughts on it, revealing there’s no running away from it. </p>







<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-talks-about-embracing-ai-as-there-is-no-going-back">Hideo Kojima Talks About Embracing AI, As There is No Going Back</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/casestudy/00012/01783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei Xtrend</a> (translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/metal-gear-solid-and-death-stranding-creator-hideo-kojima-thinks-we-cant-go-back-to-a-world-without-ai-smartphones-were-the-same/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Hideo Kojima shared his thoughts about AI. Kojima first noted that smartphones were also ‘slated’ by everyone when they first came out, and now we live in a world where “there are so many people who can’t live without their smartphones.” Kojima added that AI is similar to that, and it’s essential “to use technology in a way that will make us happy.”</p>



<p>Kojima also added that there is no point in saying things like ‘We shouldn’t use AI’ or ‘AI is useless.’ There is no going back, and smartphones were the same. Kojima also spoke about the possibility of AI changing how we communicate, helping people who aren’t the best at face-to-face interactions. In the same vein, Kojima also talked about how AI could make humans spoiled, so there should be measures to ”&nbsp;reduce the AI’s involvement, or have days where we don’t use it.”</p>







<p>In other news, Kojima had joined the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-zootopia-2-cameo-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zootopia 2 cast</a> just days before the release. Additionally, the director <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-matrix-game-konami-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could have made a Matrix game</a>, but Konami shut it down.

                <p>Gaming on the go has been popular among players for decades, and now Sony and Honda are teaming up to bring the power of PlayStation 5 to the road. The two companies formed a joint venture, Sony Honda Mobility, in 2022 to produce electric vehicles. Their first car, the Afeela 1, will be released next year and it will include the capability of playing PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 games.</p><p>However, this a limitation to what players can do with their Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment systems. Sony and Honda aren't including in-car consoles, and they are relying on PlayStation Remote Play for this to work. That means Afeela 1 owners will also need to have either a PS5 or a PS4 at their homes in order to connect with the systems to play games. Sony notes that this use of Remote Play is separate from streaming PS Plus games from the cloud.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626163" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626163"></a><figcaption>The Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg"></figure><p>This setup includes integrated display and premium audio systems for passengers. It's unclear if the cars come with a PlayStation controller or if players have to bring their own from home.</p><p>"The introduction of PS Remote Play embodies Afeela's vision for mobility: transforming the traveling space into a captivating and emotional one," said Sony Honda Mobility COO Izumi Kawanishi <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-12-18/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in a statement</a>. "Through this integration, we are elevating the customer's entire travel experience to an unprecedented level of entertainment."</p><p>Afeela 1 will be available in California first before it goes nationwide. But aside from a 2026 release window, it doesn't currently have an on-sale date.</p>

                <p>Overwatch developer Blizzard has teased that 2026 will be the year when the studio's "boldest ideas come to life."</p><p>"We're eager to take creative steps that will allow the game to lean further into storytelling and character development, and we can't wait to share these new experiences with our community," Blizzard said in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/18/xbox-bethesda-blizzard-activision-king-2025-games-thank-you/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "There's a real sense of momentum and optimism within the development team, and we believe 2026 will be a year where our boldest ideas come to life."</p><p>Blizzard did not share any further details, but 2026 marks the 10th anniversary of Overwatch, and the studio presumably has some anniversary plans in store for the milestone.</p><p>Also in the post, Blizzard ran through some reflections of the past year, saying 2025 "brought out the best in the Overwatch team."</p><p>"Inspired by the evolving landscape of the industry, we embraced the opportunity to take bold risks and focused on making impactful changes rather than playing it safe," the developer said. "The response from our community has been amazing, and we feel our relationship with our players is stronger than ever."</p><p>Blizzard also called out how Overwatch 2 relaunching in China was a "standout moment" for the game in 2025. "Despite the absence, the community’s passion remained strong, with fans organizing offline events, creating art, and supporting esports. This enduring passion for the Overwatch universe highlighted how the game brings people together and means so much beyond just gameplay, reinforcing our excitement for the future," the developer said.</p><p>2026 marks the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and studio president <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-biggest-year-yet-coming-in-2026-for-35th-anniversary-president-says/1100-6537061/" data-ref-id="1100-6537061">Johanna Faries said it will be the "biggest year yet" for the company.</a> The company is bringing back BlizzCon in September 2026 to share a number of "major" announcements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Photo by Colton "Anarche99" Childrey via UVW-CWA</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last week </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://uvw-cwa.org/">United Videogame Workers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (UVW-CWA) made quite the splash with a showy protest at the 2025 Game Awards in downtown Los Angeles. Armed with signs, fake tombstones, and leaflets, they briefly turned the celebration into a funeral for the video game industry. The Grim Reaper made an appearance. A digital billboard on the back of a cube truck drove up and down Figueroa St. And even an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Among Us</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> crew member stopped by to grieve all those lost.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't worry, this wasn't a case of critical misdiagnosis. Speaking to Game Developer as the sun went down and the ceremony was about to begin, the protest organizers explained they put on the show to spotlight the thousands of workers laid off by studios large and small in 2025, and to cast a spotlight on the CEOs and executives who ordered the cuts, many of whom were at the show. (I think I saw Matt Booty sprint by while I conducted my interview).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The gathering was an unconventional twist on the many protests staged outside the awards over the last few years. With no ongoing strike or recent major news event to peg the protest to, the group brainstormed a creative way to get their message across—and their process and motivation shone a light on where game industry unionization may be headed in 2026 and beyond.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/game-developer-s-2025-wrap-up-the-trends-that-made-and-plagued-this-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">The 10 game industry trends that made (and plagued) this year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A dirge for executives and a party for players">A dirge for executives and a party for players</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The UVW protestors set out that evening to creatively catch the eye of two groups: attending executives and senior developers, along with players footing hundreds of dollars to attend the awards in-person. "It's important to remember that we are the reason why they have a show," said UVW secretary Kaitlin "KB" Bonfiglio. They sported "wanted" posters with the faces of Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav, EA CEO Andrew Wilson, and Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick, along with their salaries presented against what the average game developer makes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Planning for the spectacle began a few months ago and emerged out of a voting process by UVW members—everything from the budget to the strategy came about through worker consensus. Despite the dour theming, UVW treasurer Sherveen Uduwana said the goal was not only to "acknowledge the harm" but also to "build excitement" for what can be done through unionizing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Silly protests with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/opinion/no-kings-protest-chicago-tactical-frivolity.html">costumed characters have been quite mainstream in 2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with commentators like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/802315/portland-no-kings-october-ice-protests-frog-antifa">Sarah Jeong</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> observing that they helped turn protests like the No Kings Rallies into joyful affairs that felt more like Disneyland than hellish warzones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most major industry figures had easier ways in and out of the Peacock theater (LA Live security only let them approach the small ice rink near the theater's edge after attempting to keep them off the property), so it's unlikely the three men would have seen their own faces. But, in a bit of luck, the increased number of non-professionals attending the show worked out in UVW's favor. As the line to enter the venue snaked around the corner, many got to speak with union organizers face-to-face.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/fifa-and-netflix-partner-for-a-new-football-game" target="_self" data-discover="true">FIFA and Netflix partner for a new soccer game</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This ties into what players and the gaming audience might be interested in," commented Uduwana. "A lot of that overlaps with what they care about [like] rushed and buggy launches, games that are suddenly canceled without warning, launches that make it clear these companies are just trying to take your money and don't care about the quality of the product."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those negative events are, according to the group, driven by executives pursuing profits at the expense of workers. "We want to be able to do our jobs at a high level of capability. We want the bosses to get out of the way and let us do those jobs. Allowing us to get our organizing wins is going to make higher quality, more exciting, and more ambitious games possible."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A bill of rights, firing protections, and agency over the way games are made">A bill of rights, firing protections, and agency over the way games are made</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/tencent-and-sony-settle-horizon-cloning-lawsuit" target="_self" data-discover="true">Tencent and Sony reach 'confidential settlement' on Horizon cloning lawsuit</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Going into 2026, the Uduwana said the organization is preparing a "bill of rights" for game workers that workers can use to identify immediate terms to raise in unionization drives. "That is basically us talking to workers this whole year, understanding what the high-priority asks are going to be, and putting together...essentially an organizing floor that we can use for future campaigns."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Workers looking for additional demands from their employers can build off of these terms for what their studio specifically needs.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> fans are concerned Jonathan Bailey, this year's People's Sexiest Man Alive, may have been recast in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s MMORPG - or at least has recorded under unfavourable conditions.</p>
<p>Bailey has voiced fan-favourite cat boy G'raha Tia since the Stormblood expansion, released in 2017. But this was before he starred in the likes of Bridgerton, Wicked, and Jurassic World Rebirth, from which his fame has risen considerably.</p>
<p>This week, the 7.4 update was released for Final Fantasy 14, bringing an extension to the story and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tom-morello-final-fantasy-14-interview-everything-burns">new song from Rage Against The Machine's Tom Morello</a>. Yet fans have noticed G'raha Tia's voice sounds a little off.</p>

<p>One <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1pnzr6b/jonathan_bailey_in_74/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit thread posits</a> either the character is no longer voiced by Bailey, or he's been recording away from the studio - likely between other major projects he's worked on.</p>
<p>"It also feels like they're minimising his speaking - he had a total of two lines in the first two quests, and at one point just emoted a thumbs up," the post reads. "He felt conspicuously silent for G'raha, someone who is way too sentimental to barely say anything at a goodbye."</p>
<p>The poster later added they think it is still Bailey, but a combination of hoarse throat and a subpar microphone "adds some gruffness to his voice".</p>
<p>Fans have also been sharing comparison videos on social media, to highlight the differences in the voice work.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">So I did a quick little comparison between 7.0 and 7.4 G'raha Tia, it seems that he HAS NOT been recast, I just think he's recording his lines from his phone or a subpar mic setup, the EQ is sorta way more treble-y, when his voice is usually bassy with the studio mics they use. <a href="https://t.co/AYYZYadgWU">pic.twitter.com/AYYZYadgWU</a></p>— Josefumi 🎙️ (@JosefumiVO) <a href="https://twitter.com/JosefumiVO/status/2000983922734457059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>In an interview with BAFTA last year, Bailey recognised Final Fantasy 14 alongside his other voice work, and how important the character is to the fanbase.</p>
<p>"I'm aware of how important this character is to so many people," he said. "I was so determined to not step away from this character, that when I was doing Company [in the West End in 2018] I had to record this in the day for about a week doing eight shows a night and my tongue inflamed. So I think, any die-hard fans out there, there's a few hours of playing where I sound a bit lispy, that's because of that. So I apologise."</p>

<p>As such, fans hope he is still working on the game, despite the apparent changes in quality.</p>
<p>That said, a representative for Bailey told <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-jonathan-bailey-graha-tia-voice-recast-2000654279">Kotaku</a> he "won't be commenting or participating in any interviews regarding Final Fantasy 14" at this time. Square Enix has not responded to Eurogamer's request for comment.</p>
<p>What is clear is the size of the role of G'raha Tia has certainly reduced since the highs of Shadowbringers, though whether that's due to Bailey or simply storytelling is unknown. Indeed, one criticism of latest expansion Dawntrail is that multiple popular characters don't receive enough screen time.</p>
<p>"With regards to the Scions playing a more active role only later on in the story, truth be told this is something I intentionally wanted to try out," director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">Naoki Yoshida told me last year</a>.</p>
<p>"I do understand there are people who always want the Scions to be at the centre of the story, but at the same time there are people who are also requesting something new instead. So it was a conscious effort on my part to experiment and see how the balance would play out."</p>
<p>It remains to be seen, then, whether G'raha Tia or other popular characters could be written out of the game in future. No doubt we'll get answers at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-fan-fest-dates-announced-so-when-is-the-next-expansion-due">Fan Fest events next year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The indie game scene is where you will always find the more experimental titles that big publishers may not feel comfortable funding. It is such a vibrant scene that allows smaller teams and individuals to really go all out. There were a number of outstanding independent games released in 2025, and it was tough to decide on a top three, especially with how muddy the waters can be when trying to determine what counts as “indie” and not, but having made our decision, it’s time to lick the stamp and send it.</p>

<p>After coming up as runner up in our Best Narrative Award, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dispatch">Dispatch</a> has taken the crown to be the best Independent game of 2025. It blends great classic Telltale like storytelling with an excellent visual presentation, and fun superhero management gameplay. AdHoc Studio’s debut title has managed to set a new bar for episodic games, the likes of which we have really not seen for years.</p>


<p>Dispatch manages to take a rather normal segments of life, office politics and a dispatcher job, and turn them on their heads to provide a fun spin. Office politics are a lot harder to handle when you are dealing with beings that could cause you all sorts of problems without breaking a sweat. AdHoc has managed something many studios have struggled to do in the past, and that is balance fun gameplay with a great story, and a memorable look.</p>
<h3>Hades II – Runner Up</h3>
<p>It would be remiss of us not to have the sequel to our Best Independent Game 2020 winner as part of this list. While it can be argued that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hades-ii">Hades II</a> does not quite meet the same heights as the original Hades, very few games could do that. What we have in Hades II is a stellar sequel which saw resource gathering, new people to meet, two separate paths, and a more mechanically involved combat system all added to expand the system.</p>

<p>Hades II also brought us a new protagonist, Melinoe, and a story which sees the Titans declare war on Mount Olympus. Everything is absolutely solid in Hades II and it is only that the story was slightly less engaging than the original for why this has game has not climbed to the top of our Best Independent mountain. Hades II didn’t beat what many consider the perfect game, but it came near close to matching its predecessor.</p>
<h3>Ball X Pit – Runner Up</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ball-x-pit">Ball X Pit</a> is what you would call a mad mashup of ideas that works really well. Developed by Kenny Sun and some friends, it takes brick breaking, base building, and ball attacks to mix it all up into one of the most entertaining roguelikes of the year. It is a fast paced and intense experience with balls flying everywhere as you fight off waves of monsters. Balls can be fused to make new ball loadouts that have various effects, and you also need to rebuild Ballbylon so you can get even more power ups in your fight to beat the monsters.</p>
<p>Ball X Pit is a game that is very hard to put down once you have started your run, the action and need for quick thinking definitely grabbing your attention. Add in the colourful and bold action on the screen with the engrossing gameplay, Ball X Pit is an indie game that has captured a huge audience that just want to unload their balls.</p>

            <p>The nights are heavy, the sun is frail. The mountain moans its hunger. The rivers are frozen scars and the trees are become hard flashes of black lightning. Bells haunt the wind and peculiar bearded men appear in the fireplaces, to be chased away with pies and brandy. The roses, strangely, are in bloom. 
</p>
<p>Put on your slippers. Stoke the embers. Pull up a chair. It is time to remember. It is time to renew. It is time to succumb to a growing addiction. It is time… to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skeal">Skeal</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>If you’ve played Skeal with us before, there is no need for further words - here’s a link to the <a href="https://whymog.itch.io/skeal-webgl-version">browser version</a>. If you’ve yet to play Skeal, further words will only spoil things. Go on, it’s free.
</p>
<p>Playing Skeal has been an RPS wintermas tradition since Alice O <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skeal-free-skiing-game">declared it so in 2017</a>. After Alice O returned to the sea in 2024 - rumour has it she may indeed now live in a greying tower - Graham <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-almost-christmas-which-means-its-time-to-play-skeal">took up the torch</a>. Now Graham is gone, and I continue the tradition in their stead. Am I making you sad? Excellent – this is the appropriate mood in which to play Skeal. But it’s the good kind of sadness, the sadness of release, the sadness of… truly terrible puns.

<p>Skeal is sort of a lesson in how you can transform a slight cringe into a teary-eyed guffaw by dragging out the punchline and committing to it whole-heartedly. It shouldn’t make me bawl but it does. I am going to get my sister’s partner to play it this holiday. He’s approximately the same age as me and I’m pretty sure this will make him weep too.</p><p>Then I will show it to my nephew, who will look at me like I’ve just offered to feed him a bowl of toothpaste. The key thing is that emotions will be had. I hope Skeal makes you have emotions too.
</p>
<p>Once more with feeling: Skeal is the work of Nick Cummings, who also makes games about <a href="https://www.whymog.net/games">laundry separation, hermit crabs and racoonomics</a>. St Nick, we should call him. Merry Decemberween all.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[HP Drops a 5-Star Laptop by 70% and Throws in $199 Worth of Accessories, Only on Amazon Not the Official Site]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-drops-a-5-star-laptop-by-70-and-throws-in-199-worth-of-accessories-only-on-amazon-not-the-official-site-2000654786</link>
            <guid>1388260</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is making it easier than ever to grab a new laptop without breaking the bank. We’re spotting plenty of amazing deals on a wide range of machines from popular brands like HP, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, and even Apple – basically, there’s something for everyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/">One of our favorite discounts, however, is this 70% drop on the 15.6-inch HP touchscreen laptop, which brings the overall price down to just $650, but that’s not all.</a> You’re also getting a 6-in-1 accessory bundle worth almost $200 with your purchase for free, which adds even more value to the offer. This deal applies to the stunning moonlight blue version, which gives off a premium, sleek look. Just note that the discount wraps up soon, so it’s best to grab it before the price shoots back up to $2,200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Power</h2>
<p>You’re greeted with a stunning 15.6-inch Full HD display upon opening the laptop. The screen features an ultra-thin 6.5 mm micro-edge bezel for a bigger viewing area, while the anti-glare coating keeps the visuals easy on your eyes. Touch support takes this a bit further by making navigation a breeze. You won’t have to rely on the trackpad or the mouse solely to get things done. Need to scroll a long document? Just use your fingers directly on the screen. The included touchscreen pen also makes it quite easy to swipe, draw, sketch, and even type!</p>
<p>The screen is paired with a full-sized keyboard, alongside a dedicated numeric keypad, which is quite comfortable to use. It provides your wrist with the support it needs for jotting down long documents, plus includes a dedicated Copilot key that launches the helpful AI assistant instantly. There’s also a built-in webcam, with integrated microphones for convenient video calls.</p>



<p>Power comes from the combination of an Intel Core i3-N305 processor and a modest 16GB RAM. Together, these let you push through busy, productive days with ease, regardless of the task at hand. The 1TB SSD, on the other hand, offers ample space to store all your important documents and files in a single place, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>Battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge offers over 9 hours of use, which means you can go an entire workday without worrying about running out of power. Recharging is fast too, so you won’t have to stay tethered to an outlet for long when running low. And finally, the free accessory bundle includes a touchscreen pen, a 128GB thumb drive, a laptop bag, a cleaning cloth, a camera protector, dust plugs, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed. That’s everything you need to get started with work and entertainment, right away, and you’re basically getting far more than just a direct discount with this deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/">This laptop is currently down to just $650 at Amazon, which is practically nothing for a device this packed.</a> This is the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, but the offer won’t be around for long. Grab it while there’s still time, as it could wrap up any moment now. Once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back at this price anytime soon.</p>

                <p>It's almost the end of 2025, and in the spirit of Spotify Wrapped, several big companies have invited subscribers to review their last year of activity. Sony got the ball rolling with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-2025-wrap-up-see-how-much-you-played-this-year/1100-6536799/">PlayStation Wrap-Up</a>, Steam offers a similar annual roundup, and the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1999147161989128217" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Year in Review recap</a> has been announced for early next year--but where is Xbox in the middle of all this?</p><p>While it doesn't offer an Xbox wrap-up every year, it still feels odd for Microsoft's gaming brand to skip 2025. The year has seen several high-profile releases from the company and the launch of an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC alongside Asus, but according to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-not-doing-an-xbox-wrapped-this-year-but-does-have-big-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft is allocating its marketing budget toward celebrating several major anniversaries in 2026.</p><p>The Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, Blizzard has its 35th anniversary to look forward to, and Bethesda is turning 40. Those are several significant milestones in proximity to each other, and it's a safe bet that Microsoft wants to accommodate them, possibly explaining the lack of an Xbox Wrapped this year. On top of that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2026-tickets-go-on-sale-soon-heres-how-much-theyll-cost/1100-6535959/">we'll see the return of BlizzCon in September</a>, and Blizzard has teased its "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-biggest-year-yet-coming-in-2026-for-35th-anniversary-president-says/1100-6537061/">biggest year yet</a>" for 2026.</p><p>Outside of Microsoft, several other gaming franchises will also have plenty of reasons to celebrate. The 30th anniversary of Pokemon is next year, Sonic the Hedgehog turns 35, and both The Legend of Zelda and Castlevania will reach the 40th anniversary milestone in 2026.</p><p>We have contacted Xbox to find out if there are any plans for a year-in-review wrap-up, and will update this article as soon as we hear back.</p>

		<p>Slavic Magic has released a major new update for Manor Lords, its medieval strategy game, with the update adding a new option to choose starting locations, new maps, new buildings and jobs associated with them, ladder climbing for units, and a whole host of changes for resources. Additionally, policies have been removed temporarily from Manor Lords as they require additional development time. You can check out the full list of changes below.</p>

<li><b>Environment Types</b>: Each Region is divided by area into multiple Environment Types: (Meadow, Woodland, Farmland, Urban, Rural).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Building Affinities</b>: Different buildings can have Affinities with different Environment Types, for instance, the Animal Pen has a “Pannage” Affinity which decreases the time to yield for Pig Pens relative to the Woodland area.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Maintenance System:</b><br>
<wbr></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Workplace Maintenance</b>: A lot of workplaces now must be maintained by delivering resources to function properly.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Failure Risks</b>: Failure to maintain a building can result in various risks, such as collapse for mines, injury and even a minor death chance.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Rate Tuning</b>: You can tune a workplace’s level of maintenance, affecting Labor Speed.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Yield System:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Yield Definition</b>: Yield is a measure of how much your workplace produces. Various buildings use different timespans and benchmark values depending on their nature.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Yield Influencers</b>: Yield can be affected by Labor Speed, Efficiency, and Productivity.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Labor Speed</b>: Labor Speed measures how fast your workers perform workplace related tasks.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Efficiency</b>: Efficiency measures how much output you get per input when crafting, per plant when farming or per passive income cycle, depending on the production type. High Efficiency means your Gardens will produce more Vegetables and your Crafting tasks may produce extra items.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Productivity</b>: Productivity is a measure of your logistics: transport and labor times vs idle times, sickness, extension work and militia assignments.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Approval Rework:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Memory Weight Shift</b>: Approval memory weight was shifted to dramatically favor current events versus past events.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Approval Tiers</b>: There are now 7 approval Tiers. Landing in a specific Approval Tier will give various penalties and bonuses to growth, influence, income among others.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Food Resource Rework:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Food Categories</b>:All foods now fit within food categories; Foraged Goods, Meats, Fishes, Vegetables, Grains and Animal Produce.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Burgage Plot Requirement overhaul</b>: Burgage Plots now require a variety of foods from different categories, encouraging more diverse variety as they upgrade.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Vegetables</b>: Vegetables resource was split into Cabbages, Carrots and Beetroots.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Orchards</b>: In addition to Apples, Pears and Quinces were added as new Orchard options.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Meats</b>: Meat was divided into: Mutton, Chevon, Pork, Beef, Chicken, Small Game, and is produced by their respective animals accordingly.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Fish</b>: Fish was divided into Carp (from ponds) and Eel (from rivers).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>New Food:</b>&nbsp;Milk is passively produced by Goats for the Animal Produce category.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Wild Animals</b>: Deer were replaced by Small Game since it’s more plausible in historical terms. Small Game also yields Pelts, which is an early trade commodity.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Foraged Goods</b>: Alongside Berries, Mushrooms have been reintroduced as a Foraged Good.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Honey</b>: Honey is no longer consumed. It is intended for use in a future update, but for now can be sold, while the Apiary Extension boosts the yield of Farms and Orchards through the Pollination Affinity.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Regional Development System Rework:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Development Perks</b>: To a lot of players, the development tree was a weak point of the game and described as immersion breaking. Therefore, a new, more grounded system of Development Perks has been introduced. The player will now face more realistic choices at each settlement level and those choices reflect the settlement development stage.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Perk Design</b>: The perks are also designed to be more nuanced from a game design perspective so that choices are less immediately obvious, but compound into strong specializations over time.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Rollout Status</b>: Since it’s still in progress, only the first batch of perks (Origins) is available.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Policies</b>: Policies are temporarily removed (still undergoing rework).<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>General:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Removed a lot of chance based mechanics in favor of more deterministic calculations to make yield balance more predictable (this includes farming and mining which used to be chance based).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Yields are more linear as Orchard Trees and Field Crops mature.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Moved consumption &amp; approval data to the Family structure instead of storing it on husbands (this was a temporary workaround to represent per family consumption and approval effects).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Since individual villagers no longer have a consumption update, we also moved the disease data to the Family structure. As a side effect, whole families will now get sick together.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Fishing nodes often spawn in rivers now (allowing river fishing).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Streams now use the river system and therefore will spawn small bridges.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added a new Elevation overlay for use with Farming and Livestock.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Replaced the Brewery extension placeholder.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added an additional road to Wirnitz in Germanic Valley<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added an extra hard cap for storage distribution limits, eg. if a stall has 21 items for some reason but only 20 storage space, the extra item will not count as supply.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Quality of Life Improvements:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a “Protect Resource Area” checkbox for the Logging Camp and Firewood Cutter which makes workers automatically avoid deforestation near vulnerable resources.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Worker families assigned to a building being upgraded will now participate in the construction.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Oxen transporting Timber for construction will get the nearest log instead of nearest on the ground before from buildings.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Oxen transporting Timber will now prioritize delivering to a target near where the Timber is picked up.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Blocked sons with jobs from refueling the home if there is a female family member without any task that can do it instead.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Workplace animals will now be assigned a home as close as possible to the workplace.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When debranching a tree, Workers will always pick the one closest to them.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When cutting down a tree, Workers will pick the nearest one, unless too far away from the Logging Camp.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Changed order of goods produced for Blacksmith and Joiner to list Spears and Large shields first.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Artisans will start producing the first listed good when their workshop is built.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Trading Post Workers will now only use Horses that are assigned to their Trading Post (Horses are automatically assigned when they arrive).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Due to tester feedback, storage building workers supply their Stalls from their own Storehouse/Granary only.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When taking care of the dead, bodies will now be moved to the nearest Corpse Pit or Church.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Manor Specific:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Manors no longer have families living in them (since Manors aren’t residential and can’t fulfil requirements it was always a bit weird).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When castle modules are placed on a wall, they will split the wall and snap the walls to edges instead of clipping with the module.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added an option to join 2 walls into 1 after you snap their ends together.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added missing wall snapping points to the outer towers.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When rotating a module, the attached walls should now stay attached. The rotation is limited if a module has wall connections.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Castle modules now collide with each other when placing in order to avoid building areas impossible for pathfinding and reduce clipping.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Adjustments:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Deprecated some jobs since they no longer were fitting the game design: Removed Dye and Dyer in their previous implementation. Removed Firewood Cart and Food Cart.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Cloaks are removed, instead, there are two recipes for producing Clothes – either from Wool or from Linen.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Apiary is now a backyard extension. Wax is now produced every third cycle from an Apiary.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Removed the “Fence up” Upgrade from fields since it’s a leftover of the previous development tree and doesn’t quite fit anymore.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Temporary removal of the “Force Early Harvest” button in the Farmhouse.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Granary workers no longer supply Windmills since it was inconsistent with all the other workplaces needing to get their own crafting resources.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Pigs, Goats and hunting hounds no longer use the livestock order timer the Oxen/Mules/Horses do.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Technical:</b><br>

<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Burgage Plots &amp; Families:</b><wbr></p>

            <guid>1388236</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Vancouver-based game developer <strong>The Coalition</strong> is working hard (<a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the help of Polish developer People Can Fly</a>) to complete <strong>Gears of War: E-Day</strong>, its first new game since 2019's Gears 5, for the planned 2026 launch. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> to the public during the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024, but the studio has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-has-been-in-active-development-for-over-five-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actively on it for nearly six years at this point</a>. </p>



<p>Granted, the team also had other projects, such as supporting Splash Damage on Gears Tactics, 343 Industries on Halo Infinite, and Epic Games on The Matrix Awakens and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-the-coalition-unreal-engine-5-xbox-series-x-alpha-point-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alpha Point Unreal Engine 5 demo</a>. This year, The Coalition launched Gears of War: Reloaded, a remaster of the first installment in the third-person shooter series and the first franchise entry to launch on Sony's PlayStation 5 consoles.</p>



<p>But it's with Gears of War: E-Day that The Coalition truly aims to make an impact. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/18/xbox-bethesda-blizzard-activision-king-2025-games-thank-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to the Xbox Wire blog</a> as part of a larger end-of-the-year interview with developers from the Xbox, Bethesda, and Activision Blizzard King divisions, they stated:</p>



<p><em>Next year marks the 20th anniversary of Gears of War, and we can’t think of a bigger way to celebrate than with the release of Gears of War: E-Day. This is our most ambitious game yet, entirely built from scratch in Unreal Engine 5 to feel like Gears and play like new. This is a return to our roots as Marcus &amp; Dom face the Locust for the first time ever. It’s the best place to jump into the Gears universe and we can’t wait to share more next year.</em></p>



<p>It is unclear what metric they are considering for this particular claim. We know that E-Day will be more linear than Gears 5, which included open-ended exploration areas and some side content, so they are unlikely to be referring to scope. Perhaps it's merely a reference to an increased budget. </p>



<p>Anyway, Gears of War: E-Day will be an origin story set fourteen years before the first Gears game, on Emergence Day, when the Locust Horde first emerged from its underground tunnels to overwhelm the surface world of the planet Sera. Despite Gears of War: Reloaded's launch on PlayStation 5, E-Day is currently only announced for PC and Xbox Series S and X.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-breaks-its-pricing-rules-on-the-clip-5-speaker-basically-giving-it-away-as-a-christmas-deal-2000654316</link>
            <guid>1388233</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A quality Bluetooth speaker is a must-have for pretty much everyone. Whether you’re spending time with friends at the park or tackling household chores, a portable speaker can completely set the mood. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/">The JBL Clip 5 is the ideal companion for any situation where you’d want to reach for a Bluetooth speaker, and right now, you can grab it at a 25% discount on Amazon.</a> Originally priced at $80, the JBL Clip 5 is now available for just $60. With powerful sound, a durable design, and a range of stylish color options, it’s a high-quality option for music lovers on the move.</p>
<p>The JBL Clip 5 delivers powerful, clear sound with deep bass, no matter where you take it. Whether you’re at the beach, by the pool, or on a hike, this portable speaker ensures your music stays crisp and vibrant. It’s built with an IP67 rating, meaning it is both waterproof and dustproof. So whether you’re caught in a rainstorm or accidentally drop it in the sand, the JBL Clip 5 is made to withstand the elements. The rugged exterior combines durable fabric with rubber, ensuring the speaker can handle the outdoors and a bit of rough treatment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portability at Its Finest</h2>
<p>The “Clip” in JBL Clip 5 isn’t just a name. The whole design is built around it. The speaker includes an integrated carabiner clip. While the speaker itself is compact and easy to carry, the clip allows you to securely attach it to your bag or belt loop. Once you’re at your destination, the clip can be used to fasten it to your beach chair or whatever else, making sure your music is always within reach and ready to go.</p>
<p>A portable speaker isn’t much good if the battery runs out halfway through a playlist. Fortunately, the JBL Clip 5 offers impressive battery life, delivering up to 12 hours of playtime on a single charge. And if you need a little extra time, you can activate the Playtime Boost feature, which prioritizes power and gives you up to three additional hours of listening time—bringing the total playtime to 15 hours. With this extended battery life, the JBL Clip 5 is equipped to last through a full day of adventure or relaxation alike.</p>



<p>JBL speakers are known for their stylish and vibrant designs, and the JBL Clip 5 continues that tradition. Beyond just the classic color options like black and white, the JBL Clip 5 offers a variety of fun and bold choices. You can opt for a sleek black-and-orange combination or choose a playful pink-and-blue, sand-and-green, or solid blue, purple, or red color schemes. For those who prefer something a bit edgier, there’s even a camouflage “squad” pattern. Just make sure not to set it down in the grass. You’ll never find it again.</p>
<p>As a JBL speaker, the JBL Clip 5 is equipped with Auracast. This lets you pair two or more Auracast-enabled speakers together, synchronized to the same audio, to create even bigger sound. It’s great for having a party, and making sure the same music is playing throughout different rooms of the house or both inside and outside in the backyard.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Nintendo Switch 2 Just Got Another Last-Minute Discount]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-just-got-another-last-minute-discount-2000654829</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re in the market for <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-better-tech-enshitification-google-review-1851784417">a Nintendo Switch 2</a> and live close to a Microcenter, you’re in luck. The PC store chain currently has the console marked down to just $400 in a surprise last-minute discount for the most popular new gaming hardware of the year.</p> <p>Microcenter is <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/695288/nintendo-switch-2-console">currently advertising</a> the console at $50 off it’s regular sticker price. Not bad for the Switch 2’s first holiday. The catch is that you have to actually go to Microcenter to get it, however. There’s no shipping, so you either need to live close or drive far. The store closest to me says it has 25 unit in stock as of this writing, though it’s not clear how long the discount will be in effect.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo Switch 2 is $399.99 at Micro Center (in-stores) <a href="https://t.co/Jw6BrF6Ufj">https://t.co/Jw6BrF6Ufj</a> <a href="https://t.co/SpmMKtmVIx">pic.twitter.com/SpmMKtmVIx</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/2001655303683678709?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s worth noting that this is only for the standalone console, not the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. If you were planning on also buying that game, which costs an additional $80, you’d basically only be saving $20 off the normal bundle price. Still something, but not as good as the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle discounted to $450 that <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sale-cyber-monday-mario-kart-world-walmart-amazon-2000649232">Walmart and some other stores</a> were selling earlier this month.</p> <p>Any savings on a new console, especially one that’s sold as well as the Switch 2 in its first year, comes as a nice surprise. It’s also been an unexpectedly tough holiday season for new console sales. Circana recently reported that only <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196">1.6 million units were sold in November</a> across Switch 2, Switch 1, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, making it the worst pre-holiday sales month for gaming hardware since 1995. That’s because even with Black Friday discounts, the average cost of a new console keeps going up.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Mintrocket has revealed more on the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> DLC In The Jungle in its latest vlog, including new locations, gameplay, and mechanics.</p>
<p>The DLC was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-in-the-jungle-announced">first teased at last year's The Game Awards</a> show, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-delays-in-the-jungle-dlc-but-sure-knows-how-to-soften-the-blow-with-these-other-announcements">back in June it was delayed until 2026</a>. It's still without a firm release date, but we now know more about what's included in its 10 hour runtime.</p>
<p>First up is the jungle village of Utara. Here, time flows in real-time, and Dave can spend time befriending villagers, gathering resources, and completing quests, all presented in an isometric view. It all sounds very Animal Crossing.</p>

<p>That view also lends itself to the new restaurant, the Bancho Grill. Rather than the fixed horizontal movement of the base game, Dave will be able to freely manoeuvre around this restaurant, with befriended villagers rocking up to eat.</p>
<p>And it's a grill rather than a sushi restaurant this time, as freshwater lake aquatic life requires cooking before eating.</p>
<p>As for the lake, expect plenty of dangers like piranhas and crocodiles, as well as tasty fish. Dave will be equipped with a new Jungle Gun that can freely transform between net guns, shotguns, snipers, and more, which should make underwater combat a little more flexible.</p>

<p>In all, it's looking like a substantial extension of the base game that sees Mintrocket experimenting with gameplay and minigames alike.</p>
<p>Dave the Diver is also heading to mobile devices next year, launching first in China and then globally. It will be fully optimised for the platform, with appropriate controls too.</p>
<p>It follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-finally-arrives-on-xbox-series-xs-two-years-after-making-a-splash-on-pc">release of the game on Xbox last month</a>, announced at the Xbox Partner Preview, meaning the game is now available across PC (Steam, Epic), PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch consoles.</p>

<p>Back on dry land</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It was almost exactly a year ago that we first heard about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a>'s 'In the Jungle' DLC at The Game Awards 2024. We got a brief look at the expansion in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/dave-the-diver-in-the-jungle-dlc-swims-onto-switch-in-2026">November Xbox Showcase</a>, but today, developer MINTROCKET has fully lifted the lid on what we can expect.</p>
<p>In a new 'Dev Dive' video, the team gives us our best look yet at the upcoming DLC, which apparently adds roughly 10 hours of gameplay to the already beefy base game.</p>
<p>We get to see the jungle village of Utara, complete with its own real-time day/night cycle, where Dave can converse with the locals, freely dive into the freshwater lake, and gather resources. It still feels a bit strange to see Dave move in a 3D plane, but the whole thing looks really rather sweet. This locale is also home to Bancho's Grill, a new restaurant to keep everyone happy.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us a closer look at Dave's new diving spot, and his fresh transforming 'Jungle Gun' weapon to fend off the beasties therein.</p>

<p>It promises to be quite the expansion when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 at some point next year. MINTROCKET still hasn't shared a precise date, but we'll be keeping an eye out over the coming months for more information.</p>

		<p>Mintrocket has released a new developer diary to mark the end of the 2025, with game director Jaeho Hwang giving details on what has been happening at the studio and what to expect going forward. We get a look at Mintrocket’s new office, but the main area of concentration is Dave The Diver’s Into The Jungle DLC which is due out in early 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Latest In the Jungle DLC News, 2025 Recaps &amp; More! | DEV DIVE" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E5_pWDFRca0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dave The Diver Into The Jungle is expected to have around 10 hours of new content for players to experience in the jungle village of Utara. Here Dave can spend his day helping villagers with their requests, or gathering fruit and minerals. If that doesn’t take Dave’s fancy there’s a new restaurant to visit that is run by Bancho. Here Dave can help serve multiple customers, with these customers being people Dave has built relationships with. The restaurant is not called Bancho Sushi, as the fish in the freshwater lake cannot be served like that, so instead the restaurant is Bancho Grill.</p>
<p>When Dave The Diver goes diving in the jungle lake he will have to watch out for threats like crocodile, catfish, electric eels, and piranhas. However, Dave is not an easy snack for these predators as he comes armed with the new Jungle Gun, which has multiple forms including shotgun, netgun, sniper rifle, and a regular gun depending on the danger. On land, Dave can wander the jungle with friends and experience different jungle themed minigames including what seems to be a guitar hero style rhythm game. In addition, there has been confirmation there will be guest characters from other games in the Into The Jungle DLC, but Mintrocket has not said who.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Mintrocket has announced it has partnered with XD to bring Dave The Diver to mobile devices. The mobile version is not going to be a straight port of Dave The Diver, with the UI and controls redesigned for the mobile experience. Dave The Diver Mobile will be released in China first with a global release to follow soon afterwards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you haven't heard of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lorns-lure-review-call-of-void" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Lorn's Lure</em></a><em>, </em>you're about to learn something today. One way to describe it is one of 2024's best indie games. Another is to say it's this amazing, somewhat niche, experimental, and ominously beautiful first-person <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/platformer/games" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">platformer</a> that takes place within a mysterious megastructure. It even has a brand-new DLC with <em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em>.</p><p>The main game is inspired by my favorite manga author, Tsutomi Nihei, who is a master of his craft. He puts his architecture background to incredible use and illustrates these haunting, gigantic structures filled with unfathomable secrets.&nbsp;</p><p>While <em>Lorn's Lure</em> already took some inspiration from Nihei, I was very intrigued to try out one particular map in this collection, called "Blame." It's the name of Nihei's most famous work, <em>Blame!</em>, so I knew this was going to be something special to me. Besides that, we have four other maps with a central "parkour" theme that are sure to keep your attention for a good few hours.</p><p>With five different maps offering five different experiences, I'm going to go against the grain and rate every level on its own merits with a handful of "mini-reviews" with their own number ratings, then we'll average those numbers up and see what we get for the whole package.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The<em> Blame!</em> vibes are strong here.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Blame is the closest we get to an additional <em>Lorn's Lure</em> chapter. It's roughly the same length as a story chapter and focuses on exploration rather than speed. Mechanically, players are given just a few upgrades, so you don't have a double-jump or grapple at your disposal. This one is purely about the vibes, and that's what made me fall in love with <em>Lorn's Lure</em> in the first place.</p><p>Elements from the <em>Blame! </em>manga are perhaps more overt here than any other chapter, with concrete, drab megastructures looming in the distance, leading into areas with unknown technology, pipes (Nihei loves to draw his intricate network of pipes, after all), and castle-like buttresses and towers.</p><figure role="group">

<p>This would make an excellent addition to the story of <em>Lorn's Lure</em> were it not a part of the <em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack. </em>While it's not the most difficult or intense chapter, it does what <em>Lorn's Lure</em> does best, instilling a sense of awe at the sheer scale of the world compared to tiny ol' you.</p><p>Final Verdict: 9/10</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Nothing else to do but jump.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - Fall</h2><p>Fall is a quick, intense experience in <em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em>. You're descending a giant pit, all the way to the bottom. <em>Lorn's Lure</em> mechanics dictate that falling too fast will result in your death as soon as you hit the ground, so the name of the game here is to take a measured approach.</p><p>You're equipped with a grapple, so Fall becomes quite an exciting experience when you're able to utilize this tool. The physics for the grapple are fantastic, so you end up feeling like Spider-Man, trying his best not to fall too hard while also rushing to the finish to get a high score.</p><figure role="group">

  </picture>
<figcaption>Make use of that grapple, or you're cooked.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is one of the shortest maps in the pack, but there's a decent variety of obstacles given that it's a completely vertical map. It can also be a bit challenging, even for someone like me who likes to take things safe, slow, and steady.</p><p>Final Verdict: 7.5/10</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Sheesh, where to even begin when you only have a single checkpoint to start?</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - ProcGenV1</h2><p>ProcGenV1 is a very experimental map in this collection, but definitely one of the highlights of <em>Parkour Pack</em>'s offerings. As the name implies, it's a procedurally generated experience. There are, in essence, unlimited possibilities in ProcGenV1, as it creates a large environment of megastructures to explore.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of this map is to find the "extraction hut," which finishes the level. The environment is filled with various other huts high and low, and most have an arrow pointing to the actual extraction hut. Huts have items that players can use at their disposal to aid in their adventure, adding a nice twist on the simplistic platforming of <em>Lorn's Lure</em>.</p><p>Items include a stamina boost, boots to increase your jumping abilities, a one-time use grapple (refillable if you find more), and a checkpoint USB. In the main game of <em>Lorn's Lure</em>, checkpoints are aplenty, but with them being so scarce in ProcGenV1, you're encouraged to be methodical and only take risks when it's absolutely necessary.</p><figure role="group">

  </picture>
<figcaption>The arrow is just vague enough to still be challenging, especially when a level is as big as this.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'm just amazed by the complexity of environments created in ProcGenV1. They are a little drab in appearance, but as I understand it, Rubeki Games will update this with new features every once in a while. I see a great deal of potential in ProcGenV1 evolving into something amazing; for now, it could use more variation in appearance and perhaps more items.</p><p>There's also a really pesky mechanic where some items are poisoned, and that decreases your stamina by a large amount for several minutes. Because of the way these levels are generated, you usually never have enough stamina to go anywhere when it's so low, so I usually waited it out until the poison debuff was removed.&nbsp;</p><p>Final Verdict: 8.5/10</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The closest I'll ever get to doing parkour in my life is through <em>Lorn's Lure</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - Rubeki's Pro Traceur</h2><p>Rubeki's Pro Traceur is a beautiful parkour-based map that replaces <em>Lorn's Lure</em>'s megastructures with a small urban environment. Resembling that of a European city, this map touts itself as a "parkour sandbox."&nbsp;</p><p>The main objective of this map is to gather all the crystals. It seems to take inspiration from <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> in particular, with its Delfino Plaza-esque visuals and vibes. Your objective is to gather all the crystals on this map, of which there are 25.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

  </picture>
<figcaption>What a nice view!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Buildings are close together to create narrow alleys to bounce around on. Crystals at the top of the building are quite difficult to reach, especially when you're stripped of your usual climbing tools. I ran into an issue where I was given the option to pick up climbing tools right from the start, but I don't think that was intentional since it largely strips the map of any sort of difficulty.&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, Rubeki's Pro Traceur is fine for what it is. It's short and doesn't try to be anything but a little sandbox to give players the ability to flex their platforming skills. It's far from the slower, exploration-based platforming that I prefer, but it's still worth one play.&nbsp;</p><p>Final Verdict: 7/10</p><figure role="group">

  </picture>
<figcaption>Gotta go fast, but also, I'm too scared to.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - Sonic</h2><p>The idea behind Sonic is to create a high-speed obstacle course for players, with devastating consequences for failure. It's a somewhat linear track that hangs high above in a megastructure, so if you fall, you're going right back to the start. The twist here is that you're given super speed, so it's actually very challenging to deal with this newfound mobility.</p><p>You don't have any tools at your disposal other than this speed. Unfortunately, there was one obstacle near the start that, try as I might, I couldn't find how to overcome. I didn't get a real chance to experience this one, so I'll just admit defeat and say this level wasn't for me (especially since I prefer the slower, methodical gameplay as opposed to speed). While I won't give it a final score since I didn't complete it, I know this one isn't for me.</p><p>Final Verdict: N/A</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p>While Blame and ProcGenV1 are the main appeal here, there's something for fans of speedier gameplay in Sonic, Rubeki's Pro Traceur, and Fall. All-in-all, it's a nice little package to give fans more <em>Lorn's Lure</em> content, but what I'm <em>especially</em> interested in is seeing how ProcGenV1 develops in the future.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em><strong>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</strong> was reviewed on PC using a code provided by the developer over the course of 5 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Asus Goes Wild on 32″ 4K OLED 240Hz Gaming Monitor, Now Selling $400 Cheaper at Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-goes-wild-on-32-4k-oled-240hz-gaming-monitor-now-selling-400-cheaper-at-record-low-2000654822</link>
            <guid>1388191</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>High-end gaming monitors usually force you to pick your poison: blazing fast refresh rates with washed-out colors, or stunning image quality with sluggish response times that get you killed in competitive matches. Asus cracked that compromise with the <strong>ROG Swift PG32UCDM, a 32-inch beast that combines true 4K resolution, QD-OLED panel technology, a 0.03ms gray-to-gray response time,&nbsp; and a blistering 240Hz refresh rate</strong> in one package. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6526/">just slashed this monitor to $899 from its usual $1,299, marking an all-time-low that makes premium OLED gaming</a> a lot more accessible. Order today and you’ll have it sitting on your desk before Christmas, ready to transform how games actually look and feel when you’re playing them.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6526/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>QD-OLED Technology</h2>
<p>The quantum dot OLED panel <strong>makes perfect blacks</strong> because each pixel makes its own light and can turn off completely which makes for infinite contrast that LCD panels can’t match. In dark game scenes, you’ll see this right away when shadows show hidden details instead of turning into gray blobs. With 99% DCI-P3 coverage and true 10-bit color depth, colors pop off the screen.</p>



<p>The <strong>32-inch size is just right because 4K resolution</strong> makes things look sharper than 1440p without making UI elements too small to read. You can sit at a normal desk distance and still see the pixels clearly without having to move your head to see the corners. The text stays clear for work, and the 16:9 aspect ratio works well with almost all games and apps without black bars or stretching.</p>
<p>The <strong>240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms gray-to-gray response time</strong> work together to make motion look clear, which makes 60Hz monitors feel like watching slideshows. Fast-paced shooters show enemy movements with no blur and give you the split-second edge you need to get headshots before your opponents even know you’re there. You can see apex markers and read road textures at speeds where other displays turn everything into smeared streaks.</p>



<p>Asus made a<strong> custom heatsink with a new airflow design and a graphene film backing to keep the OLED panels cool</strong> while they work. This cooling system greatly lowers the chance of burn-in by keeping the panel temperature stable, even during long gaming sessions where static UI elements stay on the screen for hours. The uniform brightness setting keeps the brightness level the same across the whole display, which stops some OLED monitors from changing brightness levels when you switch between dark and bright content.</p>
<p>This monitor has the VESA DisplayHDR 400 True Black certification which means it meets strict standards for HDR performance. The peak brightness levels are high enough to make explosions and light sources stand out while keeping the perfect OLED blacks in the shadows. The matte screen surface scatters reflections without adding the grainy texture that makes images less clear on poorly made anti-glare coatings which means you can put the monitor near windows and not have to deal with glare while you play during the day.</p>
<p>The <strong>90W USB-C port can send both display signals and charge</strong> your laptop with just one cable: This keeps your desk tidy and makes it easy to dock a gaming laptop or MacBook for work. With Display Stream Compression, you can send the <strong>full 4K 240Hz signal over DisplayPort 1.4</strong>. You can <strong>also use HDMI 2.1</strong> to connect your PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X at 4K 120Hz.</p>
<p>This monitor costs $899, which is $400 less than the retail price and less than other OLED gaming displays with similar specs, which usually cost between $1,200 and $1,500. At this price, most people would settle for VA or IPS panels with poor contrast but you’re getting here flagship panel technology, enthusiast-grade refresh rates, and professional color accuracy.</p>
