			<p>Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> some big announcements for game developers at Unreal Fest Seattle 2024, revealing the new features of Unreal Engine 5 and reducing the royalty fee for games that launch on the Epic Games Store at the same time as other stores.</p>
<p>However, before all these announcements, Epic founder, CEO, and main stakeholder Tim Sweeney <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGEfQJPqW8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressed</a> the viewers with an interesting speech. First, he remarked that following <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-founder-explains-massive-layoffs-says-development-and-core-initiatives-are-unaffected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year's layoffs</a>, Epic is now solid from a financial standpoint and has registered record numbers for Fortnite and the store. Secondly, Sweeney discussed the growing importance of live service multiplayer in an increasingly complex gaming market where even big games may struggle.</p>
<p><em>I'm happy to tell you now that Epic&nbsp;is financially sound and that Fortnite and the Epic Game Store have hit new records in concurrency and success. Fortnite hit 110 million monthly active users last holiday, an all-time peak. And this is all happening in the context of a game business that's rapidly changing in a way that we've only seen a few times in our lifetimes as game developers. It's a generational change. One of the manifestations we're seeing right now is a lot of games are released with high budgets and they're not selling nearly as well as expected, whereas other games are growing incredibly strong.</em></p>
<p><em>What we're seeing, the real trend here is that players are gravitating towards the really big games where they can play with more of their friends. This is a manifestation of Metcalfe's Law, the idea that the value of a network, a game, or a social experience grows in proportion to the number of friends that you can connect to. In the world of gaming, that means you and your friends getting together and playing games, chatting by voice, attending concerts, and doing all other kinds of cool virtual things online.</em></p>
<p><em>This trend, some people will call it the metaverse. We're not all in agreement on what this means. Some people, when they hear the word metaverse, think of what Facebook is doing with VR and now AR. Some people use the metaverse to describe everything they don't like about the current Fortnite season. But when you look at what's happening in the world of Fortnite, it's new and it's exciting and it's something that's never happened at this scale in the history of entertainment, with an original story that's evolving with original content and also all the world's brands participating. Musicians reaching users, Disney and Star Wars, and others all coming together to create a world-class entertainment experience that's ever-evolving and live, and that's that's really what we think that the future of gaming is about.</em></p>
<p>While Sweeney has a point when he says that an increasing number of players value the live multiplayer experience, it's equally true that several big live service multiplayer games have disappointed badly. Examples include the likes of Crucible, Babylon's Fall, Anthem, Marvel's Avengers, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and most recently, Concord. Not even IPs as powerful as Marvel's and DC's were enough to prevent these failures.&nbsp;As such, while Epic may not be interested in making another single player game for the time being, many other developers certainly are, and they are bound to find success if they create a quality experience.</p>
<p>In other Epic news, Sweeney's company has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-has-filed-a-new-legal-complaint-against-samsung-and-google-claiming-their-auto-blocker-feature-is-anti-competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> Google and Samsung because of their auto blocker feature.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-mobile-version-in-development-at-pubg-studio.998469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton has announced that it's working on a&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>mobile adaptation, and that said adaptation will be handled by one of its most prominent studios.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-%ed%8c%b0%ec%9b%94%eb%93%9c-%eb%aa%a8%eb%b0%94%ec%9d%bc-%ea%b2%8c%ec%9e%84-%ea%b8%80%eb%a1%9c%eb%b2%8c-%eb%9d%bc%ec%9d%b4%ec%84%a0%ec%8a%a4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official Krafton website (which is in Korean; we're using machine translation), Krafton's mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>will be handled by PUBG Studios, the division responsible for developing&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</p>
<p>Krafton says its&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>mobile adaptation will "faithfully reinterpret and implement the original's main fun elements to fit the mobile environment" (again, the actual wording is likely to be a touch different, since we're using machine translation).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-mobile-announcement-player-riding-pal.jpg?itok=-f6w-90o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-mobile-announcement-player-riding-pal.jpg?itok=eMf81_b5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is making its way to mobile.</figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot we don't yet know about&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s mobile version. It sounds like Krafton will be creating a brand new version of the game rather than just porting the existing version, but beyond that, we're not sure exactly what form&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>on mobile will take.</p>
<p>We also don't know when the game will launch for mobiles, nor do we know whether it'll make it out of Krafton's native Korea or not.</p>
<p>I'm assuming it will; after all,&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-finally-dethrones-baldurs-gate-3-as-most-played-game-on-steam-deck-in-february">hugely popular game</a>, so it would seem rather foolish to restrict its mobile version to one region. Still, the game technically hasn't been announced in the West yet, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>The announcement of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>on mobile is a pretty timely one, though. Last week, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release">surprise-launched on PS5</a> following a State of Play presentation (although not in Japan, where a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">patent infringement lawsuit</a> is currently ongoing between&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair and Nintendo).</p>

<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is a creature-collecting survival game in which the goal is to survive in a world populated by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-palworld-trailers-unleash-more-unspeakable-quasi-pokemon-brutality-and-cuddles"><em>Pokemon</em>-esque creatures</a> called Pals.</p>
<p>Although the designs are certainly reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>, the gameplay is more akin to something like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>; you must build a base, battle hostile Pals, and decide whether you're going to enslave your Pals to help you build or to treat them as friends.</p>
<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is currently available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6360-PPSA23126_00-0112788005082769" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and we now know that a version of the game is also coming to mobile at some point.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Until late last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> was slated to be released in November of this year. Ubisoft subsequently made the surprise announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">the game has been delayed to early next year</a>. But according to a new report, this was far from a surprise to Ubisoft Quebec, the studio behind Shadows. The developers have reportedly been pushing for a delay for months.</p><p>Ubisoft's announcement stated that Shadows' new release date was implemented to give the developers more time to polish the gameplay, and because the company wanted to apply the lessons it learned from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/" data-ref-id="1900-6418273">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' disappointing rollout--the game has reportedly sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">only around 1 million copies thus far</a>. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inside Gaming</a>'s report states that both of those reasons are true, but adds further context by stating that, "[Assassin's Creed Shadow] is currently not at the stage it needs to be for release."</p><p>There are still adjustments to be made to fix the remaining bugs. However, the larger issues apparently revolve around the desire to shore up the historically accurate aspects of the story. One of the stated reasons for these 11th hour changes is that "historical experts were brought onto the project much later than usual for a project of this magnitude." </p><p>At least one silver lining from Ubisoft's latest moves was the decision to reverse the company's stance about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-reverses-its-steam-policy-will-launch-new-games-there-on-day-one/1100-6526711/" data-ref-id="1100-6526711">releasing new games on consoles and Steam</a> on day one. That was apparently a frequently requested change from some of Ubisoft's employees.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will hit consoles and PC on February 14, 2025.</p>

                <p>A mobile version of the popular game Palworld is in the works, with PUBG company Krafton working out a licensing deal with Pocketpair to bring the game to phones.</p><p>PUBG Studios is developing the mobile version of Palworld, though additional details were not provided in the <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ED%81%AC%EB%9E%98%ED%94%84%ED%86%A4-%ED%8C%B0%EC%9B%94%EB%93%9C-%EB%AA%A8%EB%B0%94%EC%9D%BC-%EA%B2%8C%EC%9E%84-%EA%B8%80%EB%A1%9C%EB%B2%8C-%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%EC%84%A0%EC%8A%A4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>. Following Palworld's release in January 2024, scammers quickly created fake versions of Palworld for mobile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-warns-of-mobile-game-scams/1100-6520728/" data-ref-id="1100-6520728">prompting Pocketpair to warn fans to remain vigilant. </a></p><p>The deal between Krafton and Pocketpair was announced not long after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">Nintendo sued Pocketpair over patent infringement claims.</a> Palworld had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-25-million-players-in-one-month/1100-6521294/" data-ref-id="1100-6521294">enormous success</a> when it launched on PC and Xbox earlier this year, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-launching-on-ps5-today-despite-nintendo-lawsuit/1100-6526675/" data-ref-id="1100-6526675">PS5 edition was released at the end of September.</a></p><p>Mobile is just the latest extension of Palworld, and Pocketpair doesn't plan to stop there.

One analyst believes Nintendo will prevail in its lawsuit against Pocketpair, saying he believes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-vs-palworld-why-nintendo-will-probably-win-according-to-analyst/1100-6526608/" data-ref-id="1100-6526608">because Nintendo can't stop Palworld on the basis of copyright</a>, it intends to "screw them with other things," like technical patents.</p><p>If you're just getting started with the game, be sure to read <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/guides/">GameSpot's Palworld guides to hit the ground running.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/starfield-next-dlc-constellation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-next-dlc-expansion-will-continue-constellation%E2%80%99s-storyline-%E2%80%93-rumor.998385/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-next-dlc-constellation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next Starfield DLC expansion will provide a continuation of the Constellation and Artifact storyline, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/Odah_SFA/status/1838732164310999264">@Odah_SFA</a>, the next expansion, which should be named <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">"Starborn</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,"</a> will be about the disappearance of Constellation's founder, Sebastian Banks, providing a continuation of the organization and the Artifact storyline,</span>&nbsp;which makes up much of the base game's story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">OK. So, I've heard some gossip that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starfield?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Starfield</a> 's next Expansion titled "Starborn" will be about the disappearance of Sebastian Banks, Founder of Constellation and the continuation of the Artefact story. Will post more info once I know more <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starborn?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Starborn</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bethesda?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bethesda</a></p>
<p>— Odahfield (@Odah_SFA) <a href="https://twitter.com/Odah_SFA/status/1838732164310999264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As the first Starfield story expansion, Shattered Space, has only just released, it is unlikely we will hear anything about Starborn anytime soon, so it may a while until we learn if the expansion will indeed be more tightly related to the base game's main campaign. Considering how the first expansion is more of a side story, however, it would make sense for Bethesda to go in this direction and explore more of Constellation's origins.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>With an engaging story, well-developed characters and lore, and a huge amount of meaningful content, Starfield is one of Bethesda's finest games and one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years. The lack of seamless exploration and real innovation of the typical gameplay formula from the studio are noteworthy, but those willing to forego these issues will find a reactive and sprawling sci-fi universe to lose themselves in for hundreds, if not thousands, of hours.</em></p>

Amazon said it would "evaluate" how the subscription needed to change in order to "serve the needs of our players."</p><p dir="ltr">Throne and Liberty wasn't even going to be the only MMORPG Amazon published in 2024.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-speedrunners-pounce-on-glitch-that-lets-you-beat-game-in-an-hour<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> features an eye-opening glitch that lets you teleport to the game's final boss, allowing speedrunners to beat the whole adventure in under an hour. 
</p>
<p>
The exploit, which warps protagonist Zelda to Echoes of Wisdom's final dungeon, skips the vast majority of the new Nintendo Switch game. 
</p>
<p>
Inevitably, Zelda's speedrunning community has seized on the glitch to massively boost completition times - though it is unclear how long the exploit will stick around. 
</p>
<p>
"It's now possible to [warp] from after you beat the first dungeon to the final dungeon (although it softlocks)," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/1ft6tfr/echoes_of_wisdom_game_breaking_glitch_discovered/">reddit</a> user xIceblue wrote, on a post which shows the exploit's method in detail. 
</p>
<p>
"So we found a way to [warp] to right before, fight the boss there, and proceed into the final area. That flag apparently removes the softlock, and allows us to beat the game with four hearts."
</p>
<p>
Footage posted by xIceblue, embedded below, shows the game's Echo ability being manipulated using a method that involves dropping signposts on top of trees, until multiple menus overlap on top of one another. This is clearly not intended behaviour. From here, users can open up the game's world map and simply drop Zelda down to near Echoes of Wisdom's finale.
</p>
<p>This should go without saying, but you should not watch the footage of someone warping to the game's final area if you do not wish to see the game's final area.</p>

Over on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, Zelda speedrunner <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/onakutv">Onaku</a> has already posted an "any%" completion of the game at just 52 minutes (which you can watch on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMPUrSFLQW4">YouTube</a>), but isn't stopping there. Onaku is currently streaming now, at the time of writing, and aiming to get that time even lower - at under 50 minutes.
</p>
<p>
It'll be interesting to see if this exploit lasts, or whether Nintendo patches it out in an upcoming update. 
</p>
<p>
"Thanks to playful puzzles and an imaginative reinvention of Hyrule's historic iconography, Echoes of Wisdom emerges as a bold and creative new chapter in Zelda's legend," Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-rebellious-remix-of-past-and-present">Eurogamer's The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom review</a>.

<p>Season three of Rocksteady's misfit co-op shooter arrived yesterday, 1st October, bringing new playable character Zoe Lawton with it. This season also lands players back in Gotham, but not as we have seen it before.</p>

<p>"In this Elseworld, Earth held its last stand against Brainiac in Gotham City, rather than Metropolis," read <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-of-lawless-available-october-1">season three's notes</a>. "And after it fell, Brainiac decided he had little use for the failing city, leaving it to fall into the void."</p>
<p>All of this has left rivers of lava to pour through the city, and so on. Other additions this season include new gear and a number of bug fixes.</p>
<p>However, it seems not many people are really interested in seeing this version of DC's iconic city. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/315210/charts/">SteamDB</a>, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League had a 24-hour player peak of just 248.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the time of writing, there are just 144 Steam players in the game.</p>

<p>It's no secret Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League didn't take off with the success developer Rocksteady and publisher Warner Bros. had hoped.</p>
<p>Back in February of this year, Warner Bros. Discovery's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">Rocksteady's release had "fallen short" of its expectations</a>. Warner Bros. went on to attribute a $200m revenue loss to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. A report then followed in July which stated a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">key reasons for the live-service game's failure</a>.</p>
<p>In August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flop-leads-to-41-drop-in-warner-bros-gaming-revenue">Warner Bros. reported a 41 percent fall in gaming revenue year-on-year</a> due to the "weak performance" of Suicide Squad. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">Layoffs were then confirmed at Rocksteady last month</a>, with the game's underperformance a reason for this "restructuring".</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squads-first-post-launch-season-includes-playable-elseworlds-joker">fourth season of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> still appears to be on the cards.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-not-40-percent-complete/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, it was widely reported that Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, the second entry in the series by Kojima Production, is only around 30,40 percent complete but is still targeting 2025. However, there's the chance that the development of the game could be in a more advanced state.</p>
<p>As reported by multiple users on X, it seems like the 30, 40 percent figure mentioned by Hideo Kojima during last week's Tokyo Game Show event may not be related to the actual development of the game or the Japanese voiceover recording. Kojima-san mentioned it while talking about his current work on balancing parts of the game the individual teams have done, so it could be that he is 30, 40 percent done with this balancing work rather than the entire game, which wouldn't make much sense for a game that is, at worst, only 14 months away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The headline is wrong.</p>
<p>The community note too.</p>
<p>Kojima says that he’s currently balancing the parts of the game the individual teams have done. He just says 30-40% mid sentence, whether that’s 30-40% they’ve finished, he’s finished, or how much it makes up the game isn’t clear. <a href="https://t.co/kydK2tHfvM">https://t.co/kydK2tHfvM</a> <a href="https://t.co/Fe7ku1rMUo">pic.twitter.com/Fe7ku1rMUo</a></p>

<p>In many ways, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is set to outdo the previous entry in the series in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-looks-even-crazier-than-the-first-one-in-the-new-tgs-2024-footage/">lot of different ways</a>. Not only the game's Photo Mode will be wild and will influence the story of the game in some ways, but there will also be animated in-game concerts featuring actual artists.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launches sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-trailer-state-of-play-release-window/">2025</a> on PlayStation 5. A PC version of the game has yet to be announced, though it is likely it will be released around one year after the game's debut on console.</p>

<p>Set in a medieval fantasy world of knights, goblins, and very large lads made of rock dispatched solely for the purpose of destroying other things made of rocks, Throne And Liberty’s trick is it lets you transform into beasts like fish and birds to aid with travel, or even the massive golems shown in the trailer above. My research tells me you can then smash down castle walls during massive sieges. Or, as shown in the header image, literally carry your party. That’s fun! What happens if you then do a dancing emote, I wonder? Do they all fall to their death, or simply cling on to gargantuan, boogying form?</p>
<p>The golems are a great selling point, although it seems to take a good long while to get to that point - further exacerbated by the primary flavour of player gripes at the moment, which are targeted at long queue times and microtransactions. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/throne-and-liberty-rushes-steam-charts">spotted by Ian Games</a>, some players are spending up to 45 minutes creating a character, then getting disconnected. There’s also some freshly introduced issues with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, apparently brought on by the anti-cheat. I believe James, who long ago replaced three of his favourite limbs with Steam Decks, is looking into this as we speak.</p>
<p>As for positives - and a lot of folk are clearly enjoying themselves - it’s apparently quite the looker in action, and both combat and questing are getting some compliments, too. There are also no set classes. Instead, you’ll switch roles by switching weapons. The main question I have before considering any MMO is this: is this going to be like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> where I’m having a really nice time until I have to do dungeons with other players then get really nervous about whether I’m performing my role in the party correctly? What if someone is watching the specific combination of attacks I’m using and thinks it’s stupid and suboptimal? I can’t deal with this. I can’t deal with it all. That’s not so much a question as it is a minor spiral into the depths of my fractious psyche, but that’s the MMO experience for me. Let me know if this one is a bit more chill than, uh, the famously chill FF14.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Riot Games has announced that VALORANT will move from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>The announcement was made by SVP and Head of&nbsp;VALORANT&nbsp;Studios, Anna Donlan, who said “we [Riot Games] have squeezed literally every ounce of everything we could get out of UE 4, so now we make the move to UE5, and that is not an easy feat when your game is a live service game but it is necessary.”</p>



<p>Donlon continued, “This upgrade is not going to significantly change how Valorant looks or performs, at least not right away.”</p>



<p>Donlon went on to tease that developers are “very excited what about UE5 can do for us [Riot Games] in the future” and that “maybe those devs are working on something I can’t talk about and maybe those devs are thinking about ways to expand the Val universe into new playable experiences.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It remains to be seen what these “new playable experiences” are, but such comments are sure to get the Valorant community speculating on the possibilities.</p>



<p>For now though, Valorant continues to be a huge success for Riot Games since its release in June 2020. Last year, it was revealed that Valorant has 28 million players, 70% of which are Gen Z.</p>

            <p>
Pre-orders for the limited edition PlayStation 5 30th Anniversary range will come with an extra layer of scalper protection in Japan, Sony has said, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-bundles-already-selling-for-thousands-on-ebay">the rampant relisting of consoles with exorbitant prices on eBay</a> seen elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Japanese PlayStation fans <a href="https://www.playstation.com/ja-jp/local/campaigns/ps5-30th-register-to-pre-order/">can now place pre-orders</a> for the 30th Anniversary collection but require a PlayStation Network account with at least 30 hours' worth of play to be eligible. This is different to the method elsewhere, where any PSN account could be used.
</p>
<p>
In Japan, fans have far longer to register a pre-order - from now until midnight on Monday 14th October - to reduce queuing issues.

<p>
After that time, all eligible pre-orders will be placed into a lottery system to give every potential customer a fair chance (if the number of pre-orders ends up exceeding the amount of stock, which is of course inevitable).
</p>
<p>
Any stock not bought by lottery winners will then be entered into a "re-lottery" in late November, with unsuccessful pre-order customers from the first round given another shot. 
</p>
<p>
It all seems a far fairer and more straightforward system than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-bundle-priced-960-sells-out-in-seconds">the one used in the UK and US, where customers saw consoles sold out in seconds</a> - if they could get through the wobbly queuing process at all.
</p>
<p>
Another check of eBay listings here in the UK today shows dozens of recently-sold PS5 30th Edition console pre-orders that have changed hands, the vast majority in the low thousands of pounds - a markup by scalpers of around double to quadruple the console's original price.

			<p>A new God of War Ragnarok patch is now live for the PC version of the game, improving AMD FSR 3 frame generation and fixing a variety of issues.</p>
<p>Patch 4 focuses on fixing several issues, including crashes, authentication flow, and texture issues, which will no longer unload while looking at the menu for a set amount of time and won't be shown loading in while using fast travel through the Realm Between Realms.</p>
<p>The new God of War Ragnarok patch also fixes an NVIDIA memory leak issue caused by switching between different Frame Generation settings. The patch, as mentioned above, also brings some AMD FSR 3 frame generation improvements, fixing flickering in the pause menu, performance and frame pacing issues, and a small memory leak caused by turning it on and off. Rounding up the changes brought by the patch, which can be found detailed in full<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2322010/view/4681018807420990578?l=english"> here</a>, are Steam Deck offline mode and DualSense controller fixes.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok finally launched on PC last month after almost two years since its console release, and the port is definitely a solid one, although it has some <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-worse-playstation-5/">issues</a> that make it not look as good as the PlayStation 5 version. The port also doesn't offer many options to scale beyond the PS5 version's Quality Mode.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 worldwide. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/"> review.</a></p>

Epic Games is now "financially sound" after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-is-reportedly-laying-off-900-employees">shedding around 830 staff during last year's mass layoff</a>, founder Tim Sweeney has said. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking last night during a stage presentation at Unreal Fest, Sweeney briefly acknowledged the job losses as the show opened, before going on to mention last year's high watermark of engagement with the hugely-lucrative <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, that featured a massively successful throwback "OG" season. 
</p>
<p>
"Last year's Unreal Fest began with some sad news," Sweeney said. "The company had to get its finances in order, and we just had some major layoffs. We spent the last year rebuilding and also really executing solidly on all fronts.

"I'm happy to tell you now that the company is financially sound, and that Fortnite and the Epic Games Store have hit new records in concurrency and success. Fortnite hit 110 million monthly active users last holiday, an all-time peak."
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that Fortnite player numbers have dropped back down since then, and the launch of last year's new modes have had mixed success, though <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> in particular remains popular.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games remains hugely busy, with ongoing work across the ubiquitous Unreal Engine and its UEFN toolset for building and launching games in Fortnite, the growth of Epic Game Store, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-launches-major-new-lawsuit-in-app-store-fight-this-time-against-samsung-and-google">fresh legal battle announced this week with Google and Samsung</a>.
</p>
<p>
On UEFN, new modes developed by Epic Games using the technology for Fortnite were mentioned - an all-new experience set to arrive in the game this year, and a new version of the popular Fortnite Reload mode, due in the next few weeks.
</p>
<p>
And on the Epic Game Store, a new "Launch Everywhere with Epic" offer will trim Epic's existing royalty from five to 3.5 percent from 1st January 2025, to incentivise launching on its storefront. This will apply to games available on Epic's platform first or at the same time as other platforms such as Steam.

			<p>Krafton is best known for publishing PUBG Battlegrounds, the game that transformed the battle Royale genre and paved the way for its popularity. South Korea continues to expand and invest in new technologies and platforms. Now, the gaming giant has announced that it will partner up with Pocketpair to bring its popular survival crafting game Palworld to mobile devices and has secured licensing agreements for the extension of the game to mobile platforms.</p>
<h2>Krafton has announced today about signing a licensing agreement with Pocketpair to bring Palword to mobile devices</h2>
<p>Pocketpair is increasingly focusing on expanding its Palworld, a highly anticipated open-world survival game, to Xbox, PC, and PS5. It is now taking the leap in the mobile gaming industry with the help of Krafton, a South Korean game publisher that gained massive popularity for its PUBG Battlegrounds.</p>
<p>In a<a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-%ed%8c%b0%ec%9b%94%eb%93%9c-%eb%aa%a8%eb%b0%94%ec%9d%bc-%ea%b2%8c%ec%9e%84-%ea%b8%80%eb%a1%9c%eb%b2%8c-%eb%9d%bc%ec%9d%b4%ec%84%a0%ec%8a%a4/"> press release</a>, Krafton announced that it would secure a licensing agreement for Palworld's intellectual property (IP) to bring the game to mobile platforms. The game would be developed by PUBG STUDIOS under Krafton, who would mimic the game's main elements and make it suitable for the mobile environment. In the press release, the company explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It plans to faithfully reinterpret and implement the original’s main fun elements to fit the mobile environment. The project will be handled by the development team of ‘PUBG STUDIOS,’ a creative studio under Krafton.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Palworld's <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-is-now-the-most-popular-game-on-xbox-game-pass/">expansion</a> to Xbox and PC has already helped the company gain 25 million players and sell over 15 million copies, and the game even has secured the third-highest number of concurrent users on Steam. It further extended its platforms by making its debut on PS5 this September. The game owes its popularity to the enticing gameplay that keeps the players hooked and the monster-breeding mechanics incorporated into a charming world.</p>
<p>Krafton and Pocketpair partnering up to bring Palworld to mobile devices would help gain a wider player base and can also aid the company with its leading position in the survival crafting category.&nbsp; Although Pocketpair has managed to gain massive popularity, especially after its continuous expansion, it is not entirely a breeze as Nintendo has recently sued the company for patent infringement.</p>
<p>Palworld is currently available on PC, Xbox Series XIS consoles, and PlayStation 5 and can be accessed through Xbox Game Pass. Soon, players will be able to enjoy unique gaming on their mobile devices.</p>

No release window was mentioned.</p><p>PUBG Studios is the development arm behind the phenomenally successful battle royale as well as its equally successful mobile versions. Indeed, PUBG Mobile has had over one billion players since launching in March 2018.</p><p>The announcement of Palworld mobile comes hot on the heels of Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s joint lawsuit against Pocketpair for alleged patent infringement, and the subsequent launch of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-ps5-release-postponed-in-japan-amid-nintendo-pokmon-patent-lawsuit">Palworld on PlayStation 5 everywhere except Japan</a>, where the lawsuit was filed.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-developer-pocketpair-responds-to-nintendo-pokmon-lawsuit-says-its-unaware-of-the-patents-its-accused-of-infringing"><u>Pocketpair has</u> insisted</a> it has no idea which patents it’s accused of infringing, but experts have pointed to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-vs-palworld-killer-patent-may-be-about-the-mechanic-of-catching-pokmon"><u>“killer patent” that revolves around the mechanic of catching Pokémon itself</u></a>. Last week, one patent expert said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-lawsuit-shows-just-how-seriously-nintendo-views-the-threat-of-palworld-patent-expert-says">the lawsuit shows “just how seriously Nintendo views the threat of Palworld.”</a></p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Palworld vs. Pokémon Comparison</h3></div></output><p>After Palworld’s huge launch earlier this year on PC and Xbox, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have gone down the patent route.</p><p>It is worth noting that Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus"><u>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</u></a>, and this may prove the key to the lawsuit.</p><p>Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC earlier this year, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle"><u>couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</u></a>.</p><p>Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>signing a deal with Sony</u></a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket Images</h3></div></output><p>While the Pokémon games are mostly at home on consoles, Nintendo has launched a number of spin-offs aimed at other devices, including mobile. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon GO</a> has seen enormous success since launching in 2016, generating billions of dollars in revenue. There’s also <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-unite">Pokémon Unite</a>, a MOBA released for mobile and Nintendo Switch, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-sleep">Pokémon Sleep</a>, a sleep-tracking game that rewards the user with Pokémon depending on the quality of their sleep.</p><p>Indeed, a new Pokémon mobile game is right around the corner: <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, a mobile version of the Pokemon TCG, launches October 30, 2024.</p><p>Pocketpair has said it will begrudgingly investigate the patent infringement claims while continuing to update Palworld despite the lawsuit, and apologized to players left concerned about the future of the game.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Two F-Zero games are headed to Nintendo's Switch Online subscription, including a previously Japan-only release.</p>
<p>Both games launched on the Game Boy Advance and will be available on Switch from 11th October.</p>
<p>The first is F-Zero: GP Legend, which followed GBA launch game F-Zero: Maximum Velocity and was released in Europe in 2004. It plays similarly to the SNES original, but includes a Story mode based on the anime of the same name.</p>

<p>The second is F-Zero Climax, a sequel to GP Legend that was previously only available in Japan, also released in 2004. It's more of an expansion than a full sequel, but is notable for its Course Editor that allows players to create their own tracks using specific pieces.</p>
<p>F-Zero Climax was the last release in the series for 19 years, until F-Zero 99 arrived on Switch Online last year.</p>
<p>Speaking of, F-Zero 99 has received a new update with additional content that's available today.</p>
<p>There's a new Grand Prix Ace League, five new tracks (including some from the Satellaview), new machine decals, and an expanded Practice Mode. Additionally, some balance tweaks have been made to the Wild Goose and Fire Stingray machines.</p>
<p>Nintendo is also holding a one-year anniversary event, where players can earn 12 anniversary badges, backdrops, borders, and emotes.</p> <div>

<p>I enjoyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-99-feels-like-a-battle-royale-in-a-pinball-machine">F-Zero 99 when it was released last September</a>, describing it as "a battle royale in a pinball machine".</p>
<p>It's great to see Nintendo updating the game further and including more games from the series in its Switch Online offering. Now all we need is a proper brand new game - wishful thinking?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ghost of Yōtei, the newly revealed follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, will have a less repetitive open world.</p>
<p>Sucker Punch's Nate Fox and Jason Connell, creative directors on Ghost of Tsushima, were interviewed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes">The NY Times</a> to discuss the sequel, due out next year on PS5.</p>
<p>"One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again," said Connell. "We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences."</p>

<p>Indeed, the first game was criticised for its repetitive activities used to fill out its open world. With Yotei, new protagonist Atsu will be able to master firearms in addition to melee weapons, and players will have greater control over her story.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei will be a story of "underdog vengeance", as Atsu travels across grasslands and tundras.</p>
<p>That setting was inspired by two research trips by Sucker Punch to northern Japan, with the view of Mount Yōtei across Lake Toya inspiring awe. "I sat there for two hours just staring at the mountain," said Connell. "It was stunning."</p>
<p>The Shiretoko National Park, in the northeast of Hokkaido, also proved inspirational. "Inside the park, you have to watch a video telling you about the dangers of bears," said Fox. "Being in this incredibly beautiful park with jagged cliffs and water, yet all the time being aware there were dangerous bears, was electrifying.</p>
<p>"We strive to bring that into the video game - that feeling of danger."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reveals-ghost-of-yotei-the-follow-up-to-ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Yōtei was unveiled at Sony's recent PlayStation State of Play</a>. The trailer introduced Atsu and has something of a Western vibe to it, set a few hundred years after Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<p>"To create something fresh but familiar, we looked beyond Jin Sakai’s story and the island of Tsushima, and shifted our focus to the idea of the Ghost instead," wrote Sucker Punch communications manager Andrew Goldfarb on the PlayStation Blog.</p>
<p>"At Sucker Punch we love origin stories, and we wanted to explore what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask, and uncovering a new legend. This led us to Ghost of Yōtei: a new protagonist, a new story to unfold, and a new region of Japan to explore."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Look. Having basically sold both of my best standing legs to buy more <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/55690/kingdom-death-monster">Kingdom Death Monster</a> expansions, I can’t bemoan anyone spending silly amounts of money on whatever plastic tat makes them happy. But I love<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii"> Baldur’s Gate 3</a>, and it makes me sad to see all the wonderful art, writing, and acting that went into its characters reduced to $6 miniatures that look like their limbs would melt if I rubbed them between my thumb and forefinger.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/official-baldur-s-gate-3-miniatures-are-coming-but-the-origin-characters-will-set-you-back-50/">As spotted by PC Gamer</a>, WizKids have recently opened pre-orders for a set of greasy pre-painted fetishes based on Larian’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. WizKids, of course, being the maker of supermarket-discount-aisle-ass toys but, ah, they’ve got a base on them so we can pretend they’re proper models and charge you accordingly. Moaning about toys now, are we Nic? Is this what the profession has been reduced to? And to that I say: videogames are toys anyway, they’re just slightly better at hiding it. Also, several of them are worth owning.</p>

<p>Look how they plas-acred my boy:</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>WizKids/Wotc</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Okay, sure. The sculpts aren’t totally terrible in terms of silhouettes and detail, but at $25 for four randomised figures, I expect something a bit more, uh, good. Astarion above is from the <a href="https://shop.wizkids.com/collections/pre-order-collection/products/d-d-icons-of-the-realms-baldurs-gate-3-character-boxed-set">bigger box set</a>, which features all six origin characters, plus withers, for $50, or about £38. You’d have to go to a third party retailer, admittedly, but you could buy an entire 40K Kill Team for that. Don’t like Warhammer? Fine. You know who’d look much, much better on your D&amp;D table, and also comes with four miniatures for about the same price? This guy:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/boris.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Goblin King Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is Boris The Bunny Summoner from <a href="https://www.moonstonethegame.com/">Moonstone</a>, and he is but one of many beautiful miniatures they sell. Don’t like Boris? That’s fine. For the same price, you could get six halfling shieldmaidens riding walruses from <a href="https://ttcombat.com/collections/half-tilt">TT COMBAT</a>. You cannot tell me this wouldn't be a more fun dungeon encounter than Karlach's evil, waxy twin busting through a wall.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/shieldmaidens.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>TTCOMBAT</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Okay, one more. Check out this Owlbear <a href="https://zealotminiatures.com/product/owlbear/">from Zealot Miniatures</a>.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Zealot_Miniatures_Owlbear.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Zealot Miniatures</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now look at this actual bear from Wizkids:</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/wizkids-bear.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>WizKids/Wotc</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yes, yes. Paint and glue. I know. Point still stands. This bear looks like it came from a bucket on the counter of a museum gift shop. If anyone from WizKids reads this then... 1. It’s satire. I’m writing about your stupid, defective products satirically, and 2. Do NOT send me any bears to try and prove their worth. I know where they've been.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
