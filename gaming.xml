			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-august-lies-of-p-day-z-my-hero-ones-justice-2/">announced</a> the three games that PS Plus subscribers from the entry-level Essential tier and up will be able to redeem, with Round 8's Lies of P as the headline game for August, and the only game with a native PS5 version available. </p>



<p>The other two games players will be able to redeem are the hardcore zombie survival game DayZ and the 3D arena fighting game My Hero One's Justice 2. All three titles will be available for players to redeem on August 5, 2025, which means that the last chance you'll have to redeem Diablo IV, Jusant, and The King of Fighters XV, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-celebrates-ps-plus-15-year-anniversary-reveals-july-2025-ps-plus-essential-games-including-diablo-iv-and-jusant/">three games for July,</a> is August 4, 2025.</p>

<p>Lies of P entering the service next week is perfect timing for players who've perhaps been looking at Round 8's excellent take on action-RPG games with a more lustful eye since the release of its recent DLC, Lies of P: Overture.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Lies of P</a> at launch in 2023, he called it "<em>a solid imitation of FromSoftware's Bloodborne that manages to stay fun for the entire duration of a single playthrough of around 20 hours despite a marked lack of innovation.</em>" When he <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/">reviewed the Overture DLC</a> earlier this year, he called it "<em>an expansion in the true sense of the word,"</em> and "<em>a worthy purchase for those who loved the original and still want more.</em>"</p>



<p>Now you can get the base game for no extra cost beyond your existing PS Plus subscription, and pick up the DLC for a fraction of the cost of the original game. All together, not a bad deal for Bloodborne and FromSoftware fans who've not yet checked out Lies of P.</p>

Not exactly a smash hit, but it brought in more than three times its $15 million budget. It's a fun horror movie and a solid take on the source material with some clever new ideas mixed in. Until Dawn's 4K Blu-ray edition released earlier this month for $50. Along with the 4K UHD disc, you'll get a standard Blu-ray disc, a code to redeem the digital edition, and a number of bonus materials that explore how this gruesome film was produced.</p><p>Here's the full list of Until Dawn special features:</p><ul><li>Adapting a Nightmare - Director David F.

                <p>News about the future of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> doesn't sound like it will be coming soon, as Blizzard has said it will next update the community on what's next for its ARPG around the launch of Season 10.</p><p dir="ltr">In a reply to a fan on X asking for Diablo 4 updates, Diablo's director of social and content marketing Adam Fletcher <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1948505796410835265" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> the following.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1948505796410835265" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are in between seasons so nothing to share yet. Next update around PTR for S10/S10 Launch.</p>  — Adam Fletcher (@PezRadar) <a href="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1948505796410835265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"We are in between seasons so nothing to share yet. Next update around PTR for S10/S10 launch," Fletcher said.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Diablo 4 Season 9's in-game timer, Season 10 is likely to start September 23. Typically, public test realm tests for a season are done several weeks prior, which would put the PTR around early September or perhaps late August. That means the game's next Campfire Chat, where Blizzard regularly outlines its future Diablo 4 plans, will be around that same time.</p><p dir="ltr">What that translates to is that, for about a month, there will likely be no news about what's next for Diablo 4. It's a bit confusing for fans, as a handful of Diablo 4 content creators recently revealed they attended a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">Blizzard meeting on Diablo 4's future</a>. During the meeting they were shown what sounds like some of the significant changes fans have been asking to be currently in the works for Diablo 4.</p><p dir="ltr">News of the content creator meeting led many to believe some major announcements about how Blizzard will improve Diablo 4 to be imminent. Fletcher himself said in June that players' "warcries of wanting more change aren't going unnoticed," and stated that the team "has been cooking on some of the biggest changes that really hit home on things people have been asking for and more."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">Diablo 4 2025 roadmap</a> states that Season 10, Infernal Chaos, will be the last season for 2025, and will bring changes to the game's Infernal Hordes activity, new seasonal powers, and a new IP crossover. In 2026, the roadmap <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">teases a new expansion</a>, ranking system, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">It's possible Blizzard could still make a new Diablo 4 expansion announcement at Gamescom in August, but it seems like players may have to wait longer than they'd like in order to learn what steps Blizzard is taking to improve the ARPG in the short term.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, Diablo 4 Season 9, which recently just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-patch-notes-reveal-increased-rewards-and-big-barbarian-buffs/1100-6533122/" data-ref-id="1100-6533122">majorly buffed Barbarians</a>, is ongoing.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Those keen to get their hands on Xbox's recently announced handheld consoles ROG Ally and Ally X may be able to preorder the devices as of next month.</p>
<p>According to the ever reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-vous-devoile-la-date-douverture-des-ventes-60300">Dealabs</a>, preorders will go live on 20th August. That's the day <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> kicks off, with the convention in Cologne running between 20th and 24th August. During this time, attendees will be able to go <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">hands-on with the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p>
<p>Dealabs added that the devices will be priced thus: €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the Xbox Ally X. That's around £518 and £777 here in the UK. Current suggestion is Xbox's handheld devices will then be available in October, although an exact date has not yet been specified. Previously, Xbox said the devices would be available this "holiday" period, across select countries.</p>

<p>The Xbox ROG Ally and ROG Ally X are both powered by Windows 11, and feature an "immersive" full-screen Xbox experience, plus an aggregated gaming library with access to installed games from a range of PC stores, including Steam, Battle.net, and GOG. And, of course, the machine supports Xbox Play Anywhere titles, of which there are now over 1,000.</p>
<p>Those opting for the standard Xbox ROG Ally can expect an AMD Ryzen Z2 A Processor within, alongside 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage, while the Ally X upgrades that to an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor and 24GB of high-speed RAM.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Xbox laid out its Gamescom plans, when it confirmed that not only will those in attendance be able to give the ROG Ally and Ally X a shot, but also that<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong"> its booth will include a playable demo of Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Other games available to try out on the company's upcoming handheld devices include Roblox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-handheld-consoles-rog-ally-and-ally-x-preorders-open-during-gamescom-report-says]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft is implementing age verification for Xbox users, in compliance with the UK's new Online Safety Act.</p>
<p>From today, players aged 18 and over based in the UK and accessing Xbox with a Microsoft account will be encouraged to verify their age. This, Microsoft said, is a one-time process to ensure access to age-appropriate experiences.</p>
<p>Then, starting early next year, age verification will be required for players in the UK to retain full access to Xbox social features, such as game invites and communication via voice and text. Without age verification, use of social features will be limited to friends only.</p>
<p>Microsoft has detailed the process on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/">Xbox Wire</a>, including a QR code to scan to begin the age verification process away from a console. Secure methods include proof of government-issued ID, age estimation, mobile provider check, and credit card check.</p>
<p>"As this age verification process rolls out across the UK, we'll continue to evaluate how we can keep players around the world safe and learn from the UK process," reads the Xbox Wire post from Xbox vice president of gaming trust and safety Kim Kunes.</p>
<p>"We expect to roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to player safety, so these methods may look different across regions and experiences. We'll work with local communities, publishing partners and regulators to determine the right approach that both respects player privacy and doesn't take away from the Xbox gameplay experience. We'll continue to communicate the changes we're making to our practices and the data we collect so we can better protect players on our platform."</p>
<p>Xbox advises parents and caregivers to set up child or teen accounts, which do not require age verification and allow for gaming activities to be managed appropriately, including screentime and spending limits.</p>
<p>At present, Sony and Nintendo have not implemented similar measures. Eurogamer has contacted both companies for details on how they will comply with the new UK Act.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies">Roblox recently implemented new safety features</a> to ensure it's compliant, including a new age estimation tool.</p>
<p>"Safety has always been foundational to everything we do at Roblox, and we've spent nearly two decades building advanced safety tools," a Roblox spokesperson told Eurogamer. "Our Community Standards prohibit various types of content including content defined as harmful to children under the OSA. For some time, we've made certain features accessible only to ID-verified users over the age of 17.</p>
<p>"Two weeks ago, as part of our global roadmap to deliver age-appropriate content and features, we introduced a new facial age estimation tool, which unlocks access for users 13 and over to communicate more freely with people they know and trust - adding to a suite of more than 40 recent safety updates, such as updated parental controls and communications restrictions for our youngest users, which we have rolled out over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>"We take our legal obligations seriously and are working hard on the assessment and implementation of the Children's Code and will continue to engage with Ofcom."</p>
<p>Years in the making, the UK's Online Safety Act came into effect last Friday. Its aim is to make the internet safer, especially for children, which will impact social media, video-sharing platforms, and video games.</p>
<p>To find out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">how the UK's Online Safety Act will impact the games industry</a>, Eurogamer spoke with the experts.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-users-will-now-need-to-verify-their-age-in-compliance-with-uks-online-safety-act]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Atari has agreed to acquire an 82% stake in Swedish indie publisher and developer Thunderful Games, purchasing shares worth SEK 50 million (around €4.5 million). Thunderful is best known for&nbsp;SteamWorld, Islanders and Lost in Random.</p>
<p>Sadly, a restructuring of the company’s studios will take place following the acquisition.</p>


<p>The purchase is subject to a shareholder vote, scheduled for 28th August, but has already received support of Thunderful’s Board of Directors and the two largest shareholders right now – Owe Bergsten and Brjann Sigurgeirsson – who currently hold 29.9% of the company’s capital and voting rights. The purchase is being made possible by issuing new shares, so their stake and voting rights going forward will be significantly diminished.</p>
<p>Wade Rosen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Atari said, “This Transaction marks another important milestone in Atari’s development with the expansion of its publishing and development capabilities in the European region. Thunderful is recognized for publishing and developing critically acclaimed games, and with the announced transformation plan, as well as the quality and commitment of Thunderful’s teams, we are confident that Thunderful will be returning to a profitable growth path while helping to further develop Atari operations in Europe.”</p>

<p>Thunderful has a complicated business history, but boils down to having started as a merger between indie developers Image &amp; Form (best known for the SteamWorld series) and Zoink (Stick it to the Man!, Fe, Lost in Random), and Swedish retailer and distributor Bergsala in the 2019. In the following years, Thunderful has acquired more developers and publishers, including Headup Games (for a while), Coatsink and others, but the company has struggled in the last couple years. Through 2024, they made layoffs, divested Headup Games, and branched off the distribution businesses to make Thunderful Group a purely game development and game publishing entity, which is what Atari is now acquiring.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-4-will-honor-its-predecessor%E2%80%99s-legacy-without-trying-to-outdo-it-says-narrative-director.1256139/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Witcher 4 will have plenty of new features, but it will also respect its predecessor's legacy without necessarily trying to outdo it, as video games aren't mathematical, and acclaim is subjective.</p>



<p>Speaking with GamesRadar+, the game's narrative director Philipp Weber commented on online discussions centered on how CDPR will top the third entry in the series, saying that it is one of his concerns as well. However, the developer was able to move away from them by acknowledging that video games aren't mathematical, acclaim is subjective, and attempting to top The Witcher 3 "mathematically" isn't really an option.</p>



<p>On the contrary, CDPR isn't developing The Witcher 4 with the idea that it has to beat its predecessor in some way. The studio wants to do justice to the legacy of the third entry in the series, and to do so, they are developing the new game using the same philosophies. At the same time, the development team wants to make the game feel like a proper sequel that doesn't retread old ground, so ultimately, The Witcher 4 will feature a <em>"healthy mix of really moving forward and also trying out some new things, but doing justice to what was there, not trying to beat it," according to Weber. </em>Ultimately, CDPR is developing the game to make sure some people will love it, and hopefully those who love The Witcher 3 also will.</p>



<p>Although The Witcher 4 is not being developed with the idea that it has to surpass The Witcher 3, there's no doubt that the next entry in the series is likely going to surpass its predecessor in terms of visuals, judging from the impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">tech demo</a> set in the village of Valdrest, which featured impressive NPC density. With <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-made-with-console-first-approach-60-fps-on-xbox-series-s-will-be-extremely-challenging-to-achieve-says-cdpr/">console-first approach</a> and the desire to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-dev-wants-to-take-full-advantage-of-the-generational-shift-since-the-witcher-3-tech-demos-village-npc-density-was-based-on-novigrad/">take advantage of the generational shift </a>since The Witcher 3, the fourth entry in the series promises to be a spectacle for the eyes, no matter the platform.</p>

            <p>There are a number of official Jumanji video games, but they don't seem very Jumanjish to me. You've got a bunch of nineties-to-noughties minigame compilations, a pachinko adaptation, and a few reportedly dismal games based on the recent Dwayne Johnson movies, also feat. Steve off Infiniminer and Amy Pond from Dr Avenger: Endgame.</p>
<p>Ludogram's just-announced streamerbait co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/invokyr">Invokyr</a> seems to be cleaving a lot closer to the 1995 movie, which is itself based on Chris Van Allsburg's book from 1981. The game sees you and up to three others playing a cursed boardgame that transforms the house it's played in.</p><!--more-->
<p>The one immediate complaint I have is that Invokyr's boardgame looks mega simple. Going by the screens, it has you rolling dice to move one piece to the end of a path. Not exactly Twilight Imperium then. Still, there's talk of "special dice", and the cursed boardgame itself is voiced by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> dungeon master Amelia Tyler. It's going to have a certain stage presence, if nothing else. Hopefully it'll do some crafty things with the movie's literal "we have colonialism at home" theme. There's a Van Pelt-adjacent "great white hunter" in the trailer, below.</p>

<p>The transforming house around the room containing the boardgame is a creature of Blue Principled abandon. It's big and mazey enough that you might get lost, claim the developers, and is capable of various generated biomes - "jungle, ice mountain, oversized toy chest". You'll have to worry about traps and also, creatures such as carnivorous plants and puppets in cages, each with a different mode of stalking. Sort of looks like they hunt the same way in the video, admittedly: sneaky-sneak, peekaboo, chomp!</p>
<p>I'd like this to have the variety of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>'s menagerie, in which some anomalies can only be thwarted by failing to notice them. A Lethal Company Jumanji mod would be fabulous, actually. I'd also like it if the board game in Invokyr were a smaller, real-time version of the house, with a very small model of the player looking down at very small boardgame that contains another, even smaller model of the player, etcetera.</p>
<p>At the very least, there needs to be a trap that maroons one player in another world until they have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enH1LsxIJI4">a beard bushy enough to sleep in</a>. It's out... in the future. You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3883570/Invokyr/">Steam</a>. Favourite cursed boardgames, anybody?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If you're the sort of player that jumps into the yearly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> experience, there's probably one thing that's stuck with you more than anything else: that obscene download size.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the catch-all Call of Duty app (often referred to as Call of Duty HQ) via Xbox wants me to free up 381.19GB of space on my PC hard drive in order to install all the 'recommended' files it needs to run. The Steam app only requires 'at least' an SSD with 128GB available space, which is still, frankly, too much.</p>

<p>In an announcement made via <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1949968296121344261">Activision's CODUpdates account</a> on X, the publisher announced:</p>
<p>"On July 29 at 9am PT, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will be moved from the main Call of Duty install and become standalone downloads."</p>
<p>That means, sometime this week, you will be able to load the games on their own - without the need for the massive download offered by the Call of Duty HQ app. In short, as soon as tomorrow (30th July), anyone that owns either of the games will be able to launch directly into the titles once downloaded. Read: no faffing with interstitial menus or confusing screens via the somewhat cumbersome app.</p>

</figure>
<p>Legacy content for each title - this means MW2 and MW3 modes within the main Call of Duty HQ app - will be automatically removed on 7th August, freeing up space for players still wanting to access the other Call of Duty titles without bothering with the two affected titles.</p>
<p>Whether this indicates Activision is willing to remove other Call of Duty games from the app in the coming days and months remains unclear. It's also unclear why these two games have been targeted first: do they have a lower engagement rate than other titles? Are they simply easier to unhitch from the integrated ecosystem?</p>
<p>It also raises questions about upcoming series entry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> (the multiplayer aspect of which we can expect to see sometime 'this summer').</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3s-up-to-200gb-file-sizes">Way back in 2023</a>, Activision justified its decision to merge all the games into one app by saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusing-call-of-duty-hq-launcher-justified-by-activision">it allowed for easier file management and seamless switching between games</a>. Even back then, the decision drew fire from the community. Players criticised the publisher for putting the onus on individuals to "reduce the overall footprint" of the title. At the time, players became frustrated and confused when trying to access games they actually owned, as the app kept presenting them with opportunities to purchase the newest content added to the store. As you can imagine, this went down poorly.</p>
<p>Are you still playing either of the affected titles? Is this going to have a meaningful impact on you - or your SSD? Is there any reason for you to go back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-campaign-review-vapid-and-hastily-assembled">the "vapid and hastily assembled" Modern Warfare 3 campaign</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Achilles: Legends Untold, released in 2023, introduced us to a new developer with great potential. Sure, several aspects of the game were certainly rough around the edges, but there was enough quality gaming to be had in this action RPG to suggest Dark Point Game had what it took to release an absolute banger. Their follow-up game, Achilles Survivor, is the realisation of that potential, offering one of the most-compelling and thrilling experiences available in the embryotic bullet heaven genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="Achilles: Survivor. Release date trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/15ahxwZMgYg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Smartly reusing many of their gorgeous visual assets from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/03/achilles-legends-untold-review/">Achilles: Legends Untold</a>, Achilles Survivor bears an uncanny resemblance to its forbear. Played from a top-down perspective, Achilles or one of many other unlockable mythological characters, must survive for either ten or twenty minutes against an unending horde of monsters. This being a twist on Vampire Survivors, you do that with only one controller input: movement. You steer your character around the small, enclosed environment, dodging hordes of enemies, or smashing headlong through the smallest pack of them to break free.</p>
<p>Combat is automated, with each of your attacks auto-targeting foes on a repeating cycle. As you kill monsters, ranging from Ray Harryhausen style skeletons, to Cyclopes, and unpleasantly animated giant spiders, you quickly level-up. Doing so is crucial, as each incremental level provides you with a selection of additional attack powers or heightened abilities to choose from. Soon, you become the bullet hell, spewing out a multitude of deadly blades, a plume of poisoned griffin talons, and a parade of marching giants. It’s up to you to position and move your character just right to ensure you hit as many of your enemies as possible, whilst still being able to nimbly dodge their attacks.</p>


<p>One aspect that sets Achilles Survivor apart from many of its bullet heaven brethren is the rather neat building mechanic, which adds a lashing of strategy and consideration to your actions. As your survivor explorers the environment they’ll fine stone mines. Hang out around the perimeter of the mine and you’ll gradually accrue stone – this in and of itself adds to the tension, as gathering resources whilst a horde of enemies lumber towards you is quite the thrill – this can then be used to build defences at specific locations marked by a flag. You’ll get a random selection of four structures to choose from, some with offensive properties and others defensive in nature.</p>
<p>Defence types are varied, from flame thrower turrets and healing stations to poison emitting fountains and friendly warrior spawning Trojan Horses. Some defences only activate whilst you remain beside them, forcing you to bravely lure the enemies towards you before frantically fleeing at the last moment, while others work better in combination, such as a device that blasts enemies away so that they land in the spikey embrace of a nearby spear turret. Experimenting with different combinations to best thin the numbers of the enemy is all part of Achilles Survivor’s appeal.</p>
<p>There are various challenges to take on in each level that helps keeps things fresh. You can open up portals to add to the enemy count and ultimately be rewarded with some powerful loot, or close enemy spawn points by seeing off a set number of extra-powerful beasties. There are zones that if you remain within whilst killing enough baddies you’ll get a tasty bonus ability and treasure chests that can be peeked inside if you can just get past the veritable army blocking your way.</p>

<p>It all adds up to a ridiculously fun gameplay loop, satisfying and accessible, and one in which anyone could pick up a controller and have a riotous blast. Pacing is perfect, the volume of enemies gradually increasing until there are hundreds of the blighters on screen, as you desperately attempt to flank them before they close off your escape route, whilst the final remaining seconds on the clock tick down.</p>
<p>After each run, your character gains permanent upgrades, and also class specific bonuses which impact any other character you choose too. There’s always something cool to unlock, fostering that ‘just one more go’ mentality, be it new abilities, spells, buildings, characters, or levels. It’s intoxicatingly addictive, and before you know it hours of your life have gone by, as you sat with a glazed expression, slightly drooling from the ridiculous grin plastered on your face as you finally make it through a particularly challenging level.</p>


<p>My only complaint? Well, the bosses are a drag. They pop up infrequently but when they do, they often overstay their welcome. It’s not like they are particularly challenging – their area attacks can be easily dodged – it’s just that they are ridiculous bullet sponges who absorb a stupendous amount of damage. As such, the precise pacing and rhythm of the game is lost when the bosses turn up, turning proceedings into a slog until you finally whittle down their expansive health bar. One ten-minute level was doubled in length after a particularly gruelling battle with Paris – not the city, but the irritating prat from Troy. With any luck, a patch or two will refine the boss experience. Either way, bosses or not, Achilles Survivor staunchly remains one of the best examples of its genre currently available.</p>

		<p>Ubisoft have released update 1.07 for Assassin’s Creed Shadows and it brings a popular feature, New Game+ mode. In short, if you have finished the main story you can restart the game but keep all the trinkets and gubbins you acquired during your first run, so you are super powerful to start with.</p>
<p>Here are the Assassin’s Creed Shadow Update 1.07 patch notes:</p>


<h3 id="TkVXIEdBTUUr">NEW GAME+</h3>
<p>Upon completing the main story on any difficulty, start a new game while keeping all collected skills, gear, Allies and hideout progression from your first playthrough. You can start a New Game+ playthrough from the Memory Menu in the Animus after finishing all journeys of Naoe, Yasuke and Junjiro.</p>
<p>Upon completing a New Game+ playthrough you’ll be awarded Whisper of Gold, and Dragon’s Gold! Brand new gold plated Legendary Long Katana and Legendary Katana with their own unique perk engravings.</p>
<p>Take your journey through Feudal Japan to the next level as many times as you want… or at least up to 8 times with New Game+! With each new venture into New Game+, face stronger foes, more demanding challenges, and tests of your Shinobi and Samurai skills.</p>

<h3 id="S05PV0xFREdFIFJBTksg">KNOWLEDGE RANK &amp; LEVEL CAP INCREASE</h3>
<p>Prepare to push beyond your limits! We’ve raised the level cap from 60 to 80, meaning tougher foes with enhanced tactics and awareness – demanding sharper reflexes and smarter strategies.</p>
<p>To meet this rising threat, we’ve also expanded the Knowledge Rank system to 9 &amp; 10 allowing players to unlock and develop a broader array of skills, passives, and combat techniques to become even more masterful.</p>
<p>New Game+ awaits! But before taking on the task of a new journey, you can upgrade the passives and skills of Naoe and Yasuke! Players will gain 1 new rank for multiple nodes in their Mastery Skills, and 10 new ranks for all existing Knowledge passives to become even more formidable.</p>
<p>A test of your skills is no match without the right gear! The Forge can now be upgraded to level 4, allowing players to upgrade all weapons and gear to level 80 to have the edge on the rising threats that await.</p>
<p>With new levels and ranks, come three new achievements and trophies waiting to be unlocked:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enjoy the Ride</strong>: Reach Level 80</li>
<li><strong>Stars Unseen</strong>: Reach Knowledge Rank 10</li>
<li><strong>Worth its Wait</strong>: Obtain the Gold Katana and Gold Long Katana (by completing the story on New Game+).</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/igda-calls-for-greater-transparency-amid-adult-game-bans.1256097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) has issued a statement regarding recent adult game bans on platforms like Steam and Itch.io, calling for "greater transparency and fairness" in the matter.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://igda.org/news-archive/press-release-statement-on-game-delistings/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> on its website, the IGDA says it's "alarmed" by the way in which "legal, consensual, and ethically-developed games, especially from LGBTQ+ and marginalized creators", have been delisted and deplatformed by storefronts like the aforementioned two in recent weeks.</p>

<p>The association says that while it does not wish to engage in "the defense of harmful material", it does want to advocate for "reform, developer voice, and platform accountability", calling for developers' works to be assessed "fairly, transparently, and contextually".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/igda-statement-adult-game-bans-steam.jpg?itok=4TKURuPY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/igda-statement-adult-game-bans-steam.jpg?itok=_5FVIrWG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The IGDA says platforms like Steam aren't assessing adult games fairly or contextually.</figcaption></figure><p>The IGDA laments the sudden ways in which platforms like Steam and Itch.io are delisting and banning adult-oriented content, bemoaning the "lack of transparency around enforcement criteria, sudden shifts in policy, and...absence of appeal pathways" open to developers.</p>

<p>As the IGDA points out, these issues can lead to developers losing income, not to mention damage to their reputation; after all, some might be less likely to buy a developer's next game if they learn the previous effort was banned due to content Steam or Itch.io deem objectionable.</p>

<p>Not only that, but these policies can have a "disproportionate impact on marginalized voices", as the IGDA says. Censorship the association describes as "overreaching" may have a greater impact on "queer, trans, femme-identifying, and POC developers".</p>

<p>So, what does the IGDA recommend? The association is calling for clearer guidelines on what content is prohibited, as well as "timely communication" if action is taken. That's in addition to greater appeal pathways for developers, "advisory panels", and regular transparency reports.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/itch.io-adult-content-bans-igda.jpg?itok=3geS6vM7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/itch.io-adult-content-bans-igda.jpg?itok=rYqnAEAx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Itch.io has also been enacting adult content delistings in recent days.</figcaption></figure><p>This all began a couple of weeks ago, when a report by the activist group <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Collective Shout</a> alleged that platforms like Steam and Itch.io were hosting content that glorified sexual abuse and contravened the guidelines of payment processors like PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard.</p>

<p>Following that campaign's commencement, both Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itch-io-deindexes-adult-pages" rel="nofollow">and Itch.io</a>&nbsp;began deindexing and delisting adult games from their platforms, the rationale being that if payment processors objected, then they may withdraw their services, leaving customers unable to pay for games.</p>

<p>However, this scorched-earth approach has already begun to affect creators it arguably shouldn't even go near.&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>creator Cara Cadaver, for instance, recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" rel="nofollow">reported that her game had been banned from Steam</a>, despite the fact it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer" rel="nofollow">about as far from a glorification of sexual abuse or violence</a> as it's possible to get.</p>

<p>Let's hope the IGDA's statement stops this issue from getting too out of hand. It's all too easy to imagine a world where developers don't feel confident creating games with any adult themes in them at all for fear of upsetting nebulous organizations that have very little to do with the games they're causing to get banned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Godbreakers</em> is a multiplayer roguelike with some interesting ideas but a lot to prove. It’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this year and hoping to reverse a recent trend of underwhelming games by parent publisher Thunderful, which was just purchased by Atari amid its latest round of layoffs. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196307" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="657" data-playlist="196307,196539,195891" data-current="196307"><div><p>10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21857.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Godbreakers</em> is a third-person action game in which you brawl your way through short levels to take on big arena boss fights. You can do it solo or in squads of up to four players, with loot and upgrades to collect along the way. One of the key things differentiating <em>Godbreakers</em> in a fun but overcrowded genre is a mechanic that allows players to explode low-health enemies and steal their powers. The one-shot abilities offer DPS, crowd control, and other benefits with the potential to augment the usual roguelike buildcrafting with an extra layer of strategy. </p><p>I played a recent demo that left me intrigued but somewhat unconvinced. The action is fairly tight, with cancelable animations, responsive dodge dashing, and some crisp combos, including a fun slide attack that feels surprisingly good for this type of game. But the demo didn’t leave me with a good sense of the overall flow of a playthrough, or whether levels will be less boring and more visually interesting in the finished game. A loadout menu back at the home base before launching missions also showed cosmetics for customizing character appearances, along with possible ambitions for the game that the demo that I played seemed nowhere close to supporting. </p><p>Ultimately, whether <em>Godbreakers</em> can turn a bullet point list of decent but familiar gameplay ideas into a fun co-op arcade roguelike experience will come down to how the loot, upgrades, and RNG-fueled progression of each run feels. That’s one of the more difficult things to get a sense of from a short demo, and it’s also the one quality that’s often make-or-break for roguelikes without a strong visual style or other distinctive qualities. In other words, my time with the demo gave me a sense of a version of <em>Godbreakers </em>that could be worth making time for, but I’m not sure that’s a version that can launch in the next few months. </p><p>The game is being made by To The Sky, a recently formed team led by an ex-EA development director named Jugo Mirkovic, and which Thunderful, publisher of the <em>SteamWorld</em> series and other games, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-acquires-to-the-sky-games-studio&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thunderful-acquires-to-the-sky-games-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased back in 2021</a></span>. “We shopped around with this game quite a bit,” he told <em>Kotaku </em>during a recent developer presentation. “The premise of the game is still kind of similar to what we pitched, but we found the fluidity and the gameplay a bit after we pitched the game. We wanted to pitch a combat kind of action, melee, roguelike. That’s what we pitched. But we ended up with something a lot more fluid, and that surprised even us.”</p><p>The studio stresses that <em>Godbreakers</em> is very much gameplay-first, which certainly comes across in the demo. But these days, games that aren’t firing on all cylinders—story, art, unique mechanics—can be hard to make time for when there are dozens of new games coming out every week. Thunderful also published<em> Reignbreaker</em> earlier this year, a neat-looking punk take on <em>Hades</em> that struggled to connect with enough players. The studio behind it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-fizbin-shutting-down-after-reignbreaker-s-mid-march-release&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-fizbin-shutting-down-after-reignbreaker-s-mid-march-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shut down before it even released</a></span>.<em> Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em>, a roguelike spin-off of the whimsical gothic adventure from 2021, faced a similar uphill battle. One negative review praised the look and gameplay but said the progression during each new run felt too shallow to stick with. </p><p>Thunderful blamed weak sales of <em>The Eternal Die</em> for its latest round of layoffs announced on Tuesday. “It is unfortunate to have to implement further operational measures that affect some of our colleagues,” Thunderful chairman Patrick Svensk told investors. “At the same time, I am convinced that this is the right path for Thunderful to create an efficient organization within the publishing business where our announced release pipeline remains intact.<em>” </em></p><p>Amid rising debt, Atari (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-life-death-death-death-death?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-life-death-death-death-death?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back from the dead again, this time maybe for good</a></span>) announced today that it has taken a controlling stake in Thunderful for just  $5 million. That bargain bin price comes after years of great games—<em>Viewfinder</em>, <em>Planet of Lana, SteamWorld Heist 2</em>—that didn’t do well enough to make up for all of the other missed bets. Hopefully, <em>Godbreakers</em> can end up bucking that trend instead of becoming the latest casualty of it. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/godbreakers-roguelike-trailer-demo-atari-thunderful-1851787237]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2><strong>When is the Battlefield 6 open beta?</strong></h2><p>There is no release date yet for the Battlefield 6 open beta, but online speculation suggests it will begin in early August.</p><h2><strong>How to get into the Battlefield 6 open beta</strong></h2><p>Given it's an open beta, presumably anyone will be able to access the Battlefield 6 test. If it works like other open betas, players will be able to find the download from their store of choice and go from there.</p><h2><strong>What's in the Battlefield 6 open beta?</strong></h2><p>The contents of the Battlefield 6 open beta have not been announced, but it's expected the beta will allow players to try out some of the maps and modes. Battlefield Studios also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-confirmed-will-include-this-key-change/1100-6533303/" data-ref-id="1100-6533303">already confirmed</a> that the beta will allow players to choose either an "open" or "closed" weapon setup.</p><p>"Why not both?" the developer said. In the open beta, players can choose playlists that have signature weapons locked to a specific class, or not. "More to come," the developer said.</p><p>Older titles, like the much-loved Battlefield 4, had class-locked weapons, but Battlefield 2042 introduced the ability for players in any class to choose whatever weapon they wanted. Some portion of the audience didn't enjoy this, while others embraced this expanded freedom. It appears DICE is trying to appease both audiences by giving them the option in Battlefield 6.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540239-bf6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540239" data-ratio="0.55546875" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540239-bf6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540239"></a><figcaption>Battlefield 6's open beta is on the way.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540239-bf6.jpg"></figure><p>Battlefield 6 has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-campaign-is-inspired-by-this-movie-and-tv-show/1100-6531514/" data-ref-id="1100-6531514">campaign mode</a>, too, along with the rumored return of the Portal mode and a potential battle royale mode. The open beta, however, is only expected to offer up a multiplayer trial.</p><h2><strong>Does progress from the beta carry forward?</strong></h2><p>EA has not officially announced the specifics of the Battlefield 6 open beta, but history suggests that progress from the beta will not carry forward to the full game when it releases. This is how things normally work, and it's expected that will continue with Battlefield 6's open beta.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is the first new Battlefield game since 2021's tepidly received Battlefield 2042. A release date hasn't been announced, but speculation suggests it's launching on October 10. That's about a month before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s rumored November 14 release date.</p>

                <p>Despite the ongoing problems and constant shuttering of live service games, it's looking like Warner Bros still wants a piece of that questionable pie. A job listing at Warner Bros Games Montreal for an <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/en/jobs/r000096070/" rel="nofollow ">executive producer role</a> went live recently (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/following-suicide-squads-flop-warner-bros-is-hiring-for-another-live-service-game/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), which explicitly makes mention of live service titles. The role would "oversee post-launch content and live service strategy," for one, and it also notes that having a "deep understanding of the full game development lifecycle, including live services," would be beneficial experience.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a couple of mentions of overseeing live operation processes, so it certainly seems like whatever WB Games Montreal is working on will have some kind of live service element. That obviously might raise some eyebrows for a couple of reasons.</p>

                <p>Get ready to draw, doodle, animate, and compose as Mario Paint has returned for the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 via the Nintendo Classics Online library. Originally released in 1992 for the Super NES, Mario Paint turned your console into a full-on art studio, complete with a mouse and a whole world of creative tools. Now, a new generation can jump in and create colorful masterpieces, goofy animations, and original tunes--all with a modern twist.</p><p>On Nintendo Switch 2, you can use the Joy-Con 2’s new mouse-style controls to sketch, paint, and animate. Prefer a traditional setup? Plug in a compatible USB mouse--sold separately--on either Switch model and go old-school. And yes, the iconic music maker is back too, so get ready to compose your next virtual jam with chirping cats and bobbing mushrooms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8hd9D6ImM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ok8hd9D6ImM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Coloring Book is back with fresh designs and your favorite Nintendo characters to fill in, freestyle, or remix however you want. If you're feeling competitive, Gnat Attack is back to perfect your mouse skills.</p><p>If you're a Nintendo Switch Online member, you can save your creations and share them online. On Switch 2, GameChat2 lets you connect with voice, video, or screen share, so you can sketch, animate, or just hang out and watch your friends draw a very questionable Yoshi. Let the creative chaos begin.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-the-lukewarm-reception-to-battlefield-2042-fans-seem-to-be-getting-behind-battlefield-6-as-steam-wishlist-numbers-soar.1256067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Battlefield 6 was officially unveiled earlier this month, and it looks like so far the community is keen for the upcoming release, despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042s-opening-weekend-has-been-a-disaster">somewhat lacklustre initial reception to its predecessor Battlefield 2042</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7355565272528826369-FoP1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8">a LinkedIn post</a> shared by Alinea Analytics CEO Rickard Linder, following the debut of Battlefield 6's reveal trailer last week, the game racked up nearly 500,000 Steam wishlists over the weekend (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wishlist-on-steam-half-million/">Insider Gaming</a>). Linder added roughly 60 percent of those who added Battlefield 6 to their wishlist had played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>.</p>
<p>This isn't too shabby when you consider that former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-review-dices-magic-fps-formula-gets-spread-too-thin">Eurogamer editor in chief Martin Robinson called Battlefield 2042 "the weakest Battlefield in some time"</a> when it first released in 2021. To be fair, the team did work on improving Battlefield 2042, and in 2023 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-with-humility-and-hustle-dice-might-yet-win-the-war">Eurogamer noted DICE had "course-corrected in dramatic fashion"</a>, though the developer would likely "have to wait for the next iteration to see its efforts rewarded". Given those wishlist numbers, it seems this may indeed be the case.</p>

<p>Like I said, we got our first look at Battlefield 6 last week, courtesy of a new trailer. While a firm release date was not provided as part of this reveal, the disclaimer URL featured in the video takes you to a page that says: "This promotional offer expires October 10, 2025. Code expires October 10, 2027." <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-finally-revealed-with-a-dedicated-multiplayer-reveal-coming-next-week">This indicates that pre-sell offers end on October 10, and that a release date for Battlefield 6 may be October 11, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>A separate multiplayer reveal is scheduled for later this week, on 31st July.</p>
<p>Aside from what has been officially announced, we already know a fair amount about the next Battlefield entry. Leaks from the Battlefield Labs tests revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">Rush will be coming back to Battlefield 6</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">single player details have spilled out into the internet</a>, and a variety of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">weapons that'll be usable in the full release have made their way online, too</a>. Then, just this weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leaks-keep-on-coming-this-time-its-the-battle-royale-map">Battlefield 6's Battle Royale map popped up online</a>.</p>
