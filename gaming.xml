The film sees the return of Michael Keaton as the ghost with the most and Winona Ryder as Lydia. It also stars Jenna Ortega as Lydia’s daughter who ends up following in her mother’s footsteps and getting involved with Beetlejuice. And it seems a lot of people were very excited to watch this legacy sequel, as the movie is making bank at the box office. <br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-2-opening-day-1236135898/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-2-opening-day-1236135898/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In its opening weekend</a></span>, <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> brought in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2049403/?ref_=bo_se_r_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2049403/?ref_=bo_se_r_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$145.4 million globally</a></span>, with $110 million of that coming just from the United States. The original film, released in 1988, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0094721/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0094721/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opened with $8 million and would end its run at the box office with $74 million</a></span>.

I feel real good about myself.” And I’m not surprised he feels good, as<em> Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> earned the second-highest opening weekend box office for a September release in history. </p><p><em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> doesn’t have a ton of competition coming soon either, and <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> from Marvel is finally running out of steam. So the PG-13 legacy sequel from Tim Burton is likely to keep making money at the box office, especially as we get closer to Halloween and families hit the theaters looking for a fun but spooky movie to enjoy. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Still, perhaps the most egregious omission was the lack of <em>The Answer</em>, the meaty, playable epilogue that was included in the 2007 <em>Persona 3 FES </em>re-release. Though there’s been some controversy about Atlus <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-dlc-the-answer-expansion-pass-1851313160&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-dlc-the-answer-expansion-pass-1851313160">making it a paid DLC</a></span> as opposed to packaging it into the main game, I still find this approach to adding new characters, story, and dungeons at the end of a game I’ve already played preferable to how Atlus went about repackaging <em>Persona 4 </em>and <em>5</em>. The sequels’ “definitive editions” were added new story and characters interwoven into the original plot, requiring you to rebuy and replay the game to see what was new. Back in the PS2 days, <em>The Answer </em>was a divisive addition to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-ending-aigis-makoto-mc-dies-fes-answer-1851276131&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-ending-aigis-makoto-mc-dies-fes-answer-1851276131">a stellar ending</a></span> some still argue might not have needed an epilogue in the first place, and a lot of the misgivings I had with the original have been faithfully recreated in <em>Reload</em>. But as a coda to <em>Persona 3</em>, I’m still drawn in by how <em>The Answer</em> unpacks the less glamorous realities of what the original game had to say. Spoilers for the original game follow.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h904"><a id=""></a><strong>How do you follow up an ending as good as <em>Persona 3</em>’s?</strong></h2><p><em>The Answer </em>begins weeks after the end of <em>Persona 3</em>, during which the protagonist, Makoto Yuki, gave his life to defeat Nyx, a malevolent entity hellbent on destroying the planet. The epilogue starts fairly quiet, as the demon-fighting high school students of the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad are barely able to look at each other. They turn in their Persona-summoning tools, grieving not only the loss of their leader and friend but also the time they spent with one another in the Iwatodai Dormitory in the past year.</p><figure id="" data-id="a349d61a4f20ab61e650d4119839bd34" data-recommend-id="image://a349d61a4f20ab61e650d4119839bd34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Akihiko and Ken stand ready for battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Akihiko and Ken stand ready for battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a349d61a4f20ab61e650d4119839bd34" data-recommend-id="image://a349d61a4f20ab61e650d4119839bd34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Akihiko and Ken stand ready for battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The original ending of <em>Persona 3 </em>is so spectacular because it ends with a group of friends joyfully coming together, proclaiming that their love for each other has given them each purpose throughout their journey, all while their leader slowly falls into a deep sleep never to wake up again. It loudly declares that human connection makes life worth living while underlying its impermanence, as the centerpiece that ties them all together is drifting away before their eyes. On its own, it’s a perfect encapsulation of everything <em>Persona 3</em> has to say, but one naturally wonders how a group so invigorated would react to such a devastating blow. <em>The Answer </em>thoughtfully explores this question and is careful not to undo something that was already perfect.<br></p><p>Aigis, the Persona-using android of the group, was the last person to speak to Makoto before his passing, and she is taking things particularly hard. She thought she’d found a reason to live in protecting their team leader, and now that he’s gone, she’s trying to find a reason to keep living with all these human emotions she’s taken on. She’s the star of <em>The Answer</em>, but everyone in SEES is processing this differently. While some are trying to find reasons to bring the group together as the school year ends, others are actively avoiding the friends they’ve made so they don’t have to face the pain of having lost another piece of their collective puzzle. But circumstance brings these teens together and forces them to face each other and their grief once more.</p><p>SEES finds themselves in a time loop within their dorm as a new, shadow-infested dungeon opens up below the building. The phenomenon is similar to the base game’s Dark Hour, in which the real world is overtaken by a paranormal horde of demons. They can’t leave the boundaries of their old home until they face the horrors below, now with the help of a new android named Metis claiming to be Aigis’ sister. The time loop mostly gives a reason for <em>The Answer </em>to boil down the <em>Persona </em>formula to its barest core parts, shaving off the life simulation and time management elements for a much more streamlined story. But ironically, the time loop is an appropriate framing considering how repetitive and grindy <em>The Answer </em>feels compared to the main game.</p><figure id="" data-id="4dc809b5a34bcd6483742c6af37337f2" data-recommend-id="image://4dc809b5a34bcd6483742c6af37337f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aigis casts an ice spell on a shadow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aigis casts an ice spell on a shadow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4dc809b5a34bcd6483742c6af37337f2" data-recommend-id="image://4dc809b5a34bcd6483742c6af37337f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aigis casts an ice spell on a shadow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Aigis and company spend most of <em>The Answer </em>going through procedurally generated dungeons fighting high-level shadows. As a combat skill check, <em>The Answer </em>is a solid, often challenging, occasionally monotonous test of your understanding of <em>Persona 3</em>’s systems. While you can technically access <em>The Answer </em>without a save file from the base game, it assumes you have knowledge not only of the story of <em>Persona 3</em>, but also the intricacies of its turn-based battles. Aigis gains Makoto’s ability to collect and summon multiple Persona, but you’re starting from scratch with her. Without the social links and other real-world elements to fall back on, <em>The Answer </em>is all dungeon crawling and shadow slaying.<br></p><p>If, over the years, that part of <em>Persona </em>has taken a back seat for you compared to the social elements, <em>The Answer </em>may not scratch an itch for you. Its dungeons are much more repetitive than the base game’s, but it is a concentrated, challenging combat check that will appeal to those who like to get their hands dirty building an arsenal of demons to fight with. Though the difficulty spike in the eleventh hour is just as jarring now as it was in the original, <em>Reload</em>’s quality-of-life improvements do make it at least more tolerable this time around. That isn’t to say that there aren’t still great character moments to be found between dungeons, however, and despite my grievances with <em>The Answer</em>’s structure, I was truly enthralled by the story building between the margins.</p><p>At the end of each dungeon, one of the members of SEES is confronted with a moment from their past. For some, this is recent, with a few of these flashbacks occurring during <em>Persona 3</em> proper. For others, it’s years before meeting their teammates. These memories are put on display for all to see, and in most cases, it’s from a painful time in their lives. The members of SEES have all lived through tragedy, and that pain has brought them into this line of demon-hunting extracurricular activities.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="2b11db18276eb342ca34de57faea795d" data-recommend-id="image://2b11db18276eb342ca34de57faea795d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young Akihiko says &quot;Sorry, but I don't see any reason to attend a school that places second,&quot; to a scout." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A young Akihiko says &quot;Sorry, but I don't see any reason to attend a school that places second,&quot; to a scout." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b11db18276eb342ca34de57faea795d" data-recommend-id="image://2b11db18276eb342ca34de57faea795d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young Akihiko says &quot;Sorry, but I don't see any reason to attend a school that places second,&quot; to a scout." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Persona 3 </em>posits that human connection helps us carry our burdens, but throughout each of these memories, we see how those same bonds open us up to more hardship. Before any of them had even met one another, most of the members of SEES had either lost someone important to them, whether it was a parent or a sibling, or they felt like they had someone to cherish in the first place. And then they faced more loss throughout their quest to stop the Dark Hour as the broody loner Shinji died protecting one of their own. Then, when all was said and done, they saved the world, but at the cost of their leader. How many times do these kids have to lose someone just to keep on living?<br></p><p>Well, the hard truth is, they will continue to lose people. Death is a natural fact of life, and every time that you’re reminded of that, it never stops hurting. <em>Persona 3</em>’s entire deal is that even though death comes for us all, life has meaning because we find people who make even the hardest day worth living through. <em>The Answer </em>is <em>Persona 3</em> having to push its team to its limit and put that belief into practice.</p><h2 id="h905"><a id=""></a><strong><em>The Answer</em> can be frustrating, but its message is worth the grind</strong></h2><p>There’s a (compelling) argument to be made that <em>Persona 3 </em>didn’t need an epilogue. It’s still fascinating to look back on the original game’s ending and find <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/psp/971508-shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-portable/answers/342360-did-mc-die&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/psp/971508-shin-megami-tensei-persona-3-portable/answers/342360-did-mc-die" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum threads</a></span> of people trying to figure out what happened before <em>The Answer </em>wrote it in stone. But after the original strongly asserted that even in the face of death our bonds to one another give life meaning, it’s perhaps necessary for <em>The Answer </em>to show the work.</p><p>If you’ve lost someone important to you, whether through death or circumstance, you know that grief is not linear. We learn lessons each time it happens, but it doesn’t take away the new pain we feel when we lose someone once more. Shinji’s death could not prepare SEES for Makoto’s just as every other person they lost could not prepare them for the new, altogether different pain they’d feel each time someone slipped through their fingers into whatever comes next. No matter how many times you accept that loss is just part of life, you fall into the same stages of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. <em>The Answer </em>gives <em>Persona 3</em>’s cast and the player some grace to feel these emotions, dive into the ugliness of the worst of them, and come back on the other side ready to heal and move forward.<br></p><p>Structurally, <em>The Answer </em>is an often frustrating epilogue that shaves off some of the best parts of <em>Persona </em>games. Thankfully, <em>Reload</em>’s quality-of-life updates make the grind more tolerable and the remake adds enough small social elements like reading books and watching movies with your friends that it doesn’t feel like it’s all business. But as a meditation on grief, it feels like a kindness afforded to characters who once had to rile in the ambiguity of the original ending. It would have been easy for <em>Persona 3 </em>to end on a nihilistic note, showing the entire group fall apart without their leader and denying all the lessons they learned. But grief never really goes away. We just learn to help each other live with it a little more each day.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">It's funny to think that, despite the cutesy aesthetics and family-friendly appeal, the two longest-running multiplayer Mario franchises seem specifically designed to promote conflict amongst groups of friends. From blue shells to King Boos, Mario Kart and Mario Party have spent decades seemingly committed to fostering as much division among their players as possible--my wife once exclaimed, "I do not love you" when I beat her to the finish line of a flagpole minigame in 2018's Super Mario Party. We are, as of the time of writing, still together.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-party-jamboree/" data-ref-id="5000-632917">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>--Nintendo's latest attempt to drive families apart through play--is the third Mario Party game to release on Nintendo Switch, and the first to combine both traditional and motion controls. At a preview event last month, the key word Nintendo used was "more"--more boards, more minigames, more characters, more modes--and as such, there are more ways to drive your loved ones up the wall, too.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Super Mario Party Jamboree Offers Many More Ways To Fall Out With Your Friends</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The nastiest of these is the new Star Steal Trap, an item that turns any chosen space on the board into a veritable landmine, stealing a Star from any player who happens to be unfortunate enough to stop there. This is Mario Party in a nutshell--a game that is, at any given time, simultaneously exhilarating and cruel, glorious and devastating, all at the mercy of a dice roll.</p><p dir="ltr">The main offering in Super Mario Party Jamboree is, of course, Mario Party mode. The long-established format of board-game traversal interspersed with minigames remains more or less unchanged from the original offering on the N64 some 26(!) years ago. This time around there are seven boards to choose from, including two returning favorites: Mario's Rainbow Castle from Mario Party and Western Land from Mario Party 2.</p><p dir="ltr">In our demo, we played around 30 minutes (or five rounds) of Mario Party mode on Mega Wiggler's Tree Party, a new forest-themed board, with one route taking players across a giant sleeping Wiggler at its center. Landing on an Event Space rings a bell that briefly wakes Wiggler from his slumber, sending him charging around in a circle and changing the layout of the board. Items such as special dice and warp pipes return, alongside some new additions, but it's essentially classic Mario Party as you know and love/hate it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364022-mario2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4364022" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1552" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364022-mario2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4364022"></a><figcaption>Plenty of fan-favorite maps make their return.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364022-mario2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Also returning is a dedicated minigame mode, this time called Minigame Bay to match Jamboree's island theme. Here, players can take on various combinations of minigame challenges and playlists, as well as enjoy a Free Play mode for people who want to pick and choose their favorites from the collection of new and returning minigames.</p><p dir="ltr">Returning from Mario Party Superstars is a Daily Challenge mode, which collects three minigames in a playlist centered around a theme--we played Minigame Munchies, featuring three food-based minigames, and Master Strategist, made up of games that encouraged tactical thinking. Completing the challenges earned some kind of currency or score called Party Points, but it's unclear from our preview what these points are used for.</p><p dir="ltr">Jamboree also adds two new entries to its suite of modes: Koopathlon and Bowser Kaboom Squad. Though it's possible to play these modes with CPU opponents, they are clearly designed with online play in mind, though this also means only one player can play per console.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364023-mario3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4364023" data-ratio="0.56258064516129" data-width="1550" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364023-mario3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4364023"></a><figcaption>Over 110 minigames are playable.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364023-mario3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Koopathlon sees 20 players competing to earn coins in minigames to propel their character around a board, with the novel touch that the board progression and minigame play happen simultaneously via a split-screen layout. Though this feels a bit cluttered on-screen, the board essentially acts as a live leaderboard of players ranked by their coin-collecting prowess and can largely be ignored. The overall impression is of a kind of Fall Guys-esque battle royale game shot through a Mario Party lens, though from what I saw, no one gets eliminated, and players are only ever competing indirectly.</p><p dir="ltr">Koopathlon's minigames are specifically designed for that mode and feel a bit slight in comparison to the Mario Party suite of minigames--the three we played included using cannons to collect coins, hopping over spiked poles, and a Temple Run-esque endless runner. After three of these minigames, a special Bowser-themed minigame begins, featuring all 20 players, offering a prize item for victors and a penalty to their board position for losers. The Bowser minigame we played involved carefully jumping over fireballs and, once again, felt slight, though there was at least some chaotic fun in watching all 20 players on-screen at once.</p><p dir="ltr">Much stranger is Bowser Kaboom Squad, where eight players work cooperatively to collect bombs and load a cannon, all while avoiding a kaiju-sized Impostor Bowser. After the cannon is loaded, it blasts Bowser and knocks a chunk off his health bar, and players have five 90-second rounds to defeat him. Every 90 seconds, a cooperative minigame offers up the chance to gain items to help the group.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364024-screenshot2024-09-09095650.png" data-ref-id="1300-4364024" data-ratio="0.56245954692557" data-width="1545" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364024-screenshot2024-09-09095650.png" data-ref-id="1300-4364024"></a><figcaption>They are here to observe the mayhem between friends.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4364024-screenshot2024-09-09095650.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">It is an utterly bizarre mode that feels half-baked, with a selection of prefab-looking maps and uncharacteristically clunky movement for a Nintendo game. It's hard to imagine Bowser Kaboom Squad diverting anyone's attention from the other modes for very long.</p><p dir="ltr">Though, in one sense, it's admirable that Nintendo keeps adding novel modes to the Mario Party franchise, it's difficult to understand the value of single-player-per-console modes like Koopathlon and Bowser Kaboom Squad in a Mario Party game. It's hard to escape the feeling that the core appeal of Super Mario Party Jamboree is in competing with, and screwing over, your friends, preferably when they're sitting in the same room.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on this preview, Super Mario Party Jamboree won't change anybody's mind about the franchise. With the right crowd, however, it's as much fun as Mario Party has ever been, and with seven boards, 20 characters, and over 110 minigames, it looks set to be the most Mario Party for your money on the Switch to date.</p><p dir="ltr">Super Mario Party Jamboree launches for Nintendo Switch on October 17.</p>

                <p>Carmen Sandiego is back in her first game since 2015's Carmen Sandiego Returns. For the first time in franchise history, you'll play as the super thief, instead of those pursuing her, in a reimagined new game simply called Carmen Sandiego.</p><p>However, Sandiego has given up a life of crime and works as a counter-thief, tracking down V.I.L.E. operatives across the globe. The game takes style and plot cues from the Netflix animated show, which started in 2019.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dtqooGHYeQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9dtqooGHYeQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As for the gameplay, you'll control Sandiego herself, utilizing gadgets like a hang-glider and grappling hook to get around. Carmen Sandiego appears to have a more 3D-platformer flavor than the original games. The trailer shows Sandiego pickpocketing a man, so there may be some stealth elements. As you obtain clues and information, you can identify and capture V.I.L.E. operatives.</p><p>How much "edutainment" will be a part of the game remains to be seen. However, you will explore many locations across the world. Confirmed locals include Iceland, Ghana, Egypt, India, Japan, and Australia.</p><p>Carmen Sandiego has no release date yet--just a window of Q1 2025. When it drops, it will release on PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Playstation, and mobile. It will be included on the Netflix app. You can wishlist the game now.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">After 10 years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> will no longer see one big expansion per year, nor the seasonal or episodic content drops in between--in 2025, it'll get <em>two</em> expansions, with four "major updates" per year.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside some of its plays to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-is-celebrating-10-years-of-destiny-2-with-a-long-unattainable-armor-set/1100-6526351/" data-ref-id="1100-6526351">celebrate Destiny's 10-year annivesary</a>, Bungie laid out some of the details for Destiny 2's future in a series of new blog posts outlining plans for Destiny 2: Frontiers, the next phase of the game now that its current story is being wrapped up in The Final Shape expansion and the three Episodes that follow. As <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/new_frontiers">game director Tyson Green wrote</a>, in 2025, Destiny 2 will see two "medium" expansions instead of one big one, which was the approach Bungie has stuck with ever since the release of the Forsaken expansion in 2018.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364001-d2_frontiers_roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364001" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364001-d2_frontiers_roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364001"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2 roadmap for 2025.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364001-d2_frontiers_roadmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We’ve loved creating annual Expansions and are especially proud of The Final Shape. But the truth is that they dominate almost all our development effort," Green wrote. "We need to free ourselves up to explore and innovate with how we deliver Destiny 2 content so we can invest in areas of the game that will feel more impactful to players."</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post also included a roadmap that gives an idea of what we can expect from Destiny 2 as it moves forward into Frontiers. The first of the two expansions, Codename: Apollo, is slated for Summer 2025. Codename: Behemoth, the second, will launch in Winter 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside each expansion will come a "season," though not as we previously knew it. That season will last the six months between one expansion and the next, although Bungie shared no details about how the season might go about including additional stories to tell beyond the expansions--so don't take this to mean that Bungie is returning to the old model of four seasons year, each with its own linear story.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, the seasons will include two major updates--one with the launch of the expansion, and one three months later. It sounds like the idea here is that the first major update with an expansion will introduce new content that goes with that expansion, while the second three months later will "refresh the Core Game with new and reprised content." That content could be activities like Strikes or Exotic missions, new activities, weekly events, meta and balance changes, and rewards. Seems like the plan here is for Bungie to hit Destiny 2 with some kind of significant refresh every three months. Each major expansion is also slated to come with a new reward pass, which is likely to be fairly similar to what's in the game now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4364002-apollo2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364002" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2688" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4364002-apollo2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364002"></a><figcaption>Codename Apollo concept art.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4364002-apollo2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Bungie's roadmap details that all four major updates will be content that is free to everyone, and that leaves the implication that expansions, on the other hand, will be paid content, as usual.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the expansions, they may be very different from what we've seen in the past as well. The expansions are also looking to move away from the previous "one-shot" campaign structure that Destiny 2 is known for; instead of a new expansion telling a new story, Bungie is looking for the expansions to provide different experiences, and maybe to even explore different game genres within Destiny 2.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are excited to try new things that challenge your idea of what a Destiny experience can be," Green wrote. "We are actively prototyping non-linear campaigns, exploration experiences similar to the Dreaming City or Metroidvanias, and even more unusual formats like roguelikes or survival shooters. Each expansion will present a new opportunity to try something different."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364003-apollo1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364003" data-ratio="0.4" data-width="2400" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364003-apollo1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364003"></a><figcaption>Codename Apollo concept art.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4364003-apollo1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Non-linear campaign" is another buzz phrase that Bungie describes as a big departure for Destiny 2. As narrative director Alison Lührs details, Codename: Apollo is a "nonlinear character-driven adventure." In it, you'll see a campaign that includes multiple available story threads, which you'll then pick your way through, rather than just going from mission to story beat to mission to story beat.</p><p>"And the options you didn’t choose? Don’t worry, those other options are still open for you to go back and play through. You’ll need to!" Lührs wrote.</p><p dir="ltr">Lührs says Codename: Apollo will also kick off a new "multi-year saga" for Destiny 2, similar to the Light and Darkness Saga that just wrapped up with The Final Shape, although that story won't be quite so linear as "the Darkness is coming and we have to fight it." Instead, Lührs describes a series of stories that are thematically wedded together, and that will have a core concept similar in simplicity and expansiveness to Light vs. Dark.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie was very light on details about what that new story will look like, though, or what we can expect for the future of Destiny 2 in terms of where the game will take players and what it'll actually feel like. Bungie also has plans to make major adjustments to how players approach Destiny 2's content and how they earn rewards, with additional blog posts running down all the changes that are coming to the game in the future. If nothing else, Codename: Frontiers sounds like it'll be a major departure for Destiny 2 from what players are used to, and with the developer struggling through major layoffs over the last two years, those may be necessary to keep the game alive.</p>

			<p>Today is a momentous occasion for Bungie and Destiny fans, as the franchise is officially 10 years old. On September 9, 2014,<a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-was-never-in-development-bungie-will-now-be-run-by-playstation-studios-head-say-insiders/"> Bungie</a> released Destiny, a sci-fi MMO where players could become Guardians and explore the online universe. Just three years later, Destiny was closed down and replaced with Destiny 2, where the game was initially released as a pay-to-play game. However, it soon became free-to-play in 2019, where the game has received many expansions, such as Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken, and The Witch Queen, to name a few. The most recent expansion was called The Final Shape, which became the fuel to change the seasonal model. To celebrate the anniversary of Destiny as a franchise, players will be able to get nostalgic in-game armor and physical products and look at some art to revel in the nostalgia. Additionally, Bungie has provided details on Codename: Frontiers, the future of Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Major changes are coming for Destiny 2's future. The game will receive two medium-sized expansions and four major free content updates annually. This change hopes to enhance the player experience by introducing a non-linear story, meaning players won't be forced into purchasing expansions if they don't want to. In addition, there will be improvements to the core game activities and the reward system.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Players will be able to see these changes that utilize the new model starting with Codename Apollo, a nonlinear character-driven adventure and the first edition of the new expansion model, set to release in the Summer of 2025.</p>
<p>To help keep the community informed, Bungie will release a Developer Insight Deep Dives series over the coming months. Bungie has also <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny_10_anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a blog post</a> explaining Destiny's long history and an art exhibition in LA, New York City, and London. The exhibition entrance is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>In addition to this, players will be able to experience the nostalgia of Destiny by obtaining a new set of armor for each class, which is inspired by the original concept designs from Destiny. Players must go to the Tower in the Lost City in The Pale Heart to get hold of these armor sets.</p>
<p>For those who did buy The Final Shape, players can earn the Legend title in Destiny 2 by completing The Final Shape Legendary campaign, wearing the anniversary armor during specific activities, exploring the Pale Heart, and completing specific objectives. If you manage to earn the title before September 24, you'll be given early access through Bungie Rewards to purchase the new NERF LMTD Destiny 2 Ace of Spades Blaster before its official release on October 8.</p>
<p>While Destiny has been around for ten years, this new expansion model could see it last another 10.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-sim-mirthwood-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fantasy-life-sim-mirthwood-delayed-to-november.976029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-sim-mirthwood-delayed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bad Ridge Games and publisher V Publishing have announced that upcoming fantasy life sim&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>has been delayed by a couple of months.</p>
<p><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>was originally due to arrive on PC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mirthwood-release-date">on Wednesday</a>, but it's now set to arrive on November 6th instead, representing a delay of around two months. Time to dig out that old Shigeru Miyamoto quote, I suppose.</p>
<p>Bad Ridge's Daron Otis says that the delay has been put into effect in order to let the team ensure&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>is "the best it can be on day one", which is a pretty difficult goal to argue with, all things considered.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mirthwood-delayed-combat.jpg?itok=I2K9pEUi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mirthwood-delayed-combat.jpg?itok=AZ0z10Bk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's going to be a little longer before you can play&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Otis says that the team working on&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>is a "small, passionate" one, and that although the team has worked "tirelessly" to create a world players will love to explore, there are still "key areas" that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>According to Otis, those key areas include "performance optimization, localization, and some of the systems" that power&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>. All of these features need to be given "more attention" prior to launch.</p>
<p>Extra development time will, according to a press release, allow&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>'s developers to fine-tune the game, improve its performance, and ensure it's "fully localized for players worldwide", which, again, is a pretty noble goal.</p>
<p>Otis concludes by saying that making&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>'s fans happy is "more of a priority than hitting a date", which is a sentiment I think a lot of major triple-A publishers could still learn from.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>is, it's a fantasy life sim that casts you as a refugee from a continent torn apart by war. You must start again in an "immersive medieval fantasy world sandbox" that features plenty of opportunities to explore, trade, and do battle with its inhabitants.</p>
<p>After it launches, Bad Ridge has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mirthwood-roadmap-post-launch">post-release roadmap in place</a> for&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>, and it's promising multiplayer, mod support, and family dynamics, plus lots more.</p>
<p><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via Steam on November 6th. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272900/Mirthwood/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist the game right here</a> if you want to keep up with it.</p>

            <p>
I recently moved to a suburban neighbourhood where there is lots of relatively "wild" parkland and a few raggedy patches of woodland. I like to walk in the woods around evening time, after a hard day of writing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-things-to-do-while-youre-a-meatshield-in-black-ops-6">stupid listicles about Call Of Duty</a>. Forests are a critical preoccupation of mine, actually - check <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-is-an-amazing-finnish-fairytale-at-the-heart-of-alan-wake-2s-forests">this lumpen thinkypiece I wrote about Alan Wake 2</a> - but they're also spaces for retreat and reflection, where I can shrug off the angst and lose myself in the spectacle of sycamores and silverbirch, arching over the path. Except. Except that sooner or later I start thinking about the roots. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The roots are everywhere, and unseen. I can trace their presence through the differing acoustics of the soil beneath, but I can't map them precisely. I never quite know whether there's one underfoot, at any given moment. According to my layman's understanding of tree physiology (there is probably a more precise term than "tree physiology"), roots drink up water and soil nutrients. Sounds harmless, but drinking is an open-ended practice. A root that drinks up water may surely drink up other fluids. Blood, for example, or tears. The liquefied substance of the human spirit. The direful drippings of bad dreams.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>GCORES PUBLISHING</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
I'm entertaining these fears because I've just been reading the blurb for Roots Devour. It's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> management experience and a card game in which you play a really awful eldritch tree, which is trying to become top Elder God of a forest full of equally awful creatures. This is to be achieved within 30 in-game days by spreading out your roots and "organs" (do trees have organs?), harvesting the blood of other organisms, and dealing with unspecified threats. You can also, seemingly, earn the devotion of wild-eyed human tribes or mastermind their fates from the shadows.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing is presented as the act of spreading cards across a tabletop, which I like inasmuch as I'm now thinking about other card games as secret forests, hopefully not carnivorous ones. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2612690/Roots_Devour/">read more and watch a trailer on Steam</a> - I think there's full English localisation on the way. For a real-time spin on the idea of being a ravenously expanding morass of tendrils, sink your teeth into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/carrion">Carrion</a>.

We’ll have an announcement on the PA saying <em>[does pretend PA voice</em>] ‘Well, stormtroopers have gone down to Toshara and now we have the skeleton crew on site.’ The context will change, just so that we can get people to enjoy those moments as much as possible.”<br></p><p>Sounds good to me! I didn’t find the stealth in <em>Outlaws </em>to be horrible or a dealbreaker, but I’ve talked to plenty of people who are unable to move forward or enjoy the game because of some wonky and overly tough stealth sections. So hopefully this helps people stop failing and lets them enjoy the wonderful <em>Star Wars </em>vibes <em>Outlaws </em>offers. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition, it will need to be a special variant of the island known as Doom’s Cauldron, which has a slight chance of replacing the usual floating island.

The first thing you’ll need to know is that Doom is extremely tall, making him easier to hit than your standard player. He also has 500 HP and Shield and can’t use any items to heal himself. That being said, there are ways to regain health. The first is by killing other players, because you’re evil now. You can also break shield kegs or have a buddy throw chug splashes at you to heal up.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="77d7c4704d429ba1a5cf3d0804b9084a" data-recommend-id="image://77d7c4704d429ba1a5cf3d0804b9084a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Doom Luis contemplates his terrible new powers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doom Luis contemplates his terrible new powers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="77d7c4704d429ba1a5cf3d0804b9084a" data-recommend-id="image://77d7c4704d429ba1a5cf3d0804b9084a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Doom Luis contemplates his terrible new powers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Doom has various powers to enjoy.

His secondary is a bit different, shooting out a straight beam that can be moved around as you fire it. He also has a move called Mystical Gigabomb, and as the name suggests, it’s a giant bomb that you can shoot towards enemies.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="7c463d56ae7b7361945a80006115a4ad" data-recommend-id="image://7c463d56ae7b7361945a80006115a4ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Diving back down as Doom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Diving back down as Doom." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c463d56ae7b7361945a80006115a4ad" data-recommend-id="image://7c463d56ae7b7361945a80006115a4ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Diving back down as Doom." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As for his last few abilities, he can jump high up in the air and hover. While in the air, you can Dive Kick towards anyone near you. On top of that, Doom has the ultimate sprint.<br></p><p>Perhaps the most important thing to know is, if you die as Doom, you won’t be able to come back as him, <em>ever</em>. So be mindful of how aggressively you’re playing, because once Doom is gone, he’s gone. Make the most of your moment.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Every game feels pretty close to their arcade equivalents,, though they obviously pop a bit more on modern screens capable of higher fidelity.<br></p><h2 id="h911"><a id=""></a><strong>Modern classics</strong></h2><p>There are various small settings that can be tweaked/optimized in the <em>Arcade Classics</em> compilation, like the difficulty of your AI opponents, the base speed of the game, and even the starting stage on some occasions. Additionally, training mode can be entered from the game select screen, or when waiting for an online lobby, and showcases all the frame data one could possibly need, as well as a log of inputs.<br></p><p>In action, controls are pretty simplified and each fighting game has a single button, often on the left trigger, which lets you unleash hyper combos easily, kind of like modern controls in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></span>. This setting can be toggled in offline and casual play, and cannot be used in ranked, making mastery of the game less intimidating for novices while refraining from stepping on the toes of competitive players.. Speaking of, the fighting games also come with casual and ranked online matchmaking, though I had difficulty finding anyone to play online with during my preview period due to low player count. To complement the preservation and further propagation of these legendary titles, Capcom has even thrown in some very neat behind-the-scenes features.</p><p>For example, you can view the marquee of every title almost all the time from the menu, which displays the instructions that would’ve been printed onto the actual arcade cabinet, complete with the original diagrams of the joystick and face buttons that come with them. It’s a handy tool tip to have right in the menu, but for the most part it feels like a piece of history you get to carry with you, which extends to a ton of other features here, too. You can freely dip into a museum mode that features concept art and hundreds of music tracks across the seven games, like <em>MvC2</em>’s iconic character select song, individual character themes, as well as opening and ending songs, and you can even skim through all of it while waiting to connect to an online match. The most exciting bit is the scanned design documents that show some of the developer’s processes when making the games—considering how much is done digitally these days, and how secretive the games industry is, it’s astonishing to see handwritten-and-drawn notes and diagrams that lay out the mechanics and layout of the levels of some of these games, like a sequence on a moving vehicle in the port of <em>The Punisher</em> that remained mostly intact from its accompanying design doc.<br></p><h2 id="h912"><a id=""></a><strong>An oldie gets its time in the spotlight</strong></h2><p>On that note, <em>The Punisher </em>is the significant outlier of the collection, since it isn’t a traditional fighting game like the other titles included. Instead, it’s a 2D beat-em-up and its presence here is a pretty big deal: <em>The Punisher </em>is a beloved classic game that never quite made a successful jump to consoles. There is a Sega Genesis port that is widely believed to be inferior to the original arcade version, which has finally now been faithfully ported for the first time ever in this collection .It is also the first game collaboration between Capcom and Marvel Comics, which eventually gave us the rest of the games in this collection (namely the acclaimed <em>Marvel vs. Capcom </em>series), so it’s a significant piece of gaming history, too. And it rips.<br></p><p>I don’t tend to play beat-em-ups (which are deceptively difficult games) often, but after playing through <em>The Punisher</em>,<em> </em>I can understand the hype behind it. The aesthetic of these arcade games has always felt much more in line with the original visions and interpretations of the comic book characters upon which they’re based, and <em>The Punisher </em>certainly has that going for itself. If you were looking for something that looked and felt like a <em>Punisher</em> comic, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better adaptation. Frank Castle <em>looks</em> like the version of him featured in early comics, and he and the game are as gratuitously violent as ever in alignment with their vision. As you wield axes and knives to cut down enemies, it’s refreshing to see them actually bleed, which is otherwise absent from most other beat-em-ups I played growing up, like the <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles </em>series, but feels tonally pitch perfect here.</p><p>In terms of controls, <em>The Punisher</em> is pretty straightforward, but it also has some features that were advanced for its time. For example, Frank and Nick Fury (who’s the second playable character in co-op) don’t quite have a dash, but they do have a directional dodge roll that works along the X-and-Y axis. Upon grabbing an enemy, you can do any one of about three different techniques depending on your inputs, and they each can pick up screen-clearing grenades that saved my life on more than one occasion. When I felt backed into a corner, I could do a spinning leg sweep that worked as an effective parry and doubled as armor for a few seconds. The most stylistic addition comes by way of <em>The Punisher</em>’s firearms, which are only drawn when enemies with guns appear onstage. In these moments, <em>The Punisher </em>automatically locks onto enemies in your vision and lets you unload on them as the game transforms into a shooting gallery, and most of the action is accompanied by comic-accurate onomatopoeias. </p><p>I came away from this collection in awe of the historicity of it all and the bang-up job Capcom’s done preserving these seven titles. And I think that’s the ultimate goal of a project like the <em>Capcom Fighting Collection</em>, right? Yes, I’m obviously going to get mileage out of whooping people and being whooped in return as I take my fights online across the fighting game catalog featured here, but I’ve come away with something new and special and I now get to hold onto it in perpetuity. And now games like <em>The Punisher </em>get to live on outside of someone’s faint memories of playing it more than 30 years ago at an arcade. Now, someone who grew up playing and loving that game and others like it can feasibly share it with someone they love. That ought to be true for more games, and hopefully efforts like this <em>Arcade Classics </em>collection help ensure that eventually comes to pass. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Yu-Gi-Oh fans have been underserved when it comes to replaying some of the best games from the franchise's heyday, but that's all changing with the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9PKCT42?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yu-Gi-Oh: Early Days Collection</a>. What's most exciting about the upcoming compilation is that it includes Game Boy games that didn't release outside of Japan the first time around. Yu-Gi-Oh: Early Days Collection doesn't have a release date, and Konami hasn't revealed the full list of games, but from what we know so far, fans will want to keep this on their radar.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-is-world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-season-1%E2%80%99s-mythic-rotation.975993/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/what-is-world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-season-1s-mythic-rotation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Season 1 of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/">World of Warcraft: The War Within</a> starts tomorrow, which introduces a new Mythic+ season, Raiding and PvP, to engage in and try to bring up your rankings. This season is the first of the new expansion, meaning players will experience some new dungeons to join the game in a Mythic+ setting with Mythic affixes.</p>
<p>This also introduces Nerub-ar Palace on Normal and Heroic difficulty, with LFR getting access to Wing 1 of the raid. For the first week, players will only get to participate in Mythic 0 dungeons, which helps them prepare for the more challenging dungeons ahead. All Mythic+ dungeon difficulties will be available from September 17 onwards.</p>
<p>For those who want to know what to expect from the upcoming season, this guide will explain what Mythic+ dungeons you'll be seeing in the Mythic+ pool, as well as what affixes you'll be coming up against as you climb the Mythic+ rankings.</p>
<h2>What Mythic+ Dungeons Are There in The War Within Season 1?</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24137817/the-war-within-season-1-begins-september-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight new Mythic+ dungeons</a> for players to experience this season, four of which are from The War Within. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ara-Kara, City of Echoes</li>
<li>City of Threads</li>
<li>The Stonevault</li>
<li>The Dawnbreaker</li>
<li>Mists of Tirna Scithe (Shadowlands)</li>
<li>The Necrotic Wake (Shadowlands)</li>
<li>Siege of Boralus (Battle for Azeroth)</li>
<li>Grim Batol (Cataclysm)</li>
</ul>
<p>By participating in Mythic+ dungeons and earning Rating, you can unlock achievements, titles, and a mount for reaching a certain number of Rating.</p>
<p>You can work towards these seasonal rewards in Mythic+ Season 1 of The War Within.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keystone Explorer</strong>: Complete a Mythic+ Dungeon within the time limit during The War Within Season One.</li>
<li><strong>Keystone Conqueror: </strong>Attain a mythic+ Rating of at least 2000 during The War Within Season One—reward: The Tempered title.</li>
<li><strong>Keystone Master</strong>: Attain a Mythic+ Rating of at least 2000 during The War Within Season One—reward: Diamond Mechsuit mount.</li>
<li><strong>Keystone Hero:&nbsp;</strong>Attain a Mythic+ Rating of at least 2500 during The War Within Season One—reward: Luminous Nerubian Catalyst Stone.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you end The War Within Season 1 with a Mythic+ Rating in the top 0.1% of all players in your region, you'll earn the Tempered Hero title.</p>
<h2>Keystone Affixes in The War Within Season 1</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Keystone Affixes are certain attacks or debuffs that provide an extra challenge to the Mythic+ dungeon. The new affixes will be seen as Mythic+ Keystone level 2, where players will see one of the Xal'atath-specific affixes, which are the following:</p>
<p><strong>Xal'atath's Bargain: Ascendant</strong>: Every minute, Xal'atath will summon 10 Orbs of Ascendance that cast Cosmic Ascension. Should the casts go off, the orbs will buff nearby mobs with +20% movement speed and Haste per orb. However, players are able to stop the cast via interruptions, displacement, crowd control, and purging them, which will instead give players a 2% movement speed and Haste buff per orb, which can stack up to a maximum of 20% movement speed and Haste per event.</p>
<p><strong>Xal'atath's Bargain: Voidbound:&nbsp;</strong>While players are in combat, Xal'atath will summon a Void Emissary, who buffs nearby enemies with Dark Prayer. This will reduce the damage taken by 10% every three seconds, with the effect stacking. Once players have defeated the Void Emissary, players will be able to get a +20% ability cooldown rate and a +10% Critical Strike increase that lasts for 20 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Xal'atath's Bargain: Oblivion</strong>: While players are in combat, Xal'atath manifests crystals from the void that can either be absorbed by enemies or the players. Absorbing the crystals before they collide with enemies is advised, as it allows players to gain Void Essence, increasing Mastery and Leech. If the crystals hit the enemies, they will gain a +10% damage reduction per crystal.</p>
<p><strong>Xal'atath's Bargain: Devour</strong>: Every so often, Xal'atath casts a Void Rift shield on all five players that can either be removed by healing or dispelling it. If you fail to remove the shield, it will heal nearby mobs for 10% of their health. Removing a shield will grant a stack of Lingering Void, which grants players +2% health and 4% Critical Strike.</p>
<p>Past Keystone Level 4, players will see Tyrannical or Fortified become active, with the affixes alternating each week. Tyrannical increases Dungeon bosses' health by 30% and damage by 15%. Fortified means non-boss enemies have 20% more health, and their damage increases by up to 20%.</p>
<p>At Keystone Level 7, a new affix named Challenger's Peril becomes active. 15 seconds is subtracted from the dungeon timer each time a player dies instead of the usual 5-second subtraction.</p>
<p>At Keystone Level 10, Fortified and Tyrannical become active at the same time. This means if you were seeing Tyrannical in one week, you might see Fortified instead once you reach Level 10.</p>
<p>At Keystone Level 12, Xalatath's Bargain affixes are replaced with Xal'atath's Guile. This gives enemies a 20% increase in their health and damage, with players no longer receiving the buffs from the Bargain affixes.</p>
<p>This Mythic+ season is shaping up to be very difficult, with players having to be more careful in who they choose to create a Mythic+ team.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2-switching-to-two-expansions-and-four-free-updates-per-year.975990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-new-release-cadence<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie has announced radical changes to the way&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>expansions and updates will be released, and the studio is moving away from its yearly release model going forward.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/new_frontiers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an article titled "New Frontiers"</a>, Bungie marks the tenth anniversary of the&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>franchise by discussing what's next for&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>. The studio said that it "closed a door" with recent expansion&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, and that it's now looking to open "a new one, a weird one, an exciting one".</p>
<p>In short,&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>will now get two "medium"-sized expansions per year, as well as four major free updates. The expansions will be paid, but the updates will be available for all players at no cost.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-release-cadence-expansions-the-final-shape.jpg?itok=hYS1nTeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-release-cadence-expansions-the-final-shape.jpg?itok=G7gdNdUO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny 2</em>'s&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>expansion "closed a door" for Bungie.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Destiny 2</em>'s new expansions will "depart from the one-shot campaign structure" for which the game's expansions have become known, and will instead experiment with uncharted territory for&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>. This could include "exploration experiences", Metroidvania structures, or even "roguelikes or survival shooters".</p>
<p>Additionally, rather than Episodes,&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>will now get four updates per year. Expansions will launch alongside major updates at the start of Seasons, and a second update will follow three months after that, adding content like Strikes, new modes, and new gear.</p>
<p>This new modernization process begins with the expansion currently titled&nbsp;<em>Codename: Apollo</em>, which is set to launch next summer. Bungie describes this expansion as a "nonlinear character-driven adventure".</p>
<p>In essence, whereas the story in previous expansions was an "A to B to C to D" affair, this one will offer more choice, allowing you to explore locations and narrative elements at your own discretion (although the ones you don't pick will still be available later).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-release-cadence-codename-apollo.jpg?itok=wbU0DyHS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-release-cadence-codename-apollo.jpg?itok=6GmermET 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't quite know what&nbsp;<em>Codename: Apollo&nbsp;</em>is yet, but it'll be nonlinear.</figcaption></figure><p>These changes come after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">sweeping layoffs at Bungie</a>, which CEO Pete Parsons called part of a "new path" for the studio. It's also worth noting that the game's most recent major expansion,&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-final-shape-expansion-officially-delayed-to-deliver-even-bigger-and-bolder">was delayed by several months</a>, which may be relevant in Bungie's decision to shift to smaller expansions.</p>
<p>We'll likely get to find out more about Bungie's plans for&nbsp;<em>Codename: Apollo&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>in the coming months. Stay tuned for more on this as and when we get it.</p>

Another time it could be an elephant backpack that can suck up liquid and then spawn platforms in midair. And in Downsize Surprise, it’s a mouse suit that lets you shrink down all teeny.<br></p><p>Thing is, in any other platform game that did this, you’d just shrink down for the level and then explore things in your miniature mode. But in <em>Astro Bot</em>’s level, the entire thing can be played at either size, requiring a combination of the two to complete, and you can switch form at any time you like.</p><p>It’s hard to overstate how complex that is from a level design perspective. Ordinarily, such a gimmick would allow the player to step through a portal, or trigger a change, at predetermined points. To let me, buffoon that I am, just hammer the size change button as often as I want to see what happens—that’s phenomenal. And to make it even better, the transformation feels <em>utterly magical</em>.</p><p>Like in those excellent scenes in the <em>Ant-Man</em> movies when Scott Lang has got the hang of the suit, hitting the button in mid-action and shrinking or growing accordingly never gets old. That flowerbed you were just stomping over is now an obstacle course of leaves and petals to explore. The little wooden trunk you stepped on is now a tunnel you can run through with pick-ups to collect. And then, because you can’t resist the idea, you press the grow button while you’re in the tunnel, and—YES!—it bursts apart and reveals even more goodies to pick up.</p><p>You use the ability in a few other ways I don’t want to mention, because finding them is so much of the joy. I’m more here today to celebrate the absolute beauty of how it’s delivered.</p><figure id="" data-id="a2f8a65c91d37c0dc07ca165b52a3f9f" data-recommend-id="image://a2f8a65c91d37c0dc07ca165b52a3f9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands on a leaf and waves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands on a leaf and waves." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a2f8a65c91d37c0dc07ca165b52a3f9f" data-recommend-id="image://a2f8a65c91d37c0dc07ca165b52a3f9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands on a leaf and waves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s no question at all that <em>Astro Bot</em> leaves this mechanic under-explored. It’s no wonder, given that moments later you’re in Go Go Archipelago with a robo-monkey helping you throw stones at baddies and climb banana-grips up walls to reach twirly-whirly bars that fling you into the sky. If anything, the nonchalance with which Team Asobi utilizes a shrink/grow mechanic better than any game before it is all the more astonishing. “Yeah, we’ve perfected that, but we’re busy and have a great idea about balloons...”<br></p><p>Which brings me back to my provocative opening thesis. Nintendo, you’re being called out here.</p><p>Obviously there’s a new 3D <em>Mario</em> in development, perhaps intended to be released as a launch title for the Switch’s follow-up console next March. It’s been an astonishing seven years since <em>Odyssey</em> was released, and over three years since the prototype for a glorious open-world future, <em>Bowser’s Fury</em>, was tucked in with the Switch release of <em>Super Mario 3D World</em>. So it’s probably too late for me to use my considerable influence to command Nintendo over what to include in the next 3D entry. But in the game after that, Nintendo, you need to return to the concept of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/k2oAwTAzmnU?si=PgPU7z1cLb0Sryen&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/k2oAwTAzmnU?si=PgPU7z1cLb0Sryen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>'s Giant Land</a></span>, but in 3D, and it needs to be constantly innovating on the concept throughout. Got it? Great.</p><figure id="" data-id="9ed81000993a92597b07a23a641640b7" data-recommend-id="image://9ed81000993a92597b07a23a641640b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands in front of a wooden tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands in front of a wooden tunnel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9ed81000993a92597b07a23a641640b7" data-recommend-id="image://9ed81000993a92597b07a23a641640b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Teeny Astro Mouse stands in front of a wooden tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If nothing else, let this missive implore you to play <em>Astro Bot</em>. I was fairly horrified when I saw that Sony is pricing it the same as a AAA 50 hour game, because cutesy 3D platformers are a hard sell at $60. And while I still believe it’d sell far more than twice as many copies at half the price, I can also assure you that the sheer concentrated joy within out-values any number of looter shooters or zombie-fests.<br></p><p>A single level has me thinking Nintendo developers might be wriggling uncomfortably in their seats, realizing that there’s finally some competition out there, another developer capable of cutting a slice from their enormous, delicious pie.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-destiny-2-codename-frontiers/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-reveals-%E2%80%98codename-frontiers%E2%80%99-expansions-for-destiny-2.975981/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-destiny-2-codename-frontiers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bungie has posted a roadmap outlining something called ‘Codename Frontiers’, an ambitious expansion plan for Destiny 2. It arrives on the tenth anniversary of Destiny, which was released in 2014 to an overwhelmingly positive reception. On June 4, Bungie released The Final Shape for Destiny 2, but it has now been revealed that it wasn’t ever set to mark the end of the game.</p>



<p>In the words of the team, ‘We closed a door with The Final Shape, but we are opening a new one, a weird one, an exciting one.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-apollo-and-behemoth">Apollo and Behemoth</h2>



<p>Bungie has revealed that in the summer of 2025, ‘Codename Apollo’ will be released in Destiny 2. It’ll be followed up in the winter by Codename Behemoth, another super-sized expansion. Outside of these expansions, players will pick up four major updates per year <strong>for free</strong> in Destiny 2.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Each expansion under the Codename Frontiers banner will accommodate two rewards passes, and the roadmap itself stretches to Spring 2026. Each season (Apollo and Behemoth) will be comprised of new stories, locations, missions, gear, and raids – amongst other things. </p>



<p>Speaking on the new plans, Bungie’s Tyson Green, the Game Director working on Destiny 2, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We recognize that it has become too rigid. Expansions have started to feel too formulaic and are over too quickly with little replay value. Seasons and Episodes keep getting bigger but can still feel like you are just going through the motions.</p>



<p>We believe it’s time for Destiny to change and evolve, and that our community wants this game to grow and innovate too. And to do that, we need to start breaking some of the molds.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at Bungie is also working on the approachability mechanics in Destiny 2, making it much more accessible to newcomers who might otherwise be put off by the game’s complexities.</p>



<p>Everything will kick off with Codename Apollo, which has been labelled a ‘<strong>nonlinear character-driven adventure</strong>.’</p>



<p>It’s a bold play by Bungie, and it looks solid on the surface – it’ll be interesting to see how this plays out.</p>

The celebrations kick off with a wardrobe raid, as players can grab a set of armor for each class inspired by the original concept armor pieces for Destiny. These were some of the first Destiny armor sets ever seen publicly, and they can be obtained when exploring the surroundings of the old Tower in The Pale Heart.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363997-destiny-2014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363997" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363997-destiny-2014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363997"></a><figcaption>Detiny 2014 armor sets are the new black.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363997-destiny-2014.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363998-ace-of-spades-nerf.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363999-legend-pin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363998,1300-4363999" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4363998-ace-of-spades-nerf.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4363999-legend-pin.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363998-ace-of-spades-nerf.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4363999-legend-pin.jpg"></figure><p>The other big celebratory pursuit will be a new selection of tasks that can be completed to earn the Legend title and seal. Some of the challenges involve completing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">The Final Shape</a> campaign on Legend difficulty, but if you've already done that, that task will automatically be checked off of your to-do list. There's one very good reason to chase after the Legend title, as earning it before Episode: Echoes ends will give players an early-access opportunity to purchase the Nerf version of the Ace of Spades hand cannon replica before its official launch in October. The offer includes a special Ace of Spades Nerf in-game weapon ornament that will also be available for purchase in the in-game store when Episode: Revenant launches.</p><p>Bungie also teased the return of a fan-favorite Exotic sniper rifle, Icebreaker, in an upcoming Dungeon release. The original Icebreaker was nasty to be on the receiving end of, as it turned anyone hit by its rounds into a walking bomb, but it had an interesting quirk as well. Icebreaker featured self-replenishing ammunition, and when fully upgraded, it had a chance to return ammo directly to the magazine on a successful hit. While it couldn't be reloaded like a standard weapon could, it was still cool to have a sniper rifle with essentially infinite ammo available.</p><p>Bungie says it has more Anniversary tributes to Destiny yet to reveal, and beyond the milestone celebrations, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-is-changing-destiny-2-approach-to-content-as-it-begins-a-new-multi-year-saga/1100-6526354/" data-ref-id="1100-6526354">studio also laid out its plans for Year 11 and beyond of Destiny 2</a>, including four major updates every year, two smaller expansions twice a year, and the start of the next multi-year story saga in Codename: Apollo.</p>

		<p>Without actually saying it exists, Sony have announced that the PS5 Pro will be revealed tomorrow, September 10th at 8:00am PT / 4:00pm BST. What the have announced is a “technical presentation” for the PlayStation 5, and as we already know what is inside the PS5&nbsp; there’s only one thing this could be.</p>
<p>“The 9-minute Technical Presentation will focus on PS5 and innovations in gaming technology”, explains the PS Blog. That’s it, that’s all we’re getting from Sony even though they already<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/06/ps5-pro-first-official-image-sony/"> leaked the console design</a> themselves.&nbsp; The announcement was also leaked, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/ps5-pro-design-and-announcement-plans-leaked/">we knew this was coming</a> in the first half of September.</p>



<p>As for what is inside the upgraded console, here’s what has leaked/rumoured so far:</p>
<p>he PS5 Pro will follow in the footsteps of the PS4 Pro in offering a general spec bump when compared to the base PS5, aiming to give a general uplift to both performance and game fidelity. There will be a 28% boost in system memory speed, a 10% increase in CPU speed, and then a huge jump in GPU speed by some 45% with custom hardware dedicated to image upscaling.</p>

<p>On the CPU side of things, this will be achieved with a High CPU Frequency Mode which allows it to hit 3.85Ghz, though this will be done by way of the dynamic power management that balances CPU and GPU power to reach the same power consumption. When in higher CPU modes, the GPU will be downclocked by 1.5%.</p>
<p>The system memory will jump from 448 GB/s to 576GB/s throughput, though newer memory types could see that figure jump further. Faster memory can have a big impact on the GPU performance, though it may be a bit disappointing that there’s no increase in memory from 16GB, which could potentially constrain the use of some more advanced ray tracing and other techniques.</p>
<p>There’s also a higher clock speed for the audio processing, which will allow for more complex reverbs to be processed with 35% more performance.</p>
<p>What does that all mean to the layman? Slightly better puddles? Nicer lighting? Something tangible worth buying a new console for which will no doubt cost even more than a standard PS5? We shall have to wait and see.</p>
<p>The stream will be broadcast in English on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/PlayStation">PlayStation YouTube channel</a> September 10yh at 8:00am PT / 11:00am ET / 4:00pm BST.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-technical-presentation-ps5-pro-possible-reveal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a PS5 "Technical Presentation" hosted by none other than lead PS5 architect Mark Cerny, and it's scheduled to air tomorrow.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/09/tune-in-tomorrow-for-a-playstation-5-technical-presentation-hosted-by-mark-cerny/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a PlayStation Blog post</a>, Sony says that the presentation will take place tomorrow at 8am Pacific (that's around 11am Eastern and about 4pm BST). You'll be able to watch the show via the official PlayStation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2Y8dQb0S6DtpxNgAKoJKA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment communications director Sid Shuman says the presentation will last around nine minutes, and that it'll "focus on PS5 and innovations in gaming technology". While the company is cagey regarding further details, we can make a few educated guesses.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-technical-presentation-banner.jpg?itok=MMT7PCQ_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-technical-presentation-banner.jpg?itok=eXAgKjUw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big things could be coming for PlayStation.</figcaption></figure><p>Within the last few weeks, the rumor mill has been spinning particularly fast concerning a potential upcoming reveal of the PS5 Pro, which has been mooted for some time now.</p>
<p>In late August, noted leaker Bilibil-kun, via <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094" rel="noopener" target="_blank">French platform Dealabs</a>, supposedly revealed a sketch of the PS5 Pro, which showed a console that looks pretty similar to the current Slim model of the machine, only with some extra detailing and ports.</p>
<p>There was, of course, also the supposed PS5 Pro spec leak in March, behind which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-specs-leak-online" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IGN put its weight</a>, and just a couple of days ago, the ever-reliable Wario64 <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1831772340218425426" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed out</a> that the PS5 Pro's design appears to be visible in a new PlayStation image celebrating the brand's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>All told, it's looking pretty likely that we're going to get some kind of PS5 Pro reveal during tomorrow's showcase, although obviously, we can't confirm that with any degree of certainty until the presentation itself has taken place.</p>

<p>Given that this year does indeed mark PlayStation's 30th birthday, it would seem a rather appropriate year to announce the PS5 Pro, and doing so would certainly inject a little faith into a brand that has arguably been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">struggling a little</a> in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">recent times</a> (<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>notwithstanding).</p>
<p>In any case, we'll find out exactly what Sony is planning to announce tomorrow at 11am Eastern, so join us then for all the announcements from the Technical Presentation as soon as we get them.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-underlying-inescapable-tension-of-boku-no-natsuyasumi.975930/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/boku-no-natsuyasumi-ps1-playstation-summer-vacation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello. I am here to apologise. For years, dating back to the first time I wrote about it on the Old Site (in 2014!), I have been describing the <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi </em>series as variations of "relaxing", and even "chill". If you have ever played the games based on those recommendations, I would like to apologise for doing you dirty.</p><p>Sure, the games <em>look </em>chill. Their back-of-the-box summary certainly fits the bill. In each you play a kid on summer vacation, free to roam the countryside doing all kinds of fun kid stuff. Maybe you do some fishing, maybe you go for a swim, maybe you battle some bugs–you're a kid, you don't have a care in the world! Video games couldn't be any more relaxing!</p><p><strong>WRONG</strong>. As I have found<a href="https://aftermath.site/it-is-time-to-play-boku-no-natsuyasumi-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> after finally playing one to completion instead of just wildly dabbling</a>, this is a series defined by tension. No matter what you want to do, how leisurely your pursuits may appear, you are never really free to "chill" in <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi</em>. You are simply performing tasks inside the brief window between one school year and the next, and all the while the latter is hurtling toward you as grimly and inevitably as Terminus in <em>Majora's Mask</em>.</p><p>There is no <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi </em>without a calendar, and the way you're methodically marched through it, one pastime to the next, one day at a time. It doesn't matter how hard you relax, or even what you do with the time given to you, because once you arrive at your summer home and the game begins, you've got 30 days. After that, it's all over.</p><p>This broad structure leads, as Tim has covered so well in his sprawling series on the game, to an urge to optimise your vacation. When the first game provides multiple endings based on the choices you make, and some activities open up only if you've performed certain actions at certain times, the stage is set for players to try to earn the "best" version of a holiday, one that creates the most lasting and consequential memories possible.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="action button reviews boku no natsuyasumi" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/779coR-XPTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That's not really a holiday, is it? Or even relaxing. It's just more work. You get up in the morning, you get dressed, do some stuff on a schedule, get rewards for it then go to bed. Rise and shine, rinse and repeat, do it all over again. Please note I'm not criticising the games here; this is the most relatable thing about them! We all know as we get older that a weekend isn't really a full weekend, and a vacation isn't really a whole vacation, because for every day of recreation there's an equal and opposite reaction: a day of dread.</p><p>A weekend isn't 2.5 days of fun. It's a Friday night, a whole day on Saturday to do stuff then a whole other day of laundry, washing dishes, recovering from Saturday and just generally wincing at the realisation that you're closer to going back to work than you are to Friday night. Same goes for vacations, and that's how I end up playing <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi</em>, and I hate it.</p><p>In the spirit of <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi's</em> childhood reminiscence, I remember being a kid and feeling the same way about summer holidays. The first week or two would pass in a blur of delirium, freedom and escape, but as the heat dragged on and the days on the calendar whirred by, things would take on a different shape. Parties and beach trips gave way to trips to buy new school shoes, and whenever a holiday season passed its midway point I'd start to feel the weight of the upcoming school year resting a little heavier on my shoulders each day.</p><p>Maybe if <em>Boku no Natsuyasumi</em> were some sprawling sandbox, one taking place in a land free of day or date, it'd feel different. But it very much <em>does </em>take note of day and date, that's the whole point of the series. Your vacation is for a strictly limited time, so make the most of it!</p><p>I'll allow that some of this dread might be down to me, someone who can only enjoy a vacation for a certain amount of time before the threat of future work outmuscles my enjoyment of the present. But I also think much of it is intentional, for both game design and cultural reasons, and that as a result a series renowned as being "chill" actually has one of the most foreboding and inescapable boss fights of all time: going back to school.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Back to School </a>is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.
