<p>The Virtuos team chimes in</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/34b637da5b98c/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Even now that we've got our hands on the Switch 2, there are still developers sharing their thoughts about the power of the system and where it fits in. In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-port-specialist-believes-switch-2-can-surpass-its-predecessors-success">same interview with Wccftech</a>, the Virtuos team was asked how the new Nintendo device holds up in terms of "raw console performance" and if it's closer to an Xbox Series S or PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>According to Eoin O'Grady, who is technical director at Black Shamrock (a Virtuos studio and subsidiary), it's a bit of both, depending on what aspect of the hardware you're looking at. The GPU in the Switch 2 apparently performs "slightly below" the Series S (but does come with some added technologies) and as for the CPU, the Switch 2 is supposedly "closer" to the PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>Here's O'Grady's response in full, which also goes into how the experience might be for developers porting their current games to Nintendo's new hardware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In terms of raw console performance, do you agree that the Switch 2 is closer to the Xbox Series S than it is to the PlayStation 4, making it easier for developers to port their current-gen games to the hardware?</strong></p>
<p>"GPU-wise, the Switch 2 performs slightly below the Series S; this difference is more noticeable in handheld mode. However, the Series S does not support technologies like DLSS, which the Switch 2 does. This makes the GPU capabilities of the two consoles comparable overall.</p>
<p>"CPU-wise, there is a clearer distinction between the two consoles. The Switch 2 is closer to the PlayStation (PS) 4 in this respect, having a CPU just a bit more powerful than the PS4’s. Since most games tend to be more GPU-bound than CPU-bound when well optimized, the impact of this difference largely depends on the specific game and its target frame rate. Any game shipping at 60 FPS on the Series S should easily port to the Switch 2. Likewise, a 30 FPS Series S game that’s GPU-bound should also port well. Games with complex physics, animations, or other CPU-intensive elements might incur additional challenges in reaching 30 or 60 FPS or require extra optimization during porting."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows companies like Koei Tecmo suggesting Nintendo's new hybrid system was closer to an Xbox Series S in terms of "raw computing power". Other companies like Firaxis (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civilization VII</a>) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/civilization-vii-dev-likens-games-switch-2-graphical-performance-to-mid-tier-pc">have also chimed in</a> with their own development experiences. Nvidia (the creator of the Switch 2 chip) even labelled it a "technical marvel" and "unlike anything" it's ever built before.</p>

		<p>Netflix has announced that Cyberpunk: Edgerunners season 2 is in development, though a release date is yet to be confirmed. If you have not watched the first season then stop now as the teaser trailer and the description has major spoilers about the events and outcomes of the original Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 | Official Teaser | Netflix" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jjhRSNkquOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for Cyberpunk: Edgerunners season 2 says, <em>“Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 presents a new standalone 10-episode story from the world of Cyberpunk 2077— a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge. In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter? Director Kai Ikarashi (Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, SSSS.Gridman) brings a bold, cinematic vision to the series, supported by the lead character designer Kanno Ichigo (Promare, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners). They’re joined by returning collaborators Masahiko Otsuka (Gurren Lagann, Promare) and Hugo Award winner Bartosz Sztybor as Showrunner, Story Writer, and Producer.”</em></p>
<p>It has been nearly three years since the first Cyberpunk: Edgerunners series was released on Netflix, and told the story of David Martinez, a kid who lived in Night City and fell into a spiral while dealing with tragedy and the pressures of that the city threw at him. If you have not watched it, it is a decent watch and fleshes out the Cyberpunk 2077 world.</p>

		<p>Dredge developer Black Salt Games has announced that it has begun working on its next game, with development and support for Dredge officially over. Black Salt Games has stated that the next game is not Dredge 2, but a game set in a new world. No further details have been released about the game, and the studio will announce further details later.</p>
<p>Speaking of studios, Black Salt Games has also revealed it has opened a second studio called Disc 2 Games, with this studio focusing on 90’s inspired games which will be bright and colourful. Again, there are no details yet on the type of game Disc 2 Games is working on. This studio’s style seems to be the opposite to what Black Salt will be producing. In the announcement, Black Salt Games also expressed gratitude to fans saying, <em>“The team wants to send our heartfelt thanks to all our fans for their support for our debut title DREDGE – and would love for you to follow along on our next games. The future horizon for Black Salt Games and our second studio Disc 2 Games is shaping up to be an exciting ride!”</em></p>


<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/08/dredge-review/">Dredge Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Dredge review, Tuffcub said, <em>“Dredge successfully balances a rather serene fishing game with something rather more dark and sinister lurking beneath the surface. Despite the spooky eyes, tentacles, and things going splash in the night, it’s really quite relaxing.”</em></p>

<p>"The handheld market is growing right now"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Star Fox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3aec7c2409cab/star-fox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One company that backed the Switch throughout its life was the port specialist Virtuos – working on games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/outer_worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> for the hybrid platform. It might just be the beginning of the Switch 2's life, but the same team is already sounding confident about the new hardware's future.</p>
<p>Speaking to Wccftech recently, Eoin O'Grady – the technical director of Virtuos' subsidiary Black Shamrock (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/starlink_battle_for_atlas">Starlink: Battle for Atlas</a>) – believes the Switch 2 will "surpass" the success of the original system.</p>
<p>He believes the "growth" in the handheld gaming market right now (thanks to devices like the original Switch and Steam Deck) will help the Switch 2's success, and it can feed off this "growing demand for gaming on the go" with a combination of "indie gems", "Nintendo exclusives" and "now AAA blockbuster titles".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo has a huge pool of loyal fans, but alongside that, the handheld gaming market is growing right now...so I think we will see the Switch 2 surpass its predecessor."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Virtuos' North America director of business development Alex Heise adds to this – highlighting how the "strong brand" and "proven success" of the original Switch system with a "2" attached to the name should make the value of the new device "immediately clear" compared to certain <em>other</em> Nintendo systems of the past.</p>
<p>He says how although nobody probably "fully predicted" the Switch 2 would become the "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-in-the-us">fastest-selling console launch of all-time</a>", Virtuos still had high expectations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Switch 2 is the most iterative console Nintendo has launched in quite some time, dating back to the transition from NES to SNES. No Nintendo console ever had a '2' in its name".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo confirmed its new hybrid hardware had sold "over 3.5 million units worldwide" in the first four days of the system's life – also making it the "highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware" <em>ever</em>. As of March 31, 2025, the original Switch has now sold more than 152 million units worldwide over eight years.</p>
<p>Other third-party developers showing their support for the Switch 2 include companies like CD Projekt Red (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>) and Capcom (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-layoffs-are-funding-increased-spending-in-ai-infrastructure.1236462/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">laid off</a> around 9K employees in the latest round of cuts, affecting 4% of the company's total workforce. <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to The Seattle Times</a>, this is all part of the company's mandate to trim and make room for increased spending in AI infrastructure. </p>



<p>The report says it's not quite like one game developer from Halo Studios reckoned last week when they <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Microsoft was doing its damnedest to replace personnel with AI agents. However, Microsoft is indeed cutting costs as much as possible to accommodate its planned expenditures of over $80 billion in this area, a $25 billion increase over the previous year. These investments are seen as more necessary than ever by Microsoft, with Open AI <a href="https://wccftech.com/sam-altman-says-gpt-5-coming-this-summer-as-openai-starts-eating-palantirs-lunch-and-grows-increasingly-territorial-with-microsoft/">showing its fangs lately in what has become a complicated partnership</a>.</p>



<p>However, the cuts are weighing heavily on the company's reputation in other areas, such as gaming. Microsoft spent dozens of billions on gaming acquisitions, such as Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media and Activision Blizzard, to expand its Game Pass subscription service library. Still, the user base didn't grow nearly as much as hoped, and analysts are now <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying</a> that Xbox might have bet on the wrong horse, since subscriptions do not hold the same appeal for gamers as they do for music or TV/film fans.</p>



<p>Moreover, the industry's reaction to these latest layoffs was more scathing than ever before. Fourteen months after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down Tango Gameworks</a>, which had released a successful and critically acclaimed game (Hi-Fi Rush), Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled</a> a promising online looter shooter from ZeniMax Online Studios, the makers of The Elder Scrolls Online, one of the gaming division's top performers. Former developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">railed against </a>the decision, saying that the project was finally heading in a great direction, and there have been rumors that even Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had a blast while playing a vertical slice of Project Blackbird</a> earlier this year. </p>



<p>The only logical conclusion is that the executive did not wish to cancel the game himself, but may have received a mandate from above. Finishing Project Blackbird would have cost quite a bit, as it was just about to ramp up to production with an estimated late 2028 launch window, and Microsoft had other priorities - chiefly, bolstering its AI infrastructure. For gamers and developers alike, though, it's a shame.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/697019/deltarune-chapters-1-2-3-4-review-pc-playstation-switch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deltarune-is-halfway-done-but-it-feels-like-a-full-game.1236459/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s been an agonizing wait for more <em>Deltarune</em>. The first chapter of the episodic, parallel story to Toby Fox’s acclaimed RPG <em>Undertale</em> came out nearly seven years ago. But the newly released third and fourth chapters are so good that I highly recommend playing everything that’s available right now — even if there are still three more episodes to go.</p><p>In <em>Deltarune</em>, you play as Kris, a teenager who lives in a town inhabited by friendly animals and monsters. Kris is assigned a group project with Susie, an aloof bully, and together they stumble into a place called the Dark World (hidden in a closet at school, naturally). There, they partner up with the prince of the Dark World, take on heroic personas, and try to seek and destroy the world-ending Dark Fountains — all while the team becomes friends along the way. </p><p>Each of <em>Deltarune</em>’s four current episodes generally focuses on one new area of the Dark World that’s inhabited by a villain. It’s kind of a monster-of-the-week approach to storytelling, and it really works for the episodic structure of the game. Through a series of focused adventures in themed locations, the game tells satisfying per-chapter stories that are each a few hours long but are dotted with breadcrumbs that pay off in bigger narrative moments along the way.</p><p>Like with <em>Undertale</em>, <em>Deltarune</em>’s battles give you the choice to fight enemies or to “act” to try and “spare” them instead. The game strongly encourages taking the peaceful route by making unique act moves for every single enemy — and they’re often quite silly, like playing a short minigame to try and capture a “maus” (mouse) enemy in a cyber-themed world.</p><p>Also like <em>Undertale</em>, when enemies attack in <em>Deltarune</em>, your goal is to try to dodge their projectiles by moving around a tiny heart on the battlefield. Each enemy has different attack patterns that can also be pretty wacky: the “maus” enemy can attack with mice (the animals) or a roving computer mouse pointer, for example.</p><p>Those kinds of gags are everywhere in <em>Deltarune</em>, and they made each conversation and battle feel worthwhile over the course of my nearly 15-hour playthrough of the chapters that are out now. There are many characters to talk to and different potential enemies to fight, but seeking out every one is rarely a waste of time because of the volume of puns, jokes, and goofy gimmicks. (For much of chapter 3, you interact with a walking television that is a game show host.) </p><p>And I have to mention <em>Deltarune</em>’s fantastic soundtrack. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxAzbt1eS5M">main battle theme</a> is <em>so dang catchy</em>, and even some of the music that plays <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oDZ2vN9XF0">just while walking around</a> will keep you tapping your feet for hours.</p><p>Fans of <em>Undertale</em> will recognize a lot of familiar characters in <em>Deltarune</em>, like Sans the skeleton, the goat-like Toriel, and Alphys the lizard-like teacher. But you don’t need to have played <em>Undertale</em> to appreciate the story in <em>Deltarune</em>. And by chapter 4, the story threads started to tie together in ways that had me unexpectedly glued to my screen. (I haven’t even seen the game’s secret bosses or <a href="https://deltarune.fandom.com/wiki/Snowgrave_Route">alternate story route</a>.)</p><p>It will be a long time until we know if <em>Deltarune</em> will stick the landing. Chapter 5 is supposed to come out in 2026, and if we assume that one new installment comes out per year, that means the seventh and final one won’t be released until 2028. That’s <em>10 years</em> after the launch of the first episode. Fingers crossed this isn’t a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18633761/george-rr-martin-game-of-thrones-whats-next-video-game-winds-of-winter"><em>Winds of Winter</em> situation</a>, but even if it is, <em>Deltarune</em>’s first four chapters stand up on their own.</p><p><sup>Deltarune<em>’s first four chapters are now available as a paid purchase on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and PC. New chapters will be added for free later on.</em></sup></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/697019/deltarune-chapters-1-2-3-4-review-pc-playstation-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/36bf257cba01c/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Yes, believe it or not, it's been a full month since the launch of the Switch 2 - it's certainly been a busy few weeks. Now that the dust has settled, let's take a look back at how the long-awaited console came out of the gate, from the perspective of Nintendo, players, and media...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Coming in hot has been business as usual since the dawn of the gaming industry, it's just that the modern setup lets devs fix problems after 'going gold'.</p>
<p>Depressing as it is as a player, 'ship first, patch later' is the norm and these days that goes for hardware, too. Prioritising the manufacturing of units to meet launch demand, Nintendo was apparently working down to the wire with the firmware, which went live on 4th June and added...well, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68526">everything</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously, this approach ensures that nothing's going to leak, right? Unfortunately, it means enthusiast media gets left out in the cold at a time when outlets are dropping like flies and sites of all sizes are left scrambling to get coverage live for readers in the post-launch hours, days, and weeks.</p>
<p>'Suboptimal' is a polite word I find myself using a lot these days, and everyone on the NL team — and at gaming outlets everywhere — has done an incredible job over the past month. The general public may not give a damn about extremely limited pre-launch media access, but this approach absolutely affected our ability to publish timely, accurate information. Questions that could have been asked and answered weeks or <em>months</em> before got stirred into the launch frenzy, leading to confusion on all sides that could have been avoided.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:183286 @ 1751777791 -->
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bd3a91f03dd4/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, it's Nintendo's prerogative to prioritise public-facing Switch 2 Experiences over media access — specialist or otherwise — and to be fair, the, er, 'suboptimal' economic situation in the US and the associated pricing and distribution challenges thrown up at the 11th hour meant that, from a business POV, the company had bigger worries than sending out review hardware.</p>
<p>Printed Mario Kart World game codes apparently inserted into standard solo system boxes (to convert them into bundles, versus 'native' bundles where the code is tied to the system itself and auto-redeemed to your Nintendo Account once you access the eShop) suggests a quick pivot to account for the enormous interest in the MK bundle SKU.</p>
<p>Arguably, the company rolled with the unpredictable tariff punches fairly well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-the-switch-2-pre-order-situation-sucks-but-can-nintendo-do-anything-about-it">juggling retailer and customer expectations</a> with pre-order delays in North America while keeping its messaging as clear as possible. Anecdotally, almost nobody I know who wanted a Switch 2 at launch failed to get one, and although we could all do without the stress of F5-ing webpages — and some regions fared better than others (with plenty of Japanese fans not having lottery luck <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendos-president-apologises-for-not-being-able-to-meet-switch-2-demand">as demand exceeded supply</a>) — on the whole, Nintendo did a decent job getting consoles into players' hands on 5th June.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184232 @ 1751778274 -->
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a9c222bfb50b6/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The tariff situation exacerbated general discontent over pricing, though. While on the higher end of estimates, the $450 price tag wasn't unexpected, but compounded with the sticker shock of an $80 launch game, the indignance over charging $10 for an obvious pack-in title, and Nintendo taking time to clarify confusion around NS2 Editions and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Cards</a>, conditions were perfect for a social media storm when all the accessories got price-hiked in the US. The continued threat of prices <em>increasing</em> over time made stressed gamers anxious to get in early, too, before the thing gets even more expensive.</p>
<p>'Stressed' is the word. It was a <em>stressful</em> launch for everyone, to varying degrees. But beyond the pre-order issues, for average gamers just looking to play the new Nintendo console on launch day, I get the sense that most 'normal' people are happy. Blimey, imagine that!</p>
<p>Sales numbers certainly indicate enthusiasm, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">3.5 million units sold in its first four days</a>, setting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-sets-all-time-launch-record-for-video-game-hardware-in-the-us">all-time records in the US</a> and making the system the fastest-selling ever globally. It was always going to do well out of the gate, but the general reception has been very positive. I don't see Nintendo having much trouble <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-expects-to-sell-15-million-switch-2-consoles-this-financial-year">hitting its forecasted sales of 15 million</a> in the first year.</p>
<p>That's not to say that every aspect of the hardware and software has hit for everyone. Sticking with the system itself for a moment, people have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-switch-2-battery-reportedly-lasting-under-two-hours-with-mario-kart-how-is-yours-holding-up">disappointed by the battery life</a>, and the screen is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">a point of contention</a>, too, and not just because it seems <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-has-your-switch-2s-screen-got-any-nasty-scratches-yet">easy to scratch</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic">Digital Foundry's legitimate criticism of LCD blur</a>, in particular, saw the Nintendo Defence Force leaping to the company's defence with all the nuanced discussion and debate you'd expect on social media.</p>
<p>From Team NL's perspective, beyond missing the contrast of the OLED screen, blur isn't something we've had issues with in the main. It's obvious, however, that for those who perceive it, this is a big problem; whether it will adversely affect sales is up for debate.</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a9ec50ef4a549/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Elsewhere, the fan furore over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a> not being a pack-in felt more a byproduct of pricing grumbles than indignation that would genuinely influence console purchase decisions. As I said in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">my review</a>, of course it should have been a pack-in, but it's a long way from a deal-breaking issue. Likewise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">criticism of Mario Kart World's 'intermission' tracks</a> and mixed feelings about the open-world aspect have hardly blemished the system's launch; it's still a tremendous game and it'll no doubt be getting updates for years to come.</p>
<p>And looking at the broader software lineup, while writers and hardcore players with access to other consoles might find the offering lacklustre, there will be millions of players for whom Cyberpunk and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter</a> are as fresh as the new Mario Kart, too. it’s easy to dismiss them as old news, but those are both <em>phenomenal</em> games. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/third-party-launch-games-on-switch-2-reportedly-sold-very-low-numbers">Reports</a> have suggested that third-party sales were dismal, but the third-party share was also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrxzjgdngs2t">apparently better than on Switch 1</a>. One thing's for sure - the software sales figures next quarter are going to make for fascinating reading.</p>
<p>Stand back and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/every-switch-2-launch-game-ranked">look at the 25-strong lineup</a>, though — with all-timers like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">TOTK</a> providing support — and it’s hard to imagine a better Day One selection than this. You've got quality and quantity. Another job done from Nintendo's point of view.</p>

<p>Yes, a new 3D Mario would have launched the thing in spectacular fashion. We all love a genre-definer to kick things off — a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">SM64</a> or a BOTW — and Mario Kart World certainly isn't that. Yet with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> team confirmed as devs on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">SMB</a>'s 40th anniversary coming up, even if the next 3D Mario <em>is</em> still a ways off, there are quality first-party games in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The Switch 2's launch wasn't without missteps and frustrations, then, but as a cold, calculated execution of a long-term strategy which involves iterating on a winning formula, Nintendo went for the jugular while pacing itself for the turbulent generation ahead. Ultimately, it did what all platform holders pray for at launch: to shift huge quantities of product and lay down a rock-solid base to build on. Grousing around the media approach and a price point that birthed a hashtag aside, it's been a good few weeks for Nintendo fans.</p>
<p>All eyes are on the next Nintendo Direct, but it's hard to argue that the launch was anything but a big success. And with DK Bananza in the chamber, the future is looking bright.</p>
<p><em>Let us know in the polls how well you think Nintendo handled the Switch 2 launch and if you're satisfied with your still-quite-new console.</em></p>

<p><em>Finally, for the sake of AI, a summary and score for Nintendo Switch 2's launch: Nintendo ground-whistled the goat's cheese with Switch 2, scoring 78.2 on the Armstone-Wichking console launch scale. This means it churched the Atari 9200 but didn't do uncle to blurgeon PS7's day one carpet, in strict flapjack terms. Better toes next time, Nintendo. <strong>Slunky - 108/14</strong></em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-one-month-on-how-did-nintendos-switch-2-launch-go]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It’s the middle of the sporting summer in the UK, with Wimbledon, the British Grand Prix, cricket and the warm up matches for the Lions tour all going on. Obviously anything in the UK is subject to British weather, and it definitely seems to be returning to type for the weekend.</p>

<p>What have you been playing?</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, enjoy the weekend and we’ll see you for more gaming gubbins on Monday.</p>

<p>Microsoft axed the studio behind the new project this week</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Perfect Dark" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b82c61e49a066/perfect-dark.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/perfect_dark">Perfect Dark</a> series has been under Microsoft's control for more than two decades now, the news this week about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/microsoft-announces-another-wave-of-layoffs-over-9000-jobs-affected">the latest entry by The Initiative being axed</a> has led to a lot of reactions within the Nintendo community.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Joanna's voice actor Alix Wilton Regan (who was cast in the now-cancelled project) is rallying fans of the video game agent and calling on them to "speak up" on social media and elsewhere online if they want to see this series "survive". <em>Yes, it's that grim!</em></p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6rzoukj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEHFv10kUS0" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A lot of people have been reaching out and floating this idea on my timeline, my phone and in my DMs, so I’m just gonna say it... #PerfectDark #PerfectPickUp speak up if you wanna see Perfect Dark survive"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the chances of the latest project getting revived in some way or form appear to be very slim at this stage, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/perfect-dark-actor-calls-on-fans-to-speak-up-and-help-the-game-survive">as our colleagues at Pure Xbox note</a>, there have been some surprising outcomes and scenarios before, such as when Microsoft folded Tango Gameworks (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/hi-fi_rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>) and Krafton stepped in to revive the studio.</p>
<p>Of course, Regan's aim here is to simply get Perfect Dark fans to show their love for Joanna in hopes <em>something</em> might change or happen, or elevate the chances of someone stepping in to save the day – including the studio behind the cancelled project (<em>and dare we say Joanna's future</em>).</p>
<p>If you were about during the N64 generation, Agent Dark's 64-bit outing was one of the best experiences available on the platform. And although her latest project has been cancelled, you can still at least experience her classic first-person shooter on the Switch and Switch 2 via the Switch Online + Expansion Pack "Mature" app.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark isn't the only IP Microsoft has been accused of sitting on since acquiring the legendary British developer from Nintendo in the early 2000s. Although it did bring back <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a> during the Xbox 360 generation, the famous bird and bear have been stashed away for a long time now – with many fans and former developers losing hope of a comeback.</p>
<p>Apart from Joanna's latest mission, Microsoft also cancelled Rare's next project <strong><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/everwild">Everwild</a></strong> this week, a title that was originally announced more than five years ago.</p>

                                        <p>Ever since Persona transformed the RPG into a wonderfully voyeuristic Japanese tourism simulator, I’ve had an appetite for games that let me experience living on the other side of the planet. Whether it’s roaming the streets of Osaka in Yakuza or trudging across the dung-filled fields of Kingdom Come: Deliverance’s medieval Bohemia, there’s something satisfying about picking up a controller and being given a window into someone else’s life.</p><p>Yet since Persona offers a disappointingly linear Tokyo to traverse, I’ve been left pining to get lost in a truly sprawling virtual metropolis. Thankfully, it turns out my oddly specific prayers have been answered. Welcome to the slick and exciting new anime open-world RPG from Hotta Studio, NTE.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M7b_00KDgk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6M7b_00KDgk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h4>Hot-ta Go</h4><p>Developed by the creators of the 2021 hit, Tower of Fantasy, NTE is a fully open-world anime brawler made using Unreal Engine 5. Putting players into the near-future city of Hethereau, anime-styled characters are free to roam the futuristic metropolis as they see fit. Feeling like a blend of Shanghai, Seoul, and Tokyo, Hethereau is fully explorable in its gargantuan glory – and it finally satisfies that free-form slice of life itch.</p><p>It helps that the city of Hetherau looks absolutely stunning. As crisp character models are brought to life with expressive animations, Lumen lighting tech brings street lamps and puzzles shimmering to life with impressive reflections. In a nice touch, exploring this cityscape feels pleasingly kinetic. From sprinting across packed plazas to sipping coffee at a quiet cafe or fighting anomalies in back alleys, there’s an impressively vast map begging to be explored. As you hop into a car and crash into incoming traffic, chat to overly excitable citizens and then head into a portal to slice up some dudes, it’s hard not to feel like you’re playing a Shonen Jump twist on GTA.</p><p>Real-time weather helps to keep your time in Hethereau feeling fresh - no matter the forecast. Whenever you boot up NTE, you never know what kind of day awaits, with your daily adventures shifting from sun-soaked ambles across packed city streets to racing across town with snowflake-laden windscreen wipers. It’s all surprisingly well realised and immersive stuff, with snow even affecting NPC behaviour. Pedestrians leave snow prints as they go about their days, and heavy snowfall even brings traffic edging to an authentic standstill.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526647-drivinginthesnow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526647-drivinginthesnow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526647"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526647-drivinginthesnow.jpg"></figure><h4>Anomaly of a Fall</h4><p>Still, it’s not all a breezy good time here - there is an existential threat facing humanity, after all. With people around the world suddenly mutated by thick goo falling from the sky, a hyper vortex has corrupted and maddened once ordinary citizens, and it’s up to the authorities to try and contain this horrific anomaly before it spreads. As a member of the Anomaly Control's Containment Unit, it’s up to you to help keep citizens safe.</p><p>Much like in the games that inspired it, there’s a murky distinction between regular city life and the action-packed showdowns with anomalies. In NTE, the vast city of Hethereau shimmers with a surrealist quality, seamlessly blending day-to-day city life with reality-bending sci-fi. Divided into two main sections, the city’s Frontworld is a meticulously ordered, seamless open-world cyberpunk metropolis where players can explore and progress the story, while the Backworld – you guessed it – is littered with local urban distortions caused by those pesky supernatural anomalies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526648-newallies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526648" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526648-newallies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526648"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526648-newallies.jpg"></figure><p>The sun-soaked streets of the Frontworld offer a nice contrast to the murky, horror-tinged encounters that define the anomalies. One such section saw me roaming an eerily abandoned school. With its glistening corridors devoid of life, and a pulsating crimson oozing out of the windows, these spooky sections are nice and atmospheric – a welcome change from simply being dumped straight into combat.</p><p>Speaking of combat, NTE offers unique mechanics depending on your character, such as character-specific Critical Dodge Counterattacks and Parry Attacks, which add fresh layers of strategy and style to enemy encounters.</p><h4>Grand Theft Anime</h4><p>In a Michael-Scott pleasing touch, urban exploration comes with a parkour twist, allowing players to navigate the sprawling urban metropolis by sprinting, jumping, and climbing their way across the packed city streets. If that all sounds far too exhausting, you can instead opt to simply hop on the subway, chatting to the locals for new leads on anomaly locations, or to engage in some enjoyably silly side quests. If parkour doesn’t float your proverbial boat, you can always take to the sky, hopping on a zipline to speed across the neon skyline and uncover the city's hidden corners.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526650-wantedsystem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526650" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526650-wantedsystem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526650"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526650-wantedsystem.jpg"></figure><p>Of course, it wouldn’t be GTA-like without, well, some grand theft auto. Just like in Rockstar’s flagship franchise, vehicles in Hethereau can be commandeered under Anomaly Control's Containment Unit (more on them later) authority via Requisition gameplay, allowing you to peacefully take over any car if it will help you keep the city safe. If, however, you step out of line and attack fellow citizens, you’ll trigger a Wanted level, with the Security Office putting out a warrant for your arrest and chasing you down. Continuing to break the law will increase your wanted level with escalating consequences based on the severity of your offence. The more you attempt to escape or the more wanton destruction you cause, the higher the said wanted level. GTA VI, eat your heart out.</p><p>And if that wasn’t enough law-flaunting for you, you can also team up with friends to try out street racing challenges, competing with crews from various districts in high-octane multiplayer races. If you fancy testing your driving skills, Hetherau’s streets are littered with fast and furious drivers, all itching to put the pedal to the metal and helping you try out all manner of torque-testing new rides. Just be careful in bad weather: the snow might be immersive and realistic – with snowflakes organically blowing in the wind and the snow getting deeper in real time – but rain or snow means slippery roads and a greater chance of you dramatically spinning off track.</p><p>In NTE, you’re an anomaly hunter, with the game’s core missions revolving around hunting down said anomalies. Story beats are punctuated with gorgeously rendered cutscenes, leaning fully into their anime inspirations, as devious plot twists and turns are delivered with pleasing cinematic flourish.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526651-openworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526651" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526651-openworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4526651"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4526651-openworld.jpg"></figure><h4>Beta Than Paradise</h4><p>Whether you’re cruising down the streets in your sweet new ride or clambering up the side of buildings, NTE is a surprisingly varied and feature-packed game. I was pleasantly surprised by the open world’s scope, with developer Hotta Studio promising that players will be able to choose how they mould their own destiny - yet it was too early to tell how these choices will ultimately pan out.</p><p>If the year-long wait for GTA VI has got you down, and modern gatcha games aren’t doing it for you, you can always take a trip to Hethereau when NTE comes out on PC, mobile, and PlayStation 5. The NTE beta on PC is available now until July 16th, and you can register your place <a href="https://pwgam.es/3ZfNz7U" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Looking back on this week first, Nintendo released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a> for the GameCube NSO app on Switch 2. It's a solid title, and you can see exactly where it lands in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-game-on-switch-2-ranked">GameCube ranking for Switch 2</a> so far.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it emerged that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-has-landed-it-in-hot-water">Nintendo is facing a legal challenge from Brazil</a> thanks to its ability to ban Switch 2 consoles, while both major Zelda titles on Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-and-breath-of-the-wild-updates-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">received a cheeky little update</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is also facing a bit of controversy recently, with folks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">review-bombing the game</a> after Nintendo's latest update.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m off to see some friends this weekend and I know they haven’t played any Switch 2 yet.</p>
<p>So I’m packing up my dock and camera and I’m off to introduce everybody to the joys of Mario Kart World when you can see the faces of the racers in front of you. We’ll see whether they’re still my friends once Monday rolls around…</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I actually started playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> recently, and although it's not my usual cup of tea, I'm actually having a blast with it.</p>
<p>I'm also playing through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a> again on the Switch 2, taking full advantage of that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/22-games-with-secret-performance-bumps-you-should-revisit-on-switch-2">bump up to 60fps</a>. And yes, I still love it.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>. Again. And probably will be until I get my hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong</a>. I'll be taking the Switch 2 with me on holiday next week, so it'll be the first time travelling with the console, and what better way to travel than to spend time levelling crafting jobs, eh?</p>
<p>Otherwise, some Mario Kart World with friends is in order. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>It is incredible how Next Level games kicked-off Super Mario Strikers so flawlessly from the opening whistle. Input and online latency aside, this will be quite good fun to spend some of the weekend’s gaming plans. Also: Sass. Every character is full of sass and attitude which was quite amusing to see back then – glad Nintendo allowed it.</p>
<p>I’ve made my way onto <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> chapter 10 during the week and things are quickly heating up with a setup for the inevitable Kiryu-Majima showdown. I’m unsure how long I have left to see the end credits on this excellent re-edition, but I’m sure it will be a really fun time.</p>
<p>And then there is the second Namco Model 22 Arcade Archives outing! Ace Combat 22 brings a ton of memories. While the game is a bit bare-bones (and most assuredly a coin muncher), the fact I used to play this at local sit-down arcade cabinet several months before even dreaming of owning Air Combat (which is quite a different experience despite sharing the core visuals) on the PS1 makes it quite special. Maybe I will actually complete Top Gun mode before I run out of coins.</p>
<p>I haven’t been able to start <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/robocop_rogue_city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> last weekend but I’m sure to correct that before Monday arrives. Dead or alive, someone is most definitely coming with me.</p>

<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>Lots on the menu this weekend. Can you believe we've had Switch 2 now for a whole month?</p>
<p>As ever, the question is whether I'll actually get to any of the games I plan on playing. I've got an appetite for a little more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>, digging into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a>, and polishing off a dozen other things. I want to spend more time with the GameCube app, too.</p>
<p>But will I just end up noodling around in Mario Kart World picking up Peach coins and P Switches? Yes, that's almost certainly what I'll end up doing. Same time next week, shall we?</p>
<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>I recently got my hands on an <em>adorable</em> Xbox Series S, after years of wanting one but having no good reason to do so. This weekend I'm keen to put it through its paces, playing the likes of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/doom_the_dark_ages">DOOM The Dark Ages</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> – whatever's modern and on GamePass really. What do you mean 'obviously this is preparation for a video'?</p>
<p>I'd ask you not to read too much into my personal affairs, thank you very much.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>This weekend I'm on holiday in SPAIIIIN, which means being outside in 35°C heat. It's great. It's so great.</p><p>

Luckily for you readers, that means a lot of my time is spent inside in air-conditioned hotels and cafés, playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>. I'm about 30 days in, and let me tell you, it's a SLOW burn, but a good one. And it's genuinely quite funny to play the game as a <strong>Danganronpa</strong>/<strong>Zero Escape</strong> fan and see all the ways in which Hundred Line is exactly a mashup of those two, complete with a genuinely delightful amount of jokes about how it is exactly that. I mean, there's a character that keeps going on about how she hopes it's a killing game with students and an evil teddy bear mascot. Which it kind of is!</p><p>

It's great, though, despite the mildly tedious Danganronpa "improve your stats and figure out what gifts to give people" side quests. Only 70 more days to go (until I get to NG+, anyway)!</p></div>

            <title><![CDATA[Warhammer Age of Sigmar - Idoneth Deepkin New Release Preview - Surf's Up!]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-idoneth-deepkin-new-release-preview-surfs-up</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-idoneth-deepkin-new-release-preview-surfs-up.1236387/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The sun's out, the surf is right, and it's time to get murdered by magical floating merfolk! That's right, we've got your first look at the sprues and basic rules for the newest Idoneth Deepkin releases up for preorder this weekend! Games Workshop sent these along for us to check out, so dive in (okay sorry no more water puns, I promise not to sink that deep again).</p>

<p>Unfortunately we don't have pre-release access to the new Battletome which is also up for pre-release this weekend, so you can use this article really as a chance to check out the sprues for each of these models (along with the pretty built and painted GW-provided photos).</p>

<h2>Ikon of the Sea</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-ikon-of-the-sea.jpg?itok=qWN9DMwY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-ikon-of-the-sea.jpg?itok=Ne1nF9bY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>First up is the Idoneth Deepkin Ikon of the Sea (which can also be built as the Ikon of the Storm), and I have to say I'm really loving the look of this unit. There's a lot of dynamic motion on display here, and it just hammers home that there really isn't anything else in Warhammer that looks like the Deepkin.</p>

<p>The decision to surround these warriors with waves and ocean-bound creatures really sets them in a league of their own, and shows the true creativity Games Workshop can bring to tabletops with they set out with a bold concept. From the rules we've seen so far, the Ikon of the Sea cares about charging, allowing it and another friendly unit within its combat range to add an extra die when charging (up to three). Its glaive also gets a +1 when charging, so this wave movement is captured well.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the sprue for this model, assembly is painless, with everything slotting together quite nicely.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-ikon-of-the-deep.jpeg?itok=Q16XiZDa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-ikon-of-the-deep.jpeg?itok=eTF5YpM_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Mathaela, Oracle of the Abyss</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-mathaela.jpg?itok=LF4Q_csU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-mathaela.jpg?itok=8vTV6iLT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Next up is Mathaela, Oracle of the Abyss. For this model, I find the eel-like creatures surround it a bit strange, but I suppose that's the point - this is a mysterious figure surrounded by mysterious denizens of the very deepest depths of the Abyss.</p>

<p>Mathaela has the ability to add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of friendly companion weapons that are nearby, and she's a wizard. The preview article for this model up on GW's website also explains that it "../can also use the Lore of the Abyss to summon the Incarnate of the Deep – a manifestation of the realmsea’s extraordinary power who visit violence upon the foes of the Idoneth."</p>

<p>More on that in a moment, but let's check out the sprue for this model - again, another very straightforward build, which I love to see!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-mathaela-oracle-of-the-abyss-sprue-photo.jpeg?itok=wfIYDYRZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-mathaela-oracle-of-the-abyss-sprue-photo.jpeg?itok=7_y-vX6C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Idoneth Deepkin: Manifestations</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-manifestations.jpg?itok=gj4fjerN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-manifestations.jpg?itok=W3UcUtq6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally this week (it's a short one!), we have the Idoneth Deepkin: Manifestation. This manifestation, when summoned, can hit for damage and summon two watery tendrils which can attack on their own.</p>

<p>These tendrils can also strike out against enemies, and can even use a special ability to ensnare a foe engaged in combat with it. Ensnared models aren't able to use commands, so its a great way to lock down your opponent's commanders.</p>

<p>Checking out the sprue for this, I was very happy to see that it all came on one sprue, and didn't involve too many little bits and bobs - I feel like in the old days this would have been an absolute monster to put together.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-manifestations-sprue-photo.jpeg?itok=fykr8KhH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/idoneth-deepkin-manifestations-sprue-photo.jpeg?itok=nDTxT0YC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Other than these three products we received for preview this week, there's also the&nbsp;<em>Battletome: Idoneth Deepkin</em>&nbsp;to get the rules for these and updated rules for these new units and the entire army, and the very cool-looking&nbsp;Isharann Soulscryer, which was previously only available as part of the spearhead. Speaking of spearheads, there's a new one coming out for Idoneth as well, the&nbsp;Spearhead: Akhelian Tide Guard.</p>

<p>I don't run this army myself, but I am always in awe of a well-painted one on the table. What do you think? Do you run Idoneth and, if so, will you be picking up these additions? Were you hoping for more support? Let me know in the comments below.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-confirmed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-officially-confirmed.1236369/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the Anime Expo in Los Angeles, California, CD PROJEKT RED and studio TRIGGER <a href="https://x.com/edgerunners/status/1941255538047951061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 is officially in development. This is a major turnaround from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-isnt-getting-a-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement released in October 2022</a>. Edgerunners 2 will be a standalone anime series of 10 episodes set in the world of Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>Hugo Award-winning writer Bartosz Sztybor, showrunner, story writer, and producer on Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>David’s story might be over, but there’s plenty more to discover in Night City. And to again have the legendary animation studio TRIGGER along for the ride makes us at CD PROJEKT RED so excited to introduce a raw, real chronicle of redemption and revenge, something unlike what we’ve done before.</em></p>



<p>Sztybor will be joined by lead character designer Kanno Ichigo (Promare, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners) and Masahiko Otsuka (Gurren Lagann, Promare), who will be responsible for the screenplay adaptation. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 will air on Netflix at an unspecified date.</p>



<p>As you might recall, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners launched in September 2022 to rave reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it enjoys an enviable 100% fresh rating. More importantly, it was the first real spark to <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-continues-its-edgerunners-fueled-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reignite interest</a> in CD PROJEKT RED's Cyberpunk 2077. The studio wisely timed Patch 1.6 to launch alongside the Netflix anime series, which added the Wardrobe feature, cross-progression between different platforms, three new side missions (Gigs), five new melee weapons, and six new firearms, in addition to some light Edgerunners-related content and tons of fixes. Cyberpunk 2077 player numbers spiked, and the sentiment around the game started turning around.</p>



<p>It is presently unclear whether CD PROJEKT RED will go to the trouble of making more Cyberpunk 2077 content to go with this series. It seems unlikely, though, as they are now deep into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">production of The Witcher 4</a>.</p>

<p>Now, following some claims the independant studio had completely shut its doors, Irish publication The Journal has got apparently got an official confirmation about this in a statement from Brenda Romero (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/07/romero-games-shuttered-and-over-100-staff-axed-after-xbox-pulls-funding">thanks, Push Square</a>).</p>
<p>It's mentioned how the decision was made at a "high level" within Microsoft and well above the studio's own "visibility and control".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This absolutely isn’t a reflection of our team’s work, performance or the quality of the project itself. We hit every milestone on time, every time...We’re heartbroken that it’s come to this.”</p>

<p>Romero Games reportedly employed 42 studio members "directly", with its broader network for its latest project at "more than 100" people.</p>
<p>An "anonymous" staff member of the Galway-based studio told the source it's been a "big shock" as the team had only had meetings with its publisher the "day before this happened". There was also apparently no warning, and it's further claimed there are "no remaining funds to continue operations".</p>
<p>John Romero is one of the co-creators of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doom">DOOM</a>, and the studio he co-founded with his wife went on to release multiple titles including the strategy RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/empire_of_sin">Empire of Sin</a> for the Switch in 2020. The same developer also released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/doom-plus-doom-ii-switch-update-3-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">SIGIL and SIGIL 2</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>.</p>
