			<p>A new multiplatform multiplayer project which started development at Bungie is going to be revealed during today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-state-of-play-confirmed-for-february-12th/">State of Play show</a>, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Spanish website <a href="https://vandal-elespanol-com.translate.goog/noticia/1350777986/sony-presentara-en-el-state-of-play-un-nuevo-y-curioso-multijugador-nacido-en-bungie-segun-nuestras-fuentes/?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vandal</a>, which proved to be a reliable source of information in the past, shared today that the multiplayer project codenamed Gummy Bears, which managed to survive Bungie's restructuring l<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">ast year</a>, will be revealed today. The game, which is being developed by a new studio run by PlayStation Studios but still part of the Destiny series' developer, is said to be a colorful game featuring gameplay inspired by MOBAs with team-based confrontations and characters belonging to different classes, and some other elements inspired by the Super Smash Bros. series. Additionally, it is said that players will be able to interact with one another between games in ways that will allow them to express their personalities.</p>
<p>Judging from the information above, the new Bungie project will clearly be aimed at a younger audience. As such, it isn't surprising to learn that the game is reportedly launching on Nintendo Switch, as well as on PC and PlayStation 5 later this year. Gummy Bears is also reportedly being shown during the rumored Nintendo Direct, which is supposedly scheduled for this month.</p>
<p>Project Gummy Bears may not be the only Bungie project shown during today's State of Play. In an update shared<a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gets-small-developer-update-from-bungie-confirming-expanded-playtesting-and-upcoming-news-in-2025/"> last year</a>, the studio teased that more information on Marathon would be coming this year, so today's show would be the perfect occasion to show what the studio has been working on for some time.</p>

			<p>A new Ninja Gaiden 2 Black update is now live on PC and consoles, introducing additional content to the game, some balance changes, and more.</p>
<p>The 1.0.7.0 update, update 1.003.000 on PlayStation 5, introduces a New Game Plus mode, which allows players to go through a new game on a difficulty level they have previously completed with all the weapons and Ninpo that have been obtained in the previous playthrough. All weapons and spells levels, however, will be reverted to level one. The new update also adds a new Photo Mode and the ability to hide equipped projectile weapons.</p>
<p>Besides introducing new content and options, the new Ninja Gaiden 2 Black update also introduces some balance adjustments, such as lowering the HP of enemies in select chapters, increasing damage for some of Ayane's attacks, and several bug fixes. The full update notes can be found on the game's <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/update/">official website</a>.</p>
<p>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the Unreal Engine 5-powered remake of one of the best action games ever released in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black isn't quite the definitive edition of Team NINJA's second entry in the series, but it comes close. While Ryu Hayabusa no longer faces overwhelming hordes of enemies, the game's intensity, deep combat mechanics, excellent enemy variety, greatly overhauled visuals, and solid level design make it one of the best ways to experience one of the finest action games ever released, performance issues notwithstanding.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Xbox and PlayStation’s partnership continues to strengthen. To celebrate this, we’ve compiled a list of every confirmed Xbox game coming to PlayStation and every rumored release potentially in the works.</p>



<p>I didn’t know anything else other than console wars throughout high school. I was (and still kind of am) a PlayStation fan, and there was always a primal urge to defend the brand. As I’ve grown, I’ve seen the error of my ways and learned to appreciate all aspects of gaming. But so have Microsoft and Sony it seems. PlayStation is releasing exclusives on PC, whereas Xbox is bringing its library to everything.</p>



<p>2025 is set to be one of the most unimaginable years yet. A few Xbox-exclusive launches are penciled in for Sony’s PlayStation consoles, and many others are rumored. </p>



<h2 id="h-every-confirmed-xbox-exclusive-coming-to-playstation">Every Confirmed Xbox Exclusive Coming to PlayStation</h2>



<p><strong>These Xbox games are 100% confirmed for PlayStation.</strong> If you own a PlayStation, you can buy and own one of these titles once they finally release. Some you might not have thought possible, but never say never.</p>



<p>Certain titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-gameplay-releases-on-may-15-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM The Dark Ages</a> don’t make this list because they’re not released as Microsoft exclusives. It’s a third-party game from day one, although it is tied to Bethesda and Microsoft. Every game on this list isn’t currently available on PlayStation and is already out on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll continue to update this list as more shocking announcements are unveiled.</p>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</h3>



<figure><figcaption>PlayStation inherits a classic arcade-racing series. Credit to Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-period-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a> was rumored to be in the pipeline for PlayStation for a while. A Holiday 2024 announcement was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-was-ready-but-delayed-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a>, but January 2025 saw a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring 2025 release</a> confirmed. Racers feel like a dying breed at the moment, and Gran Turismo 7 is coming up to its third birthday.</p>



<p>Forza has always been one of Microsoft’s biggest brands providing authentic simulated racing through Forza Motorsport, and Horizon being the arcade relief. Forza Horizon 5 smashed it when it first came out, so this is a big coupe for the blue brand.</p>



<h3 id="h-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A playable Indiana Jones film. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-be-on-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> launch isn’t exactly a well-kept secret. Since day one of Microsoft’s Bethesda purchase, the gaming community has often wondered which titles are coming to PlayStation. After initially seeming like Xbox would get a ton of exclusives, many are coming to PlayStation after all—and Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is one.</p>



<p>Initially, The Great Circle is a timed exclusive. It came out on Dec. 9, 2024, for Xbox Series X|S and PC. But its PlayStation status was quickly confirmed too. It’s set to be an epic PS5 release in 2025, and the more hands on The Great Circle the better.</p>



<h2 id="h-rumored-xbox-games-coming-to-playstation">Rumored Xbox Games Coming to PlayStation</h2>



<p>More exciting than the confirmed Xbox-exclusive games coming to PlayStation are the ones <strong><em>potentially </em>releasing on PS4 or PS5</strong>. The rumors pipeline is hectic and chaotic, and it makes for exciting reading. As someone who’s missed out on many Xbox exclusives over the years, it might be an amazing time to be a PlayStation fan in 2025 and beyond.</p>



<h3 id="h-age-of-mythology">Age of Mythology</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Not a myth anymore? Credit to Ensemble Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Jez Corden is one of the gaming industry’s leading insiders. He’s one of the frontrunners when it comes to leaks and rumors, and he’s claimed Age of Mythology is coming to PlayStation at some point in 2025.</p>



<p>The strategy title first came out in 2002, and <em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em> came out 22 years later as a suped-up rerelease with all the expansion packs and it remasters the original from the ground up. It would be a great addition to the PS5 catalog and give real-time strategy fans a new universe to explore.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War E-Day</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Make it happen. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-coming-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War E-Day coming to PS5 could be surreal</a>. Gears of War was a franchise I was jealous of growing up—not owning an Xbox. It looked cool and brutal, and my Xbox friends all played and basked in its glorious goryness. Using a chainsaw gun to carve up an enemy is the perfect adolescent-enhancing rush anyone could ask for.</p>



<p>E-Day is an upcoming prequel set 14 years before the first mainline entry. It brings beloved characters back together, and I can’t think of a better way to start a Gears of War journey than with a narrative chronicling the pre-origins of Gears of War. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-possibly-considering-gears-of-war-playstation-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft considering a Gears of War PlayStation release</a>, I think many would be on board.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-collection">Gears of War Collection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What age are we living in? Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Carrying on the Gears of War narrative is a rumored <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-collection-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War Collection</a>. It would be a whole collection featuring remasters of any of Gears of War 1, 2, 3, 4, and Judgement. It would understandably be a big project —presumably from developer The Coalition—and the PS5 would be a likely destination.</p>



<p>As with many entries on this list, it’s speculation and pinches of salt here and there. But don’t be shocked to see at least one older Gears of War title come to PS5.</p>



<h3 id="h-halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo The Master Chief Collection</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I never thought we’d see the day. Credit to 343 Industries</figcaption></figure>



<p>Leaker NateTheHate claims several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox exclusives are on the way to PlayStation</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Microsoft is spreading the love to everyone at this point. Amongst these rumors is news of the Halo Master Chief Collection heading to PlayStation. Again, the teenage version of myself (and the adult version) can’t wrap my head around this possibility.</p>



<p>Halo was Xbox’s premier franchise for years. Halo 3’s launch was historic and all over the news at the time. Granted, its popularity has waned in recent years (Halo Infinite being a perfect example) and a PlayStation launch could give the series a much-needed shot in the Spartan Armor.</p>



<h3 id="h-senua-s-saga-hellblade-2">Senua’s Saga Hellblade 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It would follow in the footsteps of its predecessor. Credit to Ninja Theory</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hellblade 2 carried on Senua’s battle with psychosis in the 9th century. The able-bodied warrior originally debuted as a timed-exclusive on PlayStation and PC, before eventually getting an Xbox port later down the line. The tables most certainly turned with Senua’s Saga Hellblade 2 as it was released on Xbox and PC—not PlayStation.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellblade 2 is reportedly coming to PlayStation in 2025</a>. Hellblade 2 cost a lot more to develop, and deserves more praise and recognition. A PS5 launch could go a long way to doing this.</p>



<h3 id="h-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A casual stroll in the sky. Credit to Microsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 had the hard task of trying to better the outstanding Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. It arrived with a ton of new features and missions, and it was also a Microsoft exclusive. However, PlayStation owners might need to clean off and ready their own cropdusters if gossip is to be believed.</p>



<p>The same Jez Corden report about Age of Mythology and Hellblade 2 also mentions Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Again, there’s no substance regarding a release date or announcement, but a 2025 release of the Xbox game on PS5 a real possibility.</p>



<h3 id="h-starfield">Starfield</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A big occasion. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>No, you’re not spacing out, Starfield coming to PS5 might not be a rumor anymore. If you don’t believe us, take it from the mouth of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer who suggests Starfield is flying to PlayStation 5</a>. Initial suggestions indicated a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-starfield-coming-to-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield PS5</a> release was never going to happen under any circumstances.</p>



<p>When asked about Starfield staying on Xbox, Spencer has an interesting response: “There’s no specific game that I would…This goes back to my redline answer, there’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place that it will find players where we would have business success for us.”</p>



<p>It’s not difficult to read between the lines and get our hopes up for Starfield and PlayStation star-hopping together.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you also finding it hard to accept a world where PlayStation and Xbox finally join forces? If this is only the beginning, which other Xbox exclusives from years gone by do you want to see arrive on PlayStation?</p>



<p>PlayStation exclusives could be making the jump too with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-16-xbox-release-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 16 move to Xbox</a> being a major example.</p>

            <p>
Former Activision Blizzard boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> has branded the 2016 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> film "terrible" and "one of the worst movies I've ever seen".
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick shared his frustrations with Blizzard's attempt to turn the Warcraft MMO into a movie success, and said the project had been a "huge distraction" for the company that ended up causing delays to World of Warcraft game updates.
</p>
<p>
So why did Kotick let it all happen? Apparently, the deal to make the film happen had already been signed before Activision snapped up Blizzard in 2008.
</p>
<p>
"World of Warcraft, the movie... I thought was a terrible idea," Kotick said. "They had signed the deal before we owned the company. It took loads of resources and distracted them.
</p>
<p>
"Think about all the people who make video games for a living, and now have a chance to make a movie. They were, like, helping with the casting, and they're on the set... it's just a huge distraction. Our expansions were late, patches weren't getting done on time."
</p>
<p>
Legendary Blizzard developer Chris Metzen was burned out by the project, Kotick continued, and only returned to Blizzard years later after Kotick "begged" him to come back.
</p>
<p>
"And the movie was terrible," Kotick concluded. "It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-movie-director-outlines-what-would-have-happened-in-the-trilogy">Plans had been in place to make a full World of Warcraft film trilogy</a>, but they were scrapped after the movie flopped at the US box office.
</p>
<p>
"You have what amounts to the most expensive lore wiki ever made," former editor Oli Welsh wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-warcraft-movie-is-too-faithful-by-half">Eurogamer's World of Warcraft movie review</a>. "A film whose ending will have no impact for anyone who doesn't know who or what Thrall is; and a story whose greatest moments all lie in sequels that will, in all likelihood, never get made."
</p>
<p>Speaking during the same interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-activision-boss-bobby-kotick-wanted-a-jurassic-park-game-so-badly-he-sent-steven-spielberg-a-proposal-inside-a-large-dinosaur-egg">Kotick also revealed his pitch to Steven Spielberg for a Jurassic Park video game - which he sent to the director inside a large dinosaur egg</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Crytek is the latest game developer in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-playstation-layoffs-reported-by-software-development-team-member/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemingly unending list</a> that is laying off a substantial portion (around fifteen percent) of its workforce. The announcement came this morning with the following message <a href="https://x.com/Crytek/status/1889623029723885913" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on X</a>:</p>
<p><em>Like so many of our peers, we aren't immune to the complex, unfavorable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years. It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15% of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services. This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams. After putting the development of the next Crysis game on hold in Q3 2024, we have been trying to shift developers over to Hunt: Showdown 1896. </em></p>
<p><em>While Hunt: Showdown 1896 is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable. Even after ongoing efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses, we have determined that layoffs are inevitable to move forward. Crytek will offer affected employees severance packages and career assistance services. </em></p>
<p><em>We firmly believe in the future of Crytek. With Hunt: Showdown 1896, we have a very strong gaming service and remain fully committed to its operation. We will continue to expand and evolve Hunt: Showdown 1896 with great content and drive our strategy for our engine CRYENGINE. </em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't look like a new Crysis will be in the cards for several years. On the other hand, Hunt: Showdown fans will be happy to know the horror-themed first-person extraction shooter game continues to thrive following the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-out-now-on-pc-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-xs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big 1896 update,</a> which brought several technical improvements, such as DirectX 12 support, NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR support, HDR support, multi-bounce global illumination, and a full 3D audio pipeline. The game also <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-coming-to-xbox-gamepass-on-december-12-along-with-post-malones-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined Xbox Game Pass</a> (on consoles) in December, opening up to a larger audience.</p>

            <p>
Former Activision Blizzard boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> has said he desperately wanted the rights to make a Jurassic Park video game - and created a bizarre personal pitch to movie director Steven Spielberg before the first film came out.
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick said the proposal to Spielberg was "nuts" and the only time he ever pitched Spielberg after hearing that the legendary director had been interested in video games.
</p>
<p>
Alas, the pitch was unsuccessful. But the story of what Kotick did is still a good tale.
</p>
<p>
"I had a board member who was Spielberg's lawyer, and he called me and said - 'Spielberg wants to make video games, he loves video games... we'll come to you first'," Kotick recalled.
</p>
<p>
"The only time I ever pitched anything to Steven was I really wanted the rights to Jurassic Park. I was friends with Michael Crichton and I had read the manuscript and I thought 'this is going to make a great game'. So I called Michael and said 'what do I need to do to get the game rights to this?' He said 'you gotta get them from Spielberg, he owns the rights'. 
</p>
<p>
"I built... I had to make a manuscript - our proposal was a manuscript - of what we were gonna make, and I put it in, like, a dinosaur egg, in a crate," Kotick said. "I went nuts. It was all I wanted.
</p>
<p>
"I knew him [Spielberg], but I had all my friends who were good friends with him call him and say 'you know Bobby really wants to do this'. And I called him up and I said 'what do you think?' And he's like 'great pitch, great vision for what you want to do with the game'.
</p>
<p>
"He said 'I really want you to do it, I really would like you to do it, so pay the most money'. 
</p>
<p>
"And Konami ended up giving him some crazy guarantee and we didn't get the rights. And I was bummed too because I thought it would have made an incredible game.'"
</p>
<p>
It's now been a year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-boss-bobby-kotick-departs-in-just-a-few-days">since Kotick departed Activision Blizzard</a> after a long and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-boss-bobby-kotick-under-fire-after-damning-report-into-what-he-knew-of-workplace-abuse">frequently controversial tenure</a> at the top of the company. Last autumn, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/behind-the-scenes-at-blizzard-jason-schreier-talks-misconduct-swingers-parties-and-what-press-got-wrong">Eurogamer sat down with Bloomberg writer Jason Schreier for more detail on life behind the scenes at Activision Blizzard</a> - featuring plenty of chat about Kotick's time and influence at the firm.

			<p>The long-running debate over video games as art is fortunately mostly a thing of the past, though it’s often up to indie games to help prop up any arguments that still rage. Obviously what makes a game – or any piece of media – art is a complex and largely subjective issue. You might point to the aesthetic approach, the narrative, or the interplay between presentation and mechanics. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes ticks all of these boxes and is perhaps the closest you’ll get to arthouse cinema in modern gaming.</p>
<p><iframe title="LORELEI AND THE LASER EYES | Coming to PlayStation December 3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xcnwQKFgbds?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The aesthetic of Lorelei is immediately striking, with its largely monochromatic palette clearly echoing the golden age of black and white movies. The minimalistic artstyle manages to be both retro and timeless, generally doing so without generally relying on aping the pixelated or polygonal graphics of bygone eras.</p>


<p>Much of Lorelei takes place in relative quiet, with your explorations being accompanied mostly by the loud echo of your footsteps. Whilst much of the soundtrack is little more than an ambient drone, there are some memorable tunes to be heard with Radio Waves and the title track being particular standouts.</p>


<p>Exploring the world of Lorelei feels like a fusion of survival horror and Myst-like puzzles, but with a more mathematical turn. You explore a mysterious mansion with a multitude of locked doors and incongruous mechanisms, but there is no weaponry or combat to be found here. Initially your exploration is very limited and linear, but as you progress you’ll find a series of shortcut doors that require specific mathematical or logical puzzles to be solved. The maths here is more along the lines of pattern recognition rather than complex sums or algebra that would have you breaking out graph paper and a graphical calculator, so you don’t need to worry if you haven’t simplified an equation for a few years. Every face button has the same function, which is perhaps my only real complaint – the lack of a quick back button to exit the inventory menu soon becomes a little irritating.</p>
<p>The various rooms of Lorelei’s mansion contain a dizzying number of documents and notes that serve as clues for the puzzles you’ll encounter. Whilst items are mostly restricted to keys (and objects that work as keys) you’ll be referring to your notes constantly. Despite the easy access to your file of documents, I also made extensive use of pen and paper to plot out ideas, possible answers to riddles and make notes of shapes and patterns. This aspect really brought me back to a much older style of gaming, as well as making the game a fantastically engaging form of impromptu multiplayer with my teenage children. Only one person can control what happens, but the puzzles really come into their own with multiple perspectives.</p>

<p>The narrative of Lorelei is as labyrinthine as the mansion in which it takes place. You play as a young Lorelei who must explore the home of her much older self and unravel the mysteries of her life. The game is closely intertwined with visual art, classic cinema, and screenwriting and the end result is a fascinating mixture of media that manages to be more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>It even manages to engage with the history of gaming with one subquest involving a haunted PS1-era game – the one time that the game does lean in on retro polygonal graphics – which you enter and have to deliberately glitch out following clues hidden in the documents found around the house. This is a perfect example of the multi-layered nature of the puzzles in Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. There are some small standalone moments but much of the game is magnificently interwoven. I’m hoping to find time to play through it again in order to unpick the twists and turns in the narrative soon.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Lorelei is one of the best puzzle adventures in recent years and deserves to be spoken about on the same level as the likes of Zork and Myst. On the surface it feels like an arthouse take on survival horror, but the depth and complexity of its narrative, combined with the superb puzzles and uniquely stylish aesthetic makes this a modern-day classic.	</p></div>

			<p>Today, as part of their <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/app/uploads/2025/02/remedy-q4-2024-ir-presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-year 2024 financial report</a>, Remedy confirmed that Alan Wake 2 has finally surpassed two million units sold. As you might remember, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-2-forza-motorsport-alan-wake-2-npd-circana-october-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled with sales</a> despite being critically acclaimed.</p>
<p>Remedy CEO Virtala also revealed that the development and marketing costs have finally been recouped, and the developer has begun earning royalties for Alan Wake 2 towards the end of the last quarter. The executive credited the game's continued support with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Night Springs</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake House expansions</a>, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-alan-wake-2-patch-improves-ps5-pro-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5 Pro update</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Mega Geometry update</a>, and of course the retail version of Alan Wake 2, for helping push the sales of the horror game, especially during the latest Holiday period.</p>
<p>Overall, revenue increased by 49.3% to €50 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Operating profit also improved compared to last year but remained negative. Still, Remedy is hopeful for the future, stating that 2025 will mark a new era of sustainable and stable growth. The Finnish developer has the ambitious goal of doubling the 2024 revenue by 2027 while retaining an EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation) margin of 30%.</p>
<p>Following Alan Wake 2, Remedy is now fully committed to its next projects, starting with <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-will-have-lower-pc-requirements-than-remedys-single-player-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a>, which CEO Tero Virtala confirmed for a 2025 launch. The executive also said that in December, the development team successfully conducted a closed technical test with external players, testing the game's matchmaking and backend services and collecting data to shape the final game.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Control 2</a> has just entered full production after establishing production pipelines and verifying asset creation speed. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake</a> is also making 'steady progress' in full production, and it is now heading towards 'key objectives' that were agreed upon with publisher and IP owner Rockstar Games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Remedy_Slate-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Last but certainly not least, Remedy is apparently also working on an unannounced project, as evidenced by the slide posted above. The studio hasn't shared any information yet, though, which suggests that it's at an early stage of development.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden-2">Ninja Gaiden 2</a> Black has received a major update, adding a New Game+ mode and a photo mode.</p>
<p>New Game+ allows players to begin a new game on any difficulty level previously cleared with all weapons and Ninpo spells unlocked (though they revert to level one).</p>
<p>Photo mode, meanwhile, is accessed in the options menu and allows players to pause the action and move the camera around to take screenshots. It's pretty basic, but a nice addition.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the update, on top of a handful of bug fixes, players can now hide their projectile weapon for a cleaner look, and Team Ninja has made a few balance adjustments.</p>
<p>Specifically, these mainly impact missions where players take control of Ryu's various female companions: the enemies in chapters 8 and 11 have had their HP lowered, while the number of enemies in chapters 13 and 14 (the latter played as Ryu) has been raised. Ayane has also seen a buff to her attacks.</p>
<p>The full patch notes can be found on the <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/update/">Team Ninja website</a>.</p>
<p>The update is available now across all versions: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Microsoft Store, Steam).</p>
<p>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black was shadow dropped at the recent Xbox Developer Direct - it's a revised version of the Xbox 360 game Ninja Gaiden 2, with elements from its Sigma release on PS3.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-ninja-gaiden-2-black-isnt-perfect-but-its-the-best-version-yet">Digital Foundry described the release</a> as "the best version yet", though it's not perfect.</p>
<p>The release comes ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, with Team Ninja collaborating with action game experts PlatinumGames and adding in a new playable protagonist.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The developers of upcoming survival game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> have warned fans that some dastardly do-badders are sending "fraudulent invites" to a playtest for the game via Steam messages. The playtest isn't real, say Unknown Worlds, who point out that any such invite will only come in an email from their own domain.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We have been made aware that fraudulent invites to a Subnautica 2 playtest are being sent on Steam to our community," said community manager Donya Abramo on the game's official Discord (as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/subnautica-2-devs-warn-players-about-fraudulent-links-to-a-playtest-for-its-upcoming-underwater-survival-game-stay-safe-out-there-subnauts/">GamesRadar</a>). "We will never contact you directly on Steam to invite you to any of our User Research Studies or playtesting opportunities."</p>

<p>The studio did ask for players to take part in a user research study last month, but the link to that was on Discord too. "Any contact regarding studies or playtests will only ever be sent by email from an Unknown Worlds address," adds Abramo. She asks any poor soul who has already clicked a link to change their Steam password, and points them to Valve's own <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0A94-F308-34A5-1988">help page for those with stolen or hijacked accounts</a>.</p>
<p>As ever, the best advice is to simply never click any link anyone sends you, ever. I practice this daily and look at me, blissfully unaware of all things. Although if said link offered the chance to splash about in even a rockpool of sea water from the anticipated sequel to one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">the best survival games</a>, I would at least be sad to dismiss that fantasy. </p>
<p>The last we heard of Subnautica 2 was following a trailer released by the studio last year. The sea-quel will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-coming-in-2025-with-four-player-co-op-heres-the-announcement-trailer">have four player co-op</a> and its early access is set to last <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-early-access-should-last-2-to-3-years-itll-launch-with-several-biomes-and-some-narrative">at least a couple of years</a>. It's due out some time this year. In the meantime, be wary of phishing. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Another wave of redundancies has hit Unity, the company behind the ubiquitous video games engine.
</p>
<p>
The latest job losses - which appear to include all members of some teams - are the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-likely-to-announce-layoffs-to-cut-costs">sixth in the past three years</a>, during which time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-makes-further-job-cuts-as-it-ends-agreement-with-weta-fx">roughly 3500 staff</a> have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-starts-2024-by-laying-off-1800-employees-as-part-of-ongoing-reset">been let go</a>.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, Unity team members impacted by the latest cull reportedly woke to find out their fate via an email sent from a noreply@unity address at 5am Pacific time, stating their role had been "eliminated" by organisational changes (thanks, <a href="https://80.lv/articles/breaking-unity-suddenly-lays-off-numerous-developers-with-a-5-am-email/">80.lv</a>).
</p>
<p>
Unity CEO Matthrew Bromberg later confirmed the job cuts in an internal memo, obtained by <a href="https://80.lv/articles/exclusive-unity-ceo-s-internal-announcement-to-staff-amidst-the-layoffs/">80.lv</a>, in which he mentioned the repeated nature of job losses at the company.
</p>
<p>
"I know that there is some exhaustion associated with prior changes at Unity that haven't delivered the promised results, but 2025 is going to be the year where we bring to market products and services that will transform our position in the marketplace and provide a springboard to long-term growth," Bromberg claimed.
</p>
<p>
Impacted staff say the latest cuts amount to "mass layoffs", including senior staff who had been at the company for years.
</p>
<p>
Included in the cuts are the entire Unity Behavior development team, which worked on a visual tool for programming NPCs and objects.
</p>
<p>
One affected team member, Shanee Nishry, reported that everyone working on the project had been let go in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1imk2qv/unity_just_laid_off_the_entire_staff_for_their/">post on reddit</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Unfortunately, we were told today that our team is included in the latest round of layoffs and we will not be able to support you any longer," Nishry wrote. "I've reached out to leadership to ask if they can open-source the project, but there is no guarantee."
</p>
<p>
Unity has yet to tell staff the total number of jobs lost. Eurogamer has contacted the company for comment.

<p>As per Remedy's latest financial report, the thriller sequel had recouped its development fees and marketing investments by the end of 2024, and had started accruing royalty income.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 released digitally back in October 2023 across PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. The budget for the game was estimated at €70m (£58m), making it one of the most expensive cultural products to come from Finland.</p>

<p>By September last year, the game had recouped "most" of its development costs, according to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-has-now-recouped-most-of-the-money-it-cost-to-make">company's financial results at the time</a>.</p>
<p>Last year also saw Remedy release two DLCs for the game: Night Springs in June, and The Lake House in October.</p>
<p>The company credits these expansions, along with the physical edition release, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> patch, and other ongoing quality of life updates for Alan Wake 2's long-term sales.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the report, Remedy reaffirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">FBC: Firebreak will release this year</a> - it's a three-player co-op first-person shooter set in the world of Control.</p>
<p>Remakes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 and 2 are in "full production" together with publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>, though remain without a release date.</p>

<p>Bobby Kotick, the infamous former CEO of Activision Blizzard, has revealed on a podcast which studio acquisition taught him ‘an expensive lesson’ almost twenty years ago. While sitting down with Bing Gordon, former Chief Creative Officer at Electronic Arts, Kotick took a stroll down memory lane, looking back over the last forty years of the gaming industry.</p>



<p>When it was mentioned by Gordon that Kotick and his team had a ‘flawless’ mergers and acquisitions record, Kotick set the story straight by mentioning one studio buyout that was less than ideal. In his words, it was an $80 million lesson.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-wrote-it-off">‘We Wrote it Off’</h2>



<p>In a recent<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> episode of the ‘Grit’ podcast</a>, which at the time of publishing is unlisted on YouTube, Kotick took a quick dive into an awful acquisition that Activision made before merging with Blizzard in 2008.</p>



<p>He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s not true, we actually had a bad acquisition.</p>



<p>We bought the company that was in Manchester that did the driving game for Xbox, and it was called… (blanks)</p>



<p>They had a good guy who was running the day-to-day, but he was like… A brilliant guy who — like a ‘McKenzie guy’, and he was in strat planning.</p>



<p>It was $80 million and we wrote it off two years later. It was everything — everything about it violated all our principles.</p>



<p>That guy was an expensive lesson.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In this segment, Kotick is referring to Bizarre Creations, the developer behind Project Gotham Racing, a series of titles that were exclusive to the Xbox platform. While the acquisition <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/activision-buys-studio-behind-project-gotham-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">left Microsoft with the PGR label</a>, Activision would lean on Bizarre Creations to piece together ‘Blur’, which was released in 2010, three years after the 2007 buy-out occurred.</p>



<p>Blur was intended to be released in 2009, but it was <a href="https://investor.activision.com/static-files/f2927482-7047-46da-b069-cfd2cc95acd5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">delayed by Activision</a> to allow Bizarre to further polish the game.</p>



<p>Less than a year later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bizarre-says-goodbye-with-farewell-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision closed Bizarre Creations</a>, dissolving the studio (which was based in Liverpool and not Manchester, as Kotick suggested) and releasing around 200 employees.</p>



<p>To this day, the Project Gotham Racing series stands abandoned</p>



<p>Kotick went on to walk Gordon through Activision’s former acquisition processes, which were centred mostly around retaining the identity of studios and allowing them to keep doing what they were <strong>already </strong>doing. By contrast, he explained how Electronic Arts – Gordon’s former company – would ‘take over’ acquired studios and rebrand them, stripping out their image somewhat.</p>



<p>In the same discussion on the Grit podcast (props to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-passed-on-chances-to-buy-guitar-hero-call-of-duty-and-blizzard/1100-6529398/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a> for the link), both Gordon and Kotick explained that, once upon a time, Electronic Arts <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/electronic-arts-almost-owned-cod-blizzard/">almost purchased Activision and Blizzard</a>, which would have left franchises like Call of Duty under the EA umbrella.</p>

<p>In a recent interview as part of an episode of the ‘Grit’ podcast, Bobby Kotick sat down with Bing Gordon, former Chief Creative Officer at Electronic Arts. It was revealed in the earlier minutes of the episode – which spans a whopping two hours – that Electronic Arts once passed up opportunities to acquire Blizzard, Call of Duty, and Guitar Hero, among other brands.</p>



<p>Eventually, Activision Blizzard, which was formerly led by Bobby Kotick as CEO, was purchased in its entirety by Microsoft, with the tech titan acquiring all aforementioned labels.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-might-have-been">What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grit podcast episode</a> opened with Bobby Kotick suggesting that Bing Gordon would have been one of the toughest CEOs in gaming to deal with as a competitor and that he and his team would have <strong>paid </strong>to keep the then-CEO in place at Electronic Arts. It was all in jest and talk turned to mergers and acquisitions, with Gordon gushing over Kotick’s notorious success in the space.</p>



<p>That’s not entirely true, though – Kotick explained some of the rougher patches of the M&amp;A streak:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We actually had a bad acquisition.</p>



<p>The company that was in Manchester that did the driving game for Xbox… We had a good guy who was running the day-to-day but he was like a brilliant guy, who — he was in strat planning.</p>



<p>It was $80 million and like, we wrote it off two years later. Everything about it violated all our principles.</p>



<p>That guy was an expensive lesson.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I can assume Kotick is referring to Bizarre Creations, the developer behind Project Gotham Racing – but the studio was based in Liverpool, not Manchester.</p>



<p>Kotick then explained how Electronic Arts tried acquiring Activision and Blizzard (assumedly pre- the 2008 merger):</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They tried to buy us a bunch of times, we had merger conversations a bunch of times.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gordon then expanded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While you were doing Blizzard, <strong>that EA passed on</strong>, and you were doing King, EA did PopCap — just stupid things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These revelations were in the first ten minutes of the two-hour podcast episode. It’s a plethora of gaming history that sees Gordon and Kotick walk down memory lane while discussing the origin stories of some of the biggest franchises in the business.</p>



<p>In one segment of the podcast (thanks to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-passed-on-chances-to-buy-guitar-hero-call-of-duty-and-blizzard/1100-6529398/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a> for the link), Kotick explained how Overwatch was created at Blizzard. He stressed that it went against the Blizzard ‘aesthetic’ and mentioned it was ‘unbelievable’ that the team pieced it together after focusing on ‘dark’ games for so long.</p>



<p>Do you think Electronic Arts would have tanked the Call of Duty brand as it did with Medal of Honor and (arguably) Battlefield? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass is set to add a classic Call of Duty game to its library as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is heading to the subscription service. And that’s 2009’s Modern Warfare 2, not the game of the same name released in 2022.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/12/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-heading-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Era</a>, Modern Warfare 2 will be coming to the service either in March or April this year. Insider Gaming sources can corroborate this report. </p>







<p>As of writing, it remains unclear if it’s the full game coming to the service or just the campaign. It’s also unknown if it’s the original version of the game or the remastered campaign. When it does release on the service, Modern Warfare 2 will become the first classic Call of Duty game to be available for Game Pass members. It will join recent titles Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Modern Warfare 3 (2023) as the only games in the series to be available.</p>



<p>What do you think of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 coming to Xbox Game Pass in the near future?&nbsp;Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/buzzfeed-peretti-ai</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/buzzfeed-ceo-wants-to-solve-the-internet%E2%80%99s-problems-by-making-his-own-version-of-those-problems.1106340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/buzzfeed-peretti-ai<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Tuesday, Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti announced his company will be launching its own social media platform, news he buried at the end of a long, tone-deaf <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonah/the-anti-snarf-manifesto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manifesto</a> about how AI and big tech are ruining what it means to be online. This is, to Peretti’s credit, true, but if you’re worried his solution will be to stem the onslaught of journalistic job losses or fight back against the AI companies that want to fill the internet with even more crap, don’t be: he’s not doing any of that.</p><p>The manifesto is called “The Anti-SNARF Manifesto,” which is not a reference to <em>ThunderCats</em> but instead a clumsy acronym for “<strong>S</strong>takes/<strong>N</strong>ovelty/<strong>A</strong>nger/<strong>R</strong>etention/<strong>F</strong>ear,” which Peretti believes drives the current algorithmically-based news and social media ecosystems. He writes that </p><blockquote><p>The type of content that gets created and recommended is not the best content, but the content that elicits the most compulsive and predictable response from the human brain. When the platforms don’t care about content and ask the AI to maximize usage, the content evolves into what I call ‘SNARF.’ </p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The manifesto takes aim at TikTok and Meta for focusing on technology and algorithms instead of quality content, claiming that these algorithms then lead to situations in which (emphasis his)&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Content creators <strong>exaggerate stakes</strong> to make their content urgent and existential. They <strong>manufacture novelty</strong> and spin their content as unprecedented and unique. They <strong>manipulate anger</strong> to drive engagement via outrage. They <strong>hack</strong> <strong>retention</strong> by withholding information and promising a payoff at the end of a video. And they <strong>provoke</strong> <strong>fear</strong> to make people focus with urgency on their content.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Peretti believes that “Through this lens, MAGA and ‘woke’ are the same thing! They both are versions of political ideas that spread through raw negative emotion, outrage, and novelty.” He writes that “the AI-powered platforms have... delivered a MAGA President that spews SNARF and a woke counter-culture that celebrates the assassination of a health insurance executive — big stakes, lots of novelty, and plenty of anger, retention, and fear!”&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think Peretti is wrong about content that <a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obscures facts</a> or leans into <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-rant-facebook-dragon-age" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anger</a> to drive clicks. In contrast, here’s a sample of current Buzzfeed headlines: “<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mikespohr/57-hilariously-unfortunate-people-youll-probably-feel-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">57 Hilariously Unfortunate People You'll Probably Feel A Little Bad Laughing At</a>,” “<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexalisitza/political-tweets-of-the-week-2-10-24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">21 Political Tweets From Last Week That Made Me Look Up At The Sky And Yell, ‘OMFG, YES’,"</a> and “<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/abbyzinman/70s-male-heartthrobs-trivia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">These 25 Male Celebs Were Huge Heartthrobs In The '70s — But I'll Be Shocked If Literally Anyone Under 35 Can Name Them Now</a>," Buzzfeed claimed in <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/why-buzzfeed-doesnt-do-clickbait" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2014</a> that it “doesn’t do clickbait,” and by its own definition, I’d agree: You know exactly what you’re getting with these articles, and they even tell you how you’re going to feel about them. (You could call this, as Peretti chides SNARF for above, a “predictable response,” but anyway!) All of it is designed for social sharing and compulsive engagement based on a particular kind of <a href="https://www.theawl.com/2015/03/i-hate-myself-because-i-dont-work-for-buzzfeed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brainrot</a> that Buzzfeed pioneered to great success, one of value-neutral <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/catesish/help-am-i-going-insane-its-definitely-blue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversy</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/technology/how-buzzfeeds-tasty-conquered-online-food.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stripped-down utility</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Buzzfeed was at the forefront of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/11/28/this-is-your-brain-on-buzzfeed-the-science-of-viral-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viral content</a>, arguably a precursor to the very “SNARF” Peretti rails against. The spread of that content took a hit from changing social media algorithms alongside every other outlet; in the years since, Buzzfeed has struggled to <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonah/building-the-defining-media-company-for-the-ai-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regain its footing</a>, so perhaps it’s no wonder Peretti spends so long being pissed off at social platforms. But Buzzfeed can’t compete not just because the internet doesn’t work like it did in the company’s heyday, but because the articles on Buzzfeed’s page aren’t <em>about</em> anything. Peretti uses the changing nature of virality to conflate Trump’s rhetoric with the widespread response to <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luigi Mangione</a>; he seems to believe these things go wide primarily because they upset people, and he doesn’t explore much difference in <em>why</em> people are upset. But in pointing out the real ways our emotions get manipulated on the internet, Peretti also seems to take aim at any kind of content that elicits <em>real</em> emotions. He’s not wrong that it’s less fun to disagree about health care and human rights than it is what color a dress is or which Golden Girl you are. But it takes a particular kind of Rich Guy Brain to spin that out into the idea that both sides are equally bad because, as he writes, “the result is an endless stream of addictive content that leaves everyone feeling depressed, scared, and dissatisfied.” People are, in fact, legitimately depressed, scared, and dissatisfied, and while I agree that plenty of news outlets and content creators lean into that to drive hollow engagement, Peretti’s view seems to fundamentally disbelieve that people earnestly want to care about real things.&nbsp;</p><p>Peretti putting the onus for some of this on AI is laughable when his own company has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/media/buzzfeed-news-shuts-down/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">axed its Pulitzer Prize-winning news desk</a> and conducted <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/buzzfeed-layoffs-new-restructuring-1235831847/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass layoffs</a>, leaning its full weight into <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/26/media/buzzfeed-ai-content-creation/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/buzzfeed-ai-creators-news-shut-down-1235483607/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content creators</a> instead. If it’s algorithms over people that’s driving all this, wouldn’t the smart alternative be thoughtful content created by real people; i.e., hiring journalists? If the AI-driven social media platforms are the problem, why would the solution be for Peretti to create his own social media platform “built specifically to spread joy and enable playful creative expression”? Peretti writes that “this social media platform will use AI to give users agency instead of stealing their agency,” whatever that means technologically, and whatever “agency” looks like when held up against a platform whose defining feature seems to be “good vibes only.” &nbsp;</p><p>In the course of the manifesto, Peretti does remember that he also owns the remains of some outlets. He lays out his plans for them:&nbsp; Buzzfeed proper “will bring more fun and playfulness back to the internet with low stakes content that is pure entertainment” and also, somehow, “counter the increase of gaslighting and misinformation by speaking to our diverse audience in ways that other institutions, media, and platforms clearly won’t.” The reporters left at <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/huffpost-editor-in-chief-resigns-layoffs-danielle-belton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HuffPost</a> (who are now surrounded by the worst people you know in the news desks at the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-administration-throwing-more-pentagon-reporters-out_n_67a75e7fe4b077fd2382e9e9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pentagon</a>) will be “using ‘SNARF for good’” by writing, well, news. Food brand Tasty, once my favorite hate read, “will fight SNARF with utility and social connection… the Tasty app will give us our own platform to grow usage and loyalty by integrating capabilities such as AI recipe remixing, community tips and challenges, and creator-led content.”</p><p>Peretti can’t even make it through a paragraph about his own outlets before pivoting back into celebrating the very problems he rails against, an AI-driven tech platform that incentivizes creators. The main difference seems to be not just that it’s, you know, <em>nice</em> stuff, but that it’s <em>his</em> nice stuff. “I’m fed up with giving the platform companies advice about how to fix the internet, if we want this done right, we have to do it ourselves!” he writes. This is a man who claims to both “look forward to counter-programming with our human creativity fighting against the machine,” and a man who in December <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/buzzfeed-sells-hot-ones-studio-first-we-feast-rcna183956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold Hot Ones</a>, a wildly popular interview food show that sounds exactly like what Peretti seems to think the internet needs, except that it is made by and for actual humans, and as such cannot be turned into a tech product.</p><p>Buzzfeed has looked everywhere for relevance except in hiring real human people to make good work for other humans to read. But “hire reporters” doesn’t boost a company’s stock valuation or give it a tech product to tote around for investment. Peretti is trying to solve the problems he identifies with the same problems, just with his own bright yellow “LOL” badge slapped over them. I look forward to whatever “listicles, but it’s a social media network” turns out to be.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/beyond-citadel-indie-retro-shooter"><h3>Beyond Citadel Is Gory, Obscene, And Almost A Masterpiece</h3></a><p>Inspired by Lucasarts' Outlaws and Bungie's Marathon, Beyond Citadel is mechanically one of the best indie shooters I have played in years and absolutely not for everyone.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sony-playstation-network-outage-psn-ps5-pc"><h3>The PlayStation Network Outage Is Modern Gaming In A Nutshell</h3></a><p>PSN went down for 24 hours, and Sony won't even give us an explanation</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
