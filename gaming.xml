		<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay was used to round out the Nintendo Direct, showing the revived first person Metroid Prime series in all its glory. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>: Beyond is set to release in 2025 on Nintendo Switch… but could it also come to another console?</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMAgmdR8jwU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We got to see plenty of Metroid Prime staples, including the morph ball mode, locking onto enemies during combat, and spooky alien environments. The world looks significantly more expansive and filled with life than the last time that we were in the Prime series – to be fair, Metroid Prime 3 was a Nintendo Wii game – and there was a glimpse of some creepy new antagonists with a glowing line up their heads, and with Metroids in tow.</p>
<p>With a 2025 release date now confirmed, this further the speculation that Metroid Prime 4 will be a cross-gen launch game for the Nintendo Switch 2 (or whatever it ends up being called). Nintendo specifically stayed away from discussing the Nintendo Switch successor during this Nintendo Direct, but has stated that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-is-coming-this-fiscal-year-but-not-at-nintendo-direct-in-june/">they will reveal all sometime this fiscal year</a>. Any 2025 release would see Metroid Prime 4 be in and around the new console’s launch window.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch/">Metroid Prime 4 was first announced back at E3 2017</a> but the project did not progress as well as expected and was not meeting the company’s high standards in its initial form. As such, they taken the drastic measure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/25/nintendo-reboot-metroid-prime-4-development-with-retro-studios/">restarting the project in 2019</a> with series producer Kensuke Tanabe reuniting with Retro Studios, who had first revitalised the Metroid series with the original Metroid Prime game on GameCube.</p>

<p>While that has slowly but surely come together, there’s been the popular launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread</a> in 2022, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/10/metroid-prime-remastered-is-a-perfect-reminder-of-this-gamecube-great/">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> in early 2023. Both wetted the appetite for more Metroid games for fans, and it’s great to see Metroid Prime 4’s development has come far enough for Nintendo to pin a release date on it. We can’t wait to see more, though.</p>

            <p>
After a long old wait, Nintendo's hugely anticipated sci-fi shooter sequel Metroid Prime 4 has re-surfaced - bringing with it a gorgeous first gameplay trailer, a new 'Beyond' subtitle, and confirmation it's launching next year.
</p>
<p>
Metroid Prime 4 was, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch">first announced</a> all the way back in 2017, almost a decade after the launch of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption on Wii. Nintendo eventually confirmed it was was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-namco-bandai-is-working-on-metroid-prime-4">being developed by Bandai Namco</a> - but 2019 brought the news the project had "not reached the standard" Nintendo sought and was being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-development-rebooted-from-scratch">rebooted from scratch</a>, this time with original Metroid Prime developer Retro Studios at the helm.
</p>
<p>
Since then, updates have been scarce, but now - during an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-right-here-with-us">already treat-packed Nintendo Direct</a> - the long-in-the-works shooter has re-emerged with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMAgmdR8jwU">nearly two minutes of gameplay</a>.

<p>
Unfolding in the Cosmic Year 20X9 at the Galatic Federation Research Facility (as per the trailer's opening caption), how better to kick things off than with a dramatic entrance from Samus Aran herself? After the toot of a very familiar musical motif, it's straight into the action - Samus blasting and scanning her way across a beautifully desolate alien landscape.
</p>
<p>
It's certainly a thrilling tease, but we'll have to wait a bit longer until it's finally in our hands; Nintendo has confirmed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will launch for Switch in 2025 - which immediately raises the question, could it be getting a dual-platform launch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">alongside Switch 2</a>?
</p>
<p>
Nintendo, of course, was clear it wouldn't be talking about a Switch successor during today's show, but hopefully we'll learn more about its plans for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - and that fancy helmeted character at the end of the trailer - before excitement overcomes us all.

After Ganon bests Link in battle, Zelda is left to her own devices to battle hordes of monsters that descend upon the game’s take on Hyrule (which seems heavily inspired by 2019’s <em>Link’s Awakening </em>remake).</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23721063/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-interview-aonuma-fujibayashi">series producer Eiji Aonuma</a>, Zelda will navigate and fight through the world somewhat differently in <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>as she wields a magical staff known as the Tri Rod with the assistance of a fairy named Tri. The trailer details how Zelda will be able to use the Tri Rod to create “echoes” of objects and monsters she’s previously encountered and use them to overcome obstacles. </p><div><figcaption><em>You play as Princess Zelda in </em>Echoes of Wisdom<em>.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>News of the game comes at a rather booming time for the <em>Zelda </em>franchise.

But given how long we’ve been waiting to see the princess front and center as <em>the </em>protagonist in the story she’s named after, it’s going to be fantastic to finally see it happen when <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom </em>hits the Switch systems on September 26th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-hands-on-impressions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>With a release date finally announced during today’s Nintendo Direct, Square-Enix has finally lifted the veil and shown off <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-entire-loto-trilogy/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D</a> for the first time in years in hopes of bringing the Erdrick trilogy to a new generation. While Square-Enix didn’t explicitly come out and say that they had plans for a trilogy during the hands-on preview, they noted that they wanted to start with Dragon Quest III chronologically as it was the first to come in the series. Nintendo spilled the beans during today's Nintendo Direct announcing the first two Dragon Quest titles also getting the HD-2D treatment in 2025.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Our preview for Dragon Quest III HD-2D opened with a brief greeting by Dragon Quest Creator and Game Designer Yuji Horii and a brief refresher on the series by Producer Masaaki Hayasaka. They spoke briefly on how Dragon Quest III HD-2D is a remake of the <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/games/dragon-quest-iii-seeds-salvation">1988 title Seeds of Salvation</a> and while it is the third numbered title in the series, it’s recommended for new fans to jump in as this takes place the earliest in the series timeline. For the most part, Dragon Quest III HD-2D remains true to the original with the battle system, storyline, and other fundamental aspects remaining largely intact while introducing many improvements for the modern era.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Later, Hayasaka-san spoke briefly about the changes to how players will experience “a global journey” in Dragon Quest III HD-2D. Many modern conveniences are seamlessly integrated into the core gameplay, from tutorials and the ability to quick-save to mini-maps and destination guides meant to keep players on the right path. Players can also use the Zoom spell of Chimaera Wing to escape dungeons, which was only introduced in later Dragon Quest titles. The team also wanted to touch on how the story has been expanded with additional episodes written with Horii’s blessing but didn’t have the opportunity to tell us what those might be.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>As the series approaches its 40th anniversary (Dragon Quest originally debuted in Japan in 1986), Armor Project wanted to introduce fans to the beginning of the Erdrick Trilogy by telling the tale of Ortega, the hero who failed in his quest to defeat the evil Baramos, and his child called forth on their 16th birthday to take up the mantle and finish what his father had started. Our hands-on session opened up roughly 30-60 minutes after the opening credits where the playable hero had gathered up three party members and ventured out for their first steps. For the hour or so that I had time to spend with Dragon Quest III HD-2D, this gave me just enough time to venture from the town of Aliahan, explore the Dreamer’s Tower, acquire the Thief Key and Wrecking Ball, and finally leave the starting region and venture out into the world proper.</span></p>
<p><span>For fans who want to adjust their challenge from the default difficulty, Dragon Quest III HD-2D offers two optional difficulty modes. Dracky Quest is the mode for players who simply want to explore the story without engaging too deeply with the combat mechanics. The party will never be wiped out, no matter the damage taken, while also dealing more damage to bosses. Some bosses will no longer automatically heal at the start of their turn. Draconian Quest, on the other hand, flips the script and makes all of the various aspects of Dragon Quest III HD-2D more challenging. Bosses have more HP overall and the Hero’s party all deal less damage when exploiting weaknesses while enemies also deal more damage back to the party. EXP and gold rewards are also reduced to prevent players from simply grinding their way through the story.&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p><span>Combat remains largely the same with the main changes being a redesigned UI and the ability to adjust the battle speed to expedite combat while introducing new animations for the various spells and abilities. Players can also set up Tactics and customize the auto-battle setting for each party member. Beyond that, it’s traditional Dragon Quest combat with players selecting their moves from a menu and watching each turn play out against foes of various species.</span></p>
<p><span>I noticed subtle changes here and there to the items that players will acquire in their journey across Aliahan and beyond. In the Dreamers Tower where players might find a Mini Medal is instead replaced by a Boomerang, another weapon type that was introduced in later remakes of Dragon Quest III. Players will still collect a variety of Mini Medals and turn them in to Morgan Minimann in the town of Aliahan’s well, but they won’t be able to use the same GameFAQs guide to seek them all out. Other less prominent changes were seen in some of the existing items, like the Girl’s Own Annual book that can be used to change a character’s personality turns characters into a Tear-Away rather than a Tomboy.</span></p>

<p><span>Square-Enix asked that we hold our tongue until the news was ready to go out, but as players have heard during the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorTUKvj0K8">Nintendo Direct</a>, Dragon Quest III HD-2D on November 14, 2024 in North America and will be available on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. No Xbox One or PlayStation 4 versions have been announced. Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D will also be coming at a later time in 2025, completing the Erdrick trilogy.</span></p>

			<p>For much of the franchise’s history, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda</a> has come in two flavors – 3D and 2D. Unfortunately, fans of 2D Zelda have largely been out in the cold in recent years, with the 2019 Switch remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening being the only bone Nintendo’s given them. That game was good, but it wasn’t enough to fully satisfy.</p>
<p>Well, good news 2D Zelda fans – at the most recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a> The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom was announced. Perhaps even more exciting, is that this game finally, <em>finally</em> gives Zelda herself a starring role. It seems Hyrule has been beset with dark rifts that have sucked in various residents of the land, including Link, so it’s up to Zelda to save the day.</p>
<p>The open-ended nature of recent Zeldas will be preserved here, as Zelda’s abilities revolve around the “Tri-Rod,” a device that allows her to replicate various items she comes across. So, she can, for example, replicate boxes in order to get up on cliffs and past barriers. She also has the ability to replicate enemies, who will fight for her once summoned. You can check out the first trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/94RTrH2erPE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking pretty creative! I like that Zelda's first game isn't just a carbon copy of Link's adventures, with seemingly a greater focus on puzzle solving. Here's Nintendo's official description for the game.</p>
<p><em>"It’s up to Zelda and her wisdom to save the kingdom of Hyrule in a brand-new story in&nbsp;The Legend of Zelda series. The people of Hyrule are being stolen away by strange rifts that have appeared, with a certain swordsman among the missing. Team up with the mysterious fairy, Tri, and use the power of the Tri Rod to create echoes – imitations of things found in the environment. Then recreate those echoes whenever you like to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. Use echoes of water blocks to reach new heights, make bridges out of old beds, throw rocks at foes – or find your own creative combination of echoes to do things your way. You can even create echoes of monsters to fight at your side in combat."</em></p>
<p>Nintendo will also be releasing a special Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom themed Switch Lite model alongside the game. Here's a peek at that...</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is coming to Nintendo Switch on September 26.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-preview-start-of-new-adventure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the excellent <em>Octopath Traveler </em>to the highly tactical and addicting <em>Triangle Strategy</em>, Team Asano might just be the most consistent team at Square Enix. And now, with the studio's downright gorgeous signature HD-2D style for<em> Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, </em>the series has the opportunity to reach a broader audience than it ever has before.</p>
<p>I'm in the camp of "never having played <em>Dragon Quest</em> before," but by all indications, this is a remake meant for both longtime fans, as well as curious newcomers. With the opportunity to play <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>, I can, hopefully, offer a valuable perspective. One thing is certain, though: We have another hit in the making.</p>


<p>As a newcomer, <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> is the perfect starting place; the original three games are a trilogy, and chronologically, this is the beginning of it all. Rest assured, if you're worried about getting lost with the story, that shouldn't be a problem with this entry.</p>
<p>My demo starts right near the beginning of <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> -- my party is fresh and unleveled. I was given some backdrop to the story, and so we play as a 16-year-old son of a hero setting out to right the failure of his father, Ortega. Ortega failed to defeat Archfiend Baramos, so one can assume that is the ultimate goal.</p>

<p>We begin in the town of Aliahan, and quickly venture out into the vast, open grasslands. My immediate surroundings are expansive and empty, though this is clearly by design. As I venture from Aliahan to my next destination, Reeve, the way forward is frequently interrupted by random encounters of various enemies, like <em>Dragon Quest</em>'s signature slimes, and more.</p>
<p>The feeling of "retro" is immediate to me. The development team clearly spent an untold amount of hours crafting a beautiful world, but the intent to stay faithful to the old-school style of the original is evident in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> <em>Remake</em>. This is proven in its minimalist, black-and-white UI as well as nostalgic sound effects, even if it's not a 1:1 comparison to the original.</p>

<p>The combat, however, is where that retro style really comes through. The turn-based combat in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> is undeniably less involved than<em> </em>turn-based strategy games that came after it, but it's no less fun. You'll dole out commands to your party, and they will act accordingly -- simple as that.</p>
<p>This can feel a bit drawn out at times if you're commanding each party member individually, but if you prefer, you can set your party AI to act according to a rule-set through the "tactics" menu. The AI seemed pretty smart no matter what option I chose, so having a specific tactic set is likely a good choice for beginners while they get the hang of things. You might even be able to rely on it for the whole game.</p>
<p>Other than that, we can now speed up gameplay, which is a most welcome feature, indeed. Old-school RPGs tend to suffer from slow and cumbersome combat, but that is alleviated with the fast-forward function. That, along with the tactics menu, are but two of many promised quality-of-life features we can expect from <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake. </em>In short, battles are quick and unobtrusive.</p>

<h2>Good ol' Dungeon Crawling in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></h2>
<p>I soon reached the next town, and once again found very traditional and grounded JRPG mechanics. I bought some new gear with my now slightly higher level party, explored a bit, and found my next destination was a tower on the eastern side of the map. The map, by the way, is a handy tool and it's impossible to get lost with it, if you were ever worried about what to do next.</p>
<p>The town had a church, and this serves as a point to save your progress; however, one new feature is the ability to "remember." This essentially works as another save, so you can now save your progress anywhere in the world without having to worry about where the next church is. I used this to great effect in the tower, since unforgiving nature of an old JRPG was very much present.</p>
<p>The tower was a surprisingly complex dungeon with a undeniable old-school charm. Because of my limited time, I bee-lined to the top of the tower, but I could have explored quite a bit of it. No doubt, going down the many different pathways would lead to treasure, and I can't wait to explore more of it. A handy map helped guide my way efficiently through the dungeon, so once again, I never felt lost.</p>

<h2><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake </em>is Another Artistic Masterpiece</h2>
<p>The HD-2D style uses gorgeous pixel sprites combined with high quality textures and environments. For <em>Octopath Traveler</em>, you have this sparkly, polished feel to everything, giving it an identity distinguishable from, say, <em>Live a Live</em>. <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> still makes wonderful use of this style, but does so in a way that's extremely faithful to the original style.</p>
<p>The late Akira Toriyama's influence is evident, even in this HD-2D rendition of his work. Pixel sprites of characters have an immediately recognizable look, so the unique identities of characters and even NPCs are expressed wonderfully. Monster sprites are simply outstanding, giving us a brand new and improved look for slimes, monstrous crows, evil toads, and more.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the most enjoyable aspects of <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> is seeing the new monster designs and their animations. It's clearly reminiscent of the old-school <em>Dragon Quest</em> style fans are familiar with, but with that bit of extra polish to really elevate this remake.</p>

<p>The overworld is this bright and lush green within the grasslands, evoking more of an anime aesthetic than other HD-2D games. Towns and dungeons are crafted to utter perfection, the latter of which making great use of shadows and lighting to create an immersive dungeon-diving adventure. As another modern touch-up, some (not all) NPCs also have voice-acting.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> might not be the most complex JRPG, but it is one of the most promising. The way it streamlines combat to make it faster and more accessible is sure to please newcomers such as myself, and graphically, it's second-to-none. In a year full of incredible RPGs, we can expect <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> to join in as one of the best come November 14.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hello-kitty-island-adventure-switch-preview-funner-animal-crossing</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hello-kitty-island-adventure-switch-preview-a-funner-animal-crossing.904653/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hello-kitty-island-adventure-switch-preview-funner-animal-crossing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No other brands come to mind as a better fit for an <em>Animal Crossing</em>-like than Hello Kitty and the whole Sanrio gang. I don't have Apple Arcade, so this was my first time trying <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>. It was utterly delightful.</p>
<p>I'll be honest with you, I took the appointment to check out <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> more as a curiosity than anything else. It's not a property I am all that personally close to, nor am I the biggest <em>Animal Crossing </em>person.</p>
<p>But, my mother has collected Hello Kitty related objects since the late 70s, having been based in the Philippines and making trips to Japan. So, Hello Kitty has been ever-present in my periphery my whole life.</p>
<p>I am very happy that I took the time to see what <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> is all about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's a lot that is appealing about <em>Animal Crossing</em>, but there is so much faff that's not then buoyed by some interesting characters or folks to chat with. They're all <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/animal-crossing-new-horizons-best-worst-normal-villagers">pretty</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/animal-crossing-new-horizons-best-worst-snooty-villagers">one</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/best-worst-lazy-villagers-animal-crossing-new-horizons">note</a> and the gameplay gets too repetitive too quickly.</p>
<p><em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> solves all those issues I personally have with <em>Animal Crossing</em>. The characters have more depth, allowing you to get to know them personally a whole lot more. They're often involved in their own little arcs and stories, and they all know each other pretty well and reference one another frequently.</p>
<p>In other words, there's a real communal aspect to the game full of characters that genuinely feel like real friends.</p>
<p>Beyond just the characters, there's quite a bit to do in <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure </em>as well. You can cook, fish, brew potions, collect critters, give gifts, decorate homes, and all the usual sort of things you'd expect in an <em>Animal Crossing</em>-like game.</p>
<p>However, there's some more "traditional" gameplay to stumble on as well, like puzzles, timed challenges, and so on. An overarching part of the game will see you trying to figure out the mystery of the Island, which will help unlock more areas. New areas have more to explore, new characters to find, and all sorts of secrets.</p>

<p>All around there is a delightful little tale or morsel of gameplay to take part in that goes beyond the normal fetch quest. It is endless charm and delight. So much so that I was only scheduled to play for 30 or so minutes but stayed much longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't have the chance to check it out, but <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> has multiplayer mode as well. You can invite friends to your island and do whatever you want. They even get their own cabin to decorate as well.</p>
<p>The game was a pretty big hit when it first released on Apple Arcade, so the fact that it remains a good time is not much of a surprise. It's a perfect pairing for the Nintendo Switch, but it wasn't all perfect.</p>
<p>Performance on the Switch was pretty poor. From framerate issues to really long load times, it was definitely not in its final form. However, developer Sunblink has a lot of time to get everything in shape before the game launches on other platforms next year.</p>

<p><em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> will appeal to<em> Animal Crossing </em>fans, and if you're like me, it may appeal to those that aren't really. It is not just a reskin, either, offering a lot of its own gameplay. If you're at all a fan of Hello Kitty and friends, I think this is one to keep an eye out for (or play now on Apple Arcade).</p>
<p><em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> will release for PC and Nintendo Switch in 2025. It will come to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 at a later date. If you don't want to wait, you can play it via Apple Arcade right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24180971/the-legend-of-zelda-four-swords-perfect-dark-metroid-multiplayer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Y0ZwQ5">Nintendo announced a small, but mighty list of additions heading to its premium subscription service as part of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24175496/nintendo-direct-june-date-time-switch">Nintendo Direct on Tuesday</a>. <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords</em>; <em>Metroid: Zero Mission</em>; <em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em>; and <em>Perfect Dark </em>are all being released to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22747408/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-faq-price-cancel-guide">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p id="Dyy54M">Any title on its own would be a formidable addition to the catalog of games offered on the subscription service, but now we get all four. <em>Metroid: Zero Mission </em>is a classic Metroid game and highly regarded as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/3/19/18196756/the-best-metroid-games-ranked">one of the best entries in the series</a>. <em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em> takes players back to some good prehistoric hunting and exploring on the Nintendo 64. As for <em>Perfect Dark</em>, there couldn’t be a better time to revisit the original given that the reboot just got a big gameplay trailer at the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24174838/perfect-dark-release-date-trailer-xbox-initiative-crystal-dynamics">recent Xbox Games Showcase</a> — and the game will have online multiplayer. </p>
<p id="firstHeading">Then, of course, there’s another Zelda game. The standard Nintendo Switch Online already contains the NES version of <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>, but now people will be able to play the quirkier<em> Four Swords</em> addition to the game that came out to the GameBoy Advance in 2002. The best part? This game will also have online multiplayer so now those who didn’t have enough copies of the game (or enough handhelds) as kids might finally be able to revisit and play the classic with friends. </p>
<p id="iBLXKT">An individual subscription to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch/22752182/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-best-retro-games">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> costs $49.99 per year or you can also buy a family membership that costs $79.99 per year and can include up to eight users. </p>

  <p id="Uac6UH">After years of anticipation (and a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/25/18197166/metroid-prime-4-delay-reboot-retro-studios-nintendo-switch">major development shakeup</a>), Nintendo gave fans a first look at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/metroid-prime-4/39994"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> during Tuesday’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180900/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced-games">Nintendo Direct</a>. The game is now known as <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, and it will come to Switch in 2025, Nintendo said.</p>
<p id="akZi6K">The first trailer for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> features some actual gameplay, with galactic bounty hunter Samus Aran battling hordes of space pirates, scanning alien environments for clues, and going into ball mode to traverse the environment. It was all classic Metroid stuff, and a tease of a very exciting adventure to come.</p>
<p id="bIzaC9">Metroid fans also got a peek at what appears to be <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>’s villain, a space pirate commander who commands two Metroids as pets. </p>
<p id="PEs8Ry">Nintendo first announced that a new entry in the Metroid Prime series was in the works at E3 2017. At that time, the company only showed a logo for the game, and since then has not provided game details or shown gameplay. At E3 2018, Nintendo did not showcase the game, saying it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/13/17460856/nintendo-metroid-prime-4-not-at-e3">did not want to repeatedly tease fans</a> until the game was closer to completion. Then, in 2019, Nintendo said it was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/25/18197166/metroid-prime-4-delay-reboot-retro-studios-nintendo-switch">rebooting development of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> and shifting the project to Retro Studios, the Metroid Prime series’ original developer.</p>
<p id="HzpMQV"><em>Metroid Prime</em><em> 4 </em>marks the return of the popular take on the classic adventure series, which debuted on Nintendo GameCube and was last seen on Wii with 2007’s <em>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</em>.</p>
<p id="rUJkgJ"><em>Metroid</em><em> Prime 3</em>’s follow-up was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/metroid-other-m/12973"><em>Metroid: Other M</em></a>, a Wii game that failed to win over fans of Samus Aran’s intergalactic adventures. Nintendo never made a Metroid game for Wii U, although it released a reimagining of <em>Metroid 2: Samus Returns</em> for Nintendo 3DS in 2017. Samus’ most recent adventure, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22709647/metroid-dread-review-release-date-nintendo-switch-oled"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a>, was released on Nintendo Switch in October 2021. That was followed by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23592880/metroid-prime-remastered-review-nintendo-switch-remake-eshop-dread"><em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em></a> for Switch in early 2023.</p>

That shouldn’t be too surprising given developer Mistwalker’s team: as mentioned, <em>Final Fantasy </em>series creator Hironbu Sakaguchi produced and wrote the game, while long-time <em>Final Fantasy </em>composer Nobuo Uematsu provided the music. Their involvement alone enough to get gamers excited, and&nbsp;<em>Fantasian </em>does have a certain quality about it that makes it feel like <em>Final Fantasy</em> in everything but name. Honestly, you could put <em>Fantasian </em>next to Mistwalker’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lost-odyssey-is-a-moving-story-about-immortality-memor-1840422305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lost-odyssey-is-a-moving-story-about-immortality-memor-1840422305"><em>Lost Odyssey</em></a></span>, <em>The Last Story</em>, and <em>Blue Dragon</em> and have yourself a little off-brand <em>Final Fantasy</em> collection. </p><p>But beyond creator pedigree, <em>Fantasian </em>offers something fresh to the formula. The most stunning part of the game is its unique visual aesthetic. As an homage to the pre-rendered environments of old-school RPGS,<em> Fantasian</em>’s environments were made with real-world dioramas. It gives the game world a dreamlike texture and feel when the computer-rendered enemies and characters wander around. Mechanically, the big gimmick of <em>Fantasian </em>is its&nbsp;slightly tweaked traditional turn-based combat. Characters can cast spells or launch attacks at single enemies, but if you curve the path of an attack with the touchscreen, you could attack multiple enemies. </p><p>One of my favorite features in <em>Fantasian </em>is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-creators-new-jrpg-lets-you-procrastinate-1846391047&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-creators-new-jrpg-lets-you-procrastinate-1846391047">Dimengeon</a></span>, which addresses the annoyance of grinding and random encounters. When exploring the world, you can trap encountered enemies in the Dimengeon and continue exploring without fighting. Once the Dimengeon is full you then commence one long battle against all the enemies you have trapped. It’s a neat system that lets players have more freedom and choice in their exploration. </p><p>While all of the visual and mechanical features of <em>Fantasian </em>feel like inventive iterations of classic RPGs, the narrative isn’t much to write home about. You are an amnesiac protagonist sent to save the world and everything goes about as you’d expect. But for those who are tired of replaying all the classics and want a taste of something new, <em>Fantasian</em>’s dazzling environments and inventive combat make it a delightful adventure. I can’t wait for more people to play it when it launches this Holiday season on Nintendo Switch.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Still in the chibi art style of the 2019 remake of <em>Link’s Awakening</em>, it looks like a puzzle-centric game where Zelda uses a magic wand to clone objects and enemies in the environment. In addition to the overworld map there are also side-scrolling areas. </p><p>Take a look:</p><p>Link appears to get engulfed by a purple chasm early in the game, with Zelda looking for clues about where to find him and bring him back to Hyrule. Pig Ganon is also back to cause trouble. I wonder if Zelda will get to duke it out with him in the final boss fight or if that will be when Link returns to the stage to deliver the final blow as he’s done in every other<em> Zelda </em>game over the last 30 years. </p><p>It’ll be interesting to see how long <em>Echoes Of Wisdom</em> is and if it ends up feeling like the mainline adventure the Hyrule princess has deserved. Fortunately, Nintendo seems to go hard on all of its Zelda games, whether they’re open-world adventures or top-down dungeon crawlers. <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</em> for the 3DS is still one of the best games the company’s ever released. </p><p>Arriving in September, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>will kick-off what seems to be another low-key stacked year for the end of the Switch’s lifespan. While the reveal of the Switch 2 is expected in the months ahead, today’s Nintendo Direct showed the second half of 2024 is shaping up to be another strong one for the handheld hybrid. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It looks like she’ll still be scanning, shooting, and rolling into a ball to get into tight spaces. Check out the trailer below:</p><p>The last time we saw a proper new entry in the <em>Metroid Prime</em> franchise was—get ready—2007. That was the release of <em>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</em> on the beloved Wii. Since then we’ve had re-releases and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-kotaku-review-1850124313&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-kotaku-review-1850124313">remasters</a></span>, and we all agree we don’t talk about 2016's <em>Metroid Prime: Federation Force.</em> But now, some 17 years later, we get some proof of life for Samus’s first-person adventuring.</p><p>The game was originally being developed by series producer Kensuke Tanabe and a new team seemingly involving Bandai Namco, rather than the series stalwarts, Retro Games. However, in 2019, Nintendo’s Shinya Takahashi described their progress as “very challenged,” and that development would start all over again, this time involving Retro.</p><p>At the time, Takahashi said that “it will be a long road until the next time we will be able to update you on the development progress,” adding that “development time will be extensive,” although presumably no one was imagining he meant another <em>five years</em>. But that’s how long it’s been since any further information was given.</p><p>But the cogs have been turning on the franchise, not least with last year’s release of a Switch remastering of the first game, alongside the hugely popular 2D platformer <em>Metroid: Dread</em>. There’s no doubt that people want to play <em>Metroid</em> as much now as ever, and the <em>Prime</em> branch of Samus’ adventures has lost none of its fervent appeal despite people born when the last game came out now being able to drive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo has finally taken the cover off Metroid Prime 4, revealing Metroid Prime 4 Beyond with a release date of 2025.</p>



<p>The reveal came at the end of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company’s Nintendo Direct event</a> on Tuesday. </p>



<p>“The galaxy’s greatest bounty hunter Samus Aran will embark on a new mission.&nbsp;Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, a new entry in the&nbsp;Metroid Prime&nbsp;series, is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2025,” Nintendo’s press release said.</p>



<p>Like past Metroid Prime games, the new game will also be from a first-person perspective. The reveal also came with nearly two full minutes of gameplay, showing the type of gameplay Metroid Prime fans have come to expect from the series.</p>

<p>First announced in 2017, Metroid Prime 4 Beyond has gone nearly the entire Nintendo Switch lifespan before its release. In 2019, it was confirmed that the game’s development had been restarted. Based on the timing of the new release date, it could be assumed that the game will also be available on Nintendo’s Switch successor console. </p>

<p>What do you think of the first look at Metroid Prime 4 Beyond? Do you think the game sticks to its 2025 release date? </p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review.904620/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>When I gave Elden Ring a 10 two years ago, I did so not just because it’s an incredible game, but because it also raised the bar for open-world games as a whole. The way it encourages exploration, rewards curiosity, and challenges you to find your own individual solutions to difficult combat encounters by including tons of different viable weapons, spells, and other build options is absolutely exemplary. Now, FromSoftware is back to raise the bar on everyone yet again, this time when it comes to what you’d expect from a "simple" DLC. Shadow of the Erdtree may not do anything radically different from the base game, but this expansion somehow feels like a scaled-down version of that same experience that recaptures all of the magic of playing Elden Ring for the first time, with more content packed within than many fully priced games. Its unexpectedly large realm is filled with new secrets, new discoveries, a ton of new build options to experiment with, as well as some of the most challenging and unforgettable boss battles Souls fans will have ever seen. </p><p>I strolled into Shadow of the Erdtree thinking I was some kind of Elden Lord badass, having defeated <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Malenia,_Blade_of_Miquella_Location_and_Guide">Malenia</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Mohg,_Lord_of_Blood_Location_and_Boss_Fight_Guide">Mohg</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Dragonlord_Placidusax">Placidusax</a>, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Elden_Beast">Elden Beast</a>, and every other big threat around. My level 150 character was armed with fully upgraded gear and the maximum number of flasks… but let me tell you, it did not take very long for the Realm of Shadow to humble me. Even though the only requirement to access the new areas is to <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Starscourge_Radahn_Location_and_Boss_Fight_Guide">beat Radahn</a> and Mohg – which, granted, is no small feat – you’re going to want to over prepare before stepping foot into this new arena, because it is <em>brutal</em>. FromSoftware definitely skirts the line between fair and unfair with some of the later boss designs in particular, perhaps getting closer than ever. But crucially, it never actually crosses that threshold, and that masterful tightrope walk – along with some truly spectacular boss design – results in some of the most thrilling and satisfying bosses Elden Ring, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-soulslike-games">the entire Soulslike genre</a>, has to offer. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>It’s not just the quality of those fights, either: Erdtree has them in quantity, too. According to our count, there are more than 40 bosses, with 10 of those being the big, showstopper fights that reward you with a Remembrance upon defeat. Compare that to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Boss_Guides">more than 100 in the base game</a>, and it’s a significant chunk.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>According to our count, there are more than 40 bosses.</p></div><p>When you <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prepare-for-erdtree-elden-ring-interactive-map">bring up the map</a>, it may not seem like The Realm of Shadow is that big, but it is incredibly dense because it’s stacked in layers. Paths lead upwards toward ruins suspended in the sky, others delve deep beneath the surface, and some even pull you in directions you might not have believed you could even be pulled. You might find a hidden ladder tucked away in the far corner of a castle rampart, only to follow that trail for an hour before it eventually spills out into a totally new, otherwise-inaccessible area.</p><p>But even with all of the discoveries to be made, I never felt lost or unsure of where I could or should go next. The main goal of this DLC is to follow the footsteps of the demigod <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Miquella's_Haligtree_Location_and_Walkthrough">Miquella</a>, who left his flesh behind and fled to the Realm of Shadow. These footsteps are marked by large crosses that elegantly serve as subtle signposts to let you know when you’re in the vicinity of a plot-critical path, without it ever feeling like your hand is being held as you’re nudged in one explicit direction. </p><p>Apart from the main quest, there’s a whole host of new NPCs, including seven followers of Miquella that you’ll encounter at various points in the journey. Each of them have their own small questline that ties into the main story, and those can even have an effect on some of the latter boss battles, depending on your actions. And while I consider myself a fairly casual enjoyer of Elden Ring’s extensive lore compared to some of the scholars out there, even my limited knowledge of the deeper plot let me appreciate some pretty fantastic, eye-opening revelations towards the end of this story that are well worth the effort of getting to.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Shadow of the Erdtree is essentially a full Elden Ring adventure made miniature.</p></div><p>It took me about 25 hours or so to beat the final boss of Shadow of the Erdtree, but I could easily see myself putting in another 15 or 20 on just this one playthrough. I still have a handful of optional bosses I need to go back and cross off my list, areas on my map I haven’t fully explored, weapons and skills I haven’t gotten to play around with yet, and sidequests I still want to follow to completion. That’s pretty much exactly like when I completed my review of the base game after about 80 hours, which makes sense because Shadow of the Erdtree is essentially a full Elden Ring adventure made miniature. It condenses the whole experience down to something comparatively compact, all of it satisfyingly tuned specifically for end-game characters who thought they’d seen it all.</p><h2><strong>Weapons of Choice</strong></h2><p>While I haven’t had any “holy ****” moments of awe like the first time I took the elevator down to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Siofra_River">Siofra River</a>, exploration and discovery throughout the Realm of Shadow is still a delight thanks to its stellar art design, a great variety in the areas you get to explore, and the tantalizing rewards pretty much everywhere you turn. There are <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types">eight brand-new weapon types</a>, ranging from <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types#Throwing_Weapons">throwing knives</a> to <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types#Beast_Claws">beast claws</a> to giant odachi <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types#Great_Katanas">samurai swords</a>. My favorite of the new arsenal, though, is the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types#Light_Greatswords">light greatsword</a>, specifically the Milady. True to its name, the Milady has a very regal-looking moveset with combos that flow nicely into each other and hit hard, but are also relatively fast compared to actual greatswords. For me, it’s a sweet spot. I actually swapped off of my powerful dual <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Bandit's_Curved_Sword">Bandit Curved Sword</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/elden-ring-bleed-build-guide">bleed build</a> (albeit, minus the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/White_Mask">White Mask</a>, which I ruined my chance to get) to instead rock a Strength/Dexterity-focused build using one of these and found great success for the majority of the DLC.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Mitchell's Favorite Soulslikes</h3><p>My 15 favorite soulslike games, ranked. </p></div><p>I experimented with a couple of other weapons as well, something that is possible thanks to the ample opportunities to collect a bunch more <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Ancient_Dragon_Smithing_Stone">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stones</a> of both the standard and <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Somber_Ancient_Dragon_Smithing_Stone">Somber</a> varieties. However, in all my travels I found that while the new weapon types are fun – there’s certainly an appeal to going hand-to-hand against an army of hands – none of them ultimately measured up to the strength of the weapons that I carried over from the base game. It’s totally possible that there are some <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Talismans">talismans</a> I was missing to really make the new ones sing, but I was hoping to go through the entirety of Erdtree with a brand-new build. Instead, I found myself swapping back to my bread-and-butter bleed build to get the kind of damage I needed when the going got tough – but hey, that build did have two years to get optimized through the original endgame.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are so many promising new builds that I couldn't help but wish Larval Tears were more plentiful.</p></div><p>Besides, variety is the spice of life, and Erdtree is one hot dish. Not only are there a ton of new weapons, there are also plenty of new spells, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Weapon_Skills_-_Ashes_of_War">Ashes of War</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/List_of_Summonable_Spirit_Ashes">Spirit Ash summons</a>, and talismans to cover an enormous range of different playstyles. There’s now a talisman that enhances two-handed attacks; one that decreases spellcasting time dramatically, but causes you to take increased damage; another that increases the damage of abilities that involve stances; and another still that increases your damage every time you defeat an enemy. Yes, there are also plenty that are just better versions of very useful talismans you probably already have, and there’s no shame in sticking to what works. There are so many promising new builds that I couldn’t help but wish <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Larval_Tear">Larval Tears</a> were more plentiful so I could respec my character a little more freely, as I started to run out by the time I finished Erdtree’s campaign. I still have a ton of different builds I want to try, and I’m already happily onto my second playthrough to see them. </p><h2><strong>The Joy of Freedom</strong></h2><p>The journey through The Realm of Shadow is structured very similarly to <a href="https://www.ign.com/maps/elden-ring/lands-between">The Lands Between</a>, in that the map is split up into a number of different regions. Right from the get-go, you’re able to head anywhere you want to: you could follow the initial Miquella Cross to the first big “legacy dungeon,” called Belurat, and deal with the new horrific scorpion enemies; or head across a bridge to the east and work your way over to the magic filled Castle Ensis where you have to deal with this jerk (where you have go up against one of the most challenging bosses of the DLC right away), or find a way to bypass the need to go through either of those and get straight to the Scadu Altus, which largely serves as the central hub of the Realm of Shadow. Then you could head directly toward the Shadow Keep fighting your way to the top of it in order to take on one of the major bosses, or going through one of its other exits to explore otherwise inaccessible parts of the map. It’s a liberating sense of freedom, and the same masterclass level of open-world design as the base game, just on a scale that isn’t quite so vast. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Of course, whether or not you <em>should</em> make a mad dash towards the Shadow Keep is another question entirely. Even though this is endgame content and you probably won’t be leveling up quite as fast as you did in the original campaign, there’s a separate power-scaling system that only works while you’re within the Realm of Shadow. Scattered throughout the lands are Scadutree Fragments that you can collect and turn in at <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Site_of_Grace">Sites of Grace</a> to increase your overall damage and resistances. Likewise, you can also find Revered Spirit Ash blessings to increase the damage and survivability of your Spirit Ash Summons. These are two very smart inclusions as they add a much-needed sense of progression, a valuable reward for exploration, and something else to hunt for if you’re getting wrecked by a boss and need to come back when you’re stronger – all while cleverly preserving some of the original endgame’s balance if you’re bravely tackling this DLC before circling back to beat it.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>FromSoftware says Shadow of the Erdtree is the only expansion Elden Ring will get, so it’s fortunate that it’s hard to imagine a better DLC than this – as long as you’re not hoping for it to do anything radically outside the box. Everything I loved about the original has been condensed into an incredibly tight package – one that’s the size of many standalone games all on its own, and can only be considered “small” in comparison to the absolutely massive world of Elden Ring itself. Erdtree’s absolutely jam-packed with secrets, valuable treasures, challenging boss battles, and horrific monstrosities to face off against, as well as cool new weapons, spells, Ashes of War, Spirit Ashes, talismans, and more to play around with and use to find even more novel ways to tackle its memorably brutal battles. Add on some very interesting lore revelations, not to mention the same spectacular visual design and stellar music that accompanies its larger-than-life bosses, and you’ve got what is certainly one of the best DLC expansions I’ve ever played.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft, for example, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">shut down Redfall developer Arkane Austin</a> alongside Hi-Fi Rush and Ghostwire Tokyo developer Tango Gameworks in May 2024 despite posting a 17% increase in revenue and $21.9 billion in profit in its latest financial earnings report.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As long as this company is my responsibility, that's something I would not let happen.</p></div><p>But Miyazaki appeared confident Kadokawa shares his opinion on layoffs. "Speaking to myself and this company, I want to say that this is not something I would wish on the staff at FromSoftware in a million years," he said. "I'm pretty sure our parent company Kadokawa understands that and shares that view."</p><p>He then referenced former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/07/29/nintendo-president-takes-pay-cut">famously took a pay cut himself when profits were down</a> instead of resorting to layoffs. "I sincerely doubt employees who fear that they may be laid off will be able to develop software titles that could impress people around the world," Iwata said at the time.</p><p>Miyazaki echoed this statement. "I think it was the old ex-president of Nintendo, Iwata, who said 'people who are afraid of losing their jobs are afraid of making good things.' I'm paraphrasing that, but I totally share this view," he said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p>"I think it's true, and I think the people at Kadokawa, our parent company, understand that I hold this view very strongly. While we can't say 100% — we can't say with complete certainty what the future's going to hold for From and Kadokawa — at least as long as this company is my responsibility, that's something I would not let happen. So hopefully our players and our fans can take a little bit of assurance from that."</p><p>Miyazaki's comments come just as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embracer-shuts-down-alone-in-the-dark-developer-pieces-interactive">Embracer shut down Alone in the Dark developer Pieces Interactive</a> after the game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alone-in-the-dark-reboot-flopped-embracer-says-after-laying-off-staff">failed to meet expectations</a>.

"Get a random banana every three hours and grow your collection." Banana currently has a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam with 88% of players recommending it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/banana-1718706684622.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Banana is a game about clicking bananas.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The huge player count puts Banana a tad short of the top 10 list, itself full of true heavyweights.

Its single Achievement is called CLICK and is awarded upon clicking a banana.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Banana is a clicker game in which you click a banana. Get a random banana every three hours and grow your collection.</p></div><p>Its draw perhaps comes from giving out Steam items, which can be sold for Steam credit or traded. Banana gives out banana skins as its item, and clicking on the game once in a while nets players a couple per day.</p><p>Most of these skins are near worthless in terms of real-world money, estimated at fractions of a cent, but some rare ones, like a Sad Hamster Banana or a Shiny Banana, are listed for upwards of $200. The Crypticnana is listed at $1,149. Whether or not they sell for this amount remains to be seen, of course.</p><p>While some players may be looking to exploit a simple algorithm of clicking bananas to get rewarded in hard (Steam) cash, it seems many are just trading lesser bananas for fun and getting in on what appears to be somewhat of a joke.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Each player is a suspect as you gather information to try and unravel the mystery behind who killed Mr. Boddy of Tudor Mansion, along with pinpointing where he was killed and with what weapon. A classic detective game for the whole fam.</p><h2>One Night Ultimate Werewolf</h2><div id="180806"><p><h3>One Night Ultimate Werewolf</h3></p></div><p><strong>Brand: </strong>Bezier Games</p><p><strong>Number of Players: </strong>3-10 Players</p><p>Werewolf is a beloved game that's great for big groups, but One Night Ultimate Werewolf takes it in a thrilling, fast-paced direction with no moderator, no elimination, and no downtime. Play a quick round with up to 10 people and solve the mystery of who’s the Werewolf over the course of one night.</p><h2>Mysterium</h2><div id="180807"><p><h3>Mysterium</h3></p></div><p><strong>Brand: </strong>Libellud</p><p><strong>Number of Players: </strong>2-7 Players</p><p>This game takes solving a murder mystery to a new level, as one player takes on the role of a restless ghost who assists the rest of the players, who take on the role of psychics, to help figure out who their killer is. It can be played with up to 7 players and will take you just over 40 minutes to play through.</p><h2>Exit: The Game - Dead Man on The Orient Express</h2><div id="180808"><p><h3>Exit: The Game - Dead Man on The Orient Express</h3></p></div><p><strong>Brand: </strong>Thames &amp; Kosmos</p><p><strong>Number of Players: </strong>1-4 Players</p><p>Exit: The Game brings the Escape Room setup into your own home. With this story, you'll need to step into your Agatha Christie shoes to solve the case before the train reaches its destination. It can only be played once, though, as you'll need to dig into the case materials in the box to write down notes, fold, and cut different materials.</p><h2>Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective - The Thames Murders &amp; Other Cases</h2><div id="180809"><p><h3>Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective - The Thames Murders &amp; Other Cases</h3></p></div><p><strong>Brand: </strong>Space Cowboys</p><p><strong>Number of Players: </strong>1-8 Players</p><p>In a similar vein of classic detectives and stories, the Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective - The Thames Murders &amp; Other Cases game is another way to step into those shoes to solve a case. This one in particular features 10 detailed mysteries in total to solve around Victorian London, so you can keep the murder mystery game nights going for a while. The Sherlock Holmes board game series are a bit more challenging than a classic whodunit—best for ages 12+—but many adults find it hard too!</p><h2>Hunt a Killer - Death at The Dive Bar</h2><div id="180810"><p><h3>Hunt a Killer - Death at The Dive Bar</h3></p></div><p><strong>Brand: </strong>Hunt A Killer</p><p><strong>Number of Players: </strong>1+ Players</p><p>For true crime fans, this game is one to add to your collection. Hunt a Killer - Death at the Dive Bar is an immersive puzzle game that can be played with 1 or more players and involves you solving the death of a local bar owner named Nick Webster. It'll take you about 45-60 minutes to work through as well.</p><h2>University Games Murder Mystery Party Case Files: Underwood Cellars</h2><div id="180811"><p><h3>University Games Murder Mystery Party Case Files: Underwood Cellars</h3></p></div><p><strong>Brand: </strong>University Games</p><p><strong>Number of Players: </strong>1+ Players</p><p>For those who want an even more in-depth murder mystery to solve, the Underwood Cellars Murder Mystery Party Case Files will take you about 2 hours or longer to get through. While playing, you'll need to figure out what happened to famed Napa winemaker Cary Underwood, whose body was recently found after disappearing 20 years ago.</p><h2>Deception: Murder in Hong Kong</h2><div id="180815"><p><h3>Deception: Murder in Hong Kong</h3></p></div><p><strong>Brand: </strong>Grey Fox Games</p><p><strong>Number of Players: </strong>4-12 Players</p><p>Unlike a few of the games listed above, Deception: Murder in Hong Kong will only take you a quick 20 minutes. Similar to Werewolf, this is a game where you and a group of people try to narrow down who commited the murder. Players take on the role of Murderer, Accomplice, Forensic Scientist, Witness, and Investigators, with each having an interesting part to play in the mystery.</p><h2>13 Dead End Drive</h2><div id="180819"><p><h3>13 Dead End Drive</h3></p></div><p><strong>Brand: </strong>Winning Moves Games</p><p><strong>Number of Players: </strong>2-4 Players</p><p>This game is another classic murder mystery board game for everyone to enjoy, especially since it's a bit like a board game version of Knives Out. In this game, Aunt Agatha has passed away, and without any surviving relatives, she's left her vast fortune up for grabs. Only one will inherit it... will it be you? Play with up to 4 players and set traps to get rid of the competition.</p><h2>MicroMacro: Crime City</h2><div id="180820"><p><h3>MicroMacro: Crime City</h3></p></div><p><strong>Brand: </strong>Pegasus Spiele</p><p><strong>Number of Players: </strong>1-4 Players</p><p>Not only is this game filled with 16 different cases to solve, but solving them has an interesting Where's Waldo element as well. You'll need a keen eye to track everything down, but don't worry, a magnifying glass is included with the box so you can get in close to investigate every detail. You can play with up to 4 people and it’ll take you between 15-45 minutes to complete.</p><h2>Rear Window</h2><div id="202157"><p><h3>Rear Window</h3></p></div><p><strong>Brand:</strong> Funko Games</p><p><strong>Number of Players:</strong> 3-5</p><p>Based on Hitchcock’s famous thriller movie of the same name, this riffs on Mysterium’s structure. One player is the director, who draws a random selection of people to live in four apartments and some associated characteristics for them. They then have to use a limited selection of images to try and communicate to the other players, without words, who it is that lives in which apartment. Except this game has a colossal potential twist: sometimes, but not always, there’s also a murder to solve. In this instance the game is no longer a cosy cooperative affair as the director can win if the murder stays secret, while the other players gain a team victory if they can work it out. It’s an intriguing twist that makes every game a tightrope worthy of the master of suspense himself.</p><h2>Cryptic Killers: Murder of a Millionaire</h2><div id="202158"><p><h3>Cryptic Killers: Murder of a Millionaire</h3></p></div><p><strong>Brand:</strong> Cryptic Killers</p><p><strong>Number of Players:</strong> 1-99</p><p>Cryptic Killers is an enormously popular series of murder mystery cases that you can either solve solo or cooperatively. Murder of a Millionaire was the first in the franchise, leveraging a cunning range of visual and text clues, alongside frustrating red herrings, to present you with the case of Chloe, a lottery winner found dead in the park. You’ll need to solve logic puzzles as well as interweave vital details from the reams of included props to work out which of the game’s suspects has an alibi, and which are guilty. As well as being a great mystery, the pack contents encourage you into the lives of its characters, creating a compelling narrative alongside a fun case to solve. </p><h2>Detective: A Modern Crime Board Game</h2><div id="202159"><p><h3>Detective: A Modern Crime Board Game</h3></p></div><p><strong>Brand:</strong> Portal Games</p><p><strong>Number of Players:</strong> 1-5</p><p>Detective sells itself on some bold claims. Firstly, that it’s a highly realistic simulacrum of real police work, casting you in the shoes of genuine modern-day detectives presented with reams of evidence from its online case files. Second, that it’s a long-term campaign in which information in early cases can often become relevant again in much later ones, creating an engrossing, branching narrative to enjoy. While only actual police detectives can comment on the first claim it certainly mixes murder mystery and board game mechanics to present you with complex cases to work through, and it delivers handsomely on its second claim, drawing you in to a story worthy of top drawer TV drama. </p><p><em>Which ones do you love and why??</em></p><p>For more, check out our picks for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">best engine-building board games</a>, as well as our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-board-game-buyers-guide">Betrayal at House on the Hill buyer's guide</a>.</p><p><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelance writer who works with the Guides and Commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game, now retitled Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, is very much alive, as Nintendo re-revealed Metroid Prime 4 during the Nintendo Direct event today and confirmed a 2025 release window.</p><p>A trailer during the Nintendo Direct revealed showed Samus exploring an alien planet that appears to be under siege between alien factions. We saw plenty of Prime-action like scanning creatures and lock-on targeting for enemies, and the end of the trailer showed what appeared to be this game's villain: a humanoid character flanked by two Metroids like bodyguards.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj2y3bO-LxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yj2y3bO-LxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In 2019, Nintendo announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/" data-ref-id="1100-6464593">development shifted to Retro Studios</a>, noting at the time, "The current development progress has not reached the standards we seek in a sequel to the Metroid Prime series." Bandai Namco was said to be the original developer of Metroid Prime 4.</p><p>Due to the change, development on Metroid Prime 4 was restarted from the beginning at Retro, and the project's release was delayed. But now the game is finally (almost) ready for its release this holiday. It may end up being one of the Switch's last major exclusives, as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> is expected to debut in 2025. Given the 2025 release date and that Nintendo is expected to announce the Switch successor next year, it's possible Prime 4 will become a cross-generation title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2024/06/18/super-mario-party-jamboree-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Nintendo has announced the latest installment of the Mario Party series. Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.</p>

<p>The reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.</p>

<p>Jamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.</p>

</article><p>The most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.</p>

<p>Nintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.</p>

In today's Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in&nbsp;The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it's up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/94RTrH2erPE" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>While the game takes its art style from 2019's Link's Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there's no clear indication that it is connected to Link's Awakening. In this adventure, Zelda uses a new magic item called the Tri Rod to journey across Hyrule. The Tri Rod can create "echoes" of items, like tables, beds, or boxes, to climb and explore the overworld and its dungeons, but it doesn't stop there. Echoes of water blocks can be used to swim up and over certain obstacles, while trampolines allow players to easily leap across gaps.</p>

<p>Throughout the gameplay demonstration, Series producer Eiji Aonuma explains that players can also make echoes of enemies, and that these enemies can be used in combat on your side. Zelda captures a moblin to fight some slimes, then uses meat to lure in some bird enemies and summons a deku baba to snap them up. Aonuma goes on to say that there are so many echoes in the game and that he hasn't even counted them all – we'll have to learn what the limits of echoes are, if any, some other time.</p>



<p>As the trailer continues we get more glimpses into who Zelda will be interacting with throughout the game, and it includes two kinds of Zoras, some Deku shrubs, a Sheikah person (potentially Impa) and the Great Deku Tree. It also features some 2D platforming and underwater sections, as well as Zelda using birds and plants with helicopter-like leaves to glide.</p>

<p>The game launches alongside a golden Hyrule-themed Switch lite, which you can view in the gallery of images above. Luckily, you won't have to wait long for either of them: the handheld and&nbsp;The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will be available later this year, on September 26.</p>

The game is releasing in 2025 and is officially titled Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement on 2017. The game was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.</p>

<p>Finally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro's other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.</p>

During today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that Sunblink is bringing the island-building experience to consoles and PC.</p>

<p>In Hello Kitty Island Adventure, My Melody is invited to open a gift shop at Big Adventures Park, and she invites Hello Kitty and her friends to the island. You create your own Sanrio-style character and join the getaway, but when you arrive, you learn that the park is abandoned. You must work with Hello Kitty to restore the island and theme park back to its bustling former glory.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>Sunblink claims to provide more than 100 hours of gameplay spread across several different biomes and gameplay conventions. You can also decorate your spaces and even allow friends to visit your island and decorate their Friendship Cabins. On top of that, you can collect critters, go fishing, and give gifts to island dwellers. Multiplayer allows you to solve puzzles and build homes together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sunblink promises new characters, areas, clothing, items, visitors, minigames, and more will join the game post-launch, and it will all be free. Like its Apple Arcade release, there is no premium currency to earn or purchase, and you unlock everything by playing the game. Hello Kitty Island Adventure arrives on Switch in 2025, followed by releases on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC in the same calendar year.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-director-doesnt-think-open-world-games-will-become-the-new-standard-for-fromsoftware/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=elden-ring-director-doesnt-think-open-world-games-will-become-the-new-standard-for-fromsoftware<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="362" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Given the success of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a></em>, we’re undoubtedly going to get a sequel someday, but it also wouldn’t be surprising if its open world formula influenced other future FromSoftware games too. However, <em>Elden Ring</em> director and studio president Hidetaka Miyazaki doesn’t sound keen on the idea of having every game FromSoftware makes be open world.</p> <p data-characters="572" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">Ahead of the launch of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hands-on-elden-ring-took-me-to-the-shadow-realm-in-its-expansion-and-it-ruled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC</a>, Miyazaki sat down with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-on-bringing-elden-ring-to-a-close-and-the-future-of-from-software/1100-6524337/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a> to discuss <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s development and the future of FromSoftware. When asked if open world games will now serve as a new baseline for the studio, Miyazaki downplayed the possibility: “I wouldn’t necessarily say that open world is going to become the new base or foundation or standard of the company. … We have a lot of game directors and designers who are growing, so we’d love to keep an open mind in terms of the types of games that we develop.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true">He continued, “I can’t really say anything at this exact moment, but perhaps when you see future announcements from FromSoftware you’ll look back at this point and think, “Ah, that’s what he meant.”” Basically, Miyazaki isn’t ruling out more open world games in the future, but they won’t be the only thing the studio will focus on.</p>
 <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">The amount of freedom <em>Elden Ring</em> offers with its non-linear structure is certainly one of its strengths, and I doubt this will change for the inevitable sequel. However, it’s good to know FromSoftware won’t be applying this structure to every game it makes. Otherwise, they’d all risk blending together and feeling awfully similar. Not to mention they’d require incredibly long development times and thus increase the wait in-between games.</p>
 <p data-characters="599" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="false">Miyazaki’s comment about keeping an open mind on the sort of games the studio develops also makes me hopeful that we’ll see FromSoftware diversify its portfolio a little. Hopefully, the success of mecha combat game <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Armored Core 6</a></em> means the studio will get back into that series, but it’d be nice if it got to branch out into other genres, even ones it’s dabbled in before. FromSoftware tried its hand at an adventure game with 2018’s <em>Déraciné</em>, and I know more than a few people would love to see it do another mission-based third-person shooter like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-metal-wolf-chaos-xd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Wolf Chaos</a></em>.</p>
