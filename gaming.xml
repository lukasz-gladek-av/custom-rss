            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313974/nzxt-flex-pc-rental-response<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0">a long video published over the weekend by Gamers Nexus</a> called NZXT’s Flex PC rental program <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation">“a scam,”</a> the company responded Tuesday with a statement titled <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/nzxt-update-addressing-your-concerns-about-the-flex-subscription-program">“Addressing Your Concerns About the Flex Subscription Program.”</a> “I want to acknowledge that we messed up,” said NZXT CEO Johnny Hou <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSp5B--HKL4">in a video</a>, promising changes like making the names of PCs available for rent or purchase easier to tell apart.</p></div><p>However, what it said has not satisfied Gamers Nexus, which <a href="https://x.com/GamersNexus/status/1864657751986626988?">posted its own response</a>, saying NZXT’s statement “not only misrepresents facts, but distorts the reality of their predatory rental computer program. The statement ignores major points and introduces several new concerns.” The post says GN is working on a new investigation into the program that “will take weeks or months to finalize.”</p><p>The two main actions NZXT says it’s taking are on the PC names, like switching the name of its “Player: One” rental PC to “Flex: One Subscription PC,” and influencer campaigns “where the statements did not accurately reflect the details of our NZXT Flex program.” NZXT says it has pulled all of its “influencer-led” advertising while it updates the language and process.</p><p>NZXT says it is adjusting the language in its subscriber agreement as well and will make it clear that the company doesn’t sell user data on customers’ returned PCs. “Every Flex PC that comes back is fully wiped,” Hou said.&nbsp;</p><p>Hou also addressed the rental PC specs that Gamers Nexus said fluctuated “day-to-day,” noting that the Flex program “doesn’t give you fixed specs” due to the changing availability of components. “Sometimes we don’t have more supply coming in, so in the midst of that we actually have to change the specs of our PCs.”</p><p>However, this still doesn’t explain why NZXT displayed the same estimated frames per second across builds with different components.<em> The Verge</em> has contacted NZXT about the program, but the company has not responded.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
One of my favourite anime shows is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlrPO6dBaxw">Sakura Quest</a>. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed "Queen" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.
</p>
<p>
I'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old "danchi" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI.

<p>
Hoshino needs to persuade 100 residents to attend the festival by gathering clues about their "quirks and desires". Some of these clues are found online, care of a gorgeous Y2K web browser that harbours a few minigames. Others must be uncovered using Hoshino's low-key Sherlockian capabilities. "A tossed-aside cigarette butt tells a story, and the fragrant scent of trees hides the sneaky presence of a mosquito," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3107530/Danchi_Days/">the Steam page comments</a>. Confound you, trees! When the day of the festival comes, we will chop you down for firewood. Providing we get permission from the council.
</p><p>
Danchi Days takes inspiration from auld Japanese console delights like Earthbound and Moon Remix RPG, but it's also semi-autobiographical - based on developers sandy powder and Melos Han-Tani's experience of living in a real-life danchi, with art from illustrator mogumu. It's being published by Analgesic Productions, whose other works include the amazing and perpetually overlooked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anodyne">Anodyne</a> games. I'm hoping the new game's apartment block doesn't harbour anything like Anodyne 2's desertNPC.
</p>
<p>
Keen? It's not out for a while - sometime in 2026. In the meantime, you can catch up on Sakura Quest. Don't miss the multiple episode arc about the fight to extend the local bus route.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/jake-paul-added-to-undisputed-boxing-roster/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Jake Paul is joining the Undisputed boxing roster. Developer Steel City Interactive announced on Thursday that Paul will be joining the game as part of The Problem Child DLC pack on December 12.</p>



<p>“Jake’s influence on modern boxing is undeniable. His meteoric rise has introduced a whole new generation to the sport, especially those who have followed him from a YouTube phenomenon to a legitimate boxing contender,” Founder and CEO of Steel City Interactive Ash Habib said via release.</p>







<p>“I’ve been breaking barriers and making history in real life, so it’s only fitting that I bring the same energy to Undisputed. This isn’t just about being in a video game; it’s about inspiring a new generation of fans to step into the ring—virtually and in real life,” Paul said.</p>



<p>To get Paul into Undisputed, the developers at Steel City Interactive did full motion capture at their UK-based studio. </p>



<p>“The Steel City team nailed every detail, from my moves to my swag, and I can’t wait for players to test their skills,” Paul said.</p>



<p>In addition to Paul, The Problem Child DLC pack will feature six more fighters, including: Zhilei Zhang, James ‘Buster’ Douglas, Otto Wallin, Erik Morales, Marco Antonio Barrera, &amp; Juan Manuel Marquez.</p>



<p>As of writing, no price for the DLC pack has been announced. As far as future additions go, Insider Gaming has heard of a few names the studio has had talks with that were either close to a deal or have signed a deal that hasn’t been announced yet. Paul was one of those names, and there are others that, while can’t be said yet, are pretty obvious fighters to be added in future DLC.</p>

He was hit by a truck and ultimately pulled under it as the driver kept going. "The Xbox in my backpack prevented me from hitting my head or worse, even dying. I wasn't gonna get shredded beneath the truck so I used my left leg to attempt to slow the truck," Brandon wrote.</p><p>"At this point my bike wedged my right leg so I couldn’t move it anywhere. Next thing I know my backpack was only hanging on by my left shoulder and was slammed into the curb along with me afterwards."</p><p>After this, Brandon said he felt the full weight of the front end of the truck begin to roll onto his ribs, going on to say he was dragged for about 12 feet. He was taken to the hospital and miraculously only had a single broken bone in his left foot, in addition to some road rash. Not only was Brandon mostly OK from the experience, but his Xbox didn't break either. He said it booted up normally and runs games despite the toll it took and the damage it sustained.</p><p>"If the Xbox wasn’t in my bag at the time a lot more could have happened…" he wrote.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/infinity-nikki">Infinity Nikki</a> - the cute and colourful dress up game with gacha elements - released earlier today, but was quickly hacked, with reports of players being met with a distressing and distasteful message.</p>
<p>Please note, there may be some upsetting content below. <strong>Please read on at your own discretion.</strong></p>

<p>As shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1h73ssp/infinity_nikki_site_got_hacked/">reddit</a> and social media platform X, the Infinity Nikki website briefly displayed an abusive message earlier this morning, which was being used to promote fellow gacha game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> (there is no evidence this message was posted by a member of the Genshin Impact community). </p><p>A QR was also displayed under the message, but for obvious reasons, Eurogamer has not tested to see where it leads. However, it appears the hacked page was for the official celebration event, which asks players to use a QR code to open a page on their phone.</p>

<p>A reddit moderator suggested the Infinity Nikki website was "compromised for roughly 30-40 minutes", but advises players proceed with caution until developer Infold makes an announcement regarding the site's status.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it appears that the Infinity Nikki servers are down for some. Our Zoe was looking to stream the game this afternoon, however she has been met with a maintenance notice.</p>
<p>"The server is not open yet," the message on Zoe's screen reads, stating maintenance will conclude in 2029 (which we hope is an error). Additionally, Infinity Nikki's announcement page isn't working for Zoe.</p>
<p>It is unclear if these server issues are related to this morning's hack. Eurogamer has reached out to the Infinity Nikki team for comment.</p>
<p>We recently awarded Infinity Nikki four out of five stars, with our Jessica saying it has the potential to give Genshin Impact a run for its money.</p>
<p>"It sure is nice see miHoYo have some proper competition for once, and I know I'll still be returning to Miraland whenever I'm in need of a mood boost, whether that be in the form of humming along to catchy tunes while Whimcycling my way towards hot air balloons, or laughing at the melodrama in future story updates," she wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-review">Eurogamer's Infinity Nikki review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/openai-future-chatgpt-pc-gamer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The last time I wrote about <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-california-conde-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad AI deals</a>, I wrote that I was “running out of things to yell,” but I guess I wasn’t: Future, publisher of games and tech sites such as PC Gamer, GamesRadar, Tom’s Guide, and Edge magazine, has made a deal with OpenAI.</p><p>According to an <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-and-future-partner-on-specialist-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI blog post</a>, “The initiative brings Future’s journalism to new audiences while also enhancing the ChatGPT experience. ChatGPT users will be able to access content from across Future’s portfolio, with attribution and links to the full original articles for transparency and further information.”</p><p>The post notes that this “partnership builds on Future’s existing deployment of OpenAI’s technology,” with chatbots currently on Tom’s Hardware and fashion site Who What Wear. I messed around with the Tom’s bot this morning, which does in fact cite the guides its information comes from. (For what it’s worth, asking the same question of ChatGPT itself did not return any sources.) This stands in some contrast to the experience<a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/06/insider-union-chatgpt-hallucinating-links-business-insider-articles-openai-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Business Insider</a> had with its own OpenAI partnership, which failed to properly credit BI’s scoops.</p><p>You don’t need me to tell you that no good comes from feeding the work of writers into the ravenous maw of the plagiarism machine. This is yet another deal that serves OpenAI and the publishing companies it gets in bed with, while hurting the staffers and freelancers who actually <em>write</em> the words these companies need more and more of.

			<p>Mr. Robot has been cheating death for a decade now, ever since Don’t Die, Mr. Robot first launched on PS Vita, but now it’s time for his greatest challenge yet: not dying in three whole dimensions. Kind of. 3D Don’t Die Mr. Robot spruces up the 2014 indie classic with new visuals, but even with the change of perspective, it’s the same core gameplay that makes it as addictive as ever.</p>
<p><iframe title="3D Don't Die, Mr. Robot!  *Wishlist Trailer 2*" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8mDp4fUDbw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Mr Robot is stuck in the dimension of Neon Dunjun, tasked with collecting all sorts of fruit while avoiding enemies that pass across the stage in an attempt to destroy him. Mr Robot has no attacks of his own, but thankfully the fruit he’s collecting is actually explosive, blowing up and taking out any nearby enemies –&nbsp;he’s equally fortunate to personally be immune to these explosions, though just one touch from an enemy and it is lights out for him.</p>


<p>Different enemies have different movements that you need to work out. Some will fly in a straight line, while others come in a group and spread out across the level so you need to guide Mr Robot to stand in a gap between their paths, and yet more will home in on Mr. Robot, or pop in as a pair and fire a laser beam across the level. You need keep moving and adjusting your position, but will often find yourself getting cornered.</p>


<p>The main mode in 3D Don’t Die Mr Robot is Remix, giving you a sequence of levels to work through. Every level has a ranking system from bronze to platinum trophies, and once you unlock the platinum trophy the level ends. Getting that platinum at the start of Remix is easy enough, because the game is still introducing you to the different elements of it. The further you get, the tougher things become. There are levels where the platform is tiny and enemies are popping up with no way to close the gap on them with Mr Robot, so you must instead wait for fruits to appear and line up to create a chain of explosions to save him. Linking these chains together rewards you with lots of points, though points don’t always mean prizes. In some missions, you have to destroy a set number of enemies while in others you have to collect coins. As you meet each trophy tier in missions the number of enemies increases, as does their speed, testing your reactions as you go.</p>
<p>Outside of Remix mode, there is Arcade mode which is essentially a score mode where you try to survive as long as you possibly can to rack up those points. And with online leaderboards, you will want to keep chasing those scores. My personal favourite named mode is Lime Attack, which is a time attack mode which is green and the only fruit that appears is limes. Chill Out mode brings some coolness to 3D Don’t Die Mr Robot too, and rounds out the modes available. &nbsp;Collecting the coins in missions is not a pointless endeavour if you love accessorising. You can use the coins to unlock all sorts of accessories for Mr Robot, including hats, glasses, shoes and body colours.</p>

<p>What Infinite State Games has nailed with 3D Don’t Die Mr Robot is that feeling of chasing a high score, and doing better each time you go in. Every time I failed to hit Platinum in Remix mode, I would immediately replay that level over and over until I did get it… or the mission proved too tough for me, and I lowered my target to the Gold trophy.</p>
<p>One niggle I did find with the game was Mr Robot kind of getting stuck on corners in missions where the layout had some sharp corners or turns, which led to some runs ending quickly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-brings-new-jobs-to-star-wars-board-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new expansion is coming for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mandalorian-adventures-board-game-announced-by-asmodee-group" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Mandalorian: Adventures</em></a>. Unexpected Games' latest premium expansion, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> will add new game elements to the base game based on Season 2 of the popular streaming series.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> was designed by Unexpected Games' studio head Corey Konieczka, the same mind behind the original release. The expansion introduces four new characters, four locations, and a brand new mission book. The expansion is not a standalone experience and requires the base game.</p>

This season involves the titular Mandalorian Din Djarin attempting to reunite his companion Grogu with the nomadic Jedi Order, all while avoiding attacks and plots by the Imperial Moff Gideon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Season 2 of <em>The Mandalorian</em> included some of my favorite Star Wars™&nbsp;scenes in the last decade. It was a blast recreating these moments for the board game, and this expansion includes so much more. From Boba Fett and Ahsoka Tano to duels and dangerous cards, I can't wait for you to see all the new content.” said Konieczka.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to new characters and missions, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> introduces new enemy types, ongoing events, and a duel deck. These elements can be integrated into the base game, adding more replayability to the experience.</p>

In addition to this board game about helmeted bounty hunters there is the collectible card game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-unlimited-shadows-of-galaxy-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em></a> and the skirmish miniatures game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/star-wars-shatterpoint-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Shatterpoint</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> will be available in Summer 2025. It will be sold at an MSRP of $39.99.</p>

The expansion more than doubles the total number of patents that EA has opened up since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22638535/ea-accessibility-patent-pledge-apex-legends-ping-system">launching the pledge in 2021</a>, and includes generation and recognition tools for speech and audio.</p><p>“We believe that games should be accessible to everyone and our industry-leading teams are always looking for new ways to make this a reality,” Kerry Hopkins, SVP of Global Affairs at EA, said in a press release. “By making this technology available to others, we continue to work to enhance accessibility and inclusivity for players around the world by removing unintended barriers to access.”</p><p>Some examples of open tech patents include systems that can improve speech recognition, generate expressive speech audio from text data, and generate speech that mimics a player’s voice based on minimal sample speech data. One system uses machine learning to make a player’s voice sound older, while another “infers a player’s emotion while playing a video game” and automatically adjusts the game’s background music to best suit their emotional state.</p><p>EA says these patents could be used to improve gaming experiences for players with speech disorders or who struggle with verbally expressing themselves, helping them to communicate in a way that better represents their age, emotion, language, and speaking style. Alongside this announcement, EA is also releasing a <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/IRIS-Unreal-Plugin/">Unreal Engine 5 plugin that enables in-engine use of IRIS</a> — EA’s photosensitivity analysis tech — to help game developers identify frames that could impact photosensitive players.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals is just an Overwatch clone. That’s what former Blizzard President Mike Ybarra seemed to suggest in a post on social media on Wednesday (December 4).</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1864450732054675950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his post</a>, Ybarra called the game “Overwatch Marvel Rivals” while making comparisons to a recently announced game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looks similar to Horizon Zero Dawn</a>.</p>



<p>“Looks like Overwatch Marvel Rivals ships tomorrow,” Ybarra said. “Much like Light of Motiram (a clear copy of HZD) out of China. I mean even the character name – Widowmaker in OW vs. Black Widow in Marvel Rivals lol. NetEase/TenCent – all the same.”</p>







<p>Of course, one part of his comment that stood out was comparing Overwatch’s Widowmaker to Marvel’s Black Widow. It’s unclear to tell through text whether that was a legitimate criticism, but users on Twitter were quick to use the community note feature on the post.</p>



<p>Black Widow, for those that don’t know, first debuted in 1964. That puts the character 52 years older than Widowmaker. Again, however, it’s hard to tell if that comparison was serious or made in jest. That said, he has made other posts in relation to the game without addressing the comparison.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">It might not be arriving anytime soon, but Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has made clear that work is resuming on Haunted Chocolatier. The Stardew Valley creator has returned to the game after focusing on that title's 1.6 update.</p><p dir="ltr">Barone wrote <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2024/12/04/update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new blog post</a> on the Haunted Chocolatier website, acknowledging it's "been a while" since the last update. The main reason for that has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-wont-resume-work-on-haunted-chocolatier-until-stardew-version-1-6-is-settled/1100-6522145/" data-ref-id="1100-6522145">the developer's commitment to Stardew Valley 1.6</a>. Even since launching the considerable patch, bug fixes and console porting have been a priority. But now, Haunted Chocolatier should get the spotlight.</p><p dir="ltr">"My next task will be to tweak the existing bones [of Haunted Chocolatier] until I'm happy with them, add all the rest of the bones, and then flesh it all out with all the content that will need to be in the game," wrote Barone. "Yes, it's going to be a lot of work still, but it's okay, I'm addicted to the grind."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4410293-image-2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4410293" data-ratio="0.41705842847549" data-width="1489" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4410293-image-2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4410293"></a><figcaption>A work-in-progress screenshot of Haunted Chocolatier, showcasing the game's action-RPG elements. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4410293-image-2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Barone noted that Haunted Chocolatier will be created similarly to Stardew Valley. "I'm coding it (mostly from scratch) in C#, and I'm working solo in all areas," wrote the developer. "Why? It's what I'm comfortable with, it's what I enjoy, and it worked well for Stardew Valley." Barone adds that help technically might be needed down the road, but Haunted Chocolatier would basically be complete before that.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-gives-update-on-stardew-valley-1-6-console-port-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6526220/" data-ref-id="1100-6526220">Returning to Haunted Chocolatier after Stardew Valley 1.6 has always been the plan</a> for Barone, acknowledging the situation throughout this year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-announces-new-game-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6497292/" data-ref-id="1100-6497292">Haunted Chocolatier was originally unveiled</a> over three years ago. The RPG/simulation title will see players living in a haunted castle, with gameplay leaning heavier into action-RPG territory compared to Stardew Valley.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1666085285"

Sony had intended to team up with Nintendo on a disc-based, next-gen successor to the SNES. Then the Mario maker decided to stick with cartridges at the last minute, completely changing the console gaming timeline in the process. A new machine was born, one that gave us some of our favorite games ever made.

This single disc was bursting with arcade action, containing fully realized video game adaptations of all three (at the time, the only three) <em>Die Hard </em>movies, each one completely different from the others. The first is a third-person shooter that has you gunning down hordes of terrorists as you navigate Nakitomi Plaza, while the second is an on-rails, first-person shooter that sees you blast your way through Dulles Airport and beyond before a ludicrous final sequence takes you to the skies in a helicopter, from which you shoot terrorists off the wings of an in-flight 747 before bringing the whole evil airplane down. It’s surprising, stupendous, and so uniquely <em>video games</em>.</p><p>The one I remember the most, though, is <em>Die Hard With a Vengeance</em>, an absolutely crazed driving game in which you barrel down the streets and around the parks of New York City. Drawn into a terrorist’s twisted game, you must intercept cars that have been rigged with bombs and prevent them from exploding, which, of course, you do by crashing into them repeatedly, <em>Chase HQ</em>-style. You get an assortment of camera options here, one of which is a first-person, in-the-car view. Hit pedestrians in this perspective and your windshield might get momentarily splattered with blood, quickly washed away by your windshield wipers. It’s all very ‘90s edgy and extreme. <em>With a Vengeance</em>, while pretty simple and limited, is possessed of the kind of kinetic energy that would later make games like <em>Burnout 3 </em>so exhilarating, and <em>Die Hard Trilogy </em>as a whole crackles with a balls-to-the-wall enthusiasm that made it a defining release of the early PlayStation era.—Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4cbb6cdd04885a5db3ab7d81ba1cf94b" data-recommend-id="image://4cbb6cdd04885a5db3ab7d81ba1cf94b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man with giant wheels for hands battles in Paris.

Blow up the Eiffel Tower! Send your opponents plummeting from precarious New York City rooftops!

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Final Fantasy VII </em>is, deservedly, one of the most analyzed and celebrated games of all time, so there’s no insight I can offer into its greatness—especially in a relatively brief slideshow blurb—that hasn’t already been made a thousand times over. Instead, I’ll relay a memory. During my senior year of college, some friends and I had a borrowed PlayStation in the apartment we were sharing, much to the detriment of our studies, and the discovery of that game’s world, the struggles of its characters, and the monumental achievement of its design became part of the fabric of that year for us.</p><p>I’d been playing games my whole life, but in so many ways, <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>was like nothing I’d ever played before–so grandiose, so thematically complex, so audacious and spectacular. I’ll never forget one of my roommates coming back from class one afternoon, tossing his backpack down on the ground and shouting, “Gold chocobo!” before recommitting himself to the grind for the precious bird. We knew the world of <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>still held secrets we hadn’t yet attained, and we wanted to explore it for all its mysteries before venturing to that fateful final confrontation with Sephiroth. In the decades since, so many games have given us worlds that are more vast, more graphically detailed, more packed with time-wasting “content,” but I don’t know that there’s ever been a world that was more memorable and astounding, or that has served as the setting for a more epic and unforgettable tale. – Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3dfff4e2b8dfe5705f856b7a092e9d62" data-recommend-id="image://3dfff4e2b8dfe5705f856b7a092e9d62" data-format="png" data-width="1266" data-height="712" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mega Man and Roll run away from sky pirates.

It ditched 2D levels for an expansive, Saturday-morning-cartoon-esque world full of sprawling underground dungeons hiding powerful gear and dark secrets. I still remember the first time I went down a hatch, creeped around a corner, and immediately got skewered by a dual-drill-armed Sharukurusu. It was my first taste of open-world exploration and massive sandbox battles. Everything in this game was firing on all cylinders and it’s a travesty we never got <em>Mega Man Legends 3</em>. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9d618949f860319f0519d95fdca63487" data-recommend-id="image://9d618949f860319f0519d95fdca63487" data-format="png" data-width="1109" data-height="623" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abe walks along industrial scaffolding.

I wasn’t even 10 years old when I first saw Abe get gunned down outside a totalitarian industrial complex for getting on the wrong side of management and messing up a puzzle. The 2D adventure game had immaculately grim vibes with just enough cheeky, gallows humor to keep it from feeling entirely overbearing. The sequel spin-off had more depth and polish, but it still didn’t come close to the visceral gut punch of the first game. The opening FMV remains seared into my memory, and the late-game mechanical twist is an all-time great one. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7a3da461a0c036da04437e34002ff270" data-recommend-id="image://7a3da461a0c036da04437e34002ff270" data-format="png" data-width="986" data-height="555" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Parappa raps.

By that, I mean it’s emblematic of the spirit of the original PlayStation, a spirit of playful innovation and experimentation that sought to produce new kinds of home console games and to create new kinds of fun and memorable experiences. <em>Parappa </em>proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that tapping buttons on a controller in rhythm with a song could be great fun, and that concept would go on to power some of the biggest games of the decade to come. And yet, it all could have failed if <em>Parappa </em>itself hadn’t been so great–so creatively distinctive, so vibrant, so packed with unforgettable songs. Thankfully, however, within a few minutes of starting the game, an anthropomorphic onion is teaching you to rap and do martial arts with the words, “Kick, punch, it’s all in the mind!” and it’s all so wild and surreal and committed to its own vision that you know, immediately, you are never gonna forget it. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6f8f5e5b7724e972fe79182ed4ed0949" data-recommend-id="image://6f8f5e5b7724e972fe79182ed4ed0949" data-format="png" data-width="1900" data-height="1068" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dracula and other characters from Symphony of the Night appear in official art work.

When <em>Symphony of the Night </em>arrived on the scene in 1997, however, it made a very strong impression, in some ways redefining our collective notions of what was possible in the genre of 2D action games. Going in without pre-defined expectations, many players of the time–myself included–found ourselves absolutely astounded by the game’s richness and depth. Just when we thought the castle couldn’t possibly have more to give, we’d find our exploration rewarded yet again with still more areas, secrets, and bosses. For my money, the game’s second half may represent the single biggest surprise in all of gaming, a secret the likes of which may never be topped. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1f959b058ccb879b4d1385509ed20480" data-recommend-id="image://1f959b058ccb879b4d1385509ed20480" data-format="jpg" data-width="1065" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lara Croft shoots a Gatling gun.

The incredible intricacy of its environments, however, is also part of what makes it so memorable. <em>Tomb Raider 2 </em>proved that Lara Croft was no mere one-hit wonder, no fleeting sensation rocketed to short-lived stardom merely because of her sex appeal. With the success of this game, her status as an icon was cemented, and at the time, no other figure represented the new, PlayStation-powered era that video games were entering quite like she did. — Carolyn Petit </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="da89d1df6c9c0b06d33f9f37300f4e06" data-recommend-id="image://da89d1df6c9c0b06d33f9f37300f4e06" data-format="png" data-width="1064" data-height="599" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pixel art sprites appear on a bridge in battle.

Not only did the hero not live to tell the tale, the true history of what happened was ultimately buried with him. While <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>examined corporate exploitation and militarism, <em>Tactics</em> interrogated political power and religious dogma. Even optimizing the job system to create a teleporting, dual-wielding ninja of death wasn’t enough to come out the other side alive.

A Tim Burton-esque marriage of horror and whimsy, <em>MediEvil </em>is bursting with grody imagery, and though it’s all cartoonish and goofy, that didn’t stop me from fixating on the scary shit when I played it in Kindergarten. <em>MediEvil</em> is clunky to play by modern standards, but its charm and humor are pretty timeless. Maybe that’s why Sony keeps remaking it.

Not only did the developer usher <em>Final Fantasy </em>into a bold new era, but it did so while also producing numerous other incredible works that pushed the role-playing genre forward. <em>Parasite Eve </em>is remarkable for many reasons, not the least of which is its fantastic use of a real-world setting, a real rarity for an RPG at the time of its release. Taking place in New York City in the final days of 1997, the game whisks you from elegant operas to hushed museums to grimy city streets while you–as NYPD officer Aya Brea–work to thwart a horrifying threat to the Big Apple’s population. To this day, Christmastime in New York City still makes me think of <em>Parasite Eve</em>, a game that manages to feel wintry, melancholy, thrilling, and unsettling all at once. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3d5953be9d060a929a912684df9b6d30" data-recommend-id="image://3d5953be9d060a929a912684df9b6d30" data-format="png" data-width="1109" data-height="624" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman is cornered by two zombies.

Still, I think plenty of PlayStation owners were keenly aware, by 1999, that the system didn’t really have anything that could compete with <em>Mario Kart</em>. That all changed with the arrival of <em>Crash Team Racing</em>, a kart racer so good, some justifiably felt it beat Nintendo’s series<em> </em>at its own game. <em>CTR</em>’s visuals were vibrant and appealing, the racing was thrilling, the tracks were brilliantly designed and had terrific shortcuts–it had all the pick-up-and-play fun of a kart racer along with the high skill ceiling genre enthusiasts crave. To top it all off, its Adventure Mode, which has you racing against bosses, unlocking new stages and making story progress, was the most elaborate and exciting single-player mode ever offered in a kart racer at the time. — Carolyn Petit </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="18ca289da19740f550809e6dccdfc614" data-recommend-id="image://18ca289da19740f550809e6dccdfc614" data-format="png" data-width="892" data-height="501" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rinoa, Squall, and Seifer stand in a field of flowers.

And I don’t think any conversation about the impact of the original PlayStation is complete without it.</p><p><em>FFVIII</em> arguably endures in the hearts of its fans for many reasons: It’s a moving coming-of-age story set in a strange, hard-to-comprehend world. Its off-beat RPG mechanics are capable of being entertainingly exploited and utterly broken. The game features a rich, hybrid sci-fi/fantasy world with numerous cities and settlements to explore as you piece together its strange, time-bending narratives about moody teenagers shouldered with the burdens of protecting the world and each other. It didn’t land with everyone. But those of us for whom it did are still thinking about it nearly 30 years later.</p><p>I would argue that <em>FFVIII</em>’s dark horse status, however, is part of its character. While other <em>FF</em> games receive endless celebration and expensive remakes, the joy of <em>FFVIII</em>’s greatness is a sort of “if you know, you know” status for fans. In the last 30 years, I’d argue that the PlayStation brand has been home to many such experiences (fans of lesser-celebrated PlayStation titles like <em>Heavenly Sword</em>, <em>Killzone</em>, and <em>SOCOM</em> know what I’m talking about). <em>FFVIII</em>, to me, is one of the best early examples of that: Owning a PlayStation meant you could enjoy landmark titles while also finding some genuine hidden gems in its vast library. — Claire Jackson </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7234dfb629a82ac2a52fe4ad1f6abb84" data-recommend-id="image://7234dfb629a82ac2a52fe4ad1f6abb84" data-format="png" data-width="1028" data-height="577" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A car races down a track.

It might not look realistic, but <em>GT’</em>s polygonal cars and wobbly roads still get the job done and remind me of a time when racing games weren’t live-service monsters.

I spent what was probably hours playing around with the monster fusion mechanic that let me mix the creatures I captured into something that took on their physical traits, which was mind-blowing to me back in the 90s. But even setting that aside, I was enthralled at a young age by its melodrama. Walking through the village I’d been running around all game after its citizens had been turned to stone was terrifying and has been etched in my brain for decades.

Dripping with wonderfully overwrought gothic atmosphere, <em>Soul Reaver </em>features a mechanic by which you shift between planes of existence, one material and the other spectral, to solve puzzles and navigate the world. It was a very cool technical achievement for the time that made playing as betrayed wraith Raziel feel unlike anything else out there. Does <em>Soul Reaver </em>hold up as still worth playing today? We’re about to find out, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/soul-reaver-remaster-remake-psn-leak-state-of-play-ps5-1851656134&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/soul-reaver-remaster-remake-psn-leak-state-of-play-ps5-1851656134">remasters of the game and its sequel</a></span> are almost here. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="23930a3bf7878da01c162fd21a816380" data-recommend-id="image://23930a3bf7878da01c162fd21a816380" data-format="png" data-width="1043" data-height="587" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A player shoots Nazis.

Back then, first-person shooters tended to be heavily inspired by sci-fi or action movies, think <em>Doom</em> or <em>Golden Eye</em> on N64. And only a few ever leapt to console. <em>Medal of Honor</em> on the PS1 showed that console gamers were hungry for serious WW2 shooters, and it was also a really good game, which helped, too. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2ba2656272e821b2a70aafc357eed327" data-recommend-id="image://2ba2656272e821b2a70aafc357eed327" data-format="png" data-width="1058" data-height="594" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spyro appears in a render for the sequel.

It added more traversal capabilities like swimming and climbing, and more variety to the puzzles and challenges. It was short but sweet. The Autumn Plains are still my happy place. Breathing fire, collecting gems, and gliding in front of bright empty skyboxes was more fun than it had any right to be. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fc0ce6d682f84510a58162b511daa479" data-recommend-id="image://fc0ce6d682f84510a58162b511daa479" data-format="png" data-width="1178" data-height="663" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man hangs from the ceiling above fire.

It’s horrible and hilarious every time. <em>Syphon Filter</em> might not be a franchise people talk about much in 2024, but that original game on PlayStation spent a lot of time in my console because it offered up a fun, tense, and action-packed modern-day shooter about secret agents, deadly viruses, and government corruption. And also, that cool taser thing I mentioned earlier. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d60e144ad6bdfdc2f19f2331935361b5" data-recommend-id="image://d60e144ad6bdfdc2f19f2331935361b5" data-format="png" data-width="1261" data-height="709" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A kid goes to a Digimon store.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The <em>Digimon World </em>subseries has taken many different forms since the original launched in 1999, and even the first three games are all drastically different from each other. The first was more evocative of <em>Digimon</em>’s digital pet roots, weaving raising a ‘mon from its baby form into a powerful monster capable of taking on some of the bigger threats you have to face. But it could also be frustratingly tedious, as your partner would go through multiple cycles of life, dying and being reborn as a baby you had to once again raise to the point of usefulness before moving forward. The sequels had their own progress-gating but felt much less arbitrary, and had interesting twists on the <em>Digimon</em> universe that kept them fresh. Would love to see a collection on modern platforms, Bandai Namco. — Kenneth Shepard </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f35e6c4e475114fadf9e51b33f674bc2" data-recommend-id="image://f35e6c4e475114fadf9e51b33f674bc2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dart and his friends fly toward danger.

The Sony-developed RPG took aim at <em>Final Fantasy</em> and missed, but not by much. The pre-rendered backgrounds were magnificent, the music was beautiful, and the mythological stakes helped me look past the ugly enemy designs and incredibly grindy random encounters. I loved it so much, I beat the whole thing and then watched my cousins play it again on an old TV in the basement that had no sound. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f658c9ab379068a6327a0316e41330db" data-recommend-id="image://f658c9ab379068a6327a0316e41330db" data-format="png" data-width="1013" data-height="629" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spider-Man punches a super villain.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’ve been raised on the current slate of Sony <em>Spider-Man </em>games, it’s probably impossible to look at Neversoft’s 2000 release featuring the wall-crawler and understand what all the fuss was about. At the time, however, it exploded onto the scene as one of the best superhero games ever made. It nailed the appeal of Spidey–his wisecracks, his decency, his abilities–and swept you up in a breathless adventure that had you swinging from New York City skyscrapers, battling supervillains on top of speeding subway trains, and tackling all kinds of other superhero setpieces. If you ask me, the lineage of great 3D Spider-games that’s still going today all started right here with this incredible achievement. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c5aeec0325158b3df88ab6cb8b593659" data-recommend-id="image://c5aeec0325158b3df88ab6cb8b593659" data-format="png" data-width="845" data-height="475" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tony Hawk appears beside his avatar.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The original <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> is amazing. But <em>THPS2</em> is the better game, boasting the same snappy and responsive 3D skateboarding as its predecessor, but with new features and tricks. <em>THPS2</em> added manuals, letting you combo more tricks together to reach higher scores. It also included create-a-skater and create-a-park, letting younger me spend way too many hours tinkering with the game. Really, the only reason I stopped playing <em>THPS2</em> was to play <em>THPS3</em> on PS2. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4d3f07f4bbc7c96a4551e4e8d7f24959" data-recommend-id="image://4d3f07f4bbc7c96a4551e4e8d7f24959" data-format="png" data-width="1105" data-height="621" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ashely faces down a wyvern.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I hated <em>Vagrant Story </em>the first time I picked it up. Horror-filled catacombs and zombies roaming the streets? If I’d wanted that I would have played <em>Resident Evil</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>and I very much did not. But I stuck with it and quickly realized I’d actually discovered one of the best games—still to this day—ever made. The writing is brilliant, the atmospheric dungeon crawling is clever and elegant, and the hybrid turn-based action combat is surprising and satisfying. It only had one problem, and that was the awful damage formulas that rendered all attacks useless unless you spent a ton of time grinding against particular enemy types or mastering its baroque blacksmithing system. But I persevered through the single-digit strikes against enemies and one-hit spells from bosses because the medieval noir thriller at <em>Vagrant Story</em>’s core is second to none.—Ethan Gach</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You'll be able to get around the metropolis in a variety of vehicles, and judging by the trailer, it looks like the characters can also swing into action or sneak around enemies in a manner that looks heavily inspired by Insomniac's recent Spider-Man games.</p><p>When it comes to combat, Naked Science added that you can use your surroundings to defeat enemies, and between patrols, you'll also be able to take a break with various activities ranging from pub crawls to pumping some iron in a local gym. Ananta is in development for PC, PS5, and iOS, but it doesn't have a release date yet.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is pulling the metaphorical season plug on its soapy shooter Foamstars next month, less than a year after its release.</p>
<p>In a blog post, the company announced its next season - known somewhat ironically as Party Goes On - will be its last, though it will remain online and isn't shutting down completely.</p>
<p>Foamstars' Party Goes On season will kick off on 13th December, and run until 17th January. After that, season updates for Foamstars will come to an end, and no new content will be added to the game.</p>

<p>"In this concluding update, expansions will be introduced to enhance gameplay, such as the ability to customise shots of each character, and new enhancement elements, such as Prism Gems, all aimed at ensuring players can continue to enjoy the game for the foreseeable future," Square Enix wrote.</p><p>Foamstars' previous season passes will be made available once again, for those players who may have missed them previously. Square Enix noted there will be the option for players to switch between passes and choose the season pass track of their choice. "This will make it possible for players to obtain all the items from each season," it explained.</p>
<p>Those who want to go for the Premium Pass will need to pay, as before. The basic pass is free.</p>

<p>In a letter from producer <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/foamstars-letter-producer-5-dec-2024">Kosuke Okatani</a>, the developer thanked those who have played and will continue to play Foamstars.</p>
<p>"I don't want this to sound like a final message since you will be able to continue playing the game. However I wanted to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to you all once again, so I've taken up my pen to write this producer's letter," Okatani wrote.</p>
<p>"Since the game's release on February 6, 2024, the development team has been working tirelessly to add new content and features, striving to bring the game as close as possible to that goal.</p>
<p>"Throughout both the development and operational phases, we have faced many challenges. However, the support of all of you who play the game, along with the incredible fan art, has been a constant source of encouragement for the team. It's because of this support that we've been able to overcome these difficulties, always with the goal of responding to your feedback.</p>
<p>"If Foamstars has become a game that you can enjoy with others, then we couldn't be happier."</p>

<p>Foamstars initially started life as a paid for release, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-a-like-foamstars-is-going-free-to-play-in-october-eight-months-after-release">becoming free-to-play a few short months ago</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer contributor Kaan Serin called Foamstars a "serviceable paintballer... lathered with some wild lore and underwhelming hero shooter elements" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/foamstars-review">review</a>, asking: "What does it say about this shooter if the... character details are more entertaining than the 10-minute shooting galleries that precede them?"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA Game Ready version 566.36 driver is now available for download, introducing support for this month's biggest games, such as Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>
<p>Besides featuring optimizations for the highly anticipated game developed by MachineGames, which launches in a few hours for owners of either the Premium Edition or the Collector's Edition, the new Game Ready driver brings support for Delta Force, Marvel Rivals, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-path-of-exile-2-to-the-list-premium-monthly-subscription-is-50-off-until-december-30/">Path of Exile 2</a>, as well as support for the next Forza Motorsport update, which introduces ray-traced global illumination, and for the next Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 update which brings NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation support.</p>
<p>Speaking about NVIDIA DLSS 3, both Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Marvel Rivals will release with support for NVIDIA's tech which boosts performance considerably at all resolutions and on all RTX 4000 series GPU. In MachineGames' title, at 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS 3 can double performance on an RTX 4090 at 4K resolution, Supreme preset, and ray tracing. In Marvel Rivals, using NVIDIA DLSS 3 can boost performance by 2.8 times on average at 4K resolution on an RTX 4080.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-foamstars-season-last</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-foamstars-season-will-be-its-last-square-enix-says.1052598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-foamstars-season-last<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced that the next&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>season, which is due to begin next week, will be the game's last, although you'll still be able to play online if you want to.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/documents/notice-regarding-foamstars-season-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post on its website</a>, Square Enix says the "Party Goes On!" season for&nbsp;<em>Foamstars</em>, which starts on December 13th and runs until January 17th, will be the last season, and that "season updates for&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>will be coming to an end" after this period.</p>

<p>Following the end of&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>seasons, "expansions will be introduced to enhance gameplay", Square Enix says, including customizing shots for characters and "new enhancement elements".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/foamstars-season-last-pink-foam.jpg?itok=tHAZsSaR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/foamstars-season-last-pink-foam.jpg?itok=dFfxNseu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any more new seasons after next week's.</figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix goes on to say that the&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>servers will remain active, as will "all online services" for the game, so it's not being taken offline; it just won't be receiving any more characters or maps, it seems.</p>

<p>Additionally, the&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>Cup, a "series of in-game events named after each character", will be held following the next season's conclusion, and all of the game's previous Season Passes will be made available again to give you a chance to get anything you might have missed the first time around.</p>

<p>The decision to end seasons for&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>probably shouldn't come as a surprise. When the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/foamstars-release-date" rel="nofollow">was released</a>, a PlayStation Plus subscription was required to play it, and it was a premium product to boot.</p>

<p>However, in October, the PS Plus requirement was dropped and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/foamstars-free-to-play-october" rel="nofollow">the game went free-to-play</a>, perhaps indicating that Square Enix wasn't attracting the kind of player numbers it would have liked for&nbsp;<em>Foamstars</em>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Foamstars</em>, it's a multiplayer party arena shooter that's essentially Square Enix's attempt to wrest the family-friendly multiplayer crown from Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em>.</p>

<p>The game sees teams of players competing against one another across a series of gameplay modes. Rather than ink, characters can shoot foam from their guns, and the foam can help your team or hinder your opponents depending on where you fire it.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/foamstars/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on PlayStation</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/foamstars-review-partys-over" rel="nofollow">read my review here</a> to find out what I thought of this&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>competitor.</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The staff and contributors that make up Remap play all sorts of video games, and you hear us talk about most of them on weekly episodes of Remap Radio. But even with nearly three hours of banter, some games don’t make the cut, or simply do not fit into the flow of conversation. We also don’t do a lot of “reviews” here at Remap, so we needed to find something that fit in-between.</em></p><p><em>Every month, Remap Recommends gives us a chance for each of us to sit back and reflect on a game that’s continued to sit with us, to the point that we want to tell you, in writing, why it’s interesting.</em></p><p><em>These aren’t traditional reviews. They’re not long essays. This is “Hey, check this out. I liked it.”</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommendsarco">Patrick Recommends...<em>Arco</em></h3><figure></figure><p><strong>Platform: </strong>PC, Mac, Switch<br><strong>Genre: </strong>Delightfully violent anti-colonial, anti-capitalist fantasy tactics RPG<br><strong>Finally Finished:</strong> Months after I started, but over the recent holiday<br><strong>What If I'm Bad at These Games? </strong>You're good. I'm bad at them, too</p><p>The video game industry has never felt more tumultuous, and yet, if you had no understanding of the business of making video games, you would simply sit in awe at the sheer number of incredible video games released seemingly every day. I <em>understand</em> the business of making video games (or, at least, I try), and I'm <em>also</em> in awe at the sheer number of incredible video games released seemingly every day.</p><p>One of my goals towards the end of 2024 has been to drill down on a handful of independent games. Over the recent holiday, I spent significant time with some impressive and interesting games, like <em>1000xResist</em> and <em>Arctic Egg</em>s. But the game that I want to tell you about, the one that's lingered in my mind, is still <em>Arco</em>.</p><p>It's a game that caught my eye when it was released in late August, and I have been slowly plucking my way through it. I have an (in)arguably unhealthy obsession with finishing games, one I'm trying to kick, but <em>Arco</em> is a game where I felt <em>guilty</em> for not seeing it through, because I've loved it's demanding. push-and-pull combat system, which rewards players for aggression, rather than cowering in the shadows. I love its strange world, which pulls from ingrained "western" iconography, but pushes back on our celebration of such images. And that's before you start talking about the interesting supernatural elements on its fringes.</p><p>I get why so many folks haven't given <em>Arco</em> the time of day. Another tactics game in a sea of tactics game, where near every niche is catered? Oh, and it has <em>pixel</em> art? </p><p>(Honestly, these days, I feel like pixel art might be a turnoff for some people.)</p><p>But <em>Arco</em> is good—very good. It's thoughtful and smart and violent and considerate and does not waste your time. There's a lot of video games released in 2024 that feel like they'll be the subject of a long YouTube essay in a few years, and I suspect Arco will be among them. So in the meantime, why wait for that YouTube essay?</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-diplomacy-is-not-an-option">Rob Recommends...<em> Diplomacy Is Not an Option</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>The cutscenes go on too long but do have some funny beats.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Platform: </strong>PC<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Base-building survival RTS</p><div><p>Light-weight survival strategy is one of my favorite genres. The rhythm of "explore map, prepare defenses, fend off hordes, repeat" is one of the surest ways to <a href="https://remapradio.com/articles/they-are-billions-burning-hundreds-hours/" rel="noreferrer">keep me glued to my monitor</a>, and <em>Diplomacy Is Not an Option </em>delivers pretty much exactly what you want and expect from a game like this.</p><p>The game gives you the option of being a decadent noble fending off rebelling peasants while building ever more elaborate cities and defenses, with some familiar elements from <em>They Are Billions </em>like making it imperative that you send your army out to clear the map to prevent the recurring waves from growing too powerful when they arrive. The tension between expanding your base and bringing new resource patches behind your walls versus upgrading your existing forces and keeping your defensive lines smaller and stronger is familiar, but it's done well here and the powerful magic spells you can cast bring some real novelty to the action. Special shoutout goes to a lightning attack that follows your mouse cursor, which carves and incredible swath through enemy hordes.</p></div><hr><h3 id="cado-recommends-an-old-favorite">Cado Recommends... An Old Favorite</h3><figure></figure><p>I don’t know about you but I've had a hell of a month. November hit me like a ton of bricks on both the personal and external scale. </p><p>Between putting on Save Point, the added anxiety of the election, a rapidly shifting political climate that meant I could no longer put off coming out to my family, and my grandfather passing at the end of the month, it all left me very little time to check out new releases. But it also left a need for some comfort in the small moments that I did find myself with free time. </p><p>For me, this specific mix of circumstances meant I played about 15 hours of <em>Slay the Spire</em> in 10-15 minute chunks throughout the month of November in order to keep myself sane.</p><p>I have dipped in and out of the game many times before and enjoyed it but never really drilled down and did any ascensions, the game’s escalating challenge modifiers, because I never thought I was  good enough at the game to warrant the extra challenge, despite having unlocked the first ascension ages ago. The last time I played the game in any real concerted way about a year ago, I still had a few cards to unlock, so I just did normal runs until I finished out my collection for my favorite class, the Silent. Once I’d done that, it really felt like I’d “beaten” the game, and didn’t see myself coming back to it anytime soon. Alexander wept.</p><p>As this past month got more and more hectic, however, I found myself grasping for something that could sooth my soul, so I booted up <em>Slay the Spire</em>. In an attempt to wrestle control back from the world, I set myself a new goal: lock in and climb the ascension ladder. Turns out that the steady, incremental addition of new challenges each ascension offers was exactly what I needed to properly return to <em>Slay the Spire</em>. A perfect mix of the familiar and the challenging, a warm blanket of gaming fresh out of the dryer during a particularly nasty cold front in my life.&nbsp;</p><p>My recommendation to you is: give yourself space to return. As a culture, we can favor newness to a fault, but sometimes the best thing we can do for ourselves is to be retrospective. You can’t always move forward without taking stock of what you’ve left behind, so make sure to give yourself the space to do so when you need it. You never know when something old can still surprise you.</p>

<p>NZXT has released a lengthy response to claims that its Flex gaming PC subscription <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nzxt-scam-allegations-gamers-nexus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">service is a scam</a>. After an hour-long video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamers Nexus</a> dove into what it called a “predatory computer scam” from NZXT, the company not only posted a video with statements from its CEO Johnny Hou, but also listed out some of the actions they state will be taken.</p>



<p>“NZXT takes feedback seriously and, ultimately, wouldn’t be here if we didn’t listen to our community,” he said. “A lot of the issues are very serious, and it’s really important to us that we address each and every one of them.”</p>



<p>Regarding price increases after a subscription is started, Hou said that the “only instance” it’s happened is when they were required by certain states to start charging state taxes. </p>



<p>Hou then went on to talk about claims and “misconceptions” around changes to the hardware specs.</p>



<p>“You have to first understand that the Flex program doesn’t give you fixed specs,” he said. “We it comes to the availability of PC parts, it’s hard for us to control when Nvidia or Intel or AMD decide they’re going to need all the parts, so sometimes we don’t have more supply coming in. So, in the midst of that, we actually have to change the specs of our PCs.”</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>He then reaffirmed that you have to be at least 18 years old to sign up for the service. However, he didn’t address the claims that orders were being pushed through without proper identity verification. </p>



<p>As far as actions go, NZXT says that it will be pulling all “influencer-led” Flex advertising after statements were made within the adds that the company found to “not accurately reflect the details” of the program. They will also be updating the names of products offered through the Flex service in order to provide “a very clear distinction” between what is being bought versus what is part of the subscription.</p>



<p>After those two actions were announced, the <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/nzxt-update-addressing-your-concerns-about-the-flex-subscription-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company listed details</a> about what the Flex subscription program is and is not. You can read that via the company’s website.</p>



<h2 id="h-gamers-nexus-response">Gamers Nexus’ Response</h2>



<p>Not long after the response from NZXT, Gamers Nexus — the original source of the uncovering — made its own statement on what NZXT said. </p>



<p>“NZXT has posted a statement which not only misrepresents facts, but distorts the reality of their predatory rental computer program,” Gamers Nexus Editor-in-Chief Stephen Burke wrote. “The statement ignores major points and introduces several new concerns. GamersNexus has become aware of deeper elements connected to this story that GN has begun independently investigating.”</p>

<p>Delta Force, a highly-anticipated shooter reminiscent of Battlefield is out <strong>today</strong>. It was pieced together by Team Jade, a branch of TiMi Studio Group, the company that built the most popular COD game of all time – Call of Duty Mobile. For now, it’s a multiplayer-only offering, but Team Jade has confirmed when the game’s single-player campaign will be released.</p>



<p>There isn’t all that long to wait – the single-player portion of Delta Force will be available in January 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-black-hawk-down">Black Hawk Down</h2>



<p>Delta Force, which started life <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-name-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Delta Force: Hawk Ops</a> before the name came under scrutiny, is available today in open beta on PC.</p>



<p>In earlier testing periods, Delta Force presented an enjoyable and authentic large-scale combat experience that felt diverse and satisfying. Many have dubbed it ‘the better version of Battlefield 2042’, and it has plenty to offer users as it transitions into this open beta period.</p>



<p>Most players will be diving into the ‘Warfare’ mode, a 32 v 32 PvP mode bursting at the seams with military might. Users will be invited to explore land and air vehicles and go boots-on-the-ground with a dense arsenal of weapons across a series of maps.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, there is the ‘Operations’ portion of the game. This is a cooperative mode that pits three players against AI-controlled enemies as they explore developing objectives across a variety of environments.</p>



<p>Team Jade confirmed that in January, the game’s <strong>single-player </strong>component, a story based on the real-world events of ‘Black Hawk Down’, will be released on all platforms. That’ll arrive shortly after the game, which is designed to be crossplay across multiple platforms, is released on the iOS Store and Google Play, opening up two new, huge markets.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the ‘Black Hawk Down’ portion of Delta Force? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Don't worry, though, as Solos, Squads, and Zero Build will be available at launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The loot pool will include much of what was found at the beginning of Fortnite, including Assault Rifle, Burst Assault Rifle, Scoped Assault Rifle, Pump Shotgun, Tactical Shotgun, Pistol, Revolver, Submachine Gun, Tactical Machine Gun, Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle, Semi-Auto Sniper Rifle, Grenade Launcher, Rocket Launcher, Damage Trap, Ceiling Zapper, Wall Dynamo</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Fortnite OG is taking players back in time, there will be some Quality of Life changes put in place to make for a better overall experience, and you can check them all out below from The Fortnite Team;</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Building mechanics will be uniform with Battle Royale as it is today.</li><li>As far as traversal goes, players will be able to sprint, slide, mantle, door bash, and move while healing. </li><li>Some of the rough edges from that era have been preserved, while others have been polished. For example, players will find Reboot Vans and be able to see the glare from a sniper scope, but Max building resources are set to 999 and Double Pump is enabled for Shotguns (for now). </li><li>Of course, the original map that Fortnite Battle Royale launched with in 2017 is back! Great care has been taken to ensure that every tree, Chest, car, and object is right where players remember it. In Zero Build, there will be Ziplines and Ascenders to help players get to hard-to-reach locations.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Players will also be able to purchase the Fortnite OG Pass and work their way to earning 45 tiers of "retro rewards with a modern twist on classic items and Outfits." Speaking of Outfits, Renegade Rebel, Aerial Assault Bomber, and Skull Commander are the ones players will work towards in Season 1, and each will have an unlockable alt style as well. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fortnite OG Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's important to note that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-just-raised-its-battle-pass-price-for-the-first-time-ever">Epic Games did just raise its Battle Pass price for the first time ever</a> ahead of Fortnite OG, so we wanted to make sure everyone was aware of that ahead of this upcoming launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite OG first launched back in November 2023 and the reception was overwhelmingly positive.

This is a triumphant sequel that doesn’t just reimagine the soulslike genre as a co-op looter-shooter, but absolutely nails that concept in nearly every way – including many that the original did not. With completely engrossing combat, challenging and memorable boss fights, ultra-dense buildcrafting options, incredibly cool procedurally generated levels, and a clever multiversal concept that allows for a ton of different adventures in one package, it’s very likely going to become one of my most-played games this year. No matter which part of the multiverse you find yourself in, you should do yourself a favor and play this gem."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ananta-project-mugen-gameplay-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Naked Rain and publisher NetEase have revealed a brand new gameplay trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ananta</em>, the open-world anime action RPG formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Project Mugen</em>.</p>

<p>The name change was <a href="https://x.com/Ananta_EN/status/1862316133988409359" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">put into effect in late November</a>, and at that point, NetEase and Naked Rain teased a new gameplay trailer for the game, which has now arrived. It looks exactly as you'd expect; essentially like a cross between the likes of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>and a strange anime-inflected&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto</em>.</p>

<p>The trailer shows off&nbsp;<em>Ananta</em>'s central hub of Nova City, which is where you'll be spending most of your time, whether you're taking on one of the game's missions or engaging in its many minigames and distractions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ananta-project-mugen-gameplay-trailer-beach.jpg?itok=USXTSxJh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ananta-project-mugen-gameplay-trailer-beach.jpg?itok=zznkKgiB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ananta</em>, formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Project Mugen</em>, has a brand new gameplay trailer for you to check out.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer is positioning&nbsp;<em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>as a sort of everything-RPG; not only can you take on exciting, high-octane combat missions in the game, but you can also kick back and relax by driving through the city, playing volleyball, or just grabbing a bite to eat.</p>

<p>In a press release, NetEase and Naked Rain describe <i>Ananta</i>'s world as a place "where the unexpected is the norm and having fun is the ultimate goal".</p>

<p>While you'll be spending most of your time in Nova City, the two studios say you'll also be able to visit other "interconnected cities" to take on challenges, and they're also promising "kung fu movie"-style combat in which you can utilize your surroundings to defeat your enemies.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p><em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>will be a free-to-play RPG, but NetEase and Naked Rain haven't revealed what kind of monetization the game will employ. It does rather resemble a HoYoverse-style gacha game, but we'll likely learn whether that's the case in the coming months.</p>

<p>We still don't know when&nbsp;<em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>will be released, but when it is, it'll land on PC, PS5, and mobile devices. You can check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/project-mugen-interview" rel="nofollow">interview with the game's producer here</a>.</p>

            <p>Developed by Mistwalker, a studio founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-game">Final Fantasy</a> dad Hironobu Sakaguchi, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasian">Fantasian</a> was originally released on Apple Arcade in 2021 and locked within the big fruit's exclusivity cage. Now, though, Mistwalker and Square Enix have come together to re-release the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> for us PC heads, calling it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasian-neo-dimension">Fantasian Neo Dimension</a>. It's actually out today, too, if you're interested in an interdimensional journey to reclaim some lost memories.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension has you play as Leo, who awakens in a strange land filled with machines and zero recollection of how and why and who. Soon he discovers that the machines are suffering from a virus called "Mechteria" that's really not a good thing for humans or robots alike. And so, it's up to you and your pals to engage in turn-based fights and free the world from the virus.</p>

<p>Fantasian's neat spin on turn-based battling lies in how you're able to target multiple enemies, whether that's in a straight line, or in an arc, or in large AoE blasts. You're also able to 'collect' random encounters as you're exploring out in the world, so you can fight them all at once for a large cash-in when it suits you - an excellent time-saver.</p>
<p>And on the world front, it's rather nice eh? It blends handmade dioramas with CG, which gives exploration quite the striking aesthetic.</p>
<p>If you're a longtime fan who knows all this stuff and wants the lowdown on the new features, I've got you. There's new Japanese and English voice overs, new difficulty options, 4K resolution, and the option to switch the battle music from the original soundtrack to songs from across the Final Fantasy series.</p>
<p>You can find the game over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2844850/FANTASIAN_Neo_Dimension/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
