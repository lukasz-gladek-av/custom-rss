            <p>Praise the gods, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> update day, and developers Supergiant are not mucking about. They have bolstered the nippy roguelike with a heap of shiny new things in this "Olympian Update", including a new weapon with homing attacks, a liver-pecking boss fight, two new animal familiars, and the home region of the Gods - mount Olympus. It's probably the biggest update they've made yet in terms of fresh sights. And by "fresh sights", I mean Dionysus sporting a leopard-print thong. Yikes.</p>

<p>Chief among the changes is the new region, Olympus, which looks suitably full of marble statues and ionic columns, if suspiciously gloomy. The new weapon is called the Black Coat, which can launch a bunch of missile-like orbs at enemies or be used to perform damage-blocking counterattacks. Your two new animal familiars will be Raki the raven and Hecuba the hound, who can dig holes for you in place of the usual shovel, it seems. Yes, you can pet the dog. Don't make Frinos the frog jealous, now.</p>
<p>If you're wondering how much this update advances the story, we're told that there are now 2500 new voice lines,  plus "expanded subplots" for certain characters like Arachne the spider gal and Dora the friendly ghost. But the big new development in this regard is probably the appearance of Prometheus, the Titan that made humans from clay and then stole fire from the gods to give to humanity. You'll be fighting him as a boss, and likely learning a bit about his motivations. The eagle who chows on his liver every day also seeks extra protein from your face.</p><p>Like I say, it's an absolutely stacked update. You'll be able to decorate your hub at the Crossroads. Many hexes and keepsakes have been tweaked. There's new portrait art for Charon, Medea, and Hades, among others. And while Olympus is the big new hot spot, existing regions also have some new locales, we're told. I'm not even going to try to summarise the many, many changes to boons and blessings. Just know that there are some new boons, while others have been altered, and a few have been removed. </p>
<p>All the highlights are mentioned in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/7057794870232159705">this Steam post</a> but you can get into the nitty gritty of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/7057794870234137716">the full patch notes</a> if you like. Supergiant has even recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQtih_yy6IA">a 26-minute long "dramatic reading"</a> of the changes, featuring Logan Cunningham, voice actor of Homer and vocal calling card of the studio. This sounds like the most niche bedtime listening.</p>
<p>I found the fast pace and quippy conversatin' of Hades 2 a lot of fun in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">early access review</a>. But I haven't been back to it much. Maybe this update will convince me to go check on my favourite rival, Nemesis. According to these patch notes, "she is less quick about gruffly running through exits; she is less quick to purchase items from Charon." Aw, I always <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2s-best-girl-is-nemesis-because-she-messes-up-your-run">liked that about her</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shawn Layden has discussed the state of the games industry, stating there's a "collapse of creativity" and that relying on blockbusters is "a death sentence".</p>
<p>Layden took to the stage at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Asia alongside Raw Fury co-founder and chief publishing officer Gordon Van Dyke (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shawn-layden-aa-is-gone-and-thats-a-threat-to-the-ecosystem-going-forward">GI.Biz</a>), where the pair discussed the disappearance of AA studios.</p>
<p>In the past, said Layden, studios focused simply on whether a game was fun rather than monetisation schemes, though admitted "risk tolerance was fairly high".</p>

<figcaption>Nintendo has announced new hardware, but it's not Switch 2 - so what's the point of Alarmo?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNKD3U-4AY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Today, the entry costs for making a AAA game is in triple digit millions now," he continued. "I think naturally, risk tolerance drops. And you're [looking] at sequels, you're looking at copycats, because the finance guys who draw the line say, 'Well, if <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> made this much money in this amount of time, my Fortnite knockoff can make this in that amount of time.' We're seeing a collapse of creativity in games today [with] studio consolidation and the high cost of production."</p>
<p>Further, Layden stated "AA is gone", which he described as "a threat to the ecosystem".</p>
<p>Noting the general standard of games, including indie titles, is much higher thanks to advancements in tools, he continued: "Now if we can just get a bit more interest and excitement and exposure for these lower budget, but super creative and super unusual [type] of games... I'd like to see more of that. Because if we're just going to rely on the blockbusters to get us through, I think that's a death sentence."</p>
<p>AA games can bring "the new thing" and can be developed far quicker than AAA games, said Layden. Most importantly, though, they must seek unique ideas not monetisation.</p>
<p>"If you're going to pitch me your AA game, and in the first two pages of your deck is your monetisation and revenue, subscription scheme, I'm out. Your first page has to be 'This game needs to be made and here's why'," he said.</p>
<p>"I want to see that fire, I don't want to see 'here's the chief accountant on the team that's going to explain to you the [game's monetisation]'."</p>
<p>Layden also commented on current trends around <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">AI in game development</a>, stating it's "not a saviour".</p>
<p>"Artificial intelligence has been in gaming since almost the first or second games ever made," he said. "So all this excitement about gen AI, I find kind of humorous. I do see its applications in certain places for certain things. But it's just a tool, it's not a saviour. It's a tool in the way that Excel is a tool. It just helps speed you along your tasks."</p>
<p>Layden began working for Sony in 1987, eventually serving as chairman of SIE Worldwide Studios from 2014 - 2019. He's worked as a strategic advisor at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> since September 2022.</p>
<p>His comments are perhaps best reflected in games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, a unique and creative concept that was certainly a risk for Tango Gameworks.</p>
<p>That studio was closed by Microsoft, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">subsequently acquired by Krafton</a>. And Krafton boss Changhan 'CH' Kim has made comments that parallel those of Layden - specifically the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks-to-maintain-its-legacy-rather-than-cash-in">studio acquisition was motivated by the desire to maintain its legacy rather than make money</a>.</p>
<p>"We wanted to maintain their legacy," said Kim. "Although they did not have a big success in their games, we saw many creatives worth pursuing. That's why we wanted to work with that organisation."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Leadership at Don’t Nod yesterday “presented a reorganisation project to the employee representative bodies,” via <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-88278">financials report</a>, in response to "a balance sheet that highlights the need to secure the company's resources" following the underperformance of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jusant">Jusant</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden">Banishers: Ghosts of new Eden</a>.</p>
<p>In plain terms, this means that up to 69 workers at the French company are at risk of layoffs due to an 11% year-on-year decline in operating revenue, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-nod-announces-layoffs-that-could-impact-up-to-69-workers">via IGN</a>. The number represents "29% of the Paris studio workforce", say the STJV.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Our half-year results for 2024 reflect the economic underperformance of our latest release, despite solid ratings on Metacritic, as well as the accounting impact of the decisions we had to take," said Don’t Nod’s CEO and Chairman Oskar Guilbert. "The initial performance support measures announced last spring no longer seem sufficient to maintain the company's competitiveness.</p>
<p>"As a result," the statement continued, "today we presented a reorganisation project to the employee representative bodies, which could set DON'T NOD on a new development trajectory. I am fully conscious of the impact this project may have on all our employees. Securing our company's resources and restoring its ability to perform more in an increasingly competitive and selective industry is extremely necessary."</p>
<p>In late September, Don’t Nod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-nod-pause-two-game-projects-and-refocus-others-following-jusant-and-banishers-sales-disappointment">announced that they’d paused development</a> on two upcoming projects, and that development on others had been "refocused to reach a wider audience", again citing the underperformance of Jusant and Banishers.</p>
<p>Back in early September, French Video Game Workers Union (STJV) put out a press release titled <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/02/dont-nod-ascension-or-free-fall/">"DON’T NOD: Ascension or free fall?"</a>. "We’re sounding the alarm on the situation of Don’t Nod employees," they wrote, alleging "erratic" and "tumultuous" project management and citing concern over "the psychosocial hazards Don’t Nod’s workers are facing, in view of the significant number of reports of ill-being and sick leaves." The press release also describes a situation in which "Jusant’s developers were left in the dark about their future, many without any work to do, for over 2 months" following that game’s release.</p>
<p>Coinciding with Don’t Nod’s financial report yesterday, the STJV put out <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/10/at-dont-nod-the-only-plans-for-the-future-are-layoffs/">another statement </a>entitled "At Don’t Nod, the only plans for the future are layoffs", calling the layoff plans "the climax of a series of catastrophic decisions".</p>
<p>"Today’s meeting, after 2 weeks of waiting in anguish, was revealed as the starting point of a layoff plan," write the STJV. "Workers’ representatives were not told in advance about the meeting’s topic, and were not provided with any documents and information before the it, which goes against the law."</p><p>"The Don’t Nod union section, as well the whole of the STJV, cannot tolerate the company rejecting the responsibilities of its own failures on its workers," they continue. "We warned them long ago, but they ignored us and accused us of being too aggressive to speak with. With this layoffs plan, they are creating an atmosphere of extreme violece [sic]. We are calling on all workers at Don’t Nod to mobilise to save their jobs and working conditions".</p>
<p>Alice Bell (RPS in peace) awarded both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">Banishers: Ghosts of new Eden</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jusant-review">Jusant</a> a Bestest Best, and Jusant was a personal favourite of mine from last year. Best of luck to the workers who helped make such wonderful games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I punched a cultist in the face in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/streets-of-rogue-2">Streets Of Rogue 2</a>, just because. He started running away - something I would not allow. When another robed cultist spotted what was happening, he tried to intervene, and a kind of Benny Hill pursuit chain began. We ran across a beach, through public toilets, and into the surf. In the end I had to knock them both out. As they lay unconscious, I worried they might soon wake and tell someone what I had done. This can't happen, I hate accountability. I punched their unawake bodies toward the sea in an effort to float the evidence away. But after a few punches the first man exploded into chunks of flesh. I am a murderer now. I was supposed to be a chef.</p>
<p>Streets Of Rogue 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165810/Streets_of_Rogue_2/">has a demo</a> out for Steam Next Fest, and while a lot of features are locked up behind the word "UNAVAILABLE" in red font, there's still quite a lot of mischief for you to get up to.</p>

<p>If you missed the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/streets-of-rogue">Streets Of Rogue</a>, it was a small but mighty indie immersive sim of sorts, with random roguelike elements thrown in to create a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/streets-of-rogue-review">funny, chaotic sandbox of silliness</a>. You're supposed to be climbing floor after floor in an effort to find and dethrone the city mayor. But more often you end up freeing a troop of gorillas and watching as they run amok, or hacking all the ATMs while a co-op friend injects themselves with a syringe of gigantism. </p><p>The sequel is following suit, with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/streets-of-rogue-2-goes-open-world-and-you-can-drive-a-truck-through-a-barn">load of extra stuff thrown in</a>. Even something as simple as gathering chicken to craft a sandwich can take a comic turn for the worse. At first, I figured I'd simply buy some chicken fillets in the shop. But the only store in town was closed. What does that matter? I smashed the window and cut myself on broken glass clambering inside, only to find neither chicken in the freezer nor money in the cash register. </p>
<p>I washed my face in the staff bathroom, again because I can. This normally removes status effects. But my status was merely chickenless. I had to leave town and source my meat from the wilderness on the outskirts, where a gang of live chickens were frolicking happily in a pond. "I'll just kill a hen and watch the others run away in terror," I thought, getting out my trusty chef's pocket knife. But as soon as I stuck one chicken, four others immediately turned on me, pecking my poor body to pieces. </p>
<p>I barely managed to fend them off. And I had to go back to the shop to buy bread from the shopkeeper anyway, who had finally opened for business. I eyed the broken glass innocently. Shopkeepers in Streets Of Rogue 2 carry shotguns, just like the cranky hawkers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spelunky-2">Spelunky 2</a>. </p>
<p>There's a lot missing, this being a demo. But it does grant you a sneak peek at the possibilities. I created a vanilla world during the world generation process. But an encouraging amount of world modifiers are teased in the menu. You'll be able to make every animal invincible, it seems, or adjust a "cop leniency" meter. One modifier turns the game into "Water World", another reads "Zombies Ate My Game Balance", which suggests a means of transforming the game into a zombie apocalypse playground. </p><p>As for personal stats and quirks, these can include being computer illiterate, or being addicted to all drugs. You may need to kill at least once per day, or be unable to speak to people at all. One quirk makes you small enough to flush yourself down a toilet, like the shapeshifter of the previous game. Probably handy in a bind.</p>
<p>As part of the tutorial, I was sent to kill the mayor in a larger neighbouring town, which I did. But only after driving a car at questionable speeds and hitting many pedestrians along the way. The cars (a new addition) handle very nicely, drifting and sliding along with the smooth sensation of an old-school Grand Theft Auto. I parked neatly in the carpark of city hall, denting perhaps only five other vehicles, and got to work sneaking around inside the building, knife at the ready. I was discovered by goons and office workers multiple times. It was perhaps inadvisable to plant so many landmines in the hallways. Many people died. </p>

<p>Including the mayor himself. You're meant to be able to wear the mayor's hat after killing him, and give a speech at the podium to inherit his municipal throne. But at this point the tutorial bugged out and wouldn't detect that I wore the headwear. That's fine, demos gonna demo. It was nice just to kill the head honcho for once. I don't think I ever made it to the mayor in the first game, yet here I have smeared his internal organs all over his dining room in just over an hour. A satisfying result by itself. What? Why are you looking at me like that? It's not like there's going to be a "pacifist" mode in this ga-- oh, there is.</p><p>At this point I could wander out and explore the city streets, take some career quests as a chef, or restart things as a (probably much shootier) soldier or cop. But my "let this simmer" sense is tingling. I was already willing to trust this sequel on the playful strengths of its predecessor (it's one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">best roguelikes</a>). But seeing firsthand that much of the wackiness and freedom of the original Streets Of Rogue remains intact is doubly reassuring. You can play the demo yourself on Steam, should you too wish to bash a bodyguard through the wall and inject yourself with a bunch of syringes marked: "???"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak has discussed the upcoming Project 007 game again. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In an interview with IGN</a>, he openly said the goal is to make it a gaming franchise rather than a one-off project.</p>
<p><em>What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story. So, it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from the ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with.</em></p>
<p><em>I don't want to speak too big about it, but I just hope we'll do a thing that will define James Bond in gaming for years to come. And that is not only one game, but that we create a universe for gamers to own for many years to come that we can grow with that next to the Bond on the movies.</em></p>
<p>Abrak also provided an update on development, saying that production at IO Interactive is going 'amazingly well.' That doesn't tell us when we can expect to learn more, but it's been nearly four years since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-007-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project 007 announcement</a>, and it might not be much longer until we get a proper trailer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, IO Interactive has just signed an agreement with Build a Rocket Boy to publish <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-everywhere-gta-producer-leslie-benzies-teaser-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MindsEye</a>, the triple-A single player story-driven action/adventure game created with Everywhere's engine. Abrak said:</p>
<p><em>We are honored to be the global publishing partner working with Build A Rocket Boy’s exceptionally talented team and to bring our community an exciting new IP. IO Interactive and Build A Rocket Boy are like-minded in how we aim to create a bond and a long-term relationship with our communities, which perfectly aligns with our commitment to delivering high-quality, immersive experiences to players worldwide. As our first publishing partnership, this marks a significant milestone for IO Interactive, and we could not be prouder of this collaboration.</em></p>
<p>Game Director Leslie Benzies, who produced GTA games from III to V at Rockstar, added:</p>
<p><em>From day one, Build A Rocket Boy Studios has been focused on creating the next generation of compelling gaming and quality entertainment experiences. We can’t wait to share our first AAA premium game and ever-evolving universe, MindsEye, with the world. There is no finer partner than IO Interactive to publish our first title, with their strong understanding of community culture, premium action-adventure games, and a best-in-class publishing team, we really look forward to partnering with them on our new blockbuster journey.</em></p>
<p>In MindsEye, players will become Jacob Diaz, a former soldier with a mysterious neural implant who suffers from memory loss and flashbacks. They will embark on a series of dangerous covert missions to unravel the secrets of Jacob's past in a world filled with the constant threat of artificial intelligence, high-tech experimentation, corporate espionage, political corruption, and an unchecked military. According to the developer, they can expect complex narrative, rich environments, groundbreaking combat, futuristic technology, and high-speed chases. There's no release date yet, but you can add it to your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> wishlist.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, KONAMI proudly announced that the Silent Hill 2 remake has sold over a million units globally across PC and PlayStation 5 as of October 11, according to the publisher's internal tracking. That's pretty impressive, given that the game only launched on October 8. It's another indicator of the game's great reception from critics and users alike. On Steam, the Silent Hill 2 remake didn't reach a massive peak, stopping at 23.6K concurrent users. However, user reviews are extremely positive, with 92.5% of the players leaving a favorable review. That's similar to the assessment provided by Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review</a>, where he scored the game 9 out of 10.</p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-pc-is-yet-another-unreal-engine-case-of-stutter-struggle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">does have some technical shortcomings on PC</a>, mainly traversal stuttering, as in most recent Unreal Engine games. However, several mods attempt to improve the situation by adding certain lacking features, such as<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-fsr-3-frame-generation-nvidia-dlss-ray-reconstruction-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> AMD Frame Generation and NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction</a>. Another mod aims to enhance overall performance while minimizing the visual downgrade. Still, the only real fixes for the PC version's stuttering can come from Bloober Team via patches.</p>
<p>By the way, the Polish team has heavily <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-can-expect-this-isnt-end-of-adventure-with-konami-bloober-team-silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> that the Silent Hill 2 remake won't be the end of their collaboration with KONAMI. Franchise fans are already wondering which of the other installments should be remade first. In any case, it will inevitably take several years; it's best to enjoy this remake and then move on until there's something concrete to announce.</p>

                <p>Amazon has revealed<i> </i><em>five </em>new Kindles, including its first full-color e-ink tablet. The <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Colorsoft</a></strong> is a brand-new addition to the lineup, and it's a potential game changer for fans of comic books and graphic novels. You can already read digital comics on any Kindle reader, but unless it has black-and-white illustrations, you lose a key component of the story. If the Kindle Colorsoft works well, you will be able to read all of your favorite full-color comics, graphic novels, and manga as intended, with the inherit benefits of an e-ink display. It releases October 30 and is available to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder now for $280</a>.</p><p>The Kindle Colorsoft sounds even more appealing when you consider Amazon's <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/cu/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Comixology Unlimited subscription service</a></strong>. Comixology Unlimited offers over 45,000 comics, graphic novels, and manga for $10 per month (after a free 30-day trial). The catalog includes comics and graphic novels published by Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, Image, and other leaders in the visual storytelling medium. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Unlimited</a></strong> also has graphic novels and manga, but Amazon's $12/month flagship reading subscription service has a much larger focus on novels.</p><p>The Kindle Colorsoft releases <strong>October 30</strong> and is available to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder now for $280</a>. We've rounded up all five of the new Kindles below, including the updated <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Scribe</a></strong> with improved note-taking features, a faster version of the ever-popular <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPJYX7P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Paperwhite</a></strong> in models geared for adults and kids, and an <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNV9F72P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">upgraded entry-level Kindle</a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Quick look: Amazon's All-New Kindles</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Preorder Now</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Colorsoft</a> -- $280 | Releases October 30</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Scribe</a> -- Starting at $400 | Releases December 4</li></ul></li><li><strong>Available Now</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPJYX7P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Paperwhite</a> -- Starting at $160 | Available Now</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPS7ZY9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Paperwhite Kids</a> -- Starting at $180</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPS7ZY9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle</a> -- $110</li></ul></li></ul><div title="[Various] Kindle Colorsoft" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2751" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Kindle Colorsoft" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Kindle Colorsoft</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$280 | Save 20% with Eligible Trade-In | Releases October 30</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Kindle Colorsoft has a 7-inch full-color display that lasts up to eight weeks on a full charge, which is pretty remarkable for a color e-ink tablet. Designed to be used anywhere, the Colorsoft's front light will automatically adjust to your surroundings. The high-contrast screen has built-in anti-glare technology to help create the Kindle's signature paper-like reading experience, just with a full color palette this time around. While reading, you can highlight passages in color, which sounds like a nice little benefit for those who regularly like to revisit to share their favorite sentences.</p><p>Amazon has labeled the launch-model Colorsoft a "Signature Edition." This may sound a bit confusing since it's the only model available at launch, but Kindle Signature Editions offer a handful of upgrades versus lower-priced models: support for wireless charging, auto-adjusting front light, no ads, and 32GB of storage. Signature Editions also have metallic chassises. The Metallic Black Colorsoft checks all of the Signature Edition boxes.</p><p>Amazon says it's totally safe to read in the bathtub or the pool, as the Colorsoft has an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=18116670011&amp;ref=ods_me_waterproof&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IPX8 water resistance rating</a>. In lab tests, the Colorsoft still functioned after being immersed in 6.5 feet (2 meters) of fresh water for up to 60 minutes. You probably won't want to bring the Kindle with you in ocean, though, as it's only graded for three minutes of immersion at less than 0.8 feet (0.25 meters) of depth.</p><p>As mentioned, the Colorsoft is especially exciting for fans of comic books, graphic novels, and manga. Being able to read your favorite graphic novels in color on a paper-like display could bring those who have wanted to switch to digital but weren't keen on the idea of looking at black-and-white illustrations into the ereader community.</p><p>At $280, the Colorsoft is cheaper than the Scribe but a good bit pricier than the Paperwhite. Amazon is running one of its generous trade-in promotions for existing Amazon device owners that can save you some serious cash. Trade-in values for your old devices vary, but what doesn't change is the 20% discount on the Colorsoft. You'll automatically save $56 plus however much you get for your old device. Click the "Save 20% with Trade-in" banner below the price to instantly see trade-in values for eligible devices. It doesn't even need to be a Kindle. Other devices, including cheap Fire TV Sticks, can get you the 20%-off deal.</p><p>Amazon is also offering a deal on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Amazon-Essentials-Plant-Based-Cover-Black/dp/B0DJ3RRNQX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Colorsoft Essentials Bundle</a>, which comes with a plant-based leather cover and a wireless charging dock/stand for $328. You're saving $35 by purchasing the bundle compared to buying the Colorsoft and both accessories separately. Cases are available to purchase separately, too. Amazon has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Paperwhite-Lightweight-Water-Safe-Protective/dp/B0DGNVSYR5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fabric protective covers</a> in three color options for $37, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Amazon-Plant-Based-Lightweight-Sustainability/dp/B0DGNSVTFK?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leatherette covers</a> are $43. That means you'd spend $317 or $323 for the Colorsoft and one of the cases. The Kindle Colorsoft Essentials Bundle is probably the way to go here, as you'll only spend $5-$11 more to get the charging stand thrown in, too.</p></div>                      </div><p>Color e-ink has become a trend over the past year. Kobo, Amazon's biggest competitor, released its own full-color e-ink reader in April. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kobo-Glare-Free-KaleidoTM-Audiobooks-Waterproof/dp/B0CZXX465Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kobo Libra Colour</a> has a 7-inch full-color display and 32GB of storage for $220. But switching between brands after years of use is tough, as Amazon and Kobo have unique digital storefronts and file formats. You can't read Kindle ebooks on Kobo devices and vice-versa.</p><p>Most of the color e-ink tablets available now are more comparable to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9VFQ2P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Scribe</a> as hybrid readers, note-taking, and productivity devices. For instance, Android e-ink tablet manufacturer Boox has released a few different full-color options, including the 7.8-inch <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Tab-Mini-ePaper/dp/B0CCJCXN25?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Boox Tab Mini C</a> for $400, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Note-Air-ePaper/dp/B0CHF423CP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">10.3-inch Note Air 3 C</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tab-Ultra-Pro-Digital/dp/B0CHM54YZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">10.3-inch Tab Ultra C Pro</a> for productivity for $650.</p><p>And then there's reMarkable, the manufacturer behind the most popular note-taking e-ink tablet not made by Amazon, released its own full-color tablet in September. The $629 <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1856639036910958843%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Famazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-ink-color-ereader-comic-books-new-kindle-models-2024%2F1100-6527202%2F%3Futm_campaign%3Dtrueanthem_1%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dfacebook%26fbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR2QMOAicVXpV8d9V16-KyQPyTChmrEk8XORQTzokCv4ME0NCA211KgCPjQ_aem_aXdvtGRKPB2lp4lueJJu8A&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reMarkable Paper Pro</a> has an 11.8-inch display and is designed to replicate the experience of writing in a notebook.</p><p>Perhaps the next iteration of the Kindle Scribe will join the color e-ink party, too.

<p>Venturing down the road of competitive Fortnite, but not sure exactly how many ranks there are in competitive? The popular game mode is full of some of the best sweats in the game, making it a hefty challenge to move up. Here is a list of all the Fortnite ranks in order from worst to best.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-ranks">Fortnite Ranks</h2>



<p>The ranking system in Fortnite is similar to many other games as it starts with Bronze and then moves up. However, higher up in the ranking system is where the game differs from others.</p>



<p><strong>Here are all the Fortnite ranks in order:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond (I, II, III)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Champion</strong></li>



<li><strong>Unreal</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>After Diamond, each ranking is no longer split up into threes. Elite, Champion and Unreal are all their own ranking.</p>



<h6 id="h-ranked-esports-events-calendar-2024-every-tournament-you-need-to-see">Ranked:<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-events-calendar-2024/"> Esports Events Calendar 2024 | Every Tournament You Need to See</a></h6>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-s-old-system">Fortnite’s Old System</h2>



<p>Did you know that Fortnite used to have a completely different system for Ranked? In fact, it was not even called Ranked, instead, it was titled “Arena.”</p>



<p>Arena first left the game back in 2023, when Ranked officially replaced it. So, what was Arena? Well, the game mode went off of points and not rankings. </p>



<p>There were three different divisions, Open, Contender and Champion. Players who wanted to compete in FNCS had to be in Champion League. Fortnite often played around with how many points players needed to reach Champion League, but it was usually around 6,500. </p>



<p>In some seasons, once you reached a specific division, you would not fall back below that division even if your points dropped below. This ended up changing later on until Fortnite officially released Ranked.</p>



<p>Would you like to see Arena return?</p>

Not just a mystery adventure, this is a heart-warming tale of character growth.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>You are left all alone in the world after losing your last remaining relative, with only the apartment inherited from your late father.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Suddenly, a man appears and gives you—the new landlord—a warning.</p><p>“There are Yokai living among the residents in your apartment building.”</p><p>Your time spent sleuthing out the cleverly disguised Yokai began from that moment.</p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>In this social deduction adventure game, the player uses the information they gather to find the Yokai who have attempted to blend in with the residents of the apartment building they manage.</p><p>But Yokai aren’t so easy to find. You will need to talk with residents, check the security cameras, and use the detailed information in the residents’ directory to gradually uncover the truth.</p><p>However, the Yokai may set traps in order to conceal their existence, causing the residents to become suspicious of one another. Just like in a Werewolf game, every word and action can sow the seeds of doubt.</p><p>As the landlord, it’s your duty to keep your residents safe, calmly gather information, and root out the true Yokai amongst the chaos.</p><p>And while you do, you’ll also unravel the true intentions behind the mysterious man who warned you about the Yokai…</p><p>Not just a mystery adventure!

Note down anything important that you hear.</p><p><strong>Check the Apartment’s Security Cameras</strong></p><p>Yokai are cunning. Even with security cameras installed, that doesn’t mean they will reveal themselves so easily.</p><p>But you might be able to catch them dong something that’s not quite human-like when they think no one’s looking, or something they normally wouldn’t do when in their human forms.</p><p>Behavior that appears ordinary at first glance could be a hint. Keep no stone unturned, and root out the Yokai.</p><p><strong>Evict the Yokai Upon Discovery</strong></p><p>Evict the resident after you have gathered enough evidence and identified them as a Yokai.</p><p>But be careful, if you mistake a real human for a Yokai and evict them, the remaining residents will become even more suspicious of each other, which is exactly what the Yokai want.</p><p>Stay calm during your investigations and keep the residents safe until the day of the new <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a>, when the Yokai will reveal their true forms.</p><p><strong>If You Don’t Evict Them in Time…</strong></p><p>On the night of the new moon, the Yokai will display their true power.</p><p>When that happens, there will be nothing that we powerless humans can do.</p><p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p><p>We will also continue to make the interface compatible with translations.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/itch-indie-games-chagos-islands-rule-britannia<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Itch.io</a>, if you don't already know it, is a wonderland of game ideas, rough sketches, works in progress and little indie surprises. You can't exist in game development, or love indie games, without having come into contact with it at <em>some</em> point.</p><p>The weird thing about Itch, though, is that the site isn't just known as Itch. You'll usually see it written about in full, domain extension and all, as Itch.io, in ways people would never do for, say, github.com. Even weirder is that,<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/could-a-surprise-uk-territory-handover-spell-the-end-for-itch-io-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as Game Developer report</a>, the .io part of that name is now under threat for the most unlikely of reasons.</p><p>I'll be honest and say that, until this week, I had no idea what the .io even meant. Aftermath.site, that makes sense, we're a site! Ebay.com.au also makes sense, we all know .com is a business, and .au is Australia. But .io? I've just taken it for granted all these years, figuring it was some tech thing or coder thing or something I just didn't understand and had never bothered to learn.But no! Turns out .io is a <em>place</em>! And that place is the Chagos Islands, a tiny series of atolls in the Indian Ocean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagos_Archipelago" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whose history is, well...</a></p><blockquote><p>The Chagos Islands had been home to the Chagossians from the 1700s brought as slaves by the French from Africa and India, a Bourbonnais Creole-speaking people, until the United Kingdom expelled them from the archipelago at the request of the United States between 1967 and 1973 to allow the United States to build Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia, a military base on Diego Garcia, on land leased from the UK military in the British Indian Ocean Territories. Since 1971, only the atoll of Diego Garcia has been inhabited, and only by employees of the US military, including American civilian contracted personnel. Since being expelled, Chagossians, like all others not permitted by the UK or US governments, have been prevented from entering the islands.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>It's essentially some rocks, with very nice beaches, that are outposts for the US military, built on land leased from the United Kingdom, which acquired the islands in 1814 as part of the treaty governing Napoleon's original surrender. Not the kind of scenario you associate with experimental indie game development, but it is what it is. It's .io specifically because, at the time of the creation of international domain extensions, the islands were listed as the British <strong>I</strong>ndian <strong>O</strong>cean Territory.</p><p>Those islands, despite being presently leased to the US, are actually one of the few remaining overseas possessions of the United Kingdom, and that's about to change because they're about to be handed over to Mauritius as part of an overdrawn (and overdue) exchange. And with that handover comes the risk of the .io domain extension no longer existing, since the Chagos will be folded into Mauritius (whose own extension is .mu, if you were wondering).</p><p>Itch's Leaf Corcoran<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/could-a-surprise-uk-territory-handover-spell-the-end-for-itch-io-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> tells Game Developer</a> that the site itself is obviously not going anywhere, but that they might in a worst-case scenario have to change domain extension, which sounds like an enormous pain both in terms of branding but also in policing external links and backlinks. Hopefully the internet's authorities can just leave .io up. If not, Ireland's domain extension (.ie) is probably the closest replacement, and would also be much funnier to read out loud.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Five months after bursting into PC early access, Hades 2 - the sequel to Supergiant Games' much-loved 2020 roguelike action-adventure - has just received its first major content update, adding a new region, weapon, and so much else its patch notes weigh in at over 3,500 words.
</p>
<p>
Hades 2's Olympic Update ("practically mountain-sized!", exclaims Supergiant) starts with the addition of a brand-new region - one you'll probably already have guess based on the name of today's release. If it's concrete information you want, though, we'll need to delve into spoiler territory - so <strong>turn back right now</strong> if you're sensitive to that kind of thing, otherwise I'll just get on and confirm Hades 2 players can now explore Olympus, the mountain of the gods.
</p>
<p>
Olympus consists of multiple new locations, and Supergiant notes today's update also adds new locations to several other existing regions. That's alongside an "otherworldly" new weapon - Xinth's Black Coat, to be more specific - plus two new allies with unique Keepsakes, and two new Animal Familiars (Raki the Raven and Hecuba the Hound) to find.

<p>
Elsewhere in Hades 2's Olympic Update, those looking to spruce up the Crossroads a little now have access to "dozens" of new cosmetic items, while Supergiant also promises "hours" of new dialogue (spanning 2,500 new voice lines) as the game's plot picks up the pace thanks to the arrival of Olympus and its denizens. Other key additions include a new world map that appears as protagonist Melinoë moves between regions, plus native support for Apple's M1 Macs.
</p><p>
Supergiant's full patch notes are appropriately supergiant in nature, so I won't be appending the whole thing to the bottom of this page. Instead, you'll find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/7057794870234137716?l=english">all 3,500+ words covering Hades 2's latest additions</a> over on Steam; alternatively, Supermassive has brilliantly released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQtih_yy6IA">nearly 27-minute long dramatic reading</a> of the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
Hades 2 is currently expected to leave early access next year, and a release for unspecified consoles is also on the cards. Already, though, it's a bit of a treat, with Eurogamer contributor Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">calling it</a> "comfortable and familiar" and armed with the "power of surprise".

And sure, you can argue that people don’t <em>need</em> to buy these passes, that they can just wait in line, but ride queues can get quite long and waiting sucks. Besides, the big appeal of Disney World and Disneyland is the rides!

According to the drop's description, 50% of the drop's sales will go to the fundraising program Extra Life.</p>

The cards in the drop are <em>Mana Geyser</em>, <em>Lightning Bolt</em>, <em>Fierce Guardianship</em>, and <em>Delayed Blast Fireball. </em>Each of these four cards contains pixel art by Mike Burns. That artwork depicts the Fbithp braving a lava-filled dungeon to do battle with the powerful dragon planeswalker Nico Bolas.</p>
<p>The pixel art is packed with small but important details. Background details like Nico Bolas' symbol. Fbithp having a heart gauge in the upper left corner. Nico Bolas having a large boss health bar. The card descriptions depicted as textboxes by planeswalker Ajani. It all comes together to sell the retro sidescroller aesthetic.</p>
<p>Extra Life was founded in 2008 as a fundraising program of Children's Miracle Network hospitals led by the gaming community. Since its inception, the program has raised $120 million for critical pediatric needs at local hospitals across the United States and Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wizards of the Coast has helped donate money to their cause in the past through similar <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-partners-with-extra-life-2022" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Secret Lair</a> events. Specifically, their proceeds go to support the Seattle Children's Autism Center.</p>
<p>The Pixel Perfect Secret Lair is available for pre-order right now. The Secret Lair will be available until November 18, 2024.</p>

Maybe it’s all leading up to another big trailer at the next Game Awards this December. In the meantime we have 90 seconds of McConaughey reprising his energy from <em>True Detective</em> season 1 to describe the game’s main villains, The Mara Yama.</p><p>“Do you know what fear is?” the <em>Interstellar</em> astronaut asks. “The Mara Yama do. They thrive on it. These monstrous celestials haunt the darkest corners of the cluster hunting for isolated targets, and, unfortunately for their victims, the Mara Yama are interested in stealing more than just cargo. They want minds. Memories. Emotions. The more twisted and tortured, the better.”</p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8x73UW8Hjk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8x73UW8Hjk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smell the psychosphere much</a></span>?</p><p>  <em>Exodus</em>, which is promising to let players engage with the consequences of their actions between the past and future through a unique time dilation mechanic, might end up being the next <em>Mass Effect</em> or <em>Destiny</em>. Or it could be another interesting but flawed AAA experiment from a new studio still finding its footing amid a grim video game industry landscape. Either way, I’m willing to bet that it never feels as full of violent, weird, and imaginative possibility as it does in this trailer. </p><p>Real games, the ones that survive a brutal series of trade-offs, compromises, and unexpected pitfalls to come out the other end a finished product on a store shelf or download queue, are almost never as good <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-god-of-war-weve-already-been-playing-in-our-heads-1824356326&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-god-of-war-weve-already-been-playing-in-our-heads-1824356326">as the versions of them we dream up</a></span> while we’re waiting for them to arrive. I don’t expect it to be any different with <em>Exodus</em>, which is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but still doesn’t have any kind of release window. At least we’ll always have this incredible teaser. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Don't Nod - the studio behind the likes of Jusant, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> 1 &amp; 2, and the upcoming Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - has announced 69 jobs are at risk as it initiates a "reorganisation project to ensure the company's long-term future" amid "deteriorating" financial results.
</p>
<p>
Signs the studio was facing difficulties <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-bets-on-lost-records-bloom-rage-as-multiple-projects-fail-to-meet-expectations">emerged earlier this year</a> when it announced it would be partially writing down €24m following the underperformance of Jusant and Banishers: Ghost of New Eden. It also confirmed it would be cancelling the development of one unannounced project, codenamed P10, while two additional Paris-developed projects (codenamed P12 and P13) had been temporarily put on hold in order to "prioritise resources and maximise the chances of success for the most promising titles at present." Despite all this, it remained upbeat regarding the prospects of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, and noted it had two additional in-house projects in the works, both scheduled to release by the end of 2027. 
</p>
<p>
But in its newly released <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-88278">2024 half-year results update</a>, Don't Nod has acknowledged "strongly negative results despite [these] performance-enhancing measures", and has announced a "reorganisation project to safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem" that may affect up to 69 jobs. "An initial exchange took place today with the employee representative bodies," it noted, "and an information-consultation process with these same bodies will subsequently be initiated regarding this project."

<p>
In a statement accompany today's news, Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert wrote, "Our half-year results for 2024 reflect the economic underperformance of our latest release, despite solid ratings on Metacritic, as well as the accounting impact of the decisions we had to take. The initial performance support measures announced last spring no longer seem sufficient to maintain the company's competitiveness. As a result, today we presented a reorganisation project to the employee representative bodies, which could set Don't Nod on a new development trajectory. I am fully conscious of the impact this project may have on all our employees. Securing our company's resources and restoring its ability to perform more in an increasingly competitive and selective industry is extremely necessary."
</p><p>
In addition to its in-house projects, Don't Nod is providing support for two external publishing projects due for release in 2025, but Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage will be the company's next major own release when it launches for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S next year - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-lost-records-launches-in-two-parts">first part arriving on 18th February</a> and its concluding half releasing a month later on 18th March.

Unreal Engine has a lot of features for this, but for our game, we really had to squeeze up every megabyte from every piece of system content we could, and now we did it,” said GSC.</p><p>According to the interview, the studio’s devs now believe that it should be possible for any modern game to work on <em>Series S.</em> However, the developers did acknowledge that not every team or studio gets enough time to optimize for the weaker Xbox. GSC did spend a lot of time boosting performance and optimizing the game, which the studio claims helped the PC version become more “performant.”</p><h2 id="h183357"><a id=""></a>The Xbox Series S might be causing problems for devs</h2><p>In the past, we’ve heard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/developer-claims-many-studios-are-asking-xbox-to-drop-mandatory-series-s-compatibility/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/developer-claims-many-studios-are-asking-xbox-to-drop-mandatory-series-s-compatibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vague complaints</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yKJsDoysEM&amp;t=4257s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yKJsDoysEM&amp;t=4257s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from developers</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamerant.com/rocksteady-fleur-marty-comments-xbox-series-s-holding-back-generation/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/rocksteady-fleur-marty-comments-xbox-series-s-holding-back-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that the Xbox Series S is holding back some ports</a></span>.

However, in many cases, we have managed to hit 60 FPS, but it’s not as consistent as the Series X. But we’re looking to get a performance mode for Xbox Series S, to get it to 60 FPS.

                <p>Like many other games, Psyonix's Rocket League is getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-2024-halloween-game-events/2900-5807/" data-ref-id="2900-5807">Halloween update</a>, and this one will also include a range of Spider-Man content focused on the franchise's heroes and villains.</p><p>The Haunted Hallows event begins this Friday, October 18, and runs through November 4. As part of the event, players can complete challenges to unlock rewards like toppers and decals inspired by Spider-Man villains like Venom, Mysterio, and Green Goblin.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=025TMNQHWV0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/025TMNQHWV0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spider-Man superfans might be interested in buying the Spider-Man Mega Bundle (about $25 USD), which comes with everything, including a Venom-themed goal explosion, decals for Spider-Gwen and Spider-Punk, a Web-head boost and trail, Spider-Man and Symbiote wheels, and a Spidey sense topper, among other things. Check out everything available in the bundle below. Players don't have to buy the mega bundle, though, as individual items and bundles are available as well for separate purchase.</p><p>In addition to the Spider-Man content, Rocket League is adding two limited-time modes for Halloween, including Spooky Cube and Haunted Heatseeker. Spooky Cube is normal Rocket League except the spherical soccer ball is replaced with a cubical jack-o'-lantern. In Haunted Heatseeker, the field is invaded by ghosts who try to steal the ball and score--but there is a catch. If your opponent blocks a ghost's shots, the ball will ricochet back toward your own goal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385913-screenshot2024-10-16at3.51.53pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4385913" data-ratio="0.56035889070147" data-width="1226" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385913-screenshot2024-10-16at3.51.53pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4385913"></a><figcaption>Spider-Man comes to Rocket League</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385913-screenshot2024-10-16at3.51.53pm.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385914-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.34pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385915-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.41pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385916-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.47pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385917-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.52pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4385914,1300-4385915,1300-4385916,1300-4385917" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385914-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.34pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385915-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.41pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385916-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.47pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4385917-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.52pm.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385914-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.34pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385915-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.41pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385916-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.47pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4385917-screenshot2024-10-16at3.52.52pm.png"></figure><p>For lots more on Haunted Hallows, be sure to <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/its-a-spider-man-spooktacular-in-rocket-leagues-haunted-hallows" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">read the full blog post on the Rocket League website.</a>⁠</p><h3>⁠⁠⁠Spider-Man Mega Bundle (3000 Credits, or about $25 USD)</h3><ul><li>We Are Venom Goal Explosion <i>(2000 Credits individually)</i></li><li>Spider-Man Octane Decal Bundle <i>(900 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Classic Spider-Man Octane Decal</li><li>Spider-Gwen Octane Decal</li><li>Spider-Punk Octane Decal</li><li>Scarlet Spider Octane Decal</li></ul></li><li>Web-Head Boost + Trail Bundle <i>(600 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Web-Head Boost</li><li>Web-Head Trail</li></ul></li><li>Symbiote Fennec Bundle <i>(500 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Spider-Man Symbiote Suit Fennec Decal</li><li>Scream Fennec Decal</li></ul></li><li>Spider-Man Wheels Bundle <i>(500 Credits individually)</i><ul><li>Spider-Man Wheels</li><li>Spider-Man Symbiote Wheels</li></ul></li><li>Spidey Sense Topper</li><li>Spider-Man’s Bag Topper</li></ul>

Sombra will now gain Stealth for five seconds after activating Translocator, though hacking enemies or taking damage will no longer end Stealth but instead will temporarily reveal her. Blizzard has also added back her Opportunist passive, allowing her to see critically injured enemies through walls and deal more damage to hacked targets.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 - Season 13: Spellbinder Event Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24148443/director-s-take-tricks-tweaks-and-treats-for-season-13/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> going over the update, game director Aaron Keller said the changes were in order to make it so Sombra can't take any position she wants in Stealth while giving her a new gameplay loop that "increases her lethality."</p><p dir="ltr">Several Tank heroes have received changes as well in Season 13, namely Ramattra, Reinhardt, and Mauga. Ramattra's Pummel ability no longer pierces shields, though it will deal 2.5x more damage to them to compensate, with the patch notes stating that the ability being able to damage through shields was a "source of frustration for players trying to protect themselves or their allies."</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of shields, the health of Reinhardt's Barrier Field has been reduced by 100, which Keller said should lead to players having to make a choice between blocking attacks with their barrier or taking the hits themselves. Mauga, on the other hand, received a nice buff, with his ignite damage from his incendiary chaingun now dealing damage over four seconds instead of three. That should give him more power against "smaller, harder to hit targets," Blizzard said.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-12-introduces-juno-lets-players-become-egyptian-gods/1100-6525795/" data-ref-id="1100-6525795">Juno, the game's newest Support hero</a>, received a nerf to her healing both in terms of the amount healed and the falloff range of her Mediblaster. The change will require players to make better use of her mobility abilities in order to maintain proper positioning, Blizzard said. Other heroes got small updates as well, ranging from increased cooldown for Brigitte's Repair Pack to a slight health buff for Hanzo.</p><p dir="ltr">Other changes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-season-13-battle-pass-all-skins-emotes-and-rewards/2900-5867/" data-ref-id="2900-5867">Overwatch 2 Season 13</a> include a number of adjustments to various maps. Four maps--Circuit Royal, Havana, Dorado, and Numbani--have seen various tweaks, ranging from added cover and adjusted sightlines to new pathways and changes to spawn locations. A full before-and-after breakdown can be viewed in the official patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to all the various map and hero changes, Clash, the newest Overwatch 2 game mode added during Season 12, received adjustments. Blizzard said it's looking to "reduce the number of one-sided stomps" in the mode, and as a result tweaked capture times as well as made it easier for Attackers to secure at least one segment of the final objective point.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-new-halloween-game-mode-mutates-heroes-for-brutal-pvp-action/1100-6527094/" data-ref-id="1100-6527094">Overwatch 2 Season 13 introduced a new PvP Halloween game mode</a> alongside bringing back previous PvE event modes like Junkenstein's Revenge and Wrath of the Bride, and will soon offer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-getting-another-anime-crossover-this-time-with-my-hero-academia/1100-6526743/" data-ref-id="1100-6526743">My Hero Academia-themed skins</a>.

The Interactive Scoreboard is intended to make reporting faster and easier, but also to improve your social experience through whatever channels you prefer to communicate in or avoid entirely. The following features are now accessible via Interactive Scoreboard:</p><ul><li>Adjusting Mic Volume of other players</li><li>Adjusting your Mic Volume</li><li>Reporting other players</li><li>Joining/Leaving Team Voice Chat</li><li>Joining/Leaving Group Voice Chat</li><li>Muting Team Text Chat</li><li>Muting Match Text Chat</li><li>Muting Text Chat of other players</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Matchmaking Updates</p><ul><li>Tuning changes to reduce queue times for Wide matches in Competitive Play.</li><li>Loss Streak avoidance tuned down to prevent cases where it could increase worst case scenario queue times.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We're not seeing any measurable impact from this tech in preventing loss streaks and we're concerned it might be making queue times longer. So we're scaling it back for now.</p><ul><li>Role Delta tuning tightened, to try to match Ranks on the roles on each team more closely.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We believe that match quality improves significantly when you are matched closely with one of the members on the opposing team in the same role. We believe we can tighten this preference without significantly impacting queue times.</p><ul><li>Role Delta has been updated to prioritize the Tank Role above other roles.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We've been thinking about how to improve the Tank experience from every angle, to give them more even matchups and reduce 1-sided matches for the whole team further.</p><ul><li>At higher Ranks the effects of MMR Decay, Winning Trend, Losing Trend, and Calibration have been reduced.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: At our highest ranks these modifiers could sometimes allow very high skill players playing on new accounts to get lucky and surpass their peak ranks considerably, without actually earning their new rank like other players that have played more on their accounts.</p><ul><li>At higher Ranks the matchmaker now takes into account the benefits of grouping when constructing matches.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: At the highest ranks, groups have had noteworthy advantages against teams composed of all solo players for some time now. Our aim with this addition isn't to remove the advantage of grouping at higher ranks entirely, but we'd like the advantage of grouping at higher ranks to be less extreme.</p><p dir="ltr">Public Custom Games</p><ul><li>Hosting Public Custom Games now requires Endorsement Level 3.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: A reminder that we've been actioning accounts that post disruptive content in the Game Browser and we're serious about removing problematic players that don't follow our Code of Conduct. Whenever an account is actioned for a social penalty, they're reduced to Endorsement Level 0, so the combination of social actions and this feature will allow for one chance to change their behavior before they're permanently banned. Anyone that is below Endorsement Level 3 can still host games with the "Friends" or "Invite Only" settings, but they will not have access to the "Everyone" setting.</p><p dir="ltr">Streamer Protect</p><ul><li>Access to the "Hide My Name" function of Streamer Protect now requires completing the "Unrelenting Hero" Lifetime Challenge.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We've been listening to community feedback that newer accounts should be required to earn access to the feature, but it's important that this feature can't be abused by various types of disruptive players that tend to play on very new accounts. As a reminder, the "Hide My Name" feature does not prevent disruptive players from being punished when they're reported since we know their actual battle tag behind the scenes.</p><p dir="ltr">Challenge Updates</p><ul><li>Select challenges are now visible in the Main Menu.</li><li>Challenge Rewards can now be inspected in detail in the Challenges Menu.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: Challenges are now in the main menu to highlight their rewards, primarily for new Event Challenges.</p><p dir="ltr">SHOP UPDATES</p><ul><li>Mythic Skin Aspects Add-on Cosmetic is now added to the Mythic Shop.</li><li>Overwatch League Store tab was removed and replaced by a separate button in the bottom of the main Shop tab.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">COMPETITIVE UPDATES</p><p>The requirements to appear on the Top 500 Leaderboard have changed:</p><ul><li>Win requirement per season reduced from 50 to 25.</li><li>The Seasoned Competitor challenge (750 lifetime wins in Competitive Play) is now required to be completed to be eligible for any Top 500 Leaderboard starting in Season 12.</li></ul><h4>Hero Updates</h4><p dir="ltr">General</p><ul><li>Swapping your hero hides your selection on the enemy scoreboard for 15 seconds.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: This change adds a more friction to counterswapping, especially in the extreme case where two players on opposite teams are both sitting in spawn with the scoreboard open and rapidly switch their heroes in response to each other’s choices.</p><h4>Tank</h4><h5>Mauga</h5><p>Developer Comment: Increasing the duration of Mauga's burn effect will help better reward going for the smaller, harder to hit targets.</p><p dir="ltr">Incendiary Chaingun</p><ul><li>Ignite damage over time duration increased from 3 to 4 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Ramattra</h5><p>Developer Comments: Ramattra's Pummel projectiles passing through barriers was a source of frustration for players trying to protect themselves or their allies. With these changes enabling Ramattra to deal critical damage to barriers, he will still be a valuable hero choice against barrier mechanics, but won't immediately apply damage to players on the other side.</p><p>Pummel</p><p dir="ltr">Pummel</p><ul><li>No longer pierces barriers.</li><li>Now deals 2.5x more damage to barriers.</li></ul><h5>Reinhardt</h5><p>Developer Comments: This is just some fine tuning for the barrier health and regeneration rate as it had become slightly too tough to break through.</p><p dir="ltr">Barrier Field</p><ul><li>Barrier Field health reduced from 1600 to 1500.</li></ul><h4>Damage</h4><h5>Hanzo</h5><p>Developer Comments: We are reverting Hanzo back to his previous health now that it's possible to take out an opposing Hanzo with a well-aimed headshot thanks to the weapon damage changes.</p><ul><li>Base health increased from 225 to 250.</li></ul><h5>Sojourn</h5><p>Developer Comments: These Railgun changes swap out the 25 minimum energy it decays to for a longer time before it begins to degenerate which alleviates some of the pressure to quickly use the secondary fire. Disruptor shot is getting a damage increase to helps its effectiveness as an area denial tool, andlong with additional utility through generating a small amount of Railgun energy to make it more broadly useful.</p><p dir="ltr">Railgun</p><ul><li>Energy no longer stops degenerating at 25 energy.</li><li>Time before energy degeneration begins increased from 7 to 12 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Disruptor Shot</p><ul><li>Damage per second increased from 60 to 80</li><li>Now generates 25% of damage done to enemy players as Railgun energy.</li></ul><h5>Sombra</h5><p>Developer Comments: This is a significant change to Sombra's playstyle in the hopes of making her more interactive for the opposing team and shifting some of her power from the utility of Stealth and Hack into increased lethality.</p><p>Stealth having a limited duration less than the Translocator cooldown is intended to create brief windows of vulnerability. It still enables Sombra to cross through dangerous areas unseen, but to really hang around in the enemy backline will require moving from cover-to-cover similar to other flanking heroes. No longer having the stealth movement speed removed upon taking damage also enhances its usefulness as an escape tool.</p><p dir="ltr">Hack</p><ul><li>No longer ends Stealth but does reveal Sombra.</li><li>Hacked ability lockout effect duration reduced from 1.5 to 1.0 seconds (EMP duration unchanged).</li><li>BOB hacked stun duration reduced from 10 to 3 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Translocator</p><ul><li>Cooldown increased from 5 to 7 seconds.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">EMP</p><ul><li>Ultimate cost increased 12%.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Stealth</p><ul><li>No longer passive and now activates by using Translocator.</li><li>Now has a 5 second duration.</li><li>Added stealth timer around the reticle and removed ability icon.</li><li>Taking damage now reveals Sombra for 1 second instead of ending stealth.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Opportunist</p><ul><li>The Opportunist passive has been added back in.</li><li>Increases Sombra's weapon damage versus hacked targets by 20%.</li><li>See critically injured enemies through walls.</li></ul><h4>Support</h4><h5>Baptiste</h5><p>Developer Comment: This change is aimed at reducing the fatigue resulting from controlling the recoil over longer periods of play more than trying to add power to Baptiste's primary fire.</p><p dir="ltr">Biotic Launcher</p><ul><li>Primary fire recoil reduced by 30%.</li></ul><h5>Brigitte</h5><p>Developer Comment: Brigitte's healing output over the course of a match is quite high, so this is just a slight adjustment to help bring that in line.</p><p dir="ltr">Repair Pack</p><ul><li>Cooldown increased from 5 to 5.5 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Juno</h5><p>Developer Comments: Juno's healing output is too high for how much mobility she possesses so we're shortening her falloff range to increase the importance of positioning well with her mobility abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Mediblaster</p><ul><li>Falloff range reduced from 30-50 meters to 20-35 meters.</li><li>Healing per projectile reduced from 6.5 to 6.</li></ul><h4>Map Updates</h4><p dir="ltr">CLASH</p><ul><li>Capture time on the final objective points A and E now increases for Attackers as segments get secured consecutively from 1x /1x / 1x to 0.7x /1.1x /1.4x, to make the first segment easier to capture for attackers but consecutive ones harder.</li><li>Defenders now respawn instantly as the first segment and second segment get secured instead of when the previous objective points B or D get captured.</li><li>Unlock time for final objective points A and E has been increased from 25 seconds to 27.5 seconds.</li><li>Decay rate on final objective points A and E have been doubled for attackers to not lose their progress as quickly when stepping off the point.</li><li>Capture time for defenders on objective points B and D has been increased by 10% to give attackers more opportunities to attack the point.</li></ul><p>Developer Comments: We want to reduce the number of one-sided stomps occurring in the Clash game mode. We also want to address the difficulty of securing at least one segment on the final objective points as attackers. So, we tweaked the capture time for the defending team to make the fight for objective points B and D a bit more favorable for attackers.</p><h4>Circuit Royal</h4><p>1st Point</p><ul><li>New exit options from attackers initial spawn to reduce spawn camping.</li><li>Initial high ground right flank brought in and access adjusted to reduce spawn camping.</li><li>Cover options added.</li><li>New far side flank option to contest defenders on the high ground by the bridge.</li></ul><p>2nd Point</p><ul><li>Improved spawn protections for attackers leaving the second spawn area to reduce spawn camping.</li><li>Additional cover added while pushing high ground for attackers.</li><li>New flank added for attackers to take rear high ground by the chicane.</li><li>Hill lowered slightly and road angled forward to make approach for attackers slightly more comfortable.</li></ul><p>3rd Point</p><ul><li>Improved options for attackers leaving the third spawn area to combat spawn camping.</li><li>Flank route to high ground pool area widened and additional cover added to increase play options in this space.</li><li>Sightlines improved for attackers to poke at entrenched defender positions in the final area.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Before and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and After</p><h4>Dorado</h4><p>1st Point</p><ul><li>Starting high ground cover and access has been adjusted to reduce spawn camping.</li><li>Flank routes have been streamlined for attackers.</li><li>Various geometry adjustments to provide more favorable gameplay opportunities for attackers in the market area.</li></ul><p>2nd Point</p><ul><li>Staircase added for easier attacker access to the high ground.</li><li>Added access to the courthouse for attackers.</li></ul><p>3rd Point</p><ul><li>Cover added after the chokepoint on the main path.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Before and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and After</p><h4>Havana</h4><p>1st Point</p><ul><li>Reduced sightlines into the attackers' spawn.</li><li>Added new options for attackers to exit their spawn.</li><li>Reduced oppressive high ground vantage points for defenders.</li></ul><p>2nd Point</p><ul><li>Widened doorways and certain routes for cleaner navigation and flow.</li><li>Closed small holes through certain assets to block sightlines and projectiles.</li></ul><p>3rd Point</p><ul><li>Redesigned attackers' spawn interior and added additional routes for a safer attacker exit.</li><li>Sightlines from the fort wall to spawn and main route have been reduced.</li><li>Pathing into the fort has been consolidated on one side for cleaner flow and to give both teams more options while in combat around the final chokepoint.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Before and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and After</p><h4>Numbani</h4><p>1st Point</p><ul><li>Attackers' initial spawn room has been pushed a lot closer to first point to reduce runback times.</li><li>Lowered some high ground around first point.</li><li>Easier access to flank routes around first point.</li><li>Combined the paths in the building behind the payload on first point - one room that connects everything.</li></ul><p>2nd Point</p><ul><li>Forward defender spawn points have been added to reduce runback times for defenders.</li><li>A staircase has been added near attackers forward spawn for easier access to high ground.</li><li>Added a connecting path past and above the choke into third point.</li></ul><p>3nd Point</p><ul><li>Relocated a pesky sign.</li><li>Removed a tree.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Before and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and AfterBefore and After</p><h4>Bug Fixes</h4><p dir="ltr">General</p><ul><li>Fixed a bug that caused some players to be unable to purchase golden weapons.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Voice Chat Devices setting was unable to be changed.</li><li>Fived a bug that caused Adrenaline Junkie achievement to sometimes not grant.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Heroes</p><p>Baptiste</p><ul><li>Fixed a bug with Baptiste's Zombie Walk Emote.</li></ul><p>Sigma</p><ul><li>Fixed a bug where Sigma would not gain Overhealth for Juno's Mediblaster.</li></ul><p>Reaper</p><ul><li>In a previous update, fixed a bug that caused exit sound enemy reaper's shadow step to not play.</li></ul>

The turn-based adventure continues to look stunning though, and it just announced an all-star voice cast to boot that includes Andy Serkis.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196215,196055" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is a dark fantasy RPG inspired by the French Belle Époque (think French Impressionism and the Lumière brothers) about a group of explorers trying to take on a god called the Paintress who’s terrorizing the countryside with arbitrary mass killings. The turn-based combat mixes in real-time elements, while the gorgeous menus and evocative UI look like a cross between <em>Persona</em> and <em>Dishonored</em>. If the actual game can live up to its early trailers, we could have something really special on our hands. </p><p>And despite coming from a brand-new studio, the just-revealed cast for the game is full of top-notch talent. In addition to Serkis, best known as Gollum in Peter Jackson’s<em> Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy and as <em>Andor</em>’s Kino Loy in the single best episode of <em>Star Wars</em> TV ever produced, <em>Expedition 33</em> also features the voice talents of <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s Clive Rosfield (Ben Starr) and<em> Baldur’s Gate III</em>’s Shadowheart (Jennifer English). Here’s the full cast list so far:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Andy Serkis </strong>(<em>13 Going on 30</em>) as a man trying to save his family named Renoir</li><li><strong>Charlie Cox</strong> (<em>Daredevil</em>) as the lead engineer Gustave</li><li><strong>Ben Starr</strong> (<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>) as the dangerous stranger  Verso</li><li><strong>Jennifer English </strong>(<em>Baldur’s Gate III</em>) as the shy loner  Maelle</li><li><strong>Kirsty Rider</strong> (<em>Sandman</em>) as chief researcher Lune</li><li><strong>Shala Nyx </strong>(<em>The Old Guard</em>) as the cheerful warrior Sciel</li></ul></blockquote><p>The newest trailer features the talents of both Starr, who helped carry <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s uneven story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xvi-ffxvi-clive-thirsty-fan-fiction-ps5-1850588637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xvi-ffxvi-clive-thirsty-fan-fiction-ps5-1850588637">to hell and back on his shoulders</a></span>, and Serkis, who we still love <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/andy-serkis-ai-characters-project-gollum-lord-of-the-rings-1236096832/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/andy-serkis-ai-characters-project-gollum-lord-of-the-rings-1236096832/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">despite his saying some dumb stuff about AI</a></span>. The gameplay footage also gives a wider look at <em>Expedition 33</em>'s unique world and massive monsters. A giant clockwork golem fight demonstrates the game’s timing-based combat mechanics, and a grappling hook-like power shows off one of the game’s many traversal abilities. </p><p>Devora Wilde (<em>Space Marine 2</em>), Tracy Wiles (<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>), Rich Keeble, and Maxence Cazorla are in the game as well. “The actors were phenomenal to work with (and just all-around great people),” wrote <em>Clair Obscur </em>lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/introducing-the-cast-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/16/introducing-the-cast-of-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the PlayStation Blog</a></span>. “We had a lot of fun during the recording sessions. The cast beautifully conveyed the complexity of the characters, who have each been shaped by the harshness of their world. Every character has been affected by deep and constant loss and has dealt with this in their own way.”</p><p>  <em>Expedition 33</em> doesn’t have a set release date yet, but it’s supposed to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC early in 2025. So far the Unreal Engine 5 game looks like it’s shaping up nicely. I wouldn’t be surprised if it still gets one or two minor delays, but I’m looking forward to it whenever it finally arrives. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, Amazon is offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9ZdAkY?object_uuid=5630fe79-4cc3-4258-8fb4-801676a0c861&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nextorage Japan</a> 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 Solid State Drive (SSD) for $119.99 exclusively for Prime members. This SSD includes a preinstalled heatsink for PS5 compatibility out of the box.</p><h2>Nextorage Japan 2TB PS5 SSD for $119.99</h2><p><em><strong>Amazon Prime member exclusive</strong></em></p><div catalogid="52958d41-8b79-4bb5-acec-615f4f648870" id="181140"><div id="181140" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nextorage Japan 2TB PS5 SSD with Heatsink</h3></p><div><p>Amazon Prime member exclusive</p></div></div><p>The PlayStation 5 console comes with a 1TB SSD, but 300GB of that is reserved for the OS, leaving around 700GB left over for games. That space will run out quickly because some games take up an enormous amount of space, especially if you buy digital copies. For example, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">Star Wars: Jedi Survivor</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k25-review">NBA 2K25</a> all require 140GB each. Even older games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War: Ragnarok</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gran-turismo-7-review">Gran Turismo 7</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-review">Horizon Forbidden West</a> require 90GB of space apiece.</p><p>The Nextorage Japan SSD is a guaranteed fit in both the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Slim consoles. Performance-wise, it boasts read speeds of 7,300MB/s and write speeds of 6,900MB/s, which is well above Sony's minimum recommendation of 5,600MB/s. It's also pre-equipped with a low-profile aluminum heatsink. The 2TB capacity triples the storage of a PS5 or doubles the storage of a PS5 Pro, which should be enough for most people.</p><h3>Is Nextorage legit?</h3><p>There's an interesting story behind Nextorage Japan. Nextorage describes itself as a company that was "created by a group of ex-Sony engineers and staff with over 20 years of experience in the development of memory and storage products." Nextorage was originally created by Sony in 2019 as an SSD sub-division about a year before the PS5 was released. Presumably this was to be the basis for an official SSD sold by Sony direct. For whatever reason, Sony decided to ditch that idea and sold this business to another stakeholder in the company, Phison, in 2022. Phison is another large reputable company that specializes in solid state memory controllers. You'll find its controllers in name-brand SSDs like Seagate, Corsair, and Sabrent. Under Phison, Nextorage Japan eventually accomplished the goal of releasing an SSD catered specifically for the PS5 console in the form of this product right here.</p><h2>Alternative for Non-Prime Members</h2></div><div catalogid="afd3830a-9c79-404d-8955-bea9002efa9c" id="192792"><div id="192792" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Lexar NM790 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD with Heatsink</h3></p></div><p>Amazon also has the PS5 compatible <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6b4YY?object_uuid=5630fe79-4cc3-4258-8fb4-801676a0c861&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lexar NM790</a> 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 Solid State Drive (SSD) with pre-installed heatsink for only $128.99.
