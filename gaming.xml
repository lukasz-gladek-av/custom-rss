			<p>As a kid, when you come across an ancient, tattered map in the attic, what’s the first thing you do? If you answered ‘Go to sea, wreck yourself and then wash up on a desert island on the back of a giant turtle’, then we have a winner!</p>
<p><iframe title="Survival Kids - Official Nintendo Switch 2 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BhT0Rv8pFOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the very simple backstory holding down Survival Kids, a co-op survival game from Konami that’s received a surprise revival on Switch 2. The original was a Game Boy Color game of the same name, which was just rereleased on Nintendo Classics last month, and continued in the noughties by the Lost in Blue trilogy on Nintendo DS.</p>


<p>Survival Kids is a colourful romp across a series of fantastical and magical islands. Either solo or with up to 3 friends, you set about crafting and cooking your way to freedom. Or, at the very least clumsily crashing your boat into every possible island on the way home.</p>
<p>Despite the name, this is more Messing About on m Islands Kids than it is about actual survival. You are functionally immortal, you will never die of starvation and there’s none of the usual inventory or time management that comes with the survival genre. This is very much a survival-lite game, making this a decent co-op option for those new to gaming. It’s also entirely playable solo, but as in real life, it’s quicker to chop a tree down when four people are wildly swinging axes at it.</p>

<p>Near the start of each level you will find a Harmony Stone — the McGuffin that both acts as portable camp as you work your way to higher ground, and drives the limited plot forward. This is a relic from a bygone era; despite each island being a deserted one, it was once home to an ancient race with an impressive command of technology.</p>

<p>Once you set up camp, you begin your hunt for either the elevator to the next strata of the island, or the boat that will get you off the island and onto the next one. The elevator is, naturally, broken so you need to find the missing parts to repair it.</p>
<p>The rub is that as you traverse a given island, you will quickly find your way frequently blocked by gaping chasms or unclimbable walls. Since you are resourceful youngsters, and carry around a pickaxe and an axe, you can fashion functional bridges and climbing nets out of the stuff lying around the island.</p>
<p>The genius here is that since you have to manually carry everything — your pockets are full of pickaxe, remember? — and you can’t do complex tasks like climbing while your hands are full, each island is extremely navigable. That’s not to say they are linear — exploration is rewarded and you frequently have to think outside the box, throwing vines and the like into crafting boxes from across a gap, in order to create the bridge you need to cross. You’ll even come across glyphs that unlock extra outfits and Treasure Stones that increase your island’s star rating.</p>
<p>Escaping the island all hinges on solving the area’s puzzles, which invariably involves building bridges, crafting tools and eating food to get the stamina to rip stuff out of the ground.</p>
<p>These puzzles are usually pretty simple —&nbsp;chop down a tree and add wood to the blue box with the floating recipe above it — but get slightly more complicated as the game progresses. Mostly, they get more frustrating when you come across the ‘ancient’ gun turrets that shoot you into the water, making you lose the thing you’re carrying.</p>

<p>New tools are added along the way in the form of blueprints; find those and drag them back to base to discover the recipe for your tool. Collect the bits you need and you suddenly have a new glider to help traverse the peaks, or a fishing rod that will carry parts up cliffs.</p>
<p>Once you’ve repaired enough elevators and are high enough up the island, you’ll find your ship, minus a few key parts. So now, instead of looking for elevator parts, it’s the same thing but looking for rudders, sails and so on. Find the bits, repair the ship and bring the Harmony Stone aboard.</p>
<p>Island-specific recipes aside, this core gameplay loop doesn’t really change: fix the elevator, pick up your camp and up you go. It’s possibly a little simplistic for some, but ideal for playing with your partner or kids who don’t usually have a controller glued to their hands.</p>
<p>Ultimately, your mission is to get the Harmony Stone off of each island and take it back to an arcane lighthouse that staves off the storm surrounding the archipelago, permitting your eventual escape. If you complete the level fast enough, you’ll be awarded up to three stars, adding to those from looting all three Treasure Stones per island. Get enough stars and you can unlock the final island.</p>

<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>It's a feature</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="rumble turned off message switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3877cedaa3806/rumble-turned-off-message-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It seems some eager players have been a little mystified as to the reasons behind a message that's been popping up on their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> screens during play as of late.</p>
<p>Yep, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lai1kb/rumble_turning_itself_off/">over on Reddit</a> (thanks <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/49752-switch-2-will-automatically-turn-off-rumble-after-prolonged-use">GoNintendo</a>) a handful of gamers have been rocking up to report that an alert related to the console's HD Rumble has been popping onto their lovely big LCD screens, as you can see in the post below this very paragraph. Of course, with it being a new console, folk have quickly become concerned that there's something up with their Joy-Con and/or Pro 2 Controllers.</p>

<p>Fear not, however, if you happen to see this very same message, which is something that could definitely happen (although this particular writer, through a whole bunch of reviews on the system thus far, has yet to see it), so stay frosty!</p>
<p>As it turns out, amongst the many new bells and whistles the Switch 2 brings with it, its snazzy new HD Rumble 2 — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-differences-how-do-the-new-controllers-compare">the reason your Joy-Con and Pro 2 Controller feel so great this time around</a> — has the ability to shut itself off should it overheat or become a burden on other functions, such as battery, we are guessing. Indeed, browsing through the comments from the same post, we've got gamers chiming in on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> both triggering this same function.</p>
<p>Could it become annoying, though? Or can we switch it off more to the point? (No, no we can't as there's no option in settings.)</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be a huge amount of rhyme as to how and when the issue presents itself at the moment, but with the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 the rumble <em>can</em> become very intensive for entire scenes, and it appears as though a sustained rumble, for around a minute, is what's causing the issue. Perhaps the best bet, certainly with regards to CD Projekt Red's game, is to turn the rumble down in-game.</p>
<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/switch-2-joy-con-hd-rumble-wont-be-as-loud-as-it-was-on-switch">already discussed the decreased the volume of rumble</a> on Switch 2, so it's obviously an aspect of the machine they've been spending a lot of time refining and keeping an eye on. We've reached out to Nintendo asking about the exact conditions and reasons for this warning to pop up - we'll keep you posted with any updates.</p>
<p><em>Have you had the HD Rumble message pop up on your Switch 2 during game yet? Let us know!</em></p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> has sold more than one million copies on PC within three days of its arrival to the platform, <a href="https://bbs.ruliweb.com/news/read/211821">according to Ruliweb</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> would also pass the three million sales milestone across all platforms following its PC release. As of writing, the game reached a peak concurrent player count on Steam of 192,078, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">a substantial increase over the weekend from its initial peak of just under 100,000 in its first day</a>.</p>
<p>This performance marks an all-time record for South Korean single players games, a style of game that ShiftUp has been championing since releasing Stellar Blade in April of last year.</p>

<p>According to industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1934432993210237238">Daniel Ahmad at Niko Partners</a>, a majority of these PC sales stem from China, a playerbase who'd benefit from a PC-only Chinese dub and appropriate regional pricing. This market has proven an exceptionally eager one, both with Stellar Blade and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">Black Myth Wukong's own record breaking Steam release last year</a>.</p>
<p>This stunning PC release comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-remaining-thoughtful-about-how-and-if-it-brings-games-to-additional-platforms">Sony execs spoke about bringing its games to different platforms in an annual fireside chat</a>. Sony Interactive Entertainment president Hideaki Nishino and Studio Business Group head Hermen Hulst when asked about how to "protect the value" of the PlayStation console noted that Sony's consoles would remain "the best place to play and publish", but that "the team is always looking for "new and innovative ways to broaden [its] reach".</p>
<p>ShiftUp announced back in May in an investor presentation that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">a sequel to Stellar Blade was being developed</a>. The only tidbit of information aside from the confirmation present there was that the game was scheduled to be released before 2027.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Yes. Rob Wiethoff, who's delivered some of the best lines in video game, let's face it (<em>"Some men are born rich enough and dumb enough to enjoy their lives. Ain't nothing fair,"</em> goes hard right now), was doing a little bit of streaming of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> when he dropped a few tidbits of very exciting — or potentially very exciting — news, especially if it happens to relate to a certain new console.</p><p><figure data-videoid="nO48QYAS9Kg" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed362f9fxugmql&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO48QYAS9Kg">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I've got such exciting news...I can't share it with you right now, and it's absolutely killing me. By the end of this week, hopefully sooner...definitely before Friday. Oh my goodness...the news that I have to share, and I won't be the only one sharing it. I cannot wait for you to know what's going on, and that's all I can say. That's the only thing I can think about right now, and you'll know soon enough. I can't wait for you to know."</p>

<p>He seems pretty excited. So, with those Switch 2/next-gen revamp rumours already swirling, are early Switch 2 owners about to get a big cowboy-shaped surprise over the next few days? Goddammit, we sure do hope so, Dutch.</p>
<p>Of course, the OG Red Dead Redemption is already out on Switch. This writer even reviewed it back at launch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/Rockstar's%20Western%20epic%20holds%20up%20surprisingly%20well,%20its%20story%20is%20as%20powerful%20as%20ever,%20its%20knockabout%20action%20still%20feels%20great,%20and%20it%20looks%20and%20plays%20perfectly%20well%20on%20Nintendo's%20console.">giving it an 8/10</a> and calling it a barebones port (with no multiplayer) that nevertheless "still feels great, and looks and plays perfectly well on Nintendo's console."</p>

            <p>PlayStation have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-spider-man-2-and-more-playstation-titles-have-been-freed-from-their-region-lock-prison-on-pc">finally come to their senses</a> and rolled back a lot of the unpopular PC region locking that's been stopping folks in various parts of the world enjoying a bunch of games. It looks like one of those titles, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, could finally be getting a cape players have craved for a year or so as a result.</p>
<p>Yep, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani has teased deploying the review bomb-themed cape that first emerged as a meme following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">the backlash</a> to PlayStation attempting to change the game's PSN account linking rules last year. We've known the cape was a real item the studio had made for a while now, but with the region locking still ongoing, Arrowhead have opted to keep it locked away for months on end.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Taking to <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1383206162622582866">Helldivers 2's Discord server</a> not long after a mass removal of countries from the restricted lists of several PlayStation-affiliated PC games was spotted on June 13th, Jorjani wrote: "It was all our good friends at PlayStation".</p>
<p>He went on to ask players to consider revisiting any negative reviews of the game left solely because of the region locking controversy, writing: "It would be nice if folks would change their review as a result of this. But it’s not a must if you don’t wanna. It’s a point of pride for the team to see their hard work recognized with a higher user review score." Glancing at Steam, it looks like a good number have done just that over the weekend.</p>

<p>Naturally, that got folks wondering whether they might soon be getting the review bomb cape, with Jorjani responding to a question about it: "I’ll talk to the team next week. But we always felt it was something to give away once regions returned. PS has been working hard on this so a cape to celebrate is in order."</p>
<p>So, a garment that features the section of Steam's reviews graph showing just how many folks were taking out their PSN account linking frustrations on Helldivers 2 last May sounds like it could finally be incoming. If you're wondering why this is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1i7s3zc/what_ever_happened_to_the_review_bomb_cape_they/">thing people would want</a>, my best answer is that the Helldivers 2 community loves a good in-joke, so <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1787370710597312605">came up with designs</a> for the cape, then started properly campaigning for it become a real thing once Arrowhead acknowledged these sketches.</p>
<p>If you're curious as to what it'd look like, here's <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1789406952243577164">a teaser</a> Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt tweeted out just over 13 months ago, later confirming that the studio was just waiting for the right time to release it - basically, once the region locking controversy was actually over. Assuming it does finally arrive, it'll definitely be a fitting way to commemorate a long overdue change.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<li>Needed: reader recommendations</li>
</ul></em></p><p>
(Actual announcement post follows.)
</p>
<p>
Hello all! You may have noticed that we’ve stopped doing the weekly Maw liveblogs. Instead, we’ve been doing a round-up of new PC game releases with subheadings and a standard-issue comments thread. 
</p>
<p>
The reasons for this are fairly simple and boring. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/introducing-the-maw-your-weekly-rps-news-liveblog">When I came up with the Maw liveblog concept</a>, I envisaged it as a big old melting pot of open-air news planning tool, forum thread, reader tips thread and scraps drawer. It was quite an open-ended concept, one that sort of needed a whole site built around it, and I’ve struggled to figure out aspects of the execution – for example, how it should work alongside our private Trello board, where we list embargoed stories. 
</p>
<p>
Really, though, the issue here is time and turnover. A lot of people have left RPS in the nearly two years since I joined, which naturally means there’s less scope for anything that isn’t bread-and-butter news, reviews and features. Our current liveblog tech isn’t really suited to my original goals for the Maw – it lacks full comments functionality, for example – and Gamer Network’s hardworking tech team aren’t in a position to make any upgrades anytime soon.
</p>
<p>
The Maw itself will always plague us. Its hunger is, after all, insatiable, and its reach is beyond measure. The world is the Maw and the Maw is the world. The liveblog may yet return, given a change of circumstances. In the meantime, it is my frail hope that our Monday rounds-up articles, newly bolstered by the latest in h2 tags and futuristic comments-threading, will be enough to blunt the creature’s appetite and buy our newswranglers a precious few hours in which to carve some headlines from the firmament. Once more with feeling, FEED THE MAW.

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World / Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f2019168b5632/mario-kart-world-mario-kart-8-deluxe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK Charts are in and, as expected, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has retained its lofty spot at number 1 following the Switch 2's incredibly successful launch. But what ho, what luck, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is also in the top ten at number 6! Nintendo must be proper chuffed at that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, other Switch 2 games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> have all slipped down every so slightly, though hardly cause for alarm. Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</a>, however, has tumbled all the way down to number 21. Perhaps this is the backlash to Game-Key Cards actually coming into effect.</p>
<p>A couple of <strong>Resident Evil</strong> games have also snuck their way back into the top 40, but no, it's sadly not because Switch 2 versions have suddenly become available. We suspect it's a result of the recent announcement of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. That said, we wouldn't say no to Switch 2 versions, eh Capcom. Eh? Eh? Go on.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/mindseye">MindsEye</a> made it to number 4?! People, people, people...</p>
<p>Here's a look at the full top 40 for this week, with platform breakdowns for all of the titles available on other consoles as well as the Switch and Switch 2:</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shogun-total-war">Shogun: Total War</a> is 25 years old this year, and Creative Assembly are holding <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war/blogs/73">a multi-month long celebration</a> kicking off in August with livestreams, interviews, sales, and multiplayer tournaments, all culminating with a showcase in early December. This will be the first showcase of its type they've done, and it's billed to feature announcements for "new games" in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> series. That's more than one, as the discerning pluralisation understanders among you have no doubt sagely clocked.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Whether you’re a fantasy or history fan, there will be plenty to enjoy," writes CA's Roger Collum. "Warhammer 40K and Medieval 3!" The crowds bay in frothing anticipation. "Star Wars and World War 1!", we scream like shrill goats perched on single planks of driftwood floating upon stone-gray oceans, kept from madness only by the knowledge that we can adequately explain what a hammer and anvil maneuver is, in lieu of having formed any meaningful human relationships in a decade.</p>
<p>"Lord Of The Rings and Empire 2!", reads the scrawled note sellotaped to the goat-rescuing submariner's periscope lens, resulting in the tragic water deaths of both the goat and then the entire crew somehow. This madness has gone too far. Please, control yourselves.</p>
<p>For what it's worth: yes, I think at least one of these games is going to be Warhammer 40,000. On to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/future-creative-assembly-games-may-require-blood-thematically-which-sure-sounds-like-a-total-war-warhammer-40000-teaser">hefty pile of circumstantial evidence</a>, you can add the seeming absence of Warhammer 3 game director Rich Aldridge from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-fans-reckon-theyve-already-guessed-which-faction-is-coming-next-in-tides-of-torment">latest Tides Of Torment showcase</a>. This said, it's also equally possible Aldridge is hard at work on the massive End Times expansion I'm sure is coming to Twarhammer sooner rather than later. "Tides of Torment DLC will reveal its final playable faction in July," writes Collum, "and some long-awaited content will be unveiled at the anniversary showcase". As long as I get Thanquol before the trilogy wraps up, I'm a happy little ratman. Well, Thanquol <a href="https://youtu.be/iUwsmt4DlUM">and Toddy</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Such has been the onslaught of livestreams, showcases, reveals, re-reveals, trailers and assorted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pondering-geoffs-orbs">Keighleybollocks</a> this month that we skipped the new game round-up last week. The Maw, thankfully, was too stuffed with Capcom previews to express much discontent, but it could have been disastrous. The last time we forgot to lay out a Monday feeding schedule, the creature ate a bunch of double-A publishers. What, you didn't seriously think THQ went under due to "strong headwinds", did you? But enough lamentation - there are new PC games to discuss.</p>
<h2>Monday 16th June</h2>
<ul>
<li>Are you old enough to remember GEX? My sympathies. There's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gex-trilogy">GEX trilogy</a> remaster out today. If you are not old enough to remember GEX, perhaps you will be more enraptured by cute co-op climbing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>. I also have my eye on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310950/Nightmare_Frontier/">Nightmare Frontier</a>, a sort of weird western XCOM, with the caveat that AI generation tools were used to created some of its menu assets and translate the script.</li>

			<p>Following the latest Xbox announcements and rumors, fans have been worried that Microsoft's next-generation console might be a PC-like device that may not even run prior console games properly. This fear stemmed mainly from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation </a>of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 and the subsequent <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-made-xbox-handheld-reportedly-dead-oem-might-make-next-gen-xbox-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumor</a> from The Verge's Tom Warren that Microsoft might be allowing third-party OEMs like ASUS to create their own version of the next-generation console.</p>
<p>However, Windows Central's Jez Corden has taken it upon himself to reassure gamers that backward compatibility will be retained at a hardware level without even needing emulation. Corden said as much during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x6c-7VRVxw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of the Xbox Two Podcast</a>. Here's the relevant quote:</p>
<p><em>I can pretty much confirm - I'm like maybe two or three sources off writing a report on this, but the next Xbox is like 100% or 99.999% recurring running your console games, because I've seen that fear out there a lot at the moment, where it's like, oh my god, the next Xbox won't run console games. It's only going to be a PC. It's going to be like the ROG Ally. It's going to be made by ASUS, because Tom put in his article something like, "I believe Microsoft will still make their own hardware." I mean, they've said they will. The thing is, Xbox has said a lot of things in the past. When Tom says, "I believe they're going to make it," that exposes an issue with Microsoft's messaging. People don't really trust what they say anymore because they've gone back on their word so many times.</em></p>
<p><em>But, you know, which is again why I've been told by a bunch of people the next Xbox has the silicon for running Xbox One and Series X and 360 games natively. At least what's in the backwards compatibility program. And then everything you own on XB1 and Series X and S, those will all be playable on the next Microsoft Xbox. But I would not be surprised if there is an Asus ROG gaming all-in-one that also is just a PC, like Tom said. And to be fair, Tom was one of the first people, I think, who officially reported on the idea of third-party Xbox hardware. I didn't believe it at the time, but the more I looked into it, I was like, "Oh [ __ ] yeah, he's right." So, shout out to Tom for that.</em></p>
<p>To be fair, there were never any major worries that Microsoft would abandon its Xbox backward compatibility focus. It has been one of the few initiatives that has earned it widespread acclaim throughout the industry and among gamers.</p>
<p>Currently, the next-generation Xbox is expected to be launched in a couple of years. Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> fans the 'largest technological leap' between generations yet, a lofty claim to be sure.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MindsEye Review - MidEye]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mindseye-review-mideye</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mindseye-review-mideye.1219083/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mindseye-review-mideye<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At this point, <em>MindsEye </em>has had one of the most bizarre tales in the industry. Originally announced in 2022 as part of "<em>Everywhere</em>", a make-your-own game-style tool like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dreams-review" rel="nofollow">Dreams</a> </em>or <em>Roblox</em>. It was then reannounced in 2023 as a standalone episodic game where each episode would take place in a different time period and link together to an overarching story. Then, IO Interactive picked it up, and it was reannounced again in 2024, this time as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v" rel="nofollow"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a> styled open world game. That's what it finally launched as. Did all these reworks amount to anything, or is this <em>MindsEye </em>rather mid?</p>



<h2>The Worst First Day Known To Man</h2>

<p>You play as Jacob Diaz, a soldier who has gone through a mysterious traumatic event and is left with an implant that he doesn't know anything about, and most of his memories are missing. He arrives in the city of Redrock and crashes on the couch of his best friend Seb. At the same time, he also gets a security job working for Silva Corp, a company that I'd joke is "Evil Tesla," but Tesla is already Evil Tesla, so I guess it's just... normal Tesla.</p>

<p>During Jacob's first shift, he puts down a robot rebellion, stalks an employee, discovers his implant was made by Silva Corp, and then guns down a bunch of highly trained mercenaries. This starts a rolling mystery where Jacob tries to find out more about his implant, while also getting tangled up in each of these groups.</p>

<p>This may sound interesting, but the sheer amount of plot strings involved in this game means some are going to be left behind. What I didn't expect is that nearly every single one of these threads got abandoned. A former member of Jacob's military unit blackmailing him to commit crimes? Forgotten. The mayor's reelection campaign is based on taking control away from Silva Corp? Who cares. The celebrity who may be manipulating the owner of Silva Corp to steal robots? The owner's personal assistant working for a mysterious person who wants Jacob dead? Literally anything involving Seb after the first couple of missions? All of them were forgotten shortly after they started. It's like playing the first quest in a chain of side quests and then never bothering to revisit them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to take a moment to note that the game has characters that are all clear parodies of Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, and Donald Trump. However, it has nothing to say about any of these people. They're just here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only plot line given any substantial time of day is the robot rebellion one, but there's nothing about it that was really that intriguing. If you've seen any sci-fi game, movie, or book in the last 20 years, then you likely know all of the twists in advance. All <em>MindsEye </em>really has to offer is a chain of cliches, none of which are done well enough to really stand out.</p>



<p><em>MindsEye </em>is also full of bizarre line reads. None of the actors are bad, but there are several times when the tone of the read doesn't fit the situation at all. Its clear lines were edited into the wrong place, or the actors weren't given the right context for the scenes. While chasing a car in a sandstorm, Jacob is told to bring in a hacker alive, and he responds with a "copy that" that sounds like he's in tears that doesn't fit the tone of the dialogue before or after at all. At other times, lines felt chopped up, like at one point when a character responds with "that's [...] news," but if it was good or bad news is unsure because the word in the middle was clearly and poorly cut from the line.</p>

<h2>Never Before Have We Been Asked "What If a Company Was Evil?"</h2>

<p>So if the plot is generic and forgettable, the gameplay shouldn't be, right? Well, bad news there too. <em>MindsEye </em>is one of the most basic third-person shooters I've ever played, and channels all the memories of a generic mid-2000s cover shooter. Not like the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/uncharted-lost-legacy-review-chloe-and-nadines-excellent-adventure" rel="nofollow">Uncharteds</a> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gears-5-review-let-past-die-kill-it-if-you-have-to" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears of Wars</em></a>, which felt good and provided memorable and unique moments. This is closer to something like <em>Damnation</em>, <em>Quantum Theory</em>, or <em>Inversion</em>: forgettable games that brought nothing special to the table, swinging at the king and missing.</p>

<p>The only real attempt to switch up the shooter gameplay comes in the form of your drone. You get it about a quarter of the way into the game, and can either command it to perform actions, or take direct control of it and do these yourself. At first, all you can do is use it as a taser to stun humans and shut off robots. Later, you also gain the ability to hack robots to turn them friendly, and shoot grenades.</p>

<p>The grenade stands out because it's just so much better than anything else you can do that I don't know why you'd use the others once you have it. However, even with all that, none of this makes the drone anything other than a small list of abilities that don't do anything you haven't seen before.</p>

<p>While the majority of gameplay is shooting, you are sometimes pulled away for something else. There are quite a few scenes of watching people slowly walk around and talk through cameras, which isn't much fun. Sometimes you do quick time events to perform CPR or dig a hole. There's a single stealth segment that's so easy there isn't really anything to think about.</p>



<p>Not like you'll be doing much playing. Before and after every gameplay segment you'll often be placed in 10+ minutes of cutscenes. It doesn't help that a lot of these times the gameplay segments are "walk/drive from point A to B." This makes <em>MindsEye</em>'s pace sluggish, with the game really drawing out how long it can take.</p>

<p>Take "Meeting Marco Silva", the game's ninth story mission, for example. First, you take a five-minute drive from a hotel to Silva's company. Then you get a lengthy cutscene where Jacob is interrogated by his boss before she's called and told he needs to go to Silva's house. Another five-minute drive there. Another lengthy cutscene where you meet Silva company owner, Marco Silva. Then another five-minute drive to a party, followed by another lengthy cutscene to meet two more characters. Only after that do you finally get into gameplay.</p>

<p>This can work, lord knows <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-wild-wild-west-part-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a> have similar formats, but it works because the writing and acting in those games are top-notch. <em>MindsEye </em>barely has half the budget or talent, and it shows. The characters are not as well acted or interesting, and having extended cutscenes or driving segments with them is far more painful and boring.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I noticed at one point that any time a vehicle's driver dies, the car will explode no matter what. This can be really hilarious if all it's doing is sitting still or slowly rolling forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn't help that the driving segments usually end their conversations before you get wherever you're going and promptly become filled with generic and repetitive "go faster" and "why aren't we there yet?" barks.</p>

<p>But at least there's the open world, right? if you get bored of those cutscenes and conversations, you can go wander off and do side quests or other activities? Well, there's <em>MindsEye</em>'s secret. Despite looking like an open-world game, and featuring the entirety of the fictional Redrock City, this isn't an open-world game at all. You just move from story mission to story mission, having to drive through the city without interacting with it in any way.</p>

<p>Want to explore? Once you deviate too far from the path to the next mission you get a game over. Don't like your car? Too bad, you can't steal or take any. The game has assigned you a specific vehicle for this mission and that is the vehicle you get. Think you can get assigned a new vehicle? Blowing up your vehicle is almost always a game over, even if you're not near it or don't need it for the mission anymore. You will look at <em>MindsEye</em>'s world, go "shame I can't be there", and then play the game the way it demands you play it.</p>



<p>In total fairness, there is actually a free roam mode that you unlock once you beat the game. When I loaded into it I was assigned the character model of an old man wearing a gas mask, a bra, gym shorts, and with the words "Can't drink dust" painted on his stomach. I could not figure out how to change this character model. I was also assigned a car, much like the campaign, and I could not change it. There's no map, so who knows what's out there in the city. I found a single-checkpoint race, but that was it.</p>

<p>I also had a pre-made house that I could "interact" with stuff in, but that meant playing a canned animation while nothing happened, like a <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>roleplaying experience but without the other players to actually roleplay with.</p>

<p>It's a real shame because I actually would like to look around Redrock City. In one of the few positives I have to say about the game, Redrock itself is quite pretty and well-made. Sure, it's just Las Vegas, but it really nails that entertainment city vibe, with holograms, drone shows, a big sphere, tons of hotels, and more. I want to explore this city, just the game will not let me nor does it have interest in it.</p>

<h2>Nothing, Nowhere, At No Time</h2>

<p>In what feels like a leftover from when <em>MindsEye </em>was part of <em>Everywhere</em>, there is also a system that lets you build out missions and share them with people. In-game this means you sometimes see a portal and, when you go through it, you are automatically loaded into one of the 25 side missions the developer made at launch. Don't want to wait for the portal? Then you can pause the game, hit a button that says "play", and hop into a mission of your choice at any time.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first side mission I got loaded into was set in the past during Jacob's army days. It opened with him giving a monologue declaring that covert ops has changed, before declaring that covert ops never changes. Then it plays sad country music while you shoot people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The end result, however, is a bunch of generic side missions that often have nothing to actually do with the plot of the game and usually can't be more complicated than a checkpoint race or rolling firefight.</p>

<p>It's all the disadvantages of user-made content, such as canned animations, soundtracks that don't fit, and having to stick to some very specific archetypes, without the endless amount of content that actually makes these missions worth it. It's wild that each one is marked with "made by Build a Rocket Boy" like this is a crowning achievement.</p>

<p>This is also assuming the game works. I played <em>MindsEye </em>on a PlayStation 5, and it was constantly struggling to keep up with the game. It seemed like every time a quest took me into the city, the game's framerate would chug. MindsEye also crashed several times during my playthrough, sometimes during cutscenes, sometimes during firefights, and sometimes when I had the game paused while I took notes for this review.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That isn't even getting into some of the weirder glitches I saw. At one point, I had to chase a car, but the car hit a curb and flipped over. It then just sat there for a minute, me hanging around confused, before it just teleported to where I needed to chase it, causing me to fail the mission because I was too far behind. At another point, two cars pulled up full of soldiers that I think were supposed to get out and shoot me. The doors opened, and all eight soldiers dropped dead on the spot, me not having interacted with them in any way.</p>



<p>Over the course of the game, I saw other strange things like random limbs ragdolling on living enemies, my drone not listening to my commands, random vehicles exploding for no reason, and more.</p>

<p>However, I really don't want people to think there's some hidden gem buried under <em>MindsEye </em>that some patches can help unearth. <em>MindsEye </em>is, simply, fundamentally, a poorly designed, boring game. You can't patch it better without at least a year+ of reworks. Everything is fundamentally busted from the ground up, glitches or no.</p>

<h2><em>MindsEye&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>MindsEye </em>is so monumentally bad that I have a lot of questions about&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" rel="nofollow">what happens from here</a>. I can't imagine Build a Rocket Boy continues to exist. It certainly feels like IO Interactive is going to step away from publishing. This is probably the end of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> producer/designer Leslie Benzies' career. I don't see <em>Everywhere </em>coming out after this mess. If nothing else, <em>MindsEye </em>will at least serve for some fantastic behind the scenes stories down the line.</p>

		<p>SNK has announced that first character from Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves first season pass, Andy Bogard, will be available from June 24th. To mark the announcement of Andy Bogard’s release date, a brand new trailer has been released showing him action. He will be available to play as in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Episodes of South Town mode with his own story, along with being available in arcade mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="FATAL FURY: CotW ｜ANDY BOGARD" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ja2ku_BwwU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Andy Bogard is the first character as part of the season pass, with four more characters to come later on. Those characters are Street Fighter’s Ken and Chun Li plus returning Fatal Fury characters Mr Big and Joe Higashi. Now to get these characters, you will have to buy the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Special Edition because the season pass is not available to buy standalone.</p>

<p>In our Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves review, Miguel said, <em>“Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves struggles not only to understand what it wants to be, but which audience it wants to be for. While the game can be a sweat-inducing treat at its highest level of play, casual gamers might not get a lot out of it and the bevy of distracting guest characters and stage song composers in the game make it hard to see the title for its own merits.”</em></p>
