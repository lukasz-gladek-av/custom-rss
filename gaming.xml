In that case, it seems very relevant, in fact. Also odd to call out its “dated references” when I can walk into a Spirit Halloween in 2024 and still find unsold costumes from Marvel and DC movies released a decade ago. </p><p>Maybe <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/rS00xWnqwvI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/rS00xWnqwvI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David S.

However, just like fatalities, it can be a pain to remember their notations when playing online against your friends. We’ve got you covered with a breakdown of every Animality and their correct inputs, to keep by your side.</p><h2 id="h13559"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Perform an Animality</strong></h2><p>Animalities haven’t been seen since the <em>Mortal Kombat 3</em> games, when they were a lot tougher to perform. <strong>Here, they work the same way as fatalities</strong>—you perform a quick series of inputs at the end of the match with the “Finish Them” screen.</p><p>If you need practice, I can confirm that they work in the Fatality Training mode.

In addition, I’ve also listed the animals the fighters turn into and more precise descriptions for correct spacing. Although each one is listed as having a mid-spacing requirement, they’re all far more lenient.<br></p><p>It’s worth noting that this list currently covers characters up to the first half of Kombat Pack 2. The last three in the pack are all guest fighters that we assume will be released individually over time. It stands to reason that they’ll roll out with Animalities, considering the guest fighters from Kombat Pack 1 were updated with these new finishers along with this huge update.</p><p>Ready?

That’s a long time to slowly iterate on a series and its characters, meaning that this prequel, set at the tail end of the 1980s, is informed by a lot of the learnings of that decade. As a result, <em>Yakuza 0 </em>is damn near masterful in its balance of the franchise’s irreverent humor, best-in-class brawler action, and soap-y criminal drama plotlines, and features a bunch of finely tuned side activities that reveal themselves to be full games, such as Majima’s famous cabaret minigame and Kiryu’s foray into real estate management. You turn the money earned via these lucrative detours into skills in <em>Yakuza 0</em>’s progression system, which can be funneled into three different battle styles for each of the game’s playable protagonists: the series’ longtime hero Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima, an equally stalwart rival of his.</p><p>If you ask me, this game really <em>belongs </em>to Majima, who has been a fixture of the series since the beginning, but greatly benefits from the characterization he’s given in <em>Yakuza 0</em>. In the original run of the games, and in particular the initial release of <em>Yakuza</em>, he was a more straightforward and eccentric Joker-like villain who plagued Kiryu before they eventually became allies in their later years. <em>Yakuza 0 </em>fills in the story of how Majima earns his stripes, not to mention his reputation as the Mad Dog of Shimano by the time that the events of the first <em>Yakuza </em>game occur.</p><p>This characterization follows Majima into <em>Yakuza Kiwami</em> and <em>Kiwami 2</em>, remakes of the first two games that followed <em>0 </em>and remix elements of their stories, while fleshing out others that might’ve been underdeveloped in their initial releases. And it is this renewed version of Majima, as well as Kiryu, that I think we’ll see in the Amazon adaptation.</p><p>The show has the benefit of the long series that precedes it, but despite its cast and creators having said that they’re <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-amazon-kiryu-actor-interview-1851592856&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-amazon-kiryu-actor-interview-1851592856">freeing themselves up to do their own thing</a></span>, it’d be a little foolish not to draw from the perspective of this prequel. Kiryu, the main character of the series, is largely portrayed as this stoic outsider in the criminal world who wants out of that lifestyle, but <em>Yakuza 0 </em>goes to agonizing lengths to paint a picture of his hotheaded nature and youthful recklessness, as well as show the circumstances that drew him to the yakuza and maybe even started him on his path to disillusionment. You even get to see Nishiki, his sworn oath brother, and their remarkably close relationship in <em>Yakuza 0 </em>before they are at odds in the first game.</p><p>Considering the fact that the show’s first season is only six episodes long, it’s got a lot of ground to cover, and it makes sense to condense these men’s complicated and storied relationships by pulling from various places. The show seems set to focus on Nishiki and Kiryu’s confrontation in 2005, but I don’t know how well that’ll work without setting up at least <em>some </em>elements of their friendship from <em>Yakuza 0</em>, even if it doesn’t adapt that story wholesale. Majima, who makes a madcap appearance in the show’s trailer saying “Kiryu-chan” in his iconic and deranged manner, benefits so much from the emotional foundation laid out for his character’s arc beginning in <em>Yakuza 0</em>. It’d be much better to play up what a ridiculous character he is if the show also pulls in the backstory that informs that appearance and to not do that would be doing Majima a disservice.</p><p>In order to get the full scope of it though, I’d urge you to just <em>play Yakuza 0</em>. The show looks good, but adaptations always gain and lose things, sometimes in equal measure and other times not. I’m sure that there’s a lot that’ll be left on the cutting room floor, but it’ll be interesting to weigh the trajectory of these characters and the differences once you understand the breadth of their backstory as provided by <em>Yakuza 0</em> while remaining unspoiled for the larger events of the season, which seem to be adapting from <em>Yakuza</em>/<em>Yakuza Kiwami. </em>Realistically, you also <em>only </em> have till the end of the month to catch up on the games before the show premieres, so much as I’d like to recommend just marathoning the series, you’re only going to fit one of these gargantuan games in that time and may as well make it the best and most informative of the bunch. For these, and countless other reasons, you’ve really got to play <em>Yakuza 0</em>, and I mean like right now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, in the wake of <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA announcing that it did not have plans for The Sims 5</a> last month, a new set of screenshots from Project Rene have leaked, and the community is upset over some pretty big presumed changes that have been made since the game's reveal.</p><p>Over the past week, several apparent images from a recent playtest of Project Rene have leaked online, showing off some of the game's new features for the first time. While Project Rene is still in development, quite a few players have taken to the internet to criticize its altered art style, limited scope, and apparent use of microtransactions.</p><p>Several fans have shared comparisons between earlier images of Project Rene and these apparent leaks, with many assuming that the studio must have shifted development plans to make the game more mobile-friendly, in turn downscaling its art style.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i can’t believe my eyes that Project Rene has switched its course from being a promising successor of the Sims 4 to some ugly ass mobile game that will be another cash grab full of ads <a href="https://t.co/55zBbi4vJI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/55zBbi4vJI</a></p>— tom (@simshive) <a href="https://twitter.com/simshive/status/1840433234867359749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>These leaked images also show off its gameplay, which seems to include a to-do list, a chat box, and a small neighborhood to explore. Most notably, the game features the ability to work at a cafe, which has caused players to draw comparisons to The Sims Mobile, EA's 2018 game that also featured a cafe (and stopped receiving new updates earlier this year).</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New images from "Project Rene" (which is NOT The Sims 5) <a href="https://t.co/hSkPSkokuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/hSkPSkokuk</a></p>— The Sims Nostalgia (@Sims_Nostalgia) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sims_Nostalgia/status/1840459070676836741?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Quite a few players have also noticed that the apparently leaked images feature a mobile-style coin tab. These coins are apparently rewards from completing quests and can be used to purchase new outfits. However, because of the game's mobile format, quite a few players have assumed that the game will feature microtransactions.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Like Life Sim (@LikeLifeSim) <a href="https://twitter.com/LikeLifeSim/status/1840306151251959881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Y’all have to understand.

                <p>Microsoft is discontinuing its consumer HoloLens headset program, marking a major change for the company. After all, CEO Satya Nadella said in 2016 that HoloLens would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-games-and-hololens-are-key-for-microsofts/1100-6428459/" data-ref-id="1100-6428459">"key" to Microsoft's growth in the future</a>. That didn't end up coming to fruition, though, and the HoloLens program is winding down--at least for consumers. Microsoft will continue to work with the US Army to make a version of the headset for soldiers.</p><p>Microsoft confirmed to <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/microsoft-discontinuing-hololens-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UploadVR</a> that HoloLens 2 production has ended. Updates for "critical security issues and software regressions" will run through the end of 2027. But software support for HoloLens 2 will come to an end in 2028.</p>

<p>The original HoloLens headset that debuted in 2017 will have its own software support end after December 10, 2024. Production on this device was halted in 2018.</p><p>Microsoft is ending the consumer HoloLens program but is staying in business with the United States military to create a custom version of the headset for soldiers. The US Army will run an operational test in 2025 to determine if it will go ahead with full-scale production. A Microsoft spokesperson told UploadVR that Microsoft continues to be "fully committed" to working with the US Army on this initiative.</p><p>The headsets are known as Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), and are an evolution of the company's HoloLens product. In total, the Army has said it will spend <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than $20 billion</a> over a decade on research and development of the new soldier technology with Microsoft.</p><p>HoloLens was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-halo-and-hololens-merged-at-e3-2015-magic-hap/1100-6428288/" data-ref-id="1100-6428288">highly touted as a potential game-changing consumer product</a> when it was announced in 2015. Prior to the announcement of the HoloLens consumer product discontinuation, Microsoft's recent mass layoffs affected the HoloLens team.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/">Patch 7</a> has been one of the most monumental patches in Baldur's Gate 3, as it opened up the official modding toolkit for the players and added a revamped split-screen mode and more evil endings for players to explore. As of today, Patch 7 is now available for those on Mac and console. The update is pretty massive, as it adds new Evil endings, a revamped split screen, and a selection of in-game mods that members of the BG3 community built. This is a huge occasion for gamers on consoles, as it's not often that games on consoles are given the possibility to mod their games, even if it is a chosen selection.</p>
<p>Over 15 million mods have already been downloaded for Baldur's Gate 3 using Larian Studios' official toolkit. While the update has been available on PC for some time, they have quickly got the update out for Mac and console players, where players will now be able to experience new Evil endings and cinematics, as well as unique endings if you are playing as an Origin Character.</p>
<p>The official Baldur's Gate 3 Toolkit allows anyone and everyone to make mods as long as they're doing so on PC and can upload them to the official mod manager, making it an accessible way to get into the world of modding. So far, people have found a way to 'unlock' the toolkit, and are using it to make <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-real-time-combat-mod-now-allows-party-to-get-involved/">real-time combat mods</a> as well as new areas to explore, such <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-modder-creates-custom-maps-including-avernus/">as Avernus</a>. Unfortunately, these mods are unlikely ever to be able to be put on consoles as they aren't within the realms of the official toolkit.</p>
<p><iframe title="5 Mods To Start Your Baldur's Gate 3 Journey" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DQYMwztczUs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/patch-7-now-live_121?mc_cid=19af5d5b5f&amp;mc_eid=22f0f6c8d6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new patch</a> provides a more dynamic split screen option that is available for those who are playing the game via couch co-op. When you play on split screen and you are near the other party member, the screen will then merge into one, to provide a more seamless experience for those who are playing together in person.</p>
<p>There are plenty of different types of mods to play with, with some of them being as simple as changing a character's race or class, as well as a personalized UI, depending on what you prefer to play with. The patch also adds quality live improvements to the writing and animations. Honour Mode has also received a few changes, adding Legendary Actions to some of the most powerful foes you'll come across.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/last-ballad-of-damrod-jens-kidman-rings-of-power-lotr-1851662319<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Occasionally a TV show surprises you with something so unexpected you can’t stop thinking about it for hours, days, even weeks after an episode airs. The latest episode of <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em> did just that, offering up a moment that immediately etched itself onto my brain and has remained there for nearly a week. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-season-two-op-1851634812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-season-two-op-1851634812">Season two of the Amazon Prime series</a></span> is a marked improvement from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-rings-of-power-season-1-recap-1851630074&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-rings-of-power-season-1-recap-1851630074">the first season</a></span>, with tighter storylines and elevated stakes—though it still meanders a bit too much for my liking, it’s been a thoroughly enjoyable series to catch every week. But nothing thus far has stuck with me like the end credits song from the season’s penultimate seventh episode, titled “Doomed to Die.”<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re someone who immediately shuts a show off as soon as the credits start to roll, you may have missed this. After Adar snatches Galadriel’s ring from Elrond, the screen snaps to black and intense drums ring out. Before you even have a chance to read the first credit, a throaty, intense metal voice starts chanting. Yes, a metal song is playing in a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> television show, and it’s fucking awesome.<br></p><p>Called “The Last Ballad of Damrod,” the song was written by series composer Bear McCreary (the same man behind the music in the <em>God of War</em> reboot series), and sung by legendary musician Jens Kidman. Kidman is the frontman for and one of the founders of Meshuggah, a Swedish extreme metal band that is widely considered one of the best modern metal bands of all time. </p><p>The song is named after and tells the story of the troll Damrod, who joins Adar’s forces for the Siege of Eregion and wipes the floor with the city and many elves defending it until Elrdon, Arondir, and Gil-galad step in and kil the guy. Naturally, this ass-kicking troll (who apparently eats dragon bones) would be the perfect subject for a heavy metal song. I mean, check out these batshit lyrics:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>In humid mold, troll sits alone</p><p>No friend or kin to call his own</p><p>Troll gnaws on skins, raw shanks and shins</p><p>Rips meat from reeking dragon bone</p><p>With laughter deep and throaty groan</p><p>He rises from his seat of stone</p><p>From darkened cave, a bloodlust crave</p><p>Set loose upon the hills to roam</p></blockquote><p>I’ve had “The Last Ballad of Damrod” on repeat since episode 7 aired last week. It was such a lovely surprise, such an unexpected thing to hear at the end of a <em>Rings of Power</em> episode—but also something that just <em>works</em>. The relationship between high fantasy and metal music is a lengthy one, so McCreary’s choice to write such a badass song and enlist a legend of the genre to sing it is so brilliantly inspired. I’m pretty sure I PRed nearly all my lifts at the gym today while blasting this through my headphones.<br></p><p><em>The Rings of Power</em> season 2 finale drops this Thursday, October 3 on Amazon Prime. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Epic Games is investing $1.5 billion into Epic Games to create what sounds like a Disney metaverse within Fortnite, and now one of Disney's top bosses has shared a few more details on the company's plans.</p><p>Disney boss Josh D'Amaro--who is among the candidates to become Disney's new CEO after Bob Iger leaves--told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/disney-josh-damaro-parks-experiences-1236017394/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a> that Disney is planning to work with Epic to create "a place where you can play games, a place where you can be social, a place where users can generate their own content."</p><p>Essentially, D'Amaro said Disney's aim to create an entire "universe" where "all our stories can come to life."</p><p>"They can come to life in different forms, [like] games. They can come to life in ways that you can just interact with and play with the franchise in a way that's meaningful to you, a place where you can actually build," he said. "And we think that this is going to be a place where all fans can come and interact 365 days a year."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2bRcSIUsE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Yf2bRcSIUsE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>At D23, D'Amaro said Walt Disney himself was an "adventurer" and a "risk-taker," going on to say what Disney is now trying to achieve through Fortnite is an extension of that spirit.</p><p>"We should never rest on past success. We should always look for the next big idea, the next big challenge," he said. "If we'd always relied on what worked in the past, the Walt Disney Company might not exist today. As consumer preferences continue to shift, we have to adapt, or we are going to be left behind."</p><p>Characters and content from Disney's Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Avatar brands, among others, will be represented in Fortnite. Disney and Epic have yet to officially unveil any specific projects in Fortnite tied to Disney, but many are hoping to see some kind of "virtual Disney World."</p><p>Fortnite, of course, is no longer just one game--instead, it's more akin to a platform these days. In addition to the main battle royale game, Fortnite hosts games like Rocket Racing, Fortnite Festival, and Lego Fortnite, along with countless other user-created games and experiences on the platform. Whatever Epic and Disney might be cooking up could be just the latest game to exist on the Fortnite platform.</p><p>While fans have to wait a bit longer for this to materialize, Pixar characters Mr. Incredible, Elastagirl, and Frozone are now available inside Fortnite. Some Disney villains, including Maleficent and Cruella de Vil are coming to Fortnite this Fall.</p><p>Whereas Disney used to develop games in-house via its own Disney Interactive Studios, the company subsequently shut this down and instead works with outside teams as part of licensing arrangements.</p><p>One of the next licensed Disney games in the works from an outside studio is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle from Microsoft. Not every Disney game succeeds, though, as Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">Star Wars Outlaws failed to sell up to expectations</a>, though Ubisoft isn't giving up just yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/yoshi-p-says-xbox-players-should-not-give-up-hope-of-final-fantasy-xvi/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just over a year ago, PlayStation owners saw the release of Final Fantasy XVI, a game that was originally meant to be released on PC alongside PlayStation 5. However, that didn't happen, and the game was only just released for PC last month. Although the game has received great ratings from the player base, the game still didn't perform how Square Enix was hoping, with multiple new titles being released this year, and profits did not meet their expectations. However, in an interview, Yoshi-P said that Xbox players should not give up hope of Final Fantasy XVI.</p>
<p>After the release of Final Fantasy XVI, Square Enix also <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvii-nothing-decided/">announced</a> that they were moving away from making exclusive games and were going to begin selling them in multi-formats. Even the release of Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth weren't going how Square Enix expected, and sales are just not hitting the mark via exclusives, and now they're branching out.</p>
<p>PC players have seen the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Crisis Core, and Final Fantasy XVI. This likely means Rebirth will also be ported to PC at some point. However, none of these games are currently available on Xbox. Square Enix seniors have started to hint that Final Fantasy XVI may be coming to Xbox in the near future, with Naoki "Yoshi-P" Yoshida, Producer of Final Fantasy XIV and Game Director of Final Fantasy XVI, giving a message to those who own an Xbox in an <a href="https://www.si.com/videogames/features/final-fantasy-14-naoki-yoshida-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with Video Games</a>.</p>
<p>"Of course, we did announce the PC version of the game, so looking towards the Xbox version, we do want to release it on Xbox. But when it comes to the specifics, such as when the game would be available, we are not in a position to be able to share anything. But of course, I want to say that it's not as if there's zero hope, and we very much do want to achieve that. So players should not give up in terms of their hopes."</p>
<p>At the moment, it's not been specified how long Sony has console exclusivity on Final Fantasy XVI, but it's possible that it's around the end of the year. This is typically the term for exclusive PlayStation games, with Silent Hill 2's remake being a console exclusive for a year. Once it's out of the exclusivity period, it's all about how long the port takes to make for other consoles and whether they're allowed to work on it during the exclusivity period.</p>

So it’s definitely one of the heftiest updates <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s got since it launched in August of last year.</p><p>This isn’t the final patch, however. Larian says it still plans to add crossplay support for cooperative campaigns and a photo mode sometime down the line. I’m still waiting on the latter before I jump back in. Given that both <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>and <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> are coming out over the next month, though, Larian can take their time.

Please bear in mind some of the entries below might contain spoilers, proceed at your own risk</strong></p><h2 id="h12249"><a id=""></a><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Introducing ‘Evil Endings’: Brand new cinematic endings for the truly villainous playthroughs.</li><li>Added our very own Mod Manager, which lets you browse, install, and use mods created by the community.</li><li>Revamped split screen gameplay: When playing on split screen, the two halves of the screen will now dynamically merge together when player characters come close to each other in-game, and dynamically split back up when the characters move apart. This revamp comes alongside many other improvements and polishes to improve the overall split screen experience.</li></ul><h3 id="h12250"><a id=""></a><strong>Honour Mode Combat</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>If Dror Ragzlin finds himself inside the spider pit, he’ll try his best to befriend the spiders residing there with a new spell called Arachnid Compulsion so they can band together to fight the real enemy - you.</li><li>The Bulette has a new condition called Diamond Scales and a new Legendary Action called Shredding Scales.</li><li>Malus Thorm has a new Legendary Action called Grasping Appendage.</li><li>Added a new aura and spell for Spectators: Panicked Sentinel and Ocular Nightmare, respectively.</li><li>Ch’r’ai Tska’an, the leader of the githyanki ambush in Act II, has a new Legendary Action called Soul Sacrifice.</li><li>Ch’r’ai Har’rak, the githyanki leader at the Knights of the Shield Hideout, has a new Legendary Action called Tu’narath’s Embrace.</li><li>Ptaris has a new Legendary Action called Ptarian Dogma.</li></ul><h3 id="h12251"><a id=""></a><strong>UI</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Revised and reorganised the in-game video options to be more logical and robust. You now have an Upscaling Type drop-down, an Upscaling Mode drop-down, and an Upscaling Sharpness slider, followed immediately by the options that are affected by them.</li><li>Updated the Reactions UI so that you only have to toggle the Reactions you want to use and then confirm them. (This saves you from having to select ‘Do not react’ multiple times!)</li><li>Added a new Equipment Options menu to the Character Sheet on controller.</li><li>The panel that opens to ‘Donate’ magic items to Gale will now also show items in your Traveller’s Chest. It also now indicates which items are currently equipped.</li><li>We noticed some of you hiccoughing bubbles, so the action for washing yourself with soap and sponges is now called ‘Use’ instead of ‘Consume’.</li><li>Fixed your player character’s name getting reverted to ‘Custom’ during Character Creation if you moved on to create your Dream Guardian and then went back to edit the player character again.</li><li>Fixed the wrong spell Ability showing up when selecting a Feat during Level Up.</li></ul><h3 id="h12252"><a id=""></a><strong>Art</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Added a new loading screen in Act III, showing the busy streets of Baldur’s Gate.</li><li>Fixed the skirt part of the Adamantine Splint Armour missing for female dwarves.</li><li>Fixed the Adamantine Scale Mail clipping on large male characters.</li></ul><h3 id="h12253"><a id=""></a><strong>Gameplay</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>You can now start Custom Mode games using Honour Mode mechanics when starting a new playthrough. You’ll be able to do this via the ‘Ruleset’ dropdown.</li><li>The kuo-toa that promised to build you an army will now support you in the final battle. Unless they all died in Act I.</li><li>The help that the Gondians promised for the final battle will now arrive in the form of a friendly Steel Watcher. Apologies from Zanner Toobin for the delay.</li><li>The hair colour options in Character Creation will now remain accessible after you choose the bald hairstyle, so that you can continue fiddling around with eyebrow colours.</li><li>Overhead dialogues that support multiple player characters can now involve characters assigned to different players. (They were limited to characters controlled by a single player until now.) This means that there will be more banter among player characters in multiplayer games.</li><li>Group Hide will no longer affect summons that aren’t linked to the group in the Party Line.</li><li>Changed the behaviour for selecting camp supplies for a Long Rest. When selecting camp supplies that are stacked, the game now only takes what it needs from the stack.</li><li>You can no longer cheese the Leap of Faith trial at the Gauntlet of Shar by just clicking the final platform and letting your character pathfind their way there. Shar threatened to smite us if we didn’t fix this one.</li><li>Fixed a bug where resurrecting Lae’zel on the beach in Act I would cause her to appear in the Party Line but not in the world, preventing you from leaving Act I.</li><li>Patched up some savegames where Gale still had his Necrotic Aura when he shouldn’t on load.</li><li>Fixed Minthara’s body sometimes turning invisible on the Level Up screen.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-season-5-end-and-season-6-start-in-diablo-4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Like many, I’m still actively playing Diablo 4. It’s easily one of my favorite games currently—the ARPG experience you can jump into for an hour or two each night and still make significant progress playing through Helltides and Infernal Hordes. But the current season is coming to an end; a new one will begin, and it all coincides with the launch of the game’s first expansion, Vessel of Hatred. Here is when Season 5 ends and Diablo 4 Season 6 starts!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-diablo-4-season-5-end">When Does Diablo 4 Season 5 End?</h2>



<p>If you’re still actively working on leveling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-season-5-class-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your latest Whirlwind Barbarian in Season 5</a>, you might want to pick up the pace a little. Season 5 of Diablo 4 ends on October 8th, approximately one hour before the launch of the next season.</p>



<p>The current season, Season of the Infernal Hordes, offered a unique gameplay mechanic in which players defend against hordes of demons, with rogue-like buffs and debuffs altering the experience as you progress until you complete the final boss room and reap the rewards. It was an excellent way to level and gear up an end-game character quickly. </p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-diablo-4-season-6-start">When Does Diablo 4 Season 6 Start?</h2>



<p>The Diablo 4 Season 6 start date is <strong>October 8th</strong>, at approximately 10-11 am PST, though the time may vary depending on Blizzard and the game’s server stability. </p>



<p>Season 6 coincides with the launch of Vessel of Hatred, the game’s first major expansion, which includes a brand-new class, the Spiritborne, an entirely new region to explore, and new gameplay mechanics. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the level squish is one of the most significant changes for this season. As in World of Warcraft, Blizzard drops the max level in Diablo 4 from 100 to 50, then adds 10 levels for a max of 60 in the expansion. Alongside the level squish, item levels and power will drop to coincide with this change. </p>



<p>What do you think of the level squish? How about the new Spiritborne class? Let us know in the comments below, or visit our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a> to discuss the game and find a dungeon party!</p>



<hr>



<p>At Gamescom earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mercenaries-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-gamescom-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard unveiled a brand-new trailer detailing how the Mercenaries work</a> in Vessel of Hatred. It’s well worth a look if you’re a fan of the game!</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo has taken action against YouTube channels showcasing its games running on emulators, issuing copyright strikes against creators such as Retro Game Corps, which reviews devices capable of emulating classic consoles like the NES and Wii U. <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/10/nintendo-is-now-going-after-youtube-accounts-which-show-its-games-being-emulated" rel="nofollow ">Time Extension</a> was first to report.</p><p dir="ltr">Russ, the host of Retro Game Corps, shared on social media, "I hate making posts like this, but I received another copyright strike this morning. I'm going to have to change the way I make videos." He revealed that a recent video demonstrating a Wii U emulator was removed at Nintendo's request.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoZQiN0o7f36H7PaW4fVhFw/community?lb=UgkxqDniEBASvWOChP2-WYysGcwkCDwSMD9k">YouTube</a> statement, Russ expressed concern about being specifically targeted by Nintendo. "It does appear that my worst fears are true," he said. Russ added he is considering a counterclaim under fair use, arguing that his video was educational and did not impact the market for the original game. However, he remains hesitant to pursue legal action against a large corporation and plans to exclude Nintendo games from future content, saying, "I love using those games for my hardware demonstrations."</p><p>In another development, Nintendo in September <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/">filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair</a>, the developer of Palworld, alleging violations of multiple patent rights. The lawsuit, filed in the Tokyo District Court, seeks an injunction and compensation for damages. Despite these legal challenges, Palworld has achieved immense success, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-launching-on-ps5-today-despite-nintendo-lawsuit/1100-6526675/">recently launching on PlayStation 5</a> after selling over 12 million copies on Steam.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Young Fortnite players might have to take the L to a time limit going forward, should their parents or guardians so choose. That's because Epic Games has added two new parental controls to the game: time limit and time report.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/introducing-time-limit-controls-and-time-reports-for-fortnite-and-uefn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">These new options</a> allow parents and guardians to set daily restrictions on time spent in Fortnite for their children. Additionally, Epic now lets you select only certain time windows for kids to battle it out on the island. For instance, maybe you only want your little one dancing as Mr. Incredible between 3-5 PM during weekdays. That's possible now.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="149533963" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"
