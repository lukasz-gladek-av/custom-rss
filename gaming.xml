You can also use it with a bunch of different third-party controllers; we highlighted some notable gamepads we've tested with the case at the bottom of this story.</p><div title="[Various] Nintendo Switch Pro Controller Zelda Carrying Case" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3925" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Nintendo Switch Pro Controller Zelda Carrying Case" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Case-Zelda-Controller-nintendo-switch/dp/B0C6YGHCBS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Gaming-Case-Zelda-Controller-nintendo-switch\/dp\/B0C6YGHCBS?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Case-Zelda-Controller-nintendo-switch/dp/B0C6YGHCBS?tag=gamespot-promos-20">RDS Game Traveler Deluxe Switch Pro Controller Case (Zelda)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Case-Zelda-Controller-nintendo-switch/dp/B0C6YGHCBS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Gaming-Case-Zelda-Controller-nintendo-switch\/dp\/B0C6YGHCBS?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Case-Zelda-Controller-nintendo-switch/dp/B0C6YGHCBS?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$20 | Compatible with Switch 2 Pro Controller</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Zelda branding on this case is subtle enough that Switch users who don't even like the series would probably be fine with it. A round metal emblem with the game's logo is affixed on the center of the top cover. It also has a gold zipper pull with the Tears of the Kingdom logo. The promotional images don't do a great job of displaying the colors. After receiving the case recently, I can confirm that it's forest green, similar to Link's iconic tunic.</p><p>The case was designed for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Switch Pro Controller</a> and Joy-Cons with a grip attached.

The elastic band that secures the controller in place opens the door for a wide array of third-party controllers.</p><p>The case also has slots for two Joy-Con below the Pro Controller. This slot only supports original Switch Joy-Con, as the Switch 2 Joy-Con are too large.</p><p>An open mesh compartment can be used to store small accessories such as charging cables and Joy-Con straps.</p></div>                      </div><h2>Switch Pro Controllers &amp; Joy-Con</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4534616-switch2procontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534616" data-ratio="0.36666666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4534616-switch2procontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534616"></a><figcaption>Switch 2 Pro Controller | Switch Pro Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4534616-switch2procontroller.png"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-2-Pro-Controller-Switch/dp/B0F3VTFD6J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> -- $84</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</a> -- $69</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-14-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09Z1KQLW2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2 Joy-Con 2-Pack</a> -- $94</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-16-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09Z1FRQ3J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip</a> -- $40</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Joy-ConTM-L-R-Pastel-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CT3TZC8Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch Joy-Con 2-Pack</a> -- $80</li></ul><hr><h3>The Legend of Zelda Controllers</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4534623-switchzeldacontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534623" data-ratio="0.55" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4534623-switchzeldacontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534623"></a><figcaption>PowerA Wireless Controller - The Legend of Zelda: Sword Protector</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4534623-switchzeldacontroller.png"></figure><p>If you want a Zelda-themed controller for your Tears of the Kingdom carrying case, there are a few third-party options from PowerA and Hori that will work with the case. Unfortunately, the official Tears of the Kingdom-themed Pro Controller is long gone--at least for its original $75 price.

Both models will work with the Switch 2 Pro Controller, but it's worth noting that these cases don't recessed inserts or elastic straps, so your controller will rattle around a bit. Both cases have mesh compartments for small accessories.</p><p>Heads up: Amazon does have a pretty great deal on the original <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller bundled with the $20 carrying case</a> that drops the price to only $45.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0FB8WGG6L,B0F53LPKPW,B0F5361M91,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2,B0FB93DLMM&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller</a> -- $63 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Controller + Travel Case</a> -- $45 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BZ3HX62N,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFH12YYX&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a> -- $46.79 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DNK1Q81N,B0DP4T2JNC,B0DM1WH5BV,B0CMX9BXK2,B0DM18Q2M1,B0CMX7L1LM&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate 2C Bluetooth Controller</a> -- $30</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CSPH1JYV,B0CSPGMGBT,B0D9M2J4Y3,B0D9M2MN12,B0BFGSNLTM,B0CSPHXJYM,B085STR9R3,B093B9F9HW,B0CX5193MN,B0CX56QNF4,B0CX4QX8RM&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Pro 2 Bluetooth Controller</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FFGQ6J35,B0FFGJ3TWP,B0FFGRQ6XY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Pro 3 Bluetooth Gamepad</a> -- $70 | Releases August 12</li></ul><hr><h3>8BitDo and Scuf Controller Carrying Cases</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4534622-scufcontrollercase.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534622" data-ratio="0.55" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4534622-scufcontrollercase.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534622"></a><figcaption>Scuf Universal Controller Protection Case</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4534622-scufcontrollercase.png"></figure><p>In addition to the pair of 8BitDo controller cases, another popular option is <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HN1N5W6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scuf's Universal Controller Protection Case</a></strong> for $15.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/">FBC: Firebreak</a> is the first stab at making a multiplayer game that Remedy Entertainment has taken, so it's not the biggest surprise that things haven't been smooth sailing from the jump. In its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536607976683733002">latest blog post on the game's Steam page</a>, Remedy acknowledged the issues players are having with the game, including the fact that its opening hours can be fairly frustrating.</p>



<p>Remedy also confirmed that its first major update, which it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-details-two-major-updates-coming-in-fbc-firebreaks-post-launch-roadmap/">previously set to arrive sometime in Fall 2025,</a> will launch this coming September, though it didn't provide a specific date.</p>



<p>"<em>The weeks since launch have given us a huge amount of feedback, from you, the community, as well as reviews, and the data we are looking at</em>," the post reads<em>. "We've seen many players come into the game and leave within the first hour. And that's because our first hour can be frustrating; you feel ineffective and confused as to what to do. This needs to be improved."</em></p>



<p>"<em>For many of you already playing FBC: Firebreak, us focusing on the opening experience may seem less exciting, but to keep the game healthy (and your matchmaking fast), we need to bring in more people with a better first-time experience than before.</em>"</p>



<p>Remedy goes on to say that it will introduce more narrative onboarding for players who are hungry for more information about the world in which FBC: Firebreak exists, the same world as Control and Control 2, the latter of which is arguably the game that players are most excited to see from Remedy. It also says that it intends to improve the "<em>pop-up tips you receive while playing by offering important information at relevant times</em>."</p>



<p>The studio also confirms that it will be adding three new heavy guns to the game as part of its efforts to change how weak the gunplay can feel off the top. It also plans "<em>to drop all 'generic' upgrades from equipment (guns and tools) and start players with a playable and powerful version of everything a Firebreak needs from the beginning</em>."</p>



<p>Remedy is working on a Mod system to replace those more "<em>generic</em>" upgrades which the studio says will let you tweak weapons and how they become more powerful over time based on how you want to play. More about this new system will be revealed with the update in September.</p>



<p>Remedy will also be making "<em>big changes</em>" to Jobs and their content, starting with the Clearance and the Corruption levels being replaced by "<em>pre-made, exciting (you'll have to take our word for that for now) variations of Job experiences that can still be short or long or filled with Corrupted items, but also a whole lot more</em>."</p>



<p>It will also introduce a new Job with the September update, and the team is also currently looking at ways in which it can create more variety in the things to do in FBC: Firebreak, and to add more to the game.</p>



<p>"<em>We are pushing a lot of improvements and changes into the game for our first major update. Some of these ideas were improvements we weren't able to add before launch, but all were decided on and developed based on what we heard from you (listening to feedback) and seen from you (looking at data). We are extremely excited about these changes and about delivering even more than we'd originally been planning, but changes now also mean changes later. We need to see what's working for you and to hear from you again before we can be certain that we're prioritizing the right things</em>."</p>



<p>Last month, The Game Business reported that Ampere Analysis claimed Firebreak had only <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-reportedly-has-just-under-250k-players-while-junes-other-major-releases-like-fbc-firebreak-dune-awakening-and-rematch-all-exceed-1m/">managed 1.3 million</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-reportedly-has-just-under-250k-players-while-junes-other-major-releases-like-fbc-firebreak-dune-awakening-and-rematch-all-exceed-1m/">players</a> in its opening week, and while that's not exactly anything to scoff at, it's below what a modern multiplayer game needs to survive. There's also the fact that, because Firebreak is available on Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus Extra, the player count absolutely does not equal copies sold.</p>



<p>FBC: Firebreak might not be going as well as Remedy would have hoped in its opening month, but it's clear that the studio is trying to be transparent with its community and fix elements of the game that it and its community have identified as weak. If it can successfully listen to its community, then Remedy has more than a good shot at making FBC: Firebreak a very successful multiplayer game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Corvus Belli’s recent Fantasy skirmish wargame, <i>Warcrow</i>, released last year with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warcrow-winds-from-north-review" rel="nofollow"><i>Winds of the North starter set</i></a> and followed up with a few <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warcrow-syenann-action-pack-review" rel="nofollow">additional lines of forces</a>, but overall it hasn’t felt like the game truly received the introduction into the world it deserved… until now!</p>

<p>Corvus Belli just sent us an early copy of the newest release, <i>Warcrow</i> Song of the Dormant, and we’re digging in to check it out, see what’s included, and dive into how it plays.</p>

<h2>What’s Included in <i>Warcrow </i>Song of the Dormant?</h2>

<p>The new Battle Pack boxed set includes everything two players need to jump into the game, as it pits the forces of Feudom against the Scions of Yaldabaoth (more on both of these forces shortly). Included in the box set is:</p>

<ul><li>Beginner Rule &amp; Scenario Booklet</li>
	<li>Dice</li>
	<li>Range Rulers</li>
	<li>Cardboard Terrain</li>
	<li>14 miniatures Consisting of:</li>
	<li>1x Verena of Aurtigard</li>
	<li>1x Morgane of JauCret Syzigian</li>
	<li>1x Knight of the Sacred Relic</li>
	<li>4x Feudom Guisarmiers</li>
	<li>1x Uruk, He Who is Without Prejudice</li>
	<li>1x Needle</li>
	<li>1x Breath</li>
	<li>4x Intact</li>
</ul><h2>Who are the Feudom and the Scions?</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-knight-vs-needle.jpg?itok=7tscaUqH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-knight-vs-needle.jpg?itok=QuD3JBOi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Perhaps the most exciting element of the new <i>Warcrow</i> Song of the Dormant Battle Pack is the inclusion of two new factions to the game: Feudom and Scions of Yaldabaoth. But who are they, and what do they fight for?</p>

<p>The Feudom are your very classic holy warriors in a lot of ways. They seem organized (based on the bit of lore included in the instruction booklet) around a series of different realms and leaders, and rely on their faith to grant them strength and power.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-verena.jpeg?itok=WEKsxwXE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-verena.jpeg?itok=tkohYnzj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Verena of Aurtigard leads the Feudom Faction</figcaption></figure><p>Verena of Autrigard, a gorgeous looking miniature, is the High Priestess of this little fighting force, and leans on her imposing presence and connection to her faith to rain down holy punishment on her foes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a culture that relies on the populace to maintain safety and order - in more ways than one, as the rulebook references the toll that heavy taxation in the Feudom has on the everyday person.</p>

<p>But who are they fighting against? Who is it that crawls out of the fog? Meet the Scions of Yaldabaoth, “Dark Minded” elves who have embraced the corruption of magic, all for the pursuit of knowledge, power, and advancement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-uruk.jpeg?itok=eUuTLTDB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-uruk.jpeg?itok=gSGdshYE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Master Uruk brings forth his forces from the Fog</figcaption></figure><p>They’re unafraid of change, going so far as to augment their bodies! Uruk, He Who Is Without Prejudice is the leader of this fighting force, and his body is so twisted and honed to be a killing machine that he looks unlike anything else on the battlefield.</p>

<p>One thing I love about these miniatures, and which goes a long way toward describing the whole ethos of the Scions, is the description of the Intact. The Intact are described as not yet changing their bodies with transformations, and being so shamed by that fact that they cover their bodies in the bones, skin, and limbs of others!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-guisarmers.jpeg?itok=WNE24tn8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-guisarmers.jpeg?itok=U1ieVYZK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I’ve said from the beginning that, even when the rules could feel a little intimidating at times (not a problem with this new set, as we’ll soon see), the world building is top-notch!</p>

<h2>The Learn-To-Play Experience in <em>Warcrow</em> Song of the Dormant</h2>

<p>The Learn-To-Play experience in <i>Warcrow</i> Song of the Dormant takes big leaps forward for the game, and this feels like a true introduction to the game. The booklet begins with lore for each of the two factions, and then we get right into playing the game.</p>

<p>Assuming you’ve already assembled the miniatures (they’re very easy to assemble, without instructions because it’s mostly intuitive), the tutorial game walks you through every step.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-rulebook.jpeg?itok=FApaebGc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-rulebook.jpeg?itok=XgmNZ3Zf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The rulebook walks you through every step of learning the basics of the game</figcaption></figure><p>You don’t even roll the dice, instead, the booklet tells you what the roll result should be at every point to show you how the game flows. Once you make it through that beginning tutorial, there’s a QR code to scan to get the full rules, but you’ll have most of what you need to keep going!</p>

<p>And from this point on in the booklet, you’ll see a truly well-thought out mini campaign for the two forces as they face off against each other.</p>

<p>There’s lore describing the setting and the stakes involved, and then we crack off into three mounting scenarios, with mission briefings for each side of the battle.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-intact.jpeg?itok=dPsZ3xez 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-song-of-the-dormant-intact.jpeg?itok=esJVbQNS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Warcrow Song of the Dormant - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This new Battle Pack is so well-presented, clear, and easy to understand - and the translation into English is the cleanest we’ve seen. I really like the look of all the miniatures in the box, and the inclusion of cardboard terrain is a nice touch.</p>

<p>All in all, this really feels like the introduction that <i>Warcrow</i> deserves, and I believe the game is ready to hit the big-time. If you’ve been curious about <i>Warcrow</i> but haven’t seen a clear path into the game yet, this is the product you should be reaching for - and it should be hitting stockists in late August.</p>

I wasn't planning on picking up the new Nintendo console off the bat, but the incredible reviews of Donkey Kong Bananza convinced me to cave and buy one much earlier than I'd expected. IGN gave the game a rare <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">10 out of 10 review</a> and people are already talking about how it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-game-of-the-year-2025-donkey-kong-bananza-clair-obscur-expedition-33-death-stranding-2">giving GOTY vibes</a> barely a week after release.

To help promote <em>Off The Grid’s</em> Steam launch, sites like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/polygon-valnet-off-the-grid-gunzilla-rip-this-sucks&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-valnet-off-the-grid-gunzilla-rip-this-sucks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon, IGN,</em> and even <em>Kotaku </em>itself</a></span> ran sponsored posts about the game. These posts championed its frequent updates, “strong following,” and heavily mentioned that <em>District 9 </em>director Neill Blomkamp helped create<em> Off The Grid’</em>s world. So, I decided to finally check out <em>OTG</em>, as the kids call it, and see what this game is all about! </p><p>After an admittedly well-produced intro video, I was introduced to Master Sergeant Cobra, perhaps the most annoying video game man I’ve ever met. After his lovely “cum bubble” insult, he explained the basic premise of <em>Off The Grid</em>. It’s a third-person battle royale in which you try to survive while also finding valuable loot that you can extract mid-game and sell to other players later. More on that in a bit.</p><h2 id="h55076"><a id=""></a><strong>So, what is <em>Off The Grid</em>?</strong></h2><p>Then the game tossed me into a match. And sadly, Cobra was still in my ear, yelling at me, saying things like: “Come on, you chickenshit pussies!” and “Your safe zone is collapsing.” And best of all, you get to hear these same insults over and over. Fun stuff. So happy I’m here.</p><p>The actual gameplay of <em>Off The Grid </em>isn’t groundbreaking. You jump out of a plane, land on a map, find weapons and loot, fight other players, and hopefully end up the last team standing. In my first match, most of the players I encountered seemed to be bots. Looking online, this seems to be a common problem. Also looking online, I spotted a lot of players worried the game was going to get shut down soon because it takes a long time to find matches, and often you get paired with bots. </p><p>When I finally ran into a real player, or what seemed to be a real player, they were dressed like Donald Trump. Trump and Kamala Harris are skins you can buy in the game’s store. Trump’s skin has a “No Woke” sticker. After playing a few matches, I saw a lot of real players running around in the Trump skin. I’ll let you decide what that means about <em>Off The Grid</em>’s playerbase. </p><p>After a few hours of winning and losing, I had figured out what <em>Off The Grid</em> was: It’s a so-so third-person battle royale with a few neat ideas buried under a ton of garbage and bullshit. Gunplay feels snappy enough, but movement feels floaty in a way that makes it hard to control my character. Being able to swap out your limbs on the fly with new ones you find or loot off dead players is cool, and some of the limbs have unique power-ups that can help. Sadly, most of my time in <em>Off The Grid </em>was spent looking for other players to fight and waiting for matches to start. </p><h2 id="h55077"><a id=""></a>Remember NFTs? Gunzilla hopes not</h2><p>In all those previously mentioned sponsored posts advertising the game, they all failed to reveal that this is an NFT/blockchain game. Remember how I mentioned that you can extract loot during matches and sell it to other players? Well, it’s all NFTs, baby. </p><p>I earned a rare arm and sold it for 60 GUN (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gunz/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gunz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gunzilla’s cryptotoken</a></span>) to another player.

When I completed my sale, I checked my transaction history, and it was labeled as being part of my “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gunbygunz.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gunbygunz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GUNZ Wallet.</a></span>” However, because I’m on Xbox Series X/S, I don’t actually have access to my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gunbygunz.com/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20correct%20name%20of%20the%20digital%20token%3F&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gunbygunz.com/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20correct%20name%20of%20the%20digital%20token%3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GUNZ Wallet or the GUN tokens</a></span> inside it. This seems to be because<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://postimg.cc/jLc8LhPR&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://postimg.cc/jLc8LhPR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Xbox, PlayStation, and Valve</a></span> won’t allow Gunzilla to tie the actual blockchain into the game. (On the Epic Store, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/epic-games-store-will-welcome-nft-games-after-steam-ban-1847878298&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/epic-games-store-will-welcome-nft-games-after-steam-ban-1847878298">all of that stuff is functional and active in the game</a></span>.) I don’t know what this means for the GUN tokens that I earned from selling the arm. Can I ever cash them out for real dollars? Will any user-sold items I buy on Xbox be available in future Gunzilla games? </p><p>Gunzilla, the company that now owns <em>Game Informer,</em> has tried to downplay all of this NFT/Blockchain crap <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gunzillagames.com/en/news/56-Gunzilla-Games-Announces-Integration-of-its-GUNZ-Blockchain-Into-OpenSea-Marketplace&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gunzillagames.com/en/news/56-Gunzilla-Games-Announces-Integration-of-its-GUNZ-Blockchain-Into-OpenSea-Marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">despite cutting deals with companies in the industry</a></span>.

It’s a battle royale game with an optional NFT element. If you want to try out NFTs, you can; if you don’t want to, you don’t have to. It’s entirely up to the player how they want to play the game, and the game is playable without dipping into NFTs.</p></blockquote><p>And that’s true, in the sense that you can play games and never do anything with the loot you earn from matches. But that seems to be a big part of the gameplay loop built into<em> Off The Grid</em>, so ignoring NFTs and the player marketplace seems like a bad way to experience the game. </p><p>Of course, the real question is: Do you want to experience<em> Off The Grid</em>? If we ignore the NFT shit, the actual game isn’t much to write home about. I struggled to find real players both before the match started and after I was in the game. Combat is fine, but if I’m going to play a third-person battle royale, I’d rather play <em>Fortnite</em>. And the game’s entire attitude just sucks. Being insulted over and over by the announcer gets old fast, and every inch of the game is filled with the kind of edgy jokes that 13-year-olds repeat after learning a new swear word. </p><p>So, yeah, I guess if you want to grind away at earning fake coins on the blockchain by farming rare loot in a mediocre third-person shooter, you might be the target audience for <em>Off The Grid</em>. For everyone else, throw a dart at a board covered in other battle royale games and play the one you hit instead. At the very least, you won’t have to deal with players dressed as Donald Trump.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/off-the-grid-review-nft-blockchain-crypto-gunz-gunzilla-1851786579]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> supplement's physical release has been delayed. The new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> supplement, the first new supplement for the 2024 ruleset, will not be available on physical bookshelves for a few more months.</p>



<p>In an official post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2019-an-important-update-on-eberron-forge-of-the" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast announced the reason for the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> delay is that the print run of books did not meet their production standards. As illustrated in some screenshots in the post, the books appeared to be satisfactory until the book covers began to warp. Upon closer inspection, it became clear that this defect was present in all printed books.</p>

Since this will take time, the new physical release of the book is now December 9, 2025.</p>

<p>In a somewhat confusing decision, this release will also affect the digital release of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em>. If you have early access to the book, either from pre-ordering or through a D&amp;D Beyond Master Tier subscription, you can access the book's contents two weeks early on November 25. D&amp;D Beyond Hero Tier subscriptions will have one week of early access on December 2.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/eberron-forge-of-artificer-newest-dungeons-dragons-2024-supplement-is-available-for" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</a></em> is the first new supplement for the updated 2024 rules of the iconic fantasy TTRPG. It will contain updated rules and mechanics set in the Eberron setting, created by Keith Baker. The biggest draw of the book is the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revised Artificer</a> class, an arcane engineer capable of creating gizmos, gadgets, and wondrous mechanical constructs.</p>

<p>Physical copies of the book are still available for pre-order at an MSRP of $29.99.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everquest-emulator-threatens-%E2%80%98the-very-existence-of-everquest-itself-%E2%80%99-daybreak-argues-in-new-court-documents.1247604/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Everquest</em> maker Daybreak Games is suing the creators of a popular <em>Everquest</em> emulator called <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em>, accusing the company of copyright infringement and other DMCA violations. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.casd.819107/gov.uscourts.casd.819107.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original complaint</a> was filed in June in a California court and was first <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/06/24/daybreak-is-chasing-everquest-emulator-operators-from-the-heroes-journey-in-court/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by gaming outlet Massively OP</a>. In <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889955351/Prelim-injunction-motion-via-Aftermath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new documents filed this week</a>, Daybreak Games’ lawyers suggest that the existence of <em>The Heroes’ Journey </em>threatens “the very existence of <em>EverQuest</em> itself.”</p><p><em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> is one of dozens of <em>EverQuest</em> servers in operation, the majority of which are made possible due to an open-source project <a href="https://www.eqemulator.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">called <em>EverQuest Emulator</em></a>. It’s the most popular <em>EverQuest</em> server, according to EQ Emulator, <a href="https://eqemulator.org/index.php?pageid=serverlist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with more than 2,000 active users at the time of writing</a>. Some of these fan-run <em>EverQuest</em> servers run with permission from Daybreak Games, such as <a href="https://www.everquest.com/news/project-1999-daybreak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Project 1999</em></a>, which made an agreement with Daybreak Games in 2015. After the lawsuit was filed, one <em>EverQuest</em> emulator called <em>Project Quarm</em> shut down preemptively; it’s now come back online <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectQuarm/comments/1m0816j/project_quarm_has_entered_into_an_agreement_with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with permission from Daybreak Games, so long as it’s not-for-profit</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The key piece for <em>Project 1999 </em>and <em>Project Quarm</em>, for Daybreak Games, appears to be that they’re not-for-profit — meaning they don’t make money, whereas <em>The Heroes’ Journey </em>does, on top of it competing with the original <em>EverQuest</em> game. The other issue, which lawyers explain in the original complaint from June, is that <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> reportedly requires players to run the <em>EverQuest</em> client and mods it to access the unauthorized server. Daybreak Games says the mods “constitute unauthorized derivative works of Daybreak’s copyrighted software and circumvent technological measures implemented by Daybreak to control access to its copyrighted works.”</p><figure><figcaption>from Daybreak Games' lawsuit</figcaption></figure><p><em>EverQuest</em> was originally released in 1999 as a massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Its experience hinges on a lot of people playing it at once; the social element is a core function of the game. <em>EverQuest</em> is free-to-play, though it also has a premium membership plan that gives players different perks. Daybreak Games had previously been denied a temporary restraining order that would have taken <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> offline through the next phase of the lawsuit, and <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.casd.819107/gov.uscourts.casd.819107.29.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later agreed to an order</a> that instead prevented <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> from getting major updates and forced revenue into an escrow account while the lawsuit is ongoing. In Daybreak Games’ latest filing, a motion for preliminary injunction, the company seeks to have <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> taken down because it claims that its existence is a threat to <em>EverQuest</em> due to a reduction in Daybreak Games' <em>EverQuest</em> playerbase; damages for monetary harm aren’t enough, lawyers wrote.</p><p>“At the same time that EverQuest has experienced unprecedented decline, THJ has grown exponentially due to the direct theft of EverQuest users,” lawyers wrote.</p><p>It’s not clear how many players <em>EverQuest</em> currently has, and portions of the documents that discuss it are redacted. (In 2020, <em>EverQuest</em> had 82,000 monthly active players and 66,000 playing members, <a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EG7-Investor-Presentation-Dec-2020-Acquires-Daybreak-Games.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per an earnings report</a>. Aftermath has not been able to locate player numbers in the years that followed.) The newly filed documents imply that the existence of <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> has led to a decrease in <em>EverQuest</em> players; “Since THJ’s launch in late 2024, [redacted],” lawyers wrote. “A decline in user base not only causes a decline in revenue to Daybreak but also damages the entire gaming experience which depends, by definition, on the simultaneous play by thousands of users. This drop in users has irreversible ripple effects across the entire gaming experience, creating a downward spiral that will be impossible to reverse. Each day of delay allows Defendants to continue diverting players and revenue from Daybreak’s legitimate EverQuest service.”</p><p>They continued, “As a result of the damage that Defendants have already caused and are continuing to cause, [redacted.] This is the exact type of irreparable harm that preliminary injunctions are designed to prevent.”</p><p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889955350/Daybreak-vs-THJ-via-Aftermath-filing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a separate filing</a>, Daybreak Games attorney Nicholas Janda spends two pages discussing how much players love <em>The Heroes’ Journey, </em>using comments from YouTube, Reddit, and other social media. “Hands down the best thing that has ever happened to the game,” read one YouTube comment Janda cited. “Never going back to original EQ again.” Another person wrote, as cited by Janda: “The day I started THJ I stopped my EQ subs.”&nbsp;</p><p>Daybreak Games claims <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> has more than 30,000 users. That’s a huge increase since its launch in late 2024; Janda said Daybreak Games received an anonymous email in December 2024 that stated <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> had 2,000 users and was making $20,000 per month. Lawyers are drawing a line that they say shows “a clear correlation&nbsp; between THJ’s growth and the decline in official <em>EverQuest</em> server populations.” Daybreak Games is asking the court to force <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> offline, take its GitHub repositories down, and cease operation of its website while the lawsuit is ongoing.</p><p>“Player departure creates an accelerating effect where each departing [<em>EverQuest</em>] player makes the remaining experience less attractive, encouraging additional departures,” lawyers wrote. “As guild membership declines, group activities become harder to organize, and the social ecosystem that originally attracted players deteriorates. This acceleration means that early intervention is critical — once the exodus reaches a certain threshold, it becomes extremely difficult to reverse.”</p><p>Neither Daybreak Games nor the makers of <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> have responded to Aftermath’s request for comment. But <em>The Heroes’</em> <em>Journey</em>’s Discord server displays the following statement:</p><blockquote><p><em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> is currently subject to pending litigation brought by Daybreak Game Company LLC regarding intellectual property and other related matters. While that case proceeds, a Stipulated Order found <a href="https://heroesjourneyemu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/daybreak-stip-order.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> has been agreed to by the Parties in that litigation and is subject to enforcement by the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.</p><p>We know this has been stressful for many of you, but please know that you are not alone.

Ozuri,&nbsp;an advisor for&nbsp;<em>The Heroes’ Journey&nbsp;</em>who worked on&nbsp;<em>EverQuest&nbsp;</em>until 2004, told Aftermath that the community support for&nbsp;<em>The Heroes’ Journey</em>&nbsp;has been overwhelming — unlike anything they've seen in more than 25 years in the video game industry.</p><p>“I’m a 47 year old jaded gamer, and I’ve been on the internet a long time, but I’ve ugly cried more than once reading the stories of the impact <em>THJ</em> has had on people and what it has meant for them and their lives,” Ozuri said. “We are grateful and oh so humbled by our community that seems deeply emotionally invested in [<em>The Heroes’ Journey</em>.]”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-valnet-off-the-grid-gunzilla-rip-this-sucks"><h3>🙃 [Update]</h3></a><p>Cool, cool, cool</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/everquest-the-heroes-journey-lawsuit-update]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In case you've been wondering, Ubisoft is indeed working on a new entry in its long-running Ghost Recon series. The news, which had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-ghost-recon-is-in-development-report/1100-6502229/" data-ref-id="1100-6502229">heavily rumored</a> for a while now, was confirmed by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in what sounds like a heated shareholder meeting last week.</p><p>First reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, the confirmation of the the untitled Ghost Recon game came from a question about Ubisoft's history with live-service titles. Touting the company's success with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a>, Guillemot added, "In addition to the flagship game that I just mentioned, our objective is to also make strong progress in the growing market, generally speaking, by continuing to enhance our current experiences that we offer--and capitalizing on upcoming launches, such as The Division and Ghost Recon."</p><p>Later on, Ubisoft's CFO Frederick Duguet specifically called out the upcoming Ghost Recon title as one of the company's "first-person-shooter-type games," seemingly also confirming that the next entry will be an FPS. Though multiple titles in the franchise have offered first-person perspectives, the Ghost Recon games have largely been presented as third-person shooters since 2006's Advanced Warfighter, making this a significant shift for the series.</p><p>A new first-person live-service Ghost Recon game is not an entirely unprecedented thing. Ghost Recon Wildlands was a huge success for Ubisoft back in 2017, one which the company built upon by quickly following it up with a worse-received sequel, Breakpoint. Despite the difference in their receptions, both of these titles enjoyed a great deal of post-launch support. Ubisoft, in a controversial move, even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-first-nfts-are-like-steam-marketplace-on-the-blockchain/1100-6498699/" data-ref-id="1100-6498699">added NFTs</a>, a form of digital collectible rooted in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, to Breakpoint back in 2021.</p><p>Despite the confirmation of a new Ghost Recon game, neither Guillemot nor Duguet provided any timeframe, suggesting that the title is still a ways out. In the meantime, Ubisoft is keeping busy, spinning off many of its core franchises into a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">new division</a>--which is being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/" data-ref-id="1100-6533205">co-led by Guillemot's son</a>--as part of its terms with Tencent, and finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-assassins-creed-tv-series-moves-ahead-with-halo-sons-of-anarchy-veterans/1100-6533232/" data-ref-id="1100-6533232">greenlighting a Netflix adaptation</a> of its popular Assassin's Creed games.</p>

			<p>The Invisible Hours, for those who’ve not heard of it, is a game by the now-shuttered Tequila Works. A game studio you might know for games like Rime and Gylt, or its last title before it was shut down, Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story. When Riot cut its indie publishing label, <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-11-of-workforce-shuts-down-riot-forge-to-refocus-on-core-projects/">Riot Forge</a>, Tequila Works struggled to secure funding for its next project and subsequently shut down a year later. When it shut down, a thing that doesn’t happen with every game studio being shut down happened to Tequila Works. The rights for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/tequila-works-auctions-off-its-brand-and-ips/">IPs and assets were sold at auction</a>.</p>



<p>If you had the cash and were an adoring fan of, say, Gylt, you could place your bid to officially own the full rights to the game, lock, stock, and barrel. Rob Yescombe, however, a writer who has been the lead writer on and written for games such as Rime<em>, </em>The Invisible Hours, The Division, The Precinct,<em> </em>and Arizona Sunshine II<em>, </em>who has also recently written films such as Jackpot! and Outside the Wire, saw a unique opportunity.</p>



<p>“<em>Well, the truth of it is that it was a very, very, rare opportunity. When we made this game, with Tequila Works, a Spanish company that was probably best known for making Rime, which I also wrote. Sadly, this year, they went bust, and as is the course in Spain, when a company shuts down, their assets and IP go to auction. And it’s extraordinarily rare for any artist to have an opportunity to own something they’ve made. Unless you’re running your own company, your whole career, you’re a gun for hire. And I thought, ‘Well, when am I ever going to get another shot at this?</em>’”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Fortunately for Yescombe, not only did this once-in-a-blue-moon opportunity appear, it lined up with a project that, seemingly more than some of his other works, was extremely close to his heart. In a press release announcing that he had secured the rights and planned to remaster the game, he said he “<em>adored working on The Invisible Hours. Truly, the best creative experience of my life,</em>” a sentiment he echoed in our conversation when I asked him why The Invisible Hours was his pick of the games he worked on to bring back. </p>



<p>"<em>This is the one that I have to say is probably closest to my heart, because this was a moment in my career where Raúl Rubio</em>, <em>who was the creative director at Tequila Works, and I trusted each other implicitly,</em> <em>because we had made Rime together and it had gone really well. And The Invisible Hours was such a unique production because I was given enormous creative leeway</em>. <em>Essentially a creative blank check. Not in terms of money, but creatively, given carte blanche, to make something of my own. It still means the world to me, I still talk to the cast and with the people who made it. It's just one of those productions where we were all there because we loved making it, and I think that still resonates inside of it, I think you can feel when you play it that people who loved it, made it.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption>Rob Yescombe</figcaption></figure>



<p>Yescombe moved quickly when The Invisible Hours was up for grabs. The rights for Tequila Works’ games went up this past April, and by <a href="https://wccftech.com/rob-yescombe-acquires-rights-to-now-defunct-tequila-works-vr-game-the-invisible-hours-wants-to-develop-a-remaster-and-screen-adaptation/">June,</a> he was telling anyone who would listen that he planned to bring the game back. The plan, as it currently stands, is to remaster The Invisible Hours for modern headsets such as Meta’s Quest 3 and even perhaps the PlayStation VR2, and once the remaster is complete and on shelves (or rather, on head(sets)), he hopes to move forward with a screen adaptation, whether as a film or TV show.</p>



<p>On the question of changing or adding anything to the game, he was hesitant to commit to saying that he would make changes, though he did add that the one thing he wished he could've done at the time, was find a way to make the game more social, which could also bolster its appeal in this current era of social games having taken off to new heights since 2020. He even went further to suggest a version of the game that's timed, where players have to run through as much of the story as possible, and submit what they believe to be the solution to the mystery at the end.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>"Something I would have loved to have done at the time is find a way to make it more social,</em> <em>because as it stands, it's a single-player experience. What I would love to do is to say 'hey, let's all three of us go bomb around the mansion and reconvene at the end of each chapter, and see, well, what did you learn?' I think that would be really fun, and I think Meta is moving increasingly more towards social, and there's overlap there in their interests and the things that I would like to do that I think would be good for both of us.</em>"</p>



<p>He’s also not planning to start his own new studio to make the remaster. He intends to work with a team that’s already up and running and more than capable of pulling the job off. Considering how many studios in the last five years alone have tried to setup a game studio and release a blockbuster debut game at the same time, who’ve also shuttered in the last five years because starting a company is a difficult thing on its own even before you add the challenges of game making, I’d say Yescombe has the right approach in mind.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>I was curious, though, as to why he didn’t skip past remastering the game and went straight towards doing a screen adaptation. I was also curious as to why Yescombe doesn’t just stick to writing films, after two recent successful outings with 2021’s Outside the Wire and 2024’s Jackpot!.</p>



<p>"<em>I think that the pleasure of writing movies is, you get to polish it to a high shine, and then it's a product that goes out. But, the joy of writing games is, ultimately, the final product is a collaboration between me, and someone who I'm never going to meet, who is the player. And together, we're going to create the final experience. My education was in fine art, I thought I wanted to be a fine artist, and I was really taken at the time when I was at art school, with the idea that when you walk into a gallery, you're not allowed to touch anything. I always wanted to make things that were about, deconstructing the gallery space, collaborating with artist to make the final thing, which is an experience between the art the artist tried to make and the way I receive and interact with it, and that's ultimately what led me into games. And so, that's still the thing that keeps me there. Because I'm so excited to like, hop on Twitch, and see someone playing [for example] Arizona Sunshine II, and they've done something that reveals some hidden piece of dialogue I thought they would never find. And I love that they made the effort, and that they saw that I had something in place for them. And I also love to see when they find the holes that we didn't fill. It sounds disappointing in a way, but really, it's exciting to see 'Did I manage to catch all the drops?' Or did they find something that I didn't find, and we're discovering what the game can be together? That's the part that I love.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even if remastering the game was always going to be the first step, I was still curious as to why Yescombe was focused on remastering The Invisible Hours for VR. As someone who has been playing, following, and now covering games for years, VR has remained a niche market. In fact, I even said that it feels like VR has been ‘the next best thing’ each year for the last decade. But Yescombe isn’t fazed by that kind of talk. He and the team at Tequila Works weren't fazed back when they first made The Invisible Hours, even if he admitted that they "<em>perhaps mistakenly</em>" listened to some advice they had received from an entity that Yescombe stipulates, "<em>was not a hardware maker</em>," and was instead an analyst firm "<em>whose job it was to project hardware sales</em>" that predicted PSVR would sell 6 million units by the fourth quarter of the fiscal year it was launching in. </p>



<p>Obviously, that's not what happened, but the fact that myself, and millions of other players didn't get the chance to play The Invisible Hours when it first launched, makes for a greater opportunity now in Yescombe's mind, considering how much bigger VR is in 2025. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>"<em>We came out, out of the gate, into a market that didn't exist. The Invisible Hours reviewed critically really well, people loved it. Players reviewed it really well, but the market didn't exist. So now here we are, almost 10 years later, there's probably something like 20 million [Meta] Quests in the wild, a bunch of people with SteamVR, and whatever else is coming down the pipeline, and to all of those tens of millions of potential players, this is essentially a new product that they don't even know exists. And so the notion is, hey, we've got a product that has been tested very extensively by this small audience, let's remaster it, let's make it look beautiful again for a modern audience and just bring them that experience</em>."</p>



<p>Yescombe later added that they also intend to remaster the flat screen versions of the game that were released after the VR version, and also points out that The Invisible Hours is, by nature, one of the most accessible VR titles available. It doesn't rely on heavy game mechanics or frequent movement; instead, it's all about peeling back the layers of the story and getting the chance to stand in the middle of the action, follow the characters you want, and discover how it all unfolds in a unique, firsthand way. There's complexity to be found for those who want to pick up everything not bolted down and dig as deep as possible, but enjoying The Invisible Hours isn't prohibited by your knowledge or experience of playing games and playing VR games. "<em>You can do the version where you're almost inside a piece of theatre, and everybody is going to get an interesting, and what will feel like, a bespoke experience</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We’re still a long way out from seeing The Invisible Hours return to headsets and screens, and an even longer way out from seeing it reach the big or small screen in a film or TV adaptation. But Yescombe’s enthusiasm for the game and his clear love for telling stories in games has me hopeful that he is able to get the chance to bring The Invisible Hours to as many gamers and viewers alike.</p>



<p>I'm also hopeful that I'll be able to learn more about what his other ongoing project is, as he shared with me that he's working on a project he absolutely cannot discuss yet, with The Quarry and Until Dawn writer and director, Will Byles, whom he was actually going to be seeing soon after our Zoom conversation.</p>



<p>"<em>I can't say what it is, by Will Byles and I, we're working on something together right now. I literally can say nothing about it, but we're working on something. In fact we're seeing each other imminently.</em>"</p>



<p>Thank you to Rob Yescombe for speaking with me and being so generous with your time and answers.</p>

In <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, you won’t unlock fishing straight away, but once you do, it can feel like quite the game-changer for food supplies, income, and collectors who want to see it all.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Civilization is a series in thrall to the illusion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-rise-and-no-fall-how-civilization-reinforces-a-dangerous-myth">endless incremental progress</a>, and what more bruisingly poetic way to refute that narrative than by sticking two fingers up at this year's ailing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> and opting to play 2016's much better-regarded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a> instead. Conveniently, you can currently get Civilization 6 for free on the Epic Games Store - the giveaway runs till 24th July.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're mad about Civ 7's failings, there's a fair chance you already own Civ 6. But the freebie does include access to all of the game's DLC and expansions, so might be worth bagging if you only ever bought the base game from a different store. For clarity, you do not need to stick two fingers up at Civ 7 while downloading the free version of Civ 6. It is a piece of software and cannot respond to your hatred.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sid-meiers-civilization-vi--platinum-edition">The Epic Games Store giveaway</a> is for Civ 6's Platinum Edition, which includes the Vikings Scenario Pack, the Poland Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Australia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Persia and Macedon Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Nubia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, and the Khmer and Indonesia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, plus two big expansions: Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm.</p>
<p>After all the yelling, shouting, explosions and assorted farmyard noises in response to Civilization 7, it is kind of terrifying to revisit Adam Smith's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-6-review">Civilization 6 review</a> from 2016. "Civ VI demands flexibility of thought and function, and it rewards it handsomely with a game that responds elegantly to all kinds of different playstyles," he wrote, concluding that "it is, quite simply, a thing of wonder, and a late contender for my personal game of the year." </p>
<p>It was subsequently consecrated as RPS's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-4x-2016-civilization-6">best 4X of 2016 in the year's Advent Calendar</a>, and stands firm (appropriately) at 6th on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">best PC strategy games</a>. (You all ranked it at 13th on your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-50-favourite-strategy-games-of-all-time">own list</a> because what is the average RPS reader if not a chuckling contrarian.)</p>
<p>I want to go back. Still, perhaps with enough updating and patching, Civ 7 will shine similarly. Civilization tends to play the long game, after all. The next major update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-is-getting-auto-explore-for-scouts-reminding-me-that-i-both-hate-and-love-auto-explore">will add auto-exploration for scouts and smoothed-out Age transitions</a>. It feels like if they can figure out the controversy over the Age mechanic, the rest might fall into place.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-youve-given-up-on-civilization-7-civ-6-is-free-with-all-dlc-expansions-for-a-limited-time-on-epic-games-store]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s another new trailer! Look, I’m not going to pretend at professional distance here: I am extremely excited about next month’s new TV series, <em>Alien: Earth</em>. And each new trailer gives me more reason to be. But this isn’t because I think the <em>Alien</em> franchise is some surefire hit generator—goodness gracious it isn’t—but because it’s from Noah Hawley, and I suspect it’s going to be really, <em>really </em>weird.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="297" data-playlist="195358,195697,197589" data-current="195358"><div><p>Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20816.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Noah Hawley is perhaps best known for his TV reinterpretation of the Coen Bros. movie <em>Fargo</em>, but the reason I’m so thrilled he’s behind <em>Alien: Earth</em> is because of his 2017-19 show, <em>Legion</em>.</p><p>It’s hard to convey <em>Legion</em>’s brilliance in words, given so much of this unique take on the world of superpowers existed in the most astonishingly vivid visual flourishes. It was also the most extraordinary take on what was, after all, an X-Men story, despite never uttering those words, nor even alluding to the wider franchise. The story of David Haller (Dan Stevens), the schizophrenic son of Charles Xavier (although he is never named either), explored his attempts to come to terms with his powers and his mental illness, accompanied by the unknowable reality of Aubrey Plaza’s Lenny, all while being pursued by the astoundingly sinister Amahl Farouk (Navid Negahban). It was like nothing else on TV. (The above is a genuine scene from the TV show, not a compilation or trailer. It was this fantastic.) And <em>that</em>’s why I’m so hyped for <em>Alien: Earth</em>.</p><p>Hints of the possible weirdness have appeared throughout the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDyzBpnfjqkmoQqUBXKeRF7zmfLe3HT0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDyzBpnfjqkmoQqUBXKeRF7zmfLe3HT0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promotional campaign</a></span> for the series, not least a full three minutes of a cat’s eye view of a Weyland-Yutani ship:</p><p>But somewhat less overtly, there have been multiple trailers featuring shots so distinctive from Hawley’s shows; sparse, symmetrical spaces, intercutting shots of idyllic nature with barren, metallic greys. There’s so much potential here for headfuckery, peculiar flashbacks/forwards that can sit unexplained for episodes at a time, and visual flare that will speak far more potently than the scripts.</p><p>Or, of course, it could be terrible. No one knows yet. But I have such high hopes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-trailer-fx-sydney-chandler-samuel-blenkin-1851783707?_gl=1*cs6p7h*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI4NDI5MDMkbzYwJGcxJHQxNzUyODQzMTM4JGo1OCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-trailer-fx-sydney-chandler-samuel-blenkin-1851783707?_gl=1*cs6p7h*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI4NDI5MDMkbzYwJGcxJHQxNzUyODQzMTM4JGo1OCRsMCRoMA..">Last month we had a trailer</a></span> that stopped holding back and introduced us to the idea that the the Weyland ship that crashes into an North America’s Prodigy City isn’t just carrying a Xenomorph, but at least four other alien species. One of them looks like a Metroid. Another is the cutest little evil octopus.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="b6586ff107f30a248cb647354fd567a9" data-recommend-id="image://b6586ff107f30a248cb647354fd567a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A weird octopoid alient with what looks like a single eyeball for a head, with two pupils." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A weird octopoid alient with what looks like a single eyeball for a head, with two pupils." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FX / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b6586ff107f30a248cb647354fd567a9" data-recommend-id="image://b6586ff107f30a248cb647354fd567a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A weird octopoid alient with what looks like a single eyeball for a head, with two pupils." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We also learned that this 2120-set show, taking place a couple of years before the events of the original 1979 <em>Alien</em> film, has a program in which human consciousnesses are transferred into synthetic bodies, and throughout the earlier trailer, there were hints that this will cause issues for those minds: perfect Hawley territory for unreliable narration and ambiguity over reality.</p><p>This latest trailer at first seems to be something of a best-of of what’s come before, but in fact subtly moves ideas forward a step. The young girl whose mind is transferred into a synth body—she’s not questioning her humanity. The alien creatures we know have escaped on board the crashed ship? We now see their eggs, their victims, and a whole lot more blood. And most of all, if you’re me and geeking out about this, we see a constant flip-flopping between sci-fi metallic horror and comfortable, Earthly bucolic nature. Right up until that final shot, the incredibly subtle yet striking image of a Xenomorph lit by natural light.</p><figure id="" data-id="e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-recommend-id="image://e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1827" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FX / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-recommend-id="image://e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1827" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When did you last see a Xenomorph lit by natural light?</p><p>Oh, and talking of progression between the trailers, we need to talk about the poor goat.

Not least, based on this being set two years before the original movie, you’re forced to wonder how much was known about the Xenomorphs ahead of Ripley’s first encounter in 2122. Now, forgive me, because I’m no expert in this franchise (obviously <em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em> are masterpieces in their own distinct ways, but the rest of the movies really don’t bear all that much scrutiny in my opinion), but I’ve tried to piece this all together. And for the record, the <em>Alien Vs. Predator</em> movies are not canon, as Ridley Scott made sure of by the story he told in <em>Prometheus</em>.</p><p>2012's <em>Prometheus </em>was set in 2093, at which point it’s made clear that Xenomorphs are yet to exist. <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, released in 2017, is set in 2104, just 16 years before this TV show, and now—as a result of experiments with fungal spores on an alien planet—it seems they do. But they’re nowhere near Earth, and it’s unclear whether or not anyone could have reported back about them. The next chronological movie is <em>Alien</em>, which of course was not created to be part of some enormous franchise spanning the timeline in either direction, and so gave no thought to where or why the Xenomorphs existed. But it <em>does</em> reveal that the as-yet unnamed corporation had deliberately sent the Nostromo out to encounter the aliens.</p><p>So, this all suggests that <em>Alien: Earth</em> is going to explain how Weyland-Yutani knew to go look for the buggers: they literally encountered them on the planet’s surface. That’s quite a twist! It also leaves huge questions about those other four species! Why have we never encountered any of these again in the <em>four</em> other films that take place after <em>Alien</em>? Obviously <em>Aliens</em> takes care of itself, in its own contained story, but what about <em>Romulus</em>? That’s set on a Weyland experimental ship, but here they’re only focused on the Xenos. And sure, the more we can forget <em>Alien 3</em> and <em>Alien Resurrection</em> the better, but the latter is set another 200 years later on and <em>still</em> doesn’t suggest other lifeforms are out there.</p><p>It’s obviously tempting to just say, “Dude, who cares? It’s a sci-fi story and they’re just making shit up as they go.” And yes, that’s absolutely true. But people take canon and continuity <em>really</em> seriously, especially in nerdcore like this. It would, I think, be a bit lazy to set a TV show in such a crucial moment in the mythos’ history and act like what comes next isn’t important. It seems very unlikely that’s the plan. Hence why it’s so interesting to speculate!</p><p>The show is going to be on FX and Hulu, starting August 12 with two episodes. After that, it’ll come out on a weekly schedule, like TV used to in the olden days, with eight episodes total finishing on September 23.</p><p>Clearly I’m way too excited for it.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-noah-hawley-fx-tv-series-trailer-scott-1851786549]]></content:encoded>
