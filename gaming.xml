			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-brings-the-mmo-to-consoles-with-cross-play-new-10-player-raid-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of New World: Aeternum at Summer Game Fest 2024, we caught up with some lead figures from Amazon Games Orange County to dive into the console launch and the various improvements coming to the existing PC version.</p>
<p>We chatted with Scott Lane (Game Director), Katie Kaczynski (Senior Producer), and David Fairfaye (Creative Director). As a reminder, the new version of the MMORPG will go live on October 15.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I think of it more of a spiritual successor because it's got three years of learnings and improvements that we made on the PC and then a whole bunch of new stuff that we've added.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Let's start with the big one. What differentiates New World: Aeternum from the live PC version?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane:</strong> I think of it more of a spiritual successor because it's got three years of learnings and improvements that we made on the PC and then a whole bunch of new stuff that we've added.&nbsp; Some of the big differentiators are the way we tell people the story is new, the way we tell the story's new.</p>
<p>Those special close-up dialogue cameras, the in-game cinematics we've added. You'll see new pre-rendered cinematics as well at launch. Beyond that, the beach questing is similar but vastly improved. The time to max level is streamlined. I think streamlined is a word I'm probably gonna use a lot because the console audience wants things faster and more clear. We made the game soloable from beginning to end. Doesn't mean you have to play solo. You can play with a group, you can play solo, it's really your option. It still has the MMO back end.</p>
<p>But we've done a lot of focus around making it play and feel more like an action RPG. We've added swimming. We've added a new raid at the endgame. We've taken our solo trials and we've made end-game versions of those that you can play through repeatedly.</p>
<p>We've added a PvP zone. What am I forgetting?</p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye:</strong> Gear score increase, matchmaking.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane:</strong> Oh yes, matchmaking for our 3v3 PvP Arena.</p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye:</strong> The other thing we discussed earlier is that the controller support is just better. Now you can remap controls, you have lock on, you have aim assist, so that controller experience has been enhanced from what's currently on live.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane:</strong> Also, you have camera choices now between player relative or camera relative camera, which is very different for some players depending on which one you choose. If you played the game, like, at launch for New World, it'd be easier to describe what hasn't changed rather than what has changed.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the class archetypes that are being introduced in New World: Aeternum?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski:</strong> We wanted to make this a really easy game to just hop into. So, if you have a favorite weapon that you play in a different game, or there's a specific kind of fantasy that you were thinking about for your character, you can very easily start with that.</p>
<p>New World: Aeternum is still a classless game, so your weapon is really your class. But this is a great way to start with this embodiment and definition of who your character is at the beginning, and then you can change and roll to whatever you want it to be as you journey through the game.</p>
<p><strong>You also talked about the improved quest flow from level 1 to 65. Is that going to be in terms of just pacing for how experience is doled out, or are you redesigning those quests?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>I'll take that. I think it's both. We've definitely worked a lot on the quest flow. The NPCs move with you. You can go to an area, and there's a lot of quests around, so there's less sort of like having to run for running's sake. The story sort of moves with you.</p>
<p>The other big thing we wanted to do is that there's no grind for grind's sake in terms of the story, right? As you progress, you naturally level up and the story just gets you to max level so you don't have to do extra stuff, just the story.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane:</strong> It is also notably faster to get to max level than in the previous version. It probably takes about half of the time. But it's worth mentioning that once you get to max level, that's when the game opens up. You get to the end game and there's all kinds of crazy, fun stuff to do.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'It is also notably faster to get to max level than in the previous version. It probably takes about half of the time.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Yeah. Even in the brief hands-on, I got to level 11, got through introductory quests, and was opening up new weapon skills and new combos to experiment with. Are there any changes in the crafting and trading systems from the PC release?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>Not too many. The big thing we've done is we've tried to streamline some of the crafting so you progress a little bit faster. We've made some of the recipes for jewel crafting a little simpler, so there's one main recipe for the different types, and then you add different stones to it. Little things like that just sort of make it easier to level up.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Do you see some of these changes making their way back into the live PC version?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>Oh, they're gonna get all this. For the folks that are currently playing, if they purchased the Rise of the Angry Earth DLC last year, they're going to get everything.</p>
<p>If you have the base game, you're gonna get some of what we talk about when it comes to the new content and new features. So, we're gonna keep the console and PC at parity. Everything that is coming to the console is coming to the PC.</p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>And that's important for crossplay, right? One of the big things is that PC users can play with console users. They can play in the same worlds, so they always have to be on the same build.</p>
<p><strong>Does that mean New World on PC will change, or rather, essentially disappear, and that Aeternum will take its place?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>I wouldn't say disappearing. I think it's just gonna be rebranded to match the branding of where we are now with the franchise.</p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>The way that I describe it is if you played right at launch, the game has changed so much. It's a completely different game. We redid the entire main story quest line. It's totally brand new. If you're playing today, and you're a current player, then it's just a continuation of your journey. Your progression continues. This is gonna drop on October 15th, and you're just gonna keep playing and having fun, either on your main or on a fresh start world. If you're on console, you get all of this from day one, and it's just like Aeternum is the ultimate New World experience.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>There'll be a lot more people to buy your stuff on the trading post from October 15th.</p>
<p><strong>Will you launch new worlds, like fresh start worlds, with New World: Aeternum?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Nice. What do players get when they buy into the game on consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>Do you mean like pre-order?</p>
<p><strong>Either pre-order or the editions that are out there.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>There's a standard edition and then we have a deluxe edition that comes with a bear mount, so that's super exciting. And then there's also a pre-order bonus. That's the dire wolf mount called the Azoth Stalker. That's also actually available on PC. While that is a pre-order bonus, it is available to our PC players as well who are currently playing. All they have to do is log in between June 7th and October 14th in order to get that, and then on October 15th, they'll be able to grab that.</p>
<p><strong>I was going to ask if there was a loyalty program for people who are already on PC and have a New World account but might want to start up on consoles. </strong></p>
<p><b>Scott Lane: </b>Well, on console, no, but on PC, I think it was really important for us that anything, like the Azoth Stalker mount pre-order bonus, would be there as well. We didn't want to give something to the consoles that the PC players wouldn't have access to. It just didn't seem fair for all the support they've given us. And it's the same with the content. We really wanted to just make the PC game better for those who bought Rise of the Angry Earth as a thank you for hanging in there and sticking around with this and being a good partner.</p>
<p><strong>On PC, will you still have the same controller support and the lock-on features?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We have total parity. So you can lock on, I think the default is middle mouse button. It feels great.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>Or you can play on controller on PC.</p>
<p><strong>On the other hand, can you play with keyboard and mouse on consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>Yes. I've never tried it.</p>
<p><strong>Good to know it's there as an option. As far as the expansion content goes, in the little bit that I played, I did see a hook. There was a quest item that you could pick up for the Elysian Wilds. I mentioned that you did not have access to that expansion in the bit I played.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>You saw that here?</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, there was a mudstain note in the city you could walk up to that was just sitting on a chest. When you click that, it says you need access to this expansion, and you have to be level 25.</strong></p>
<p>Oh, no, you just have to be level 25. It was gated by level, not the expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. The tooltip kind of said both things for some reason. I wondered if Elysian Wilds was included with the base game. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>Do you mean the base console game?</p>
<p><strong>Yeah</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>So, for the Standard and Deluxe edition on consoles, both of those have everything wrapped up and included. They get it all. On PC, there's still a base game where some people may not have the DLC on PC. That won't happen on console since everything is included.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. So, there isn't a piecemeal way to buy specific expansions on consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>It all comes nicely wrapped in a bow, ready to go for that.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>New World: Aeternum includes everything that has shipped to date and all the new stuff.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We're continuously balancing PVP, and I think with this release, we will make a very big effort to bring all the weapons up to parity and balance the game.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Cool. Have you talked about any of the PVP rebalancing that you guys are doing for New World: Aeternum?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>We're continuously balancing PVP, and I think with this release, we will make a very big effort to bring all the weapons up to parity and balance the game.</p>
<p><strong>The 15 weapon types that are in New World: Aeternum, is that everything that's in the base game? There's no new weapon types this time around?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski:</strong> Correct. For the console version, everything is in the base game, I just want to make that clear. There is a flail that's gated behind the Rise of the Angry Earth DLC on PC.</p>
<p><strong>With the cross-play feature, is there cross-communication and cross-platform guild support?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>Absolutely, yeah. You can join guilds with people on any platform, you can chat with them, you can make friends with them.</p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>You can run the influence races together, you can take over the territory together, you can fight wars together, you can do all that. It's awesome.</p>
<p><strong>For consoles, are you guys talking about if there's graphic versus performance modes available for players?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>Yeah, we do have a 4K mode. We have performance and quality. The goal of performance is to always be at 60. In Quality mode, you'll sometimes dip a little bit, but it gives you all the best visuals. The shadows are deeper, and the lighting's a little better, so you can sort of choose what's best for you.</p>
<p><strong>Are you guys utilizing AMD FSR or any additional rendering options for consoles/PC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>Yes, we are. We're using an upscaler.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane:</strong> I believe it's FSR.</p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>One other thing about the rendering: it's worth mentioning we'll be bringing HDR in with this release, which I think will be really great for those with HDR displays.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Finally bringing a raid to New World is something players have been asking for for a long time. This is a full and true raid. It's that challenging content players have been waiting for.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Awesome. I guess from each of you, is there one, like, particular feature or something that stands out for the launch of New World: Aeternum that is something you've wanted to do from the base game that you can finally do?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>I'll start because I always say this. I know Katie wants to say something.</p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>I do want to say it!</p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>My favorite is the raid. I think finally bringing a raid to New World is something that players have been asking for for a long time. This is a full and true raid. It's a three-boss experience, and I think, you know, it's part of that end game. It's that challenging content players have been waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>That first boss is my favorite. It looks very different from what we've done. It acts very different from what we've done. Really different mechanics throughout the whole thing with each of the bosses, but that one, I love the way it looks. But the thing that I'm excited about is actually the Lawless Zone.</p>
<p>I think that - I love our faction system. I play into it. I played each different faction type on each of my characters. But I'm really looking forward to getting into this lawless area where factions don't matter. I think this is gonna be the coolest thing. And we're gonna have more information on that coming up in a Forged in Aeternum episode where we kind of dig into that. I'm super stoked to do that episode, it's my favorite thing.</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong> <strong>Lane:</strong> For me, I'm like a 90/10 player. 90% of the time, I want to be alone, but I like to know there are people around. The 10 percent I group is only really out of requirements in a game, so I am really pumped about having the solo experience from beginning to end and having some endgame solo activities and things that I can just do by myself.</p>
<p>Part of that is the enhanced dialogue system, almost like the RPG storytelling systems we've added. I think combined, those two make the game something I would have loved to have gotten from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you all very much for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-first-donald-duck-short-in-60-years-shouldn%E2%80%99t-be-the-last.897078/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24175403/new-donald-duck-movie-short-diy-duck<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="3Y8gUa"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/century-of-disney/23603428/donald-duck-horny-as-hell-three-caballeros-saludos-amigos">Donald Duck</a>, arguably tied with Goofy as the second most recognizable Disney character  after Mickey Mouse, starred in over 150 short films throughout the 1930, ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s. 2024 marks the 90th anniversary of the pantsless Pekin, who persisted through the second half of the 20th century thanks to Disney Channel replays of his shorts, appearances in <em>DuckTales</em>, and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23018966/kingdom-hearts-4-announcement-trailer-release-date">Kingdom Hearts games</a>. </p>
<p id="x48euw">Disney is celebrating the duck’s birthday with the usual merch drops and theme park shenanigans, but its best gift to fans is a brand-new short: <em>DIY Duck</em>, Donald’s first solo short outing since 1961’s <em>The Litterbug</em>. Directed by veteran Mark Henn, who has remained on Disney’s hand-drawn animation team throughout the quarter-century pivot to 3D CG,  <em>DIY Duck</em> checks all the boxes of a classic Donald short, starting with a mundane day-in-the-life problem that puts the character through the cartoon wringer.</p>
<div id="hpbUOu"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ncEza6z_SwE?rel=0&amp;start=1" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="AJig7d">Donald was always my favorite cartoon character: Landing between the more wholesome Disney gang and Tex Avery and Chuck Jones’ elastic, ecstatic WB cast, Donald was just... some dude... trying to learn how the world works and get by. His temper could run hot, but he was solutions-oriented. He wanted to make a buck, but wasn’t anything like Scrooge McDuck. His curiosity and zest for life meant Disney could drop him into a PSA every now and then — Donald wanted to learn, and we wanted to learn with him. I will dig up what might be his greatest adventure, <em>Donald in Mathmagic Land</em>, once a year just to remind myself that, yeah, math rules.</p>

<p id="lVGupM">These days, Donald’s mostly a relic, playing second fiddle to Mickey in the rare instances when Disney approves its mascot character for media use. That’s a bummer, and <em>DIY Duck</em> is a great reminder. Today’s more sophisticated toons are often fantastical and larger than life even when speaking to nuanced human experiences. So it’s kinda nice to have a modern short, simple yet stylish in its cartooning, that is about fixing a crack in a wall — something that I, like Donald, would be absolutely terrible at. In a neat throwback, <em>DIY Duck</em> also pays tribute to Donald’s classic rage voice by using archive clips of Clarence “Ducky” Nash, who voiced the character for 50 years.</p>
<p id="9Hm7Ml">While Disney maintains a hand-drawn department, the company mostly deploys it for stunts (like <em>DIY Disney</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23915430/once-upon-a-studio-disney-short-robin-williams-genie-ai">last year’s <em>Once Upon a Studio</em> short</a>) and skeletal work on 3D CG features. During a visit to Walt Disney Animation for 2014’s <em>Big Hero 6</em>, I was fortunate to watch Henn in action, cartooning by hand for a scene that would later be painted over and rendered with the finished CG art. Whether Disney will ever make a new hand-drawn feature — or, heck, a steady stream of Donald shorts! — is unclear, but by keeping Henn and the team on board, the studio implicitly understands the soul of the medium, whether it’s breathing life into 3D characters or reviving a legacy for an act of tribute. I’m just hoping this isn’t the last time we see Donald in this form over the <em>next</em> 60 years.</p>

The demo pulls you into a game that constantly shifts itself in form, taking on the styles of retro games such as Atari’s <em>Adventure</em>. For lovers of classic games and meta-horror, <em>Tormenture</em> is a thrilling experience so far.</p></div><div><p>Release Date: July 25, 2024</p><p>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2596420/Arranger_A_RolePuzzling_Adventure/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2596420/Arranger_A_RolePuzzling_Adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Arranger</em></a></span> is a challenging and extremely adorable entry in the 2024 micro-trend that is “map-based puzzle games.” I don’t know how many games are required for a micro-trend, but between this and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paper-trail-origami-puzzle-game-impressions-1851497194&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paper-trail-origami-puzzle-game-impressions-1851497194"><em>Paper Trail</em></a></span><em> </em>I’m just gonna go with it.</p><p>Like the latter,<em> Arranger</em>’s puzzles revolve around how the player interacts with and shifts the map of the game world. The tile-based maps are shifted as you move, almost like a conveyor built. Move forward and everything in a line moves forward with you until you wrap around the screen. Sliding and arranging (get it) the map to progress forward is a deceptively simple but challenging mechanic that the demo proves is delightful. </p></div><div><p>Release Date: TBD</p><p>If you have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Balatro</em></a></span>-pilled this year and are searching for your next gambling-adjacent gaming fix then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400510/Dungeons__Degenerate_Gamblers/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400510/Dungeons__Degenerate_Gamblers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</em></a></span> is here for you. The roguelike adventure takes the form of gambling against a series of enemies in a tavern, in a game of blackjack (or twenty-one). You pick cards in hopes of getting the highest score without going bust. The twist is that the game isn’t just populated by a normal deck. Tarot, business, library, and note cards are all possible things you can draw, each with their own unique skills. Like <em>Balatro</em>, the random element creates situations in which you must roll with the deck and come up with new solutions to outsmart your enemy.</p></div><div><p>Release Date: August 1, 2024</p><p>I played a press demo for this <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kitsune-tails-retro-platformer-sapphic-super-mario-1851526665&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kitsune-tails-retro-platformer-sapphic-super-mario-1851526665">sapphic <em>Super Mario</em></a></span>-inspired retro-platformer and was charmed by the familiar mechanics and cute queer story. While I had some issues with finicky mechanics and design issues, the public demo fixes at least one of my problems—the invincibility power-up now has a clear indicator of its time limit—so developer Kitsune Games is working to make the game better. The Next Fest demo will give you a short taste of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325260/Kitsune_Tails/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325260/Kitsune_Tails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kitsune Tails</em></a></span>’ beautiful pixelated world and make you fall in love with protagonist Yuzu.</p></div><div><p>Release Date: TBD</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1910600/ONE_BTN_BOSSES/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1910600/ONE_BTN_BOSSES/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>ONE BTN BOSSES</em></a></span> is a boss rush game in which you have a single button to press in each level. Sounds simple, but it isn’t. Each level adds new twists and mechanics to the single-button system. The core gameplay has you controlling a ship on a set track, with the ship moving on its own—you press a button to change direction, but that slows you down. The faster you go the faster you shoot, so it’s all about balancing speed and control as the enemy fires back at you. It’s a tightly designed mechanical marvel and the demo is the perfect taste of what’s to come.</p></div><div><p>Release Date: July 18, 2024</p><p>The beauty of the Soulsike genre is that there are so many variations on the FromSoftware formula. With <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1832040/Flintlock_The_Siege_of_Dawn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1832040/Flintlock_The_Siege_of_Dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Flintlock</em></a></span>, developer A44 is focusing on high mobility, with combat that offers guns, swords, and magic to wield. Verticality is also a unique twist, with special abilities letting you move above enemies to unleash powerful attacks.

So far, the demo delivers an impressive combat system, even if it still has some kinks to work out.</p></div><div><p>Release Date: TBD</p><p>One of the cutest visual novels on offer during Steam Next Fest is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377250/Whimel_Academy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377250/Whimel_Academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Whimel Academy</em></a></span>.

In the demo, you will get a taste of the game’s time management mechanics that have you picking and choosing the classes you want to take, and with whom you want to spend your time. All of this will culminate in what type of witch or wizard you become, as well as any romance you might find yourself in the middle of.</p></div><div><p>Release Date: July 18, 2024</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1519710/SCHiM/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1519710/SCHiM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>SCHiM</em></a></span>’s demo confirms that the 3D platformer is just as charming to play as it is to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/06/an-entire-game-where-you-have-to-keep-to-the-shadows/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/06/an-entire-game-where-you-have-to-keep-to-the-shadows/">look at</a></span>. Set in a monochromatic world of light and shadows, you control a little blob that can only step in the dark shadowy parts of the map. With busy city streets full of cars, pedestrians, strollers, ducks, and more that all create shadows, moving from point A to B becomes an adorable adventure.</p><hr><p>That’s ten picks for what you shouldn’t miss at Steam Next Fest, but it barely scratches the surface of what’s available.

But Iizuka also says that he doesn’t actually “need” a gun because he’s powerful enough on his own. So there’s a bit of conflicting messaging about whether Shadow used guns in the 2005 game because he had to or because he wanted to.</p><p>“Yeah, in the games Shadow did use a gun,” Iizuka said. “But when we talk about Shadow, he would use whatever he needed in the moment to get the job done. So he would pick up a gun or ride a bike in order to get the job done – he’s that kind of character.</p><p>But he’s also extremely powerful on his own and doesn’t really need a gun or anything because he can do it himself – he is a weapon. So as long as there’s no need for Shadow to use a gun, he will probably not use one.”</p><p>Shadow’s levels in <em>Generations </em>do include a ranged attack in the form of his iconic Chaos Spear energy blast, and it functions similarly to how firearms did in the 2005 game. In a sense, it lines up with what Iizuka’s saying here because Shadow doesn’t need a weapon when he’s able to create those attacks himself. But ultimately, let’s just call Shadow’s arsenal in 2005 what it was: a very mid-2000s attempt at creating an edgier tone. It’s fun to look back on, but maybe not something we need to prioritize when looking back at Shadow’s history and recreate in the here and now.</p><p><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on October 25.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/treyarch-found-out-about-black-ops-6-on-game-pass-shortly-before-announcement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>One of the biggest gaming stories of the last month <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-game-pass-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the confirmation</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 would be on Xbox Game Pass day one. It’s the first game in the franchise to come to Microsoft’s subscription service, and it’s apparently something that the team at Treyarch — the developers of Black Ops 6 — didn’t find out that far in advance.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-focuses-on-impressive-games#%C2%A7item-a-cod-q-and-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with Stephen Totilo</a>, Treyarch production director Yale Miller was asked about the game launching on Game Pass and how the meeting with Activision and Microsoft went.</p>



<p>“It wasn’t that long ago, frankly,” Miller said of when the team found out.</p>



<p>He continued: “I think it was a conversation, just internally with meeting with the Activision folks on those pieces, and talking about the opportunity for us. It was more like, ‘What does that mean?’”</p>







<p>Miller then touched on what made the jump to Xbox Game Pass exciting for the developers and the franchise as a whole. He talked about more people being able to try the game that may not have in the first place. There’s also the task of onboarding new players and introducing — or reintroducing — them to game modes.</p>



<p>“It’s been four years since [the last] Black Ops… Zombies is super deep rich,” Miller said. “It’s got quest lines and story. Some people just may not even remember that. With new players, how do you bring people into that universe?</p>



<p>“Sometimes we take for granted that a lot of people play Call of Duty and have been playing Call of Duty before. ‘Oh, they’ll get it. You know, they’ve played this before.’ So I think it has forced us to relook at some of that.”</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. As of publishing, there’s been no announcement whether the game will be available via Cloud gaming, which Ubisoft holds the rights to.</p>

<p>What do you think of the developers at Treyarch not finding out until shortly before the announcement that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 would be on Xbox Game Pass?

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign Teaser | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As seen in the screenshot below, Black Ops 6's Zombies storyline brings the return of Elizabeth Grey, Grigori Weaver, and Mac Carver from Black Ops Cold War's Requiem team, while Maya Aguinaldo is introduced as a new character to complete this cast of four.</p><p dir="ltr">One big complaint from Black Ops Cold War was the odd feeling of disconnect, as the game forced you to play as a BOCW operator skin instead of featuring a cast of story characters with unique voice lines. It also made for awkward moments when a player could exfil from a match as a Samantha Maxis operator skin, after completing the game's final story Easter egg, where Samantha devastatingly sacrificed herself to stop the Forsaken boss.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4316561-bo6-reveal-0282.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316561" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4316561-bo6-reveal-0282.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316561"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6's Zombies cast.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4316561-bo6-reveal-0282.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, Treyarch did <a href="https://x.com/MrDalekJD/status/1799870429470883988" rel="nofollow ">confirm with Call of Duty content creators</a> that players would have a choice in who they played as, allowing for the choice of selecting a story character or a random operator skin from Black Ops 6.</p><p dir="ltr">Playing as part of the Zombies crew comes with the added bonus of immersion and unique character voice lines that include bits of story, while the choice to play as a random operator lets players simply slay the undead as one of the fancy operator skins they unlocked.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Black Ops 6, make sure to check out all of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/">our highlights from the big reveal</a>, including details on the campaign, multiplayer maps, and Treyarch's new omnidirectional movement system.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be released on October 25 across PlayStation, PC, and Xbox, including a launch on Game Pass for day one.</p>

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has explained his point of view regarding the decision-making process behind the recent closure of several studios, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/">including Tango Gameworks</a>, the studio behind 2023's hit rhythm-based action game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hi-fi-rush/">Hi-Fi Rush</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"The closure of any team is hard obviously on the individuals, hard on the team," Spencer said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIpMhthwnto">an interview with IGN</a> following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/">Sunday's Xbox Showcase</a>. I haven't been talking publicly about this because right now is a time for us to focus on the team and the individuals. It's obviously a decision that's very hard on them, and I want to make sure--through severance and other things--that we're doing the right thing for individuals on the team [who have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">been laid off</a>]. It's not about my PR, it's not about Xbox PR, it's about those teams."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Despite being asked specifically about the reasons behind the fate of Tango Gameworks, Spencer kept his answers vague.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the end--I've said over and over--I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and [help it] grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that, frankly, are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make," Spencer explained. "We will continue to go forward, we will continue to invest in what we're trying to go do in Xbox, and build the best business that we can, which ensures we can continue to do shows like the one we just did."</p><p dir="ltr">Throughout the interview, Spencer never once mentioned Tango Gameworks (or Arkane Austin, or any of the other recently shuttered studios) by name.</p><p dir="ltr">"For us, as the organization gets bigger, I think it's just more important that we can take bets together and try to do innovative, creative things, and that will continue to drive us," he added.</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer's words echoed sentiments recently shared by Xbox president Sarah Bond, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-tries-to-defend-shutdown-of-award-winning-hi-fi-rush-studio/1100-6523342/">who replied to questions about the closures</a> with a similar non-answer, saying, "We look at each studio, each game team, and we look at a whole variety of factors when we're faced with making decisions and trade-offs like that. But it all comes back to our long-term commitment to the games we create, the devices we build, the services, and ensuring we're setting ourselves up to be able to deliver on those promises."</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer did, however, give some specifics regarding the company's finances, stating, "We're up double digits every year over the last five years on game sales on Xbox consoles."</p>

The Series X will also get a special edition console in black that comes with 2TB of space and costs $599.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, Xbox stressed these new consoles have "the same speed and performance" as their predecessors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Price-wise, these new consoles are roughly in line with the original $499/$299 pricing of the Series X|S at launch.

While this new Series S costs more, it puts the system closer to parity with its sibling console, albeit at the cost of being unable to play discs.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Handhelds may finally be in Xbox's future">Handhelds may finally be in Xbox's future</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Separately from the showcase, Spencer spoke of a potential Xbox handheld. Reports began circulating before the weekend, and he indicated to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/hbYl4_y7N14">IGN</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> such a device may exist.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think we should have a handheld too," said Spencer. "The future for us in hardware is pretty awesome. We will have a time to come out and talk more about platform, and we can't wait to bring it to you."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of the big three console makers, Microsoft is the only one that's yet to enter the handheld space.

<p data-characters="316" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">On display during both the Guerilla Collective event and the Latin American Games Showcase 2024, <em>Bittersweet Birthday </em>is an action-RPG that fuses <em>Soulslike </em>dodging with bullet hell chaos. The story-driven adventure is aiming for a specific type of challenge, and a demo is now live ahead of a planned Q2 2025 launch.</p> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true">The start of <em>Bittersweet Birthday</em> — which has World Eater Games developing and DANGEN Entertainment publishing — finds you waking up without any memories. As you attempt to flee the dangers lurking in this mysterious location, a voice comes through the speaker system and offers a means of escape. From there you’ll have to pick up the pieces of your past and venture forth through the challenges that await.</p>
 <p data-characters="133" data-current-count="133" data-injectable="false">You can get an idea of how the story unfolds and see some of the promised multi-phase boss battles in the announcement trailer below.</p> <figure data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Bittersweet Birthday - Announcement trailer | PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ve53cyTDuvQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="267" data-injectable="false">The team at World Eater Games first launched an <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bittersweet-birthday-a-game-of-heart-horror--2#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiegogo campaign</a> for <em>Bittersweet Birthday </em>back in August 2021. 341 backers pushed it past its $23,000 goal to make development a possibility, and now you can try it for yourself in a demo that’s live on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1581100/Bittersweet_Birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">Beyond the enigmatic narrative and intense battles, <em>Bittersweet Birthday </em>has a few ways for players to stretch out and relax in its world. There are mini games like darts and gachapon, the latter of which has 48 collectibles to pick up while playing. There are also side quests that give you a chance to hunt down secrets and unlock more Memories. &nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">The team cites a handful of inspirations, including <em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask</em>, <em>Undertale</em>, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-hyper-light-drifter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyper Light Drifter</a></em>, <em>OneShot</em>, and the <em>Monster Hunter </em>series. When <em>Bittersweet Birthday </em>launches next year, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/mtg-secret-lair-x-hatsune-miku-digital-sensation-reveal-release-date/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mtg-secret-lair-x-hatsune-miku-digital-sensation-reveal-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="286" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Wizards of the Coast has revealed the next Hatsune Miku crossover with <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-did-magic-the-gathering-come-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>. It’s yet another Secret Lair drop comprised of six collectible cards that look stunning and will be well worth adding to your decks if you’re quick enough to get a copy of the set. </p> <p data-characters="486" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true">This latest set is called the <em>MTG</em> Secret Lair × Hatsune Miku: Digital Sensation drop. It’s the second collaborative drop between the incredibly popular card game and global digital superstar Hatsune Miku. It’ll be available as part of the Secret Lair Summer Superdrop 2024, which you can pre-order from <strong>June 24, 2024, at 9 AM PT until July 14, 2024, at 11:59 PM PT</strong>. You’ll have to be quick, though, because I suspect this particular set is going to sell out quickly. </p>
 <h2 id="h-mtg-secret-lair-hatsune-miku-digital-sensation-is-all-you-need-for-a-magical-summer-of-tcg" data-injectable="false"><em>MTG</em> Secret Lair × Hatsune Miku: Digital Sensation is all you need for a magical summer of TCG</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">The <em>MTG</em> Secret Lair × Hatsune Miku: Digital Sensation has six new cards for you to add to your collection. As you’d expect, each one is themed around the digital superstar Hatsune Miku. I’ve outlined every card in the set below so you know what to expect. My favorite is the one shown in the image above, Miku, Child of Song.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li>1x Diabolic Tutor</li> <li>1x Chord of Calling</li> <li>1x Child of Alara as “Miku, Child of Song”</li> <li>1x Song of Creation</li> <li>1x Sol Ring</li> <li>1x Thespian’s Stage</li> </ul> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true">If, like me, you haven’t purchased a Secret Lair Superdrop for a while, you should know that Wizards of the Coast changed the system a little while ago. Superdrops and Secret Lair sets, in general, are now no longer printed to demand once a campaign finishes. Instead, there’s a limited number of everything on offer, so you might miss out if you don’t get your order in right away. </p>
 <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="267" data-injectable="false">This <em>MTG</em> Secret Lair × Hatsune Miku: Digital Sensation will almost certainly be a popular one that sells out faster than most. I tend to sit on Secret Lair drops for a while before I decide what I’m getting, but you won’t have that luxury with this one. </p> <figure data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="【LIVE】 M@GICAL☆CURE!

As a collector and art-lover, I adore these cards, but they’ve also opened me up to a library of music that I didn’t know I needed in my life and I love them all the more for that. </p>

Developer Full Circle has shared a fresh update on the next Skate game. While there is still no release date, the team has laid out several tweaks and additions coming to the series, many of which have been developed alongside feedback from various play tests. 
</p>
<p>
First off, the upcoming free-to-play game has a rebuilt Flick-It system in place. The developer said this will ensure each trick "feels as fun and satisfying to perform as ever before".
</p>
<p>
Thanks to this rebuild, in which added upgrades improve a player's accuracy and control, tricks in Skate should be easier than ever. "All of this work has been done with an eye to the future, so we can give the game plenty of room to grow as we add new tricks and techniques down the line," said senior gameplay designer Reid Buckmaster. Additionally, Skate will have a "streamlined" control system, which should make things easier for players to get to grips with.

<p>
Full Circle said while Skate will be fun to play solo, it is best experienced with others, and as such the team is including a number of 'social' features such as collaborative Pop-Up activities. 
</p>
<p>
There are also going to be a number of customisation options, with Full Circle confirming "almost everything" players do in the game will earn awards, which can then be used to change up characters and boards. These awards will also unlock placeable objects that can be popped into the world. 
</p>
<p>
As for its character creator, the team said it is bringing "as many options" as it can to the game, to allow for a more inclusive experience. This includes body shape, height, hairstyles and more. This is so Skate's players can "feel free to be whoever [they] want to be in San Van".
</p>

<p>
Ahead of Skate's release, the team is going to keep listening to its community's feedback. As such, it is encouraging more players to sign up to its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/insider-playtest-registration">Skate Insider program</a>. It confirmed console testing is scheduled for this autumn. 
</p>
<p>
On its eventual release, Skate will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, PC and mobile. Furthermore, it will also have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.

            <p>
This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-games-showcase-black-ops-6-direct-2024">everything shown at the Xbox Showcase last night</a>: one of the best summer preview events in recent years, and one of Microsoft's best ever. </p>
<p>On the one hand, perhaps the trove of upcoming titles should be expected. After all, this is what you <em>should</em> get when you spend nearly $100bn buying up swathes of the games industry. On the other, well, Microsoft has seemed to perenially exist on promising that <em>next</em> year's crop of first-party games will finally be where its acquisition spree pays off, where Game Pass truly hits the big time, and where it at last starts clawing back some market share. </p>
<p>After watching the avalanche of announcements last night (Doom! Gears! Perfect Dark!) alongside everything else we knew was coming (Fable! Indy! More Diablo!) it's hard to see how the next 12 months couldn't make an impact - let alone the boost of launching Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 into Xbox Game Pass. Could Xbox finally feel like it's hitting its stride this console generation, after numerous misfires? Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy to discuss.</p>

<!-- cache hit 103:single/related:cb2d34f057bd2b0b9b8f02cbd2e14037 --><!-- empty -->
<p>The <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/2006-03-20-yet-another-microsoft-portable-media-gaming-device-rumor.html">extremely long-standing rumors</a> regarding Microsoft making a portable game console got a strong shot in the arm over the weekend from none other than Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. Speaking on stage as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbYl4_y7N14">part of an IGN Live interview</a>, Spencer said directly that "I think we should have a handheld, too."</p>
<p>The comment stops just short of an official announcement that Microsoft is actively working on portable gaming hardware for the first time. But if anyone is in a position to make an "I think we should..." into an operational reality, it's Spencer.</p>
<p>"The future for us in hardware is pretty awesome," Spencer continued during the IGN presentation. "And the work that the team is doing around different form factors, different ways to play, I'm incredibly excited about it."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/7/23862655/microsoft-xbox-handheld-editorial-steam-deck">Previous insider reports</a> suggested that Microsoft had at one point prototyped a cloud-focused Xbox handheld sporting a new "lightweight version" of the Xbox UI. Speaking to IGN, though, Spencer suggested any potential portable Xbox would not be a modified version of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/sonys-200-handheld-portal-can-stream-games-from-your-ps5-and-uh-thats-it/">the streaming-only PlayStation Portal</a>.
</p><p>"I like my ROG Ally, my Lenovo Legion Go, my Steam Deck," Spencer said. "I think being able to play games locally is really important."</p>
<h2>We’ve heard it before?</h2>
<p>If Spencer's mention of "different form factors" sounds familiar, that's probably because he said something almost identical <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-sure-seems-to-be-thinking-about-some-sort-of-portable-xbox/">back in February</a> when he told Bloomberg that he "get[s] excited about different form factors that allow people to play in different places." Around the same time, Spencer told the Verge that he was looking at unorthodox ways that Xbox could potentially capture more "player hours," saying:
</p><blockquote><p>So, OK, what keeps people from playing certain hours? Well there’s some sleep, school, and kind of normal life, but some of it is just access. Do I have access to the games that I want to play right now? Obviously we’re kind of learning from what Nintendo has done over the years with Switch, they’ve been fantastic with that. So when I look at Steam Deck and the ROG and my Legion Go, I’m a big fan of that space.</p></blockquote>

<p>Comments like these are a big change from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/ftc-v-microsoft-document-leak-outs-detailed-plans-for-mid-gen-xbox-refresh/">internal Microsoft documents that leaked last September</a>, which listed an Xbox portable as a "current gap in FY23" that is "not in scope for 1st party" (alongside potential products like a mobile controller, earbuds, and a media remote). But Spencer was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/xbox-exec-says-leaked-old-emails-and-documents-have-outdated-info/">quick to call that leak "outdated"</a> at the time, so it might not be the last word on Microsoft's portable gaming plans.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In 2020, former Chief Xbox Officer Robbie Bach <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/microsoft-never-made-handhelds-reason/">said</a> that his tenure—which ended in 2010—included "at least three groups that presented portable Xbox presentations... All three times, we decided not to do it." That feels like ancient history, though, in a world where <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-steam-deck-killing-windows-running-overlords/">everyone</a> and their <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/new-steam-deck-competitor-lets-you-easily-swap-in-more-ram-storage/">corporate subsidiary</a> is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/no-one-needs-this-cryptocurrency-powered-steam-deck-competitor/">looking</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">draft</a> off <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">the market success of the Steam Deck</a>. And if Spencer gets his heart's deepest wish, it seems like Microsoft might be joining them before too long.</p>

                <p>Full Circle, the team behind the highly anticipated Skate reboot, has shared some new information about what players can expect upon its release. This includes a new way to use the iconic Flick-it system, a new approach to soundtracks, and lots of customization options.</p><p dir="ltr">Senior gameplay designer Reid Buckmaster explained in a development update that the studio has "done a ton of work rebuilding Flick-it to ensure that every trick feels as satisfying to perform as ever." Buckmaster explained that the new system will accurately help players perform more-difficult tricks and is meant to be fun and satisfying for everyone.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As the video continued, gameplay software engineer Lance Lawson stated the team has been pushing the limits of the Frostbite engine and has been able to add various new tricks. These include Slappies, Boned Ollies, Quick-Pop Ollies, Wallies, Improved Power Slides, Enhanced Transitions, Pre-Wind Spins, Roll-Ins, Grind Bump-Outs, and Smoother Flip Tricks.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can fully take advantage of San Vansterdam (in-game location) by placing objects where they want via Quick Drops. As they progress through the game, they can unlock various items, including customizations for their character, board, and even new objects to place around the world.</p><p dir="ltr">Another interesting feature that was mentioned during the development update is that the game will be ever-changing. New parts of the city will be added from season to season, and the music will update based on which songs players are listening to the most. Near the end of the video, it was revealed that console players will be able to get their hands on Skate a bit early by signing up to be playtesters this fall.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Skate content, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-everything-we-know-about-the-skate-reboot/1100-6505591/">our story detailing everything we know so far</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Slug Tactics - Official Gameplay Features Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Each playable character can move and shoot in the same turn, and staying on the move grants an important damage reduction modifier that will be essential to staying alive. Each character sports a basic weapon with unlimited ammo, as well as a more-powerful secondary weapon that has limited shots. Ammo for secondary weapons can be replenished by completing specific objectives. Attacking an enemy while another friendly squad member is within striking distance will activate a Sync attack, described as one of the key ways players will be able to dominate the battlefield and maximize the amount of damage they can do each turn.</p><p dir="ltr">By running, gunning, and completing Sync actions, squad members will build up Adrenaline, which can be used to activate powerful special abilities unique to each character. Of course, it wouldn't be a Metal Slug game without the titular armored vehicle, and players will be able to pilot various vehicles, including the Metal Slug, over the course of the game. The Slug uses fuel as a resource, but can attack multiple times as long as it has the required fuel. Fallen squad members can be revived with a 1up token, but players only have a limited number of reinforcements over the course of each set of missions, with more able to be acquired by completing various objectives.</p><p dir="ltr">Metal Slug Tactics, developed by Leikir Studio and published by Dotemu, is slated to release in Fall 2024 on Steam for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p data-characters="223" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Thanks to her ability to deal high Liberation damage, offer a 38% Resonance Skill DMG Deepen buff, and her title as the game’s only shielder, Taoqi can be a great addition to a wide array of teams in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em>. </p> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">But who can benefit the most from her buff? And more importantly, which weapon and Sonata should you pick to potentialize her strengths? For all looking to awaken her true potential as a defensive support, here’s the best Taoqi build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-weapons-for-taoqi-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">The best weapons for Taoqi in Wuthering Waves</h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/the-best-weapons-for-taoqi-in-wuthering-waves.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">As Taoqi’s whole kit scales off Defense, the best weapon for her is the 4-star <strong>Dauntless Evernight</strong>. The weapon earns the spot given its 61.56% DEF substat (at level 90). When using the broadblade, you will also be able to get another 15% boost in the stat by performing her Intro Skill (R1). Using the 4-star Discord can also work, as its Energy Regen value will increase her Liberation availability. </p>
 <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">Dauntless Evernight is also my main F2P pick for Taoqi, as you can find a free copy of it within the Port City of Guixu. The free copy of the weapon will only become available after you complete the We Promise, We Deliver quest. You can check out its exact location in our <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-all-free-5-and-4-star-weapons-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to get all free 5 and 4-star weapons in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> guide.</a> For F2P players looking to get an extra boost in ER, the craftable 4-star Broadblade#41 will be my main pick. </p>
 <h2 id="h-best-sonata-and-echoes-for-taoqi" data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Taoqi</h2> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">The best Sonata for Taoqi is a full <strong>Moonlit Clouds</strong> set. The set shines through its ability to provide a handy amount of ER and further empower her Outro Skill by adding a 22.5% ATK buff to it. As Taoqi’s ability to constantly self-heal will allow you to always proc its buff, a full Rejuvenating Glow set will be my main alternative. </p> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">When using Moonlit Clouds, the best main echo for Taoqi is Impermanence Heron. The echo is a must, as it will allow you to offer a 12% all-damage boost to the character taking the field after her. I recommend that you pair our main pick with two Elites and two Common echoes. If using Rejuvenating Glow, go with Bell-Borne Geochelone as your main.</p>
 <h3 id="h-best-stats-and-substats" data-injectable="false">Best stats and substats</h3> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">As the focus of our build lies in both strengthening her shield and allowing her to deal good damage, I recommend going with Crit Rate as the main stat for your main echo.

After last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-first-look-reveals-companions-and-fan-favourite-returning-character">cinematic trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard which detailed the game's full suite of seven companion characters</a>, today brings our first - albeit very brief - glimpse at actual gameplay.
</p>
<p>
A short clip shared to social media platform X shows series regular Varric in Minrathous, capital of the Tevinter  Imperium region, a location we have heard plenty about - but never seen before in a mainline Dragon Age game.

<p>
Varric is hot on the tail of Solas following the events of Dragon Age: Inquisition, though I imagine things won't be as easy as he makes out here. Minrathous, meanwhile, or the quick glimpse we get of it, looks suitably grim. I'm getting dark Ankh Morpork vibes.

<p>The footage, and an accompanying press release, confirms The Veilguard's player character will be named Rook. </p>
<p>"Dragon Age: The Veilguard features some of the deepest companion storylines in Dragon Age history, navigating romance, tragic loss and complex choices that will affect relationships with players and the fate of The Veilguard," said creative director John Epler. 
</p>
<p>"BioWare's storytelling roots shine through every chapter of this adventure, and we are incredibly excited for Dragon Age fans as well as those new to the series to experience this crafted, character-driven narrative that is so intertwined with our studio's DNA."</p>
<p>
We'll see much more of Dragon Age: The Veilguard tomorrow in BioWare's big gameplay reveal livestream. That's set for 4pm UK time - and you'll be able to watch it right here on Eurogamer.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I hate small talk. I don't feel I'm any good at it. I don't want to engage in it. I practically run from it if I see it coming. But I love talking about big ideas, especially philosophy. Quite obviously, that makes me annoying. I admit it. People minding their own business in a casual setting may feel assaulted by my unprovoked diatribes about Nagel's concept of moral luck, humankind's supposed dominion over other animals, or the virtues of a restorative justice system. Thankfully, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pro-philosopher-2-governments-and-grievances/" data-ref-id="5000-591162">Pro Philosopher 2: Governments and Grievances</a>, everyone in my personal life can enjoy a reprieve from my ceaseless desire to debate and discuss topics like these as I work to beat this game instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Pro Philosopher 2 (PP2) is modeled closely after the Ace Attorney series but recontextualizes Capcom's art style and mechanics to focus on philosophical debates rather than pit players in a court drama. Here you don't present evidence that refutes the claims being spoken from the witness stand; you find holes in the arguments of your verbal sparring partner.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBrzfQsnmQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tFBrzfQsnmQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The first game, which focused on moral philosophy specifically, is on Steam for free following a debut on Kongregate years ago that earned it some cult praise. I came to the series with the upcoming second game, which very pointedly focuses on political philosophy this time around. Because if there's one thing gamers love, it's politics in their games.</p><p dir="ltr">Jokes aside, Pro Philosopher 2 is made for people like me who sincerely <em>do</em> feel that way--and it's also self-aware enough to take digs at itself in the demo I played. The game supposes a metaphysical realm in which you have access to numerous philosophers from world history and you can attempt to unravel their worldviews. In the demo, which is available for a limited time as part of Steam Next Fest starting today, you'll get to take on Machiavelli, author of The Prince, whose might-makes-right philosophy still lingers in our real world all too often today.</p><p dir="ltr">It serves as a strong introduction to the game, because not only will you get to learn the ropes of the game's debate mechanics--in which you ask clarifying and backing questions before challenging your opponent's perspective armed with their own words--but it also quickly becomes obvious how relevant these centuries-old points of view still often are--for better or worse. For those interested in the subject matter but perhaps not as well-versed in it, the game even feels like a strong introduction to the material.</p><p dir="ltr">In my demo level, I had to carefully dissect Machiavelli's words to try and prove why it actually <em>isn't </em>better for a leader to be feared than loved. There were often many wrong answers and few right ones, and each wrong answer would damage my credibility rating like a health bar, which I find to be an awesomely creative way to transpose a debate into a video game.</p><p dir="ltr">The game pairs its Ace Attorney-like 2D cartoonish art with a serious understanding of the subject matter, but even then it doesn't take itself too seriously. When I initially failed to beat Machiavelli in the demo, the characters discussed how it might not be a strong first impression with which to sway me into buying the game, all in a very fourth-wall-breaking manner. And during the course of any debate, you're armed with a secret, albeit ineffective, weapon: You can simply tell your rival they stink. Literally. You can use the "you stink!" reply to resort to the debate tactics of a fourth-grader, and honestly, that's still seen pretty often in modern politics, so I think it's fitting.</p><p dir="ltr">Enjoying the demo for PP2 as much as I did, I'm now looking forward to the full game when it launches later this year, and in the meantime, I'm perhaps even more excited to go back to the first one and argue moral philosophy--which is really where I do my best annoy-everyone-around-me work. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2120070/Pro_Philosopher_2_Governments__Grievances/" rel="nofollow ">try the demo for yourself for a limited time on Steam</a>, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2120060/Socrates_Jones_Pro_Philosopher/" rel="nofollow ">download the original</a>, which is free.</p>

Knowing that that story arc was wrapping up has left the future of the game a little hazy, but we now have a clearer idea of what the next year will look like for Destiny 2, as well as a tease of where things are headed in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie laid out the details of the rest of the year's Destiny 2 content, divided into three big story arcs called Episodes, in a short new vidoc called The Journey Ahead. Mostly, it fills in some story and gameplay details about what each of those episodes will entail, because up until now, we only knew their names and the structure of how Bungie was arranging content going forward.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2 | The Journey Ahead</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Episode 1: Echoes</h2><p dir="ltr">The first episode, Echoes, starts Tuesday, June 11, and deals directly with the aftermath of The Final Shape's conclusion. The Witness, Destiny 2's ultimate antagonist up until now, is defeated, but the paracausal energy it embodied isn't gone. Instead, it mixed with the Light of the Traveler to manifest weird artifacts from the Witness's memory, shooting them out into the solar system. The episodes all deal with the fallout of what those sources of power to do the worlds where they land and the people who find them, with the first one resulting in major shifts to Nessus.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie said that players will head to Nessus to find the echo and discover the location has been physically altered, with the Vex enemies there acting strangely. The episode comes with a new activity, Breach Executable, which Bungie described as an "arena-style offensive" in which you're trying to cap geysers of Radiolaria (otherwise known as "Vex milk") while holding off hordes of enemies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316525-destiny2year10%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316525" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316525-destiny2year10%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316525"></a><figcaption>Strange things are afoot inside Nessus.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316525-destiny2year10%287%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The episode is also going to take players deeper into Nessus to uncover secrets of what used to be there--including, apparently, a whole lost civilization. It looks like that will include more than just a few superficial changes to Nessus as it tells its story. Bungie also teased a new villain who might be behind what's happening with the Vex and said the Vex will exhibit new behavior, changing up how they act in battle.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Episode 2: Revenant</h2><p dir="ltr">The second episode is Revenant, one that deals with Scorn leader Fikrul, otherwise known as the Fanatic. Bungie described the Episode as having a sort of "vampire-hunter" theme, and it'll heavily concern the Fallen, who are finally trying to establish a new permanent home since their own homeworld, Riis, was destroyed by the Witness. Bungie said you'll team up with the Fallen to become a Slayer Baron, essentially a Fallen monster hunter.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316528-destiny2year10%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316528" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316528-destiny2year10%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316528"></a><figcaption>Concept art for Revenant suggests armor inspired by the Scorn and the act of killing monsters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316528-destiny2year10%2810%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In practice, the vampire-hunter theme is informing the armor aesthetic--you look a lot like you're in Bloodborne or the movie Van Helsing. Fikrul also has a Dracula castle, so it sounds like we'll be Castlevania-ing our way through that. As for new gameplay, Bungie mentioned a potion-crafting system, where you'll be able to create potions that provide different combat buffs and influence what loot drops you receive.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Episode 3: Heresy</h2><p dir="ltr">The final episode, Heresy, concerns the Hive. The Final Shape saw Savathun standing as both an ally and an antagonist to the Guardians, and her sister, Xivu Arath, is still out in the universe somewhere as a potential threat. Bungie said the episode is going to shake up the existing relationships in the Hive god pantheon, which sounds ominous and potentially important for Destiny 2's future.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the relevant details of what's taking place: We're headed back to the Dreadnaught, the big Hive battleship that was introduced in Destiny's The Taken King expansion and has been kind of chilling in the orbit of Saturn ever since. It'll have an activity Bungie likened to The Coil from the Season of the Wish, although we don't have many details about how it'll actually work. Bungie referred to an "eldritch force" players will face aboard the Dreadnaught and showed off two armor sets--one that takes cues from resident Hive expert and former Hive god Eris Morn, and another that imagines being a navigator on the Dreadnaught. That last one has the flair of an 18th century officer's uniform from a European navy, but made out of bones.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Destiny 2 Year 11</h2><p dir="ltr">The last thing Bungie did was tease Destiny 2 content in 2025, although it provided precisely zero details about what that might entail. The final screen of the vidoc just listed the name "Codename: Frontiers" with the Destiny 2 logo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316523-destiny2year10%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316523" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316523-destiny2year10%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316523"></a><figcaption>Here is what we know about Year 11: this image.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316523-destiny2year10%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are a couple things to intuit from that slide, at least. First, the use of the Destiny 2 logo might suggest that we're not in for a Destiny 3 anytime soon, despite some rumors to the contrary. To some degree, that make sense--with massive player investment in Destiny 2, rebooting the community in a whole new game has its risks, even if that might help Bungie deal with some of the current game's technical limitations.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the name, Codename: Frontiers might suggest expanding Destiny 2 beyond the solar system, where the game has taken place up until now. Before the original Collapse that kicked off the story and created the world we've been playing in, humanity was trying to expand beyond Sol and out into the rest of the universe, and it would make some sense for the story to go back to that direction, cleaning a lot of the slate for something new. But that's all speculative at this point.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, we at least have a better understanding of where things are going from The Final Shape for the next year. Bungie didn't mention any new dungeons or raids among the episodes, but the Annual Pass that was made available with The Final Shape buys access to a dungeon, so we can expect at least one to pop up sooner or later, too.</p>

<p data-characters="490" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In 2013, Intelligible Games released the <em>Ace Attorney-inspired</em> <em>Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher</em> for web browsers, where instead of catching murderers in over-the-top courtroom dramas, you debated with real-world philosophers from throughout history to deduce the true nature of morality. It saw a full remake on Steam in 2023 but, 10 years after the original, the same team is back with a proper sequel; one that shifts its focus towards that oh so favoured of topics among gamers: politics.</p> <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">Titled <em>Pro Philosopher 2: Governments &amp; Grievances</em>, I was able to test out a short demo ahead of its release as part of Steam Next Fest (it should be available for download by the time you’re reading this). And by short, I do mean short; you can easily clear it in 20 minutes. However, it does succinctly sum up what you can expect from the full game: interesting topics of debate, a fun sense of humour, and a lot of blatant similarities to <em>Ace Attorney</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="1077" data-current-count="1077" data-injectable="true">A part of me feels bad directly comparing <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> to Capcom’s visual novel series, but one look at it and you’ll see <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> doesn’t just wear the <em>Ace Attorney</em> influences on its sleeves; it’s dressed head to toe in them. Not only are its core gameplay mechanics functionally identical, but even aspects of its presentation borrow liberally from <em>Ace Attorney</em>. Characters have exaggerated reactions when taken by surprise, and they let out cries of “Nonsense!” during arguments, which have the same energy as Phoenix Wright’s iconic “Objection!”, right down to the word smacking into the screen in bold red letters. This may risk costing <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> any semblance of its own identity, but it’s clear these similarities come out of reverence for <em>Ace Attorney</em> and not a cynical attempt at copying it in the hopes of recreating its popularity. Plus, as a die-hard <em>Ace Attorney</em> fan myself, I can’t help but crack a smile at the ways <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> lifts elements from Capcom’s work.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Intelligible Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="585" data-current-count="885" data-injectable="true">The thought of a game that requires you to engage in political debates and point out the flaws in each philosopher’s way of thinking sounds like a daunting and difficult task, but it’s easy to get to grips with if you’ve played even one <em>Ace Attorney</em> game. Instead of tangible evidence, you have an idea slate, which holds ideas and concepts you can use to challenge your opponent’s statements, no different to spotting contradictions in an <em>Ace Attorney</em> testimony. Challenging incorrectly will reduce your Credibility, and if that runs out it’s game over. </p>
 <p data-characters="640" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true"> It’s a very simple idea in practice and, much like how you can press for further testimony in <em>Ace Attorney</em>, you can ask for clarification if you think a specific statement is too vague, or ask your opponent to back up their claim with evidence. Doing these can result in new ideas for the idea slate or additional statements. There’s no punishment for using the Clarification and Backing options on every statement, which is perfect for the most cautious of players (you’ll also get some amusing dialogue out of it). And reaching the end of a statement earns you a slight hint on what to do should you be completely lost.</p>
 <p data-characters="727" data-current-count="727" data-injectable="true">I got to grips with the demo incredibly easily, but I have to imagine the full game will prove far more challenging. One extra gameplay mechanic is alluded to but isn’t featured in the demo, and given the very nature of the political debate and its complexities, there could be some real head-scratching puzzles that’ll leave more than a fair share of players stumped. It’s obviously too soon to tell how these will be handled, and whether the difficulty will be fairly balanced or not. At the very least, the <em>Ace Attorney</em>-esque presentation and fun banter between protagonist Ari and her fellow cast members should keep you engaged, and may even help you learn some new things about the history of politics.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Intelligible Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="740" data-current-count="1040" data-injectable="true"><em>Pro Philosopher 2</em>‘s slightly goofy sense of humour won’t be for everyone, but it definitely got some light chuckles out of me. Mostly from how it portrays actual philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli as this arrogant genius, regularly cracking a smug smile as he lords his superior intellect. Liberties are absolutely going to be taken with how these real-world figures are depicted, but it makes for an entertaining experience nonetheless. You also have the option during debates to just insult your opponent with a “You stink!,” which is designed to never work and cost you credibility. Yet I can see players using it anyway if only to see how each philosopher reacts to being dragged into your average Twitter argument.</p>
 <p data-characters="1132" data-current-count="1132" data-injectable="true">What will likely make or break <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em>, however, is exactly how it handles its choices of debate topics. Based on the demo, it fortunately doesn’t feel as if it will try and pursue a neutral stance throughout. Machiavelli argues in favour of blatant totalitarianism, believing a stable state of government is only possible with a single ruler in charge; one untethered by pesky morals. I like to think we can all agree that’s an awful idea, and it’s one Ari (and by extension the game and the development team) completely refute, but will this same approach be taken with future debates? What if the game requires the player to make an argument they fundamentally don’t agree with? Will <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> even broach the more controversial topics, or will it play things safe and stick to dismantling outdated or unpopular arguments that don’t hold water in the 21st century? It’s a tricky balancing act, though I’d rather see the game take at least some kind of stance instead of flaking out at the last minute and pulling some “all sides are equally valid” nonsense.</p>
 <p data-characters="948" data-current-count="948" data-injectable="false">Regardless, <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> is one to watch for anyone with an interest in visual novels, logic puzzles, and/or political discourse that doesn’t quickly devolve into hurling slurs at one another. It sounds like it’ll be a pretty meaty experience too, with it promising more philosopher opponents than the five its predecessor had, though an exact number hasn’t been confirmed. A couple of examples shown in trailers are 17th century Englishman John Locke (who looks delightfully foppish) and Chinese philosopher Confucius, so there’s already some decent variety to the kind of views that players will need to engage with. Mechanically, <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> seems perfectly sound, and building a game all around political debate, especially in the current climate, is a gutsy decision I applaud Intelligible Games for making. I just hope it has actually interesting or insightful things to say about its various debate topics.</p>

These new features now live in the first-person shooter over two years after it launched aim to provide players with an easy way to report it.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/battlefield/battlefield-2042/voice-chat-moderation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA’s help page</a>, the company said voice chat moderation is used when reviewing reports of “harmful or offensive” voice chat, so its support teams can “action the reports appropriately.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here’s how it works: when you report a player, EA’s support team automatically receives a recording of the session you wish to report. Then, after evaluating the recording, the support team will make a decision according to EA’s Positive Play Charter and “enforce a solution.”</p><p>As outlined by EA, here’s how to report someone through Battlefield 2042’s Squad and Players list:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Open the Pause menu.</li><li>Choose Squad and Players.</li><li>Select the player’s name on the list.</li><li>Choose More.</li><li>If you want to report them, select Report.</li><li>Select Abusive Voice Chat.</li></ul><p>If you just want to block the player, follow the same steps above, select Block, and then confirm when you’re asked to. Blocked players are also muted for you in voice and text chat.</p><p>It’s worth noting that you can’t turn voice chat moderation off, but you <em>can</em> choose not to use voice chat when you play. EA said this is “to protect players.”</p><p>The expectation is this new voice chat moderation feature will be used in future Battlefield games. In April, EA announced that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-season-7-motive-connected-battlefield-universe">Battlefield 2042 Season 7 is officially its last</a>, with development of the Connected Battlefield Universe now in full swing. Battlefield general manager Byron Beede explained that it's time for the franchise to "turn from the present to the future." To that end, he said, EA would continue to support Battlefield 2042 with "in-game challenges, events, modes, and of course, ongoing maintenance," but would move away from a seasonal structure when Season 7 wraps up this month.</p><p>Season 7 marks the end of Battlefield 2042's comeback trail after its disappointing release back in 2021, which saw <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-review"><u>fans and critics pan its 128-player matches and its Specialist system</u></a>, among other things. In the years since it has managed to rehabilitate its reputation somewhat, though it still sits at Mixed on Steam.</p><p>EA has a number of developers working on future Battlefield projects, including a team at Dead Space remake maker EA Motive, Ripple Effect, DICE, and Criterion.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

More details about Black Ops 6 multiplayer will arrive during the Call of Duty Next event on August 28, but it's uncertain if this will include any information for Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Here we highlight all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/">major announcements from the Black Ops 6 reveal</a>, which includes campaign details, more information on the movement system, and the first look at Zombies mode. Black Ops 6 is also revealed to include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-will-let-players-customize-the-hud-like-never-before/1100-6524099/">more HUD customization than ever before</a>.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on October 25, and it will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-leak-reveals-its-coming-to-game-pass-day-one/1100-6523742/">available on Game Pass</a> for day one.</p>
