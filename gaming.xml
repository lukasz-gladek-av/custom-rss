It’s still possible that large waves could affect a huge number of countries, as far afield as China, New Zealand and Peru, and 13 foot waves have affected parts of Russia. However, even tsunamis have, so far, been minor. Despite this, evacuations are vital, with reports that waves <em>could</em> reach 10 feet in Japan. As such, <em>Elden Ring</em> developers FromSoftware have left their offices and canceled July 31's planned release of Patch 1.02.</p><p>“Due to the tsunami warning following the earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula,” reads FromSoft’s statement, “we have decided to postpone the distribution of the ‘<em>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN</em>’ Patch 1.02, which was scheduled for today to tomorrow, July 31 (Thursday) after 10:00CEST / 1:00 PDT.”</p><p>Duo Mode was due to add the ability to play <em>Nightreign</em> in pairs, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mode-option-patch-1-02-ps5-1851786981">a feature fans have been begging for since the game’s release</a></span>. The game was launched designed to be played in groups of three, which is an unusual group size for multiplayer gaming, and clearly far harder to pull together than just partnering up. The lack of a two-player mode felt even more strange, though, given you could also play solo. Two days after the game came out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-mod-seamless-coop-pc-1851783200">a modder created an unofficial two-player option</a></span>, demonstrating it was certainly possible. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FromSoftware said at the time</a></span> that not including duos was rather oddly “overlooked during development,” and that the game had only been balanced for three-player play.

            <p>The team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> - that is to say, the wildly popular trading card mobile game - has released a statement apologising to its community following a report that highlighted a piece of fan artwork which had been copied to create a card, saying it was provided "incorrect reference materials".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a Pokémon fan artist posted some comparison images of their own artwork of Legendary bird Ho-Oh next to an image of an upcoming card from Pokémon TCG Pocket's 2025 expansion, which had been datamined. This datamined card showed the Pokémon in the same pose as the fan artwork, with others surmising that the image had been traced (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-claims-pokmon-tcg-pocket-features-a-design-traced-from-fan-art-creators-point-out-that-pokmons-legal-terms-likely-allow-the-company-to-monetise-any-fan-made-content-it-wants">IGN</a>).</p><p>

You can see the two images below, with the fan art on the right:

<p>Now, the Pokémon TCG Pocket team has released a statement about its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-trading-card-pocket-gets-new-johto-themed-packs-alongside-trading-update">upcoming expansion Wisdom of Sea and Sky</a>, writing:</p>
<p>"It has come to our attention that there was a production issue regarding the illusion of Ho-Oh featured in the immersive card artwork for Ho-Oh EX (3-star) and Lagia EX (3-star).</p>
<p>"After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect reference materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards."</p>

<p>As such, the developer has said it will now replace these cards with placeholders for the time being, while it works to provide new artwork as soon as it is able. It will also conduct further investigations "to ensure no similar issues" are present elsewhere within the game itself.</p>
<p>"To all our players who have been looking forward to this expansion, and to the talented illustrators who bring the Pokémon world to life, we deeply apologise for any inconvenience this has caused," the developer wrote. "We take this matter very seriously and are committed to strengthening our quality control process to prevent this from happening again."</p>
<p>The Pokémon TCG Pocket closed by thanking its community for their understanding and patience, as well as the continued support. "We remain dedicated to delivering an experience that you can enjoy," it said.</p>

            <p>There are some mods that you need to read up on before you understand why you might want to give them a whirl. There are some mods with which that process can be accomplished via a single GIF. A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> work that makes it possible to hilariously reduce the contents of Cyrodiil's cities to chunks of flying rubble just by slapping buildings with spells is firmly in the latter camp.</p>
<p>Before you get too worried about the karmic balance of the modding wizard powerful enough to make this sort of wanton destruction possible, it's worth bearing in mind that they've previously given players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-gets-fallout-4-style-building-from-modder-who-wants-to-collaborate-on-a-full-settlement-system">the ability to build new homes</a> any displaced citizens could probably move into.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prolific Oblivimaster tweaker MadAborModding, whom <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-modder-delivering-fallout-4-style-settlement-building-reckons-the-game-could-still-usher-in-a-modding-renaissance">we interviewed about his work earlier this month</a>, has clearly been busy since that point. His latest mod, as its name on Nexus Mods yells in all caps, lets you <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4943?tab=description">DESTROY BUILDINGS</a>. I usually like text to keep the hollering to a minimum, but honestly I think he's earned it here.</p>
<p>As the GIFs on the mod page and the below showcase video from Reddit show off, the modder's developed a means of getting Oblivion Remastered's buildings to hilariously explode into bits when you fire spells at them. It's glorious. Well, unless you're an NPC living in some stone tower that's just been uprooted and sent spinning into the sky.</p>
<p>"This is only possible because of Unreal, the creation engine in any other Bethesda game wouldn't let you do this," the building batterer wrote in the thread below the video, "But in unreal, all you gotta do is flip a few true/false flags."</p> 
<p>Don't worry, though, the effects of any impromptu demolition you get up to aren't permanent, with everything resetting to normal when you next hit a loading screen. On one hand, that's maybe disappointing if you're eyeing up a playthrough in which, to paraphrase Walter White, you are the Oblivion Crisis. Though, given how much lobbing staircases into the stratosphere would inconvenience the story, I reckon MadAborModding's right to pitch this as temporary fun.</p>
<p>That said, he sounds like he's far from done working on it. Future plans include giving buildings their own health stats and a visible health bar, as well as letting you hack chunks out of them with non-magical attacks. That'd bring the mod closer to a full-blown house fighting experience, something I didn't know I wanted in Oblivion, but now definitely do.</p>
<p>The option to limit the destruction to specific areas of the game is also in the works. As of right now, the mod comes with its own optional tweaking menu thanks to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4810">Mad Mod Config Menu</a>, in case you fancy messing with the explosion radius or enabling anti-gravity.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the mod a go, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a> is a hard requirement. I wish your hardware the best in coping with the amount of fireplaces that're about to be whizzing around the Imperial province.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-mod-delivers-tamrielic-teardown-by-letting-you-blow-buildings-to-bits-with-plans-for-full-blown-house-fighting]]></content:encoded>

As a result, both cards have been replaced with a temporary placeholder that the team is actively working to replace with new artwork as soon as it’s ready.”</p><p>It sounds like well-loved illustrator Sie Nanahara was provided references either by Creatures Inc (the team behind <em>PTCG</em> art) or DeNA (the developers of this app) that included fan-made art, rather than previous official Pokémon artworks. This explanation lifts responsibility from the artist which—as we’d suggested previously—would have been a very surprising move by a very established creator. </p><p>“Immersive cards” are the animated collectibles that appear in every set of the digital card game. They are one of the top selling-points of the app, offering magical cards that play out beautiful animated sequences when clicked on. As a committed player, I’ve collected all of the previous immersive cards (finally got Celestial Guardian’s Solgaleo’s Lillie card yesterday after months of trying), and so know that these being missing from the new set is a pretty big deal for players.</p><p>It also means that replacing them is no easy feat. <em>PTCG Pocket</em> uses a mix of freshly commissioned art and classic cards, and in pretty much any other circumstance could have switched the affected artwork out with anything from the colossal archive. However, given the Ho-Oh and Lugia cards are animated, these will take vastly longer to create, often requiring enormous artworks for the camera to pan around, or complex 3D animations. Neither can be rustled up in an afternoon.</p><p>Unfortunately, the “temporary placeholder” in question is literally just some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/nintendaan.com/post/3lv64qgtsyc2b&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/nintendaan.com/post/3lv64qgtsyc2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“coming soon” text</a></span>. When “played” it just shows a black rectangle.</p><p>So far, I’ve not seen any accusations made regarding the Lugia immersive card, although suspect that it’s been removed at the same time as a precaution. While no blame is being placed on the artist, it makes sense to be concerned that the same issues could have arisen for both cards given they came from the same creator.</p><p>The Chinese artist whose work was copied has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a statement</a></span> regarding the issue as well, albeit an ambiguous one, referring to a past commission but not who commissioned the work. “I solely delivered commissioned 2D artwork,” he says in his own translation, “with no involvement in subsequent model production, sales, or profit sharing. This revealed past gaps in copyright awareness.” He added “profound gratitude” that the artwork had been removed.</p><p>The artist responsible for the immersive cards, Sie Nanahara, has yet to make any statements, and hasn’t responded to a request for comment.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-art-plagiarism-card-apology-1851787290]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Despite reports to the contrary, it doesn't look like Battlefield 6 will cost $80 after all, as publisher EA is shunning the move to that kind of pricing for its games, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>Following EA's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx">latest financial report</a>, CEO Andrew Wilson took part in an earnings call with investors, where the company exec was asked about other publishers releasing $80 games, like Nintendo did with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>"We're not looking to make any changes on pricing at this stage," Wilson replied, adding EA already offers "a fairly broad pricing scheme across our various products" (transcribed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-no-80-games-for-now-were-not-looking-to-make-any-changes-at-this-stage">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Continuing, Wilson said: "When you think about everything from free-to-play through to our premium products and deluxe editions, our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value.</p>
<p>"We'll continue to look at opportunities to deliver great value to our players through various pricing schemes over the course of time, but no dramatic changes planned yet."</p>
<p>During the same call, it was confirmed that EA had not factored in any price changes to its  current fiscal year earnings guidance, meaning games releasing prior to March 2026 aren't expected to retail for $80. That includes Battlefield 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-details-including-an-october-release-date-leak-ahead-of-official-reveal">which was recently suggested to be releasing with an $80 price tag attached</a>.</p>
<p>The conversation around game pricing has been more prevalent in recent times. Earlier this year, Gearbox's Randy Pitchford made waves when he suggested that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">if you were a true fan you would purchase Borderlands 4 whatever the price may be</a>. This comment was met with backlash, so the Gearbox exec then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">attempted to justify his comments with a video</a> shared on social media. Here, he admitted he did not know how much Borderlands 4 would cost. More recently, we found out Borderlands 4 will actually sell for $70, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/randy-pitchford-stoked-about-borderlands-4s-70-price-point-confirms-tonne-of-dlc-on-the-way">Pitchford is "stoked" about that</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just last week, Microsoft walked back on its previous decision to hike the price of its new first-party Xbox games up to $80 this 'holiday season', saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-bullishly-hiking-xbox-games-to-80-microsoft-confirms-u-turn-starting-with-the-outer-worlds-2">it's sticking to a lower price point "in line with current market conditions"</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-may-not-be-80-after-all-as-ea-shuns-higher-priced-games-for-now]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Microsoft has been heavily criticized by some of its fans for sharing Xbox exclusives with rival platforms like Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Switch consoles. On one hand, this has inevitably aggravated the issue of Xbox hardware sales, which have admittedly been on the decline for some time. On the other hand, though, the change of policy appears to be starting to pay dividends for the Redmond-based giant.</p>



<p>Mat Piscatella, Executive Director &amp; Video Game Industry Analyst at Circana (formerly NPD), has shared the following chart from the firm's upcoming Q2 Games Market Dynamics report <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3luzr5q2qac27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on BlueSky</a>:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Q2 2025 Top 10 Best-Selling Games on PlayStation Platforms</td><td>(Physical and Full Game Digital from digital data sharing publishers in the Digital Leader Panel)</td><td> Ranked on Dollar Sales </td><td>Reporting Period: April 6-July 5</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rank</strong></td><td><strong>Last Quarter Rank</strong></td><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td><strong>Publisher</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>NEW</td><td>Forza Horizon 5</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>NEW</td><td>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>MLB: The Show 25</td><td>Sony (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>NEW</td><td>Doom: The Dark Ages</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>NEW</td><td>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>13</td><td>Minecraft</td><td>Microsoft (Corp)</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</td><td>Ubisoft</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>Take-Two Interactive</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>WWE 2K25</td><td>Take-Two Interactive</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>In Q2 2025, Microsoft practically dominated the PlayStation Top 10 chart in the United States with five games: the evergreen Minecraft, the steady <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, and the newly released ports of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. The Top 10 chart is completed by Sony's MLB: The Show 25 (also a multiplatform game), Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows, another evergreen (Grand Theft Auto V), and WWE 2K25.</p>



<p>It could even be argued that the revenue Microsoft is getting from PlayStation (and Nintendo) platforms will essentially cover the lost revenue caused by putting those games on Game Pass on Microsoft's Xbox and PC. In that light, the switch to multiplatform might suddenly be much more palatable.</p>



<p>Circana has also shared the overall Top 10 best-selling games in the United States this past month:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rank</strong></td><td><strong>Last Month Rank</strong></td><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td><strong>Publisher</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Elden Ring: Nightreign</td><td>Bandai Namco Entertainment</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>NEW</td><td>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</td><td>Sony</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>NEW</td><td>Mario Kart World</td><td>Nintendo</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</td><td>Microsoft</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>185</td><td>Stellar Blade</td><td>Sony</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>Forza Horizon 5</td><td>Microsoft</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>MLB: The Show 25</td><td>Multiple Video Game Publishers</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>Minecraft</td><td>Multiple Video Game Publishers</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>Take-Two Interactive</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>NEW</td><td>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</td><td>Marvelous Entertainment</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <p>FromSoftware has postponed its next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> update due to a tsunami warning.</p>
<p>The update was initially meant to go out today, 30th July, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-duo-mode-is-finally-on-the-way-with-release-date-confirmed">introduce the much sought after two-player mode</a>, as well as some UI improvements and more Relics filtering options. However, following the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c3r4x9yrrg4t">recent earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula</a> - which has seen the cancellation or postponement of several other events, as well as evacuations in some parts of the US west coast and Japan - the developer has pushed the release of the update back.</p>
<p>Instead, the update - known as Patch 1.02 - will now live tomorrow, 31st July. It is scheduled for after 9am UK time.</p>

<p>Additionally, the second cycle of Elden Ring Nightreign's Everdark Sovereign event, which was initially planned to go live following patch 1.02's release, has also been delayed until "after the update file has been distributed".

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/keychron-k2-he-keyboard-review.1256796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>A good keyboard is essential if you spend any time at all with your desktop or laptop. Whether you’re about to write the next Game of Thrones – I mean, somebody should – or you’re trying to get into the Platinum club in Overwatch 2, these are keys that you’re going to press hundreds of thousands, if not millions of times. As such, they’d better feel pretty damn amazing, and, as a starting point, the Keychron K2 HE nails the introduction.</p>
<p>The Keychron K2 HE is a 75% Wireless Magnetic Switch Keyboard. 75% referring to the reduced footprint that does away with the additional keypad, and shuffles the surrounding keys a bit closer together, while retaining all of a keyboard’s core functionality. Our review unit was the K2 HE Special Edition, which boasts a black and brown colour scheme, with premium-feeling rosewood trim and RGB lighting. The regular edition initially looks more restrained, but benefits from shine-through keycaps that let your RGB colours shine through the lettering.</p>



<p>The K2 HE Special Edition is fitted with Nebular Linear Gateron magnetic switches and Hall Effect sensors, hopping onto the same trend that has come to dominate pro controllers in the last few years, and using magnetic fields as opposed to metal contacts to detect when a key is depressed, removing a point of wear from the equation as there’s less friction between internal components, and allowing for more customisation potential.</p>
<p>Gateron switches have also come to the forefront of switch tech thanks to their incredibly smooth actuation, and the properties of these particuar linear key switches with dual rails lives up to that. In some circles, they’re even thought to eclipse the Cherry line of mechanical switches which have been the apex predator of the keyboard world for many years. In use? The Gateron keys feel and sound absolutely amazing.</p>

<p>They make the Keychron K2 HE immediately satisfying to use, and every key press feels assured and comfortable. It’s hard to express just how different they feel over regular button tech, or mechanical keys, but placing your fingers on them feels more like an elaborate dance than mashing buttons together, making typing and gaming feel exceptionally smooth.</p>
<p>Besides the fantastic feel of the keys themselves, the Keychron K2 HE boasts a 1000hz polling rate, which means that it ‘speaks’ to your computer multiple times in a fraction of a second. The result is improved response time, and through several Overwatch 2 sessions I felt lightning fast, or, at least, as fast as my ageing fingers will go. This is a decidedly understated keyboard for gaming, but it’s got the technical chops to make it an excellent choice for people who want a more mature look for their gaming setup.</p>

<p>The one potential downside is that the frame of the Keychron K2 HE is surprisingly thick, raising the overall profile of the keyboard by a few millimetres beyond my current FNATIC setup. Through extended typing, I did find myself wanting a wrist rest, though I didn’t notice the need during gaming sessions, presumably due to the set position I hold my hand and arm in. It’s worth considering whether you’ll need a wrist rest based on your own use case, but I wouldn’t be surprised to discover that you do.</p>
<p>The Keychron K2 HE is set up initially for use with a Mac, and thanks to that, all the buttons are suitably Apple-flavoured when you take it out of the box. Keychron do however give you a full set of replaceable buttons to match with Windows, and they’re semi-easy to remove and replace.</p>
<p>There’s an included tool that’s supposed to clip onto the key cap and let you pull it up, but I didn’t have the best experience with it. I found instead that it was just easier to use it as a lever, and the caps come off easily enough, while replacing them with the new cap is a doddle. It’s nice to have the choice, but I wouldn’t want to hop back and forth between Windows and Mac platforms too often, thanks to the slight faff, and ultimately each time you do it you run the risk of scratching the keys.</p>
<p>One of the most welcome innovations in gaming and PC peripherals is the move to web configurators that let you configure your device through your browser, rather than downloading a separate app. Keychron’s implementation is spot on, and from here you can remap keys, create macros, and setup the RGB lighting, giving you full control over the K2 HE with as little fuss as possible. More of this, please.</p>

<p>What’s particularly special about Hall Effect keyboard, though, is that unlike with mechanical, optical or – <em>shudder</em> – membrane keyboards, you can customise the actuation point. The point at which depressing a key is recognised by the keyboard is set not by those physical contacts, or the point at which light passes through a cut out of plastic, but just by the change in magnetism, and that can be incredibly precise. Of a total 4mm of travel, you can configure the Nebular Linear Gateron keys to trigger from anywhere between 0.5mm and 3.8mm. That can allow for exceptionally shallow key presses that can, frankly, be completely impractical.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of other features built around this, including <span data-pf-type="Text">Last Keystroke Prioritization (LKP) and Snap Click – somewhat controversial “Snap Tap” features that are banned in some games – having multiple actions triggered by a half and full press of a key, and even a full-on analogue mode that can be like a gamepad trigger in a racing game.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chrono-odyssey-will-revamp-pretty-much-everything-following-first-closed-beta.1256793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming MMORPG Chrono Odyssey recently held the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-mmorpg-to-hold-limited-time-steam-cbt-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first limited-time Closed Beta test on Steam</a>, and the first impressions weren't exactly lavish in praise. The game featured several performance, balance, and polish issues, all of which are being addressed by South Korean developer Chrono Studio.</p>



<p>This morning, the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2873440/view/532104920883537322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> the second part of its CBT Notes. Earlier this month, they had addressed some key concerns regarding animation and combat responsiveness and performance, promising the addition of popular upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR.</p>



<p>Today, though, the studio addressed in great detail the changes coming to most of the systems seen in the Chrono Odyssey beta. For combat, input responsiveness is being significantly improved through several tweaks, including better client-server packet transmission and optimized network performance. Hit reactions will occur more frequently and include knockback effects, making them easier to recognize; the duration of crowd control effects (CC) will be increased to 2-4 seconds, allowing more opportunities for follow-up attacks. Damage feedback is also being enhanced, with new hit reaction animations added based on the type of enemy attack, improving the visibility of effects like stagger and knockback, and sound and camera effects introduced to improve the feeling of impact. Weapon sweeping will feel faster, too, thanks to a shortened buffer window.</p>



<p>The skill system is also changing. Each weapon will support four combat styles, and skills across different weapons will synergize. A skill tree node system called Matrix will be added to provide different progression paths for all these playstyles. Needless to say, all classes in Chrono Odyssey will have to be rebalanced following this change.</p>



<p>Monster AI will be improved to ensure monsters respond more effectively to ranged attacks, and Chrono Studio is also planning to smooth those frankly ridiculous difficulty spikes that players ran into during the Closed Beta. </p>



<p>Even the game world is changing. Visually, region-specific features such as swamps, misty forests, wildflower fields, and grasslands will strengthen visual identity, and a dynamic grass system will be implemented, and the wind system will be improved to create immersive environmental interactions.</p>



<p>To make exploration more rewarding, the team plans to increase content density and introduce new exploration elements, such as themed caves, narrative encounters, and gathering opportunities at points of interest (POIs). New Dynamic Quests and Chain Quests will also be added, with hidden rewards such as rare achievements and exclusive titles as incentives to explore.</p>



<p>Beyond the main questline, meaningful events and quests are being introduced to Chrono Odyssey with unique, memorable characters tailored to each region. Certain quests will even offer player choices that influence their progression and conclusion. </p>



<p>Expedition Dungeons will include randomized elements to make each run unique. Depending on the path taken, players may encounter different bosses, treasure chests, and other events, creating a more dynamic experience. Replayability will be encouraged as well with the introduction of additional rewards for completing the same dungeon multiple times.</p>



<p>There's also a veritable mountain of smaller tweaks to the user interface, crafting system, tutorials, and social systems. While it's fantastic that Chrono Studio has addressed the user feedback in such amazing depth and is willing to improve the game in many core areas, the downside of that is the near-inevitable delay. Chrono Odyssey is currently still slated for 2025, but with all these changes on the way and the prospect of <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-qa-multiple-closed-beta-tests-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future beta tests</a> to evaluate them, it seems obvious that the game won't be released this year. Still, better to wait for a solid product than rush something out.</p>

<p>This bumps this Switch title up to Version 1.2.1 and follows on from a Switch 2 game update at the beginning of last month. Here's the full rundown via Nintendo's support page:</p>

<p>Nintendo has been busy this week with all sorts of updates, and yesterday it released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> for Switch Online's Super Nintendo app.</p>
<p>More details about this latest update have now emerged, and apart from being able to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/psa-you-can-now-remap-super-nes-controls-with-nintendo-switch-online">remap the buttons in this specific library</a>, it seems the CRT filter on this app has also received an update.</p>
<p>The filter update is apparently designed to better capture what the original experience on the SNES was like on older television sets. There are already some before-and-after comparisons doing the rounds online.</p>
<p>Polygon has actually showcased this "improved CRT filter" and just how "transformative" it is in a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/617241/nintendo-classics-snes-crt-filter-retro-games-how-to-turn-on">series of screenshots</a>. You can also see more comparisons like this on social media and elsewhere online:</p>





<p>This follows on from Nintendo releasing a similar update for the Nintendo 64 app alongside the launch of the Switch 2 and the GameCube library.</p>
<p>Once again, the latest update for the SNES app is part of the Mario Paint game drop this week, which also includes mouse control and Joy-Con 2 mouse mode support.</p>

Now, 27 years later, history repeats itself with <em>R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</em>. With its tight level design, three selectable ships, powerful Delta Attacks, and the brilliant Force mechanic, this new edition proves that gaming classics of this caliber are truly timeless. If you played <em>R-Type Delta</em> back in the day, this is the perfect opportunity to return to its dark science fiction <a title="Genres > Action [2,893 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>. If you’ve never experienced this essential piece of gaming history before, now is the time.</p><p><strong>Sharper Than Ever</strong></p><p><em>R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</em> features high-resolution graphics that hone the polygonal edges of this <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [48,105 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> masterpiece until they’re sharp enough to cut glass. You simply haven’t experienced <em>R-Type Delta</em> until you’ve played it in high definition! Of course, the game also comes equipped with modern quality-of-life improvements.</p><p><strong>Environmental Storytelling</strong></p><p>What has always made <em>R-Type Delta</em> so fantastic is its dark, eerie atmosphere. Shoot-’em-ups are not typically known for storytelling, but <em>R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</em> excels with its simple, minimalist environmental storytelling, characteristic of the late ’90s. It’s a narrative that is as fascinating as it is unsettling, as adrenaline-pumping as it is deeply disturbing. And all this without a single word being spoken.</p><p><strong>The Meaning of Delta</strong></p><p>The name “Delta” carries several meanings. Firstly, the Greek letter delta resembles a triangle, which coincidentally has as many sides as there are playable ships in the game. It is also the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet, and <em>R-Type Delta</em> is the fourth game in the <em>R-Type</em> series. Additionally, the delta triangle is the simplest type of polygon, which is fitting since <em>R-Type Delta</em> was the first game in the series to use three-dimensional polygon graphics instead of two-dimensional <a title="Companies > sprite [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sprite">sprite</a>s.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>The year is 2163, and the badly damaged R9 <a title="Companies > Arrowhead Game Studios [26 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead</a> fighter has just returned to Earth after its mission to destroy the Bydo Empire. The vessel is rescued by the battle-cruiser Croque-Monsieur and transported to an orbital space station. One year later, astronomers in Central Asia observe mysterious objects falling from the sky, and moments later, control is lost over the orbiting annihilation platform Moritz-G. This high-tech machine, capable of destroying the entire planet, descends over a city and levels it to the ground. Although its planet-destroying weapons have not yet been activated, its advanced defense systems make Moritz-G virtually impossible to approach. A desperate military operation is launched, and the prototype ship R9aII Delta is deployed to resolve the situation. Thus begins the epic battle that is <em>R-Type Delta</em>!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo just reversed course on one of its most controversial changes to <em>Mario Kart World</em>, sorta. The Switch 2 maker just buffed the appearance rate of three-lap courses after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-notes-random-online-switch-2-1851785133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-notes-random-online-switch-2-1851785133">previously nuking a sneaky workaround</a></span> players had been exploiting to avoid the new game’s in-between driving sections. Somehow that’s not even the biggest change in the game’s first major update since launch. The Switch 2's biggest exclusive is back on the menu. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Mario Kart World </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 1.2.0</a></span> includes new features, lots of game tweaks, and some massive rebalancing. One thing that might bring back some lapsed players is this patch note: “Increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in ‘VS Race’ and wireless races.” Fans are taking that to mean that traditional three-lap stages will be more frequent, including when playing online. </p><p>A big criticism of the game has been throwing lots of straightaway, interstitial courses into the mix that just have players racing between the actual tracks they want to play on. When<em> Mario Kart World</em> first released, choosing “random” while playing online automatically removed these tracks from the selection pool. The community’s preference was so strong it became common to see all 24 players in a race choose random. So, Nintendo being Nintendo, they got rid of that workaround in an apparent attempt to “force” fans to play <em>Mario Kart World</em> “the right way.” </p><p>The company now seems to have backed off a bit, though it’s anybody’s guess whether it was “bullied” into accommodating players’ preferences or simply wanted to try and fix how the random selection option worked without making everyone extra miserable. In any case, <em>Mario Kart World </em>version 1.2.0<em>&nbsp;</em>is so big, that’s not even the most consequential part of the update. Far from it, in fact.</p><p>“Made COM weaker in everything other than ‘Battle,’” reads a major change that’s already rippling throughout the community with fans unsure whether to embrace the difficulty nerf or call for an unofficial “hard” mode to return. Grand Prix and Knockout races could get pretty gnarly at 150cc (a 200cc mode doesn’t exist in the game yet, though many suspect it will get added at some point), and it’s not just the higher speeds that make things tricky. </p><p>Instead, its CPU racers tricking off every surface in sight and hammering players with shells and other items. <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s item box RNG also tends to incentivize players “bagging” it in last place before trying shoot up the ranks with the powerful items they’ve earned. Twenty-four players also means races have huge middle packs with double the carnage of previous <em>Mario Kart</em> games. We’ll see how it shakes out, but some players are already claiming special bragging rights for unlocking three stars—the highest performance rating—on all races before the CPU nerf. </p><p>Other significant patch notes include “made homing of Boomerang weaker” and “On the ‘Free Roam’ map, when you gather all of the P Switches, ? Panels, and Peach Medallions, the colors of the various numbers will now change.” There are also dozens of fixes to race tracks where players were previously falling through the map or getting snagged on trees and other obstacles. It’ll take some time to see how all the changes shake out, but it definitely feels like we’ve entered <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s first official “We’re so back” era. </p><p>Here are the full patch notes for ver. 1.2.0:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><h2 id="h444205"><a id=""></a><strong>Latest update: Ver. 1.2.0 (Released July 29, 2025)</strong></h2><p><strong>General</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player”, added “No COM” to the COM rules.</li><li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player” and “Multiplayer”, added “Mushrooms only” to the item rules.</li><li>You can now choose “View Replay” after downloading ghost data in “Time Trials”.</li><li>You can now choose whom to watch when spectating in “Knockout Tour” and “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li><li>You can now see the waiting time until the next race or battle starts in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li><li>When using CameraPlay in “Multiplayer” and “Online Play”, the game will now remember the camera cursor position and size until the player closes the game.If you change the number of people playing, the cursor position and size will return to their original settings.</li><li>On the “Free Roam” map, when you gather all of the P Switches, ?

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/37a6d0938a306/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following three updates in June, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s first (<em>and probably last</em>) update for July 2025 is now officially live.</p>
<p>This might just be the biggest one yet, as it includes a whole bunch of general updates as well as multiple bug fixes. One, in particular, mentions how the frequency of "lap-type courses" has been increased in some modes. Another note mentions how the computer opponents have been made "weaker in everything other than Battle" mode.</p>
<p>There's much more alongside these adjustments, so here's the full rundown courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h2>Mario Kart World: Ver. 1.2.0 (Released July 29, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player”, added “No COM” to the COM rules.</li>
<li>In the “VS Race” of “Single Player” and “Multiplayer”, added “Mushrooms only” to the item rules.</li>
<li>You can now choose “View Replay” after downloading ghost data in “Time Trials”.</li>
<li>You can now choose whom to watch when spectating in “Knockout Tour” and “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li>
<li>You can now see the waiting time until the next race or battle starts in “Online Play”, “Wireless Play”, and “LAN Play”.</li>
<li>When using CameraPlay in “Multiplayer” and “Online Play”, the game will now remember the camera cursor position and size until the player closes the game.
<ul>
<li>If you change the number of people playing, the cursor position and size will return to their original settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the “Free Roam” map, when you gather all of the P Switches, ? Panels, and Peach Medallions, the colors of the various numbers will now change.</li>
<li>Made COM weaker in everything other than “Battle”.</li>
<li>Made homing of Boomerang weaker.</li>
<li>Decreased the probability of getting a Triple Dash Mushroom in the low position, whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than “Frantic”.</li>
<li>Changed it so order of getting ? Block is higher than in the past, whenever the item rules in a race are anything other than “Frantic”.</li>
<li>Made it so there is a wheel spinning animation if the player presses the A button (acceleration) too early when starting a race while driving.
<ul>
<li>Player will not lose speed even when spinning wheels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in “VS Race” and wireless races.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where in “Online Play”, the player would not dash even when getting on a Dash Panel.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes controls were inoperable on the menu screen after the player was retired in “Balloon Battle” in “Wireless Play”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a Peach Medallion would sometimes disappear when doing Rewind in “Free Roam”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes controls were inoperable when the player pointed the cursor at their own character or course and pressed A on the “Free Roam” map.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes controls were inoperable when the player quit a mission in “Free Roam” right before entering a pipe.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player would slip through some drift ice around “Sky-High Sundae”.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where the player would slip through the ceiling in “Dry Bones Burnout”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player would sometimes hit a fence when throwing a red shell on the first turn in “Moo Moo Meadows”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where one part of the effects that take place for the bridge transforming when heading toward “Rainbow Road” did not display.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player would slip through the ground on the road between ”Starview Peak” and “Sky-High Sundae”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where some of the item boxes would not have appeared in “Wario Shipyard”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player would slip through the bottom of a rock near the goal of ”Wario Shipyard”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player would go out of the course when using a Mega Mushroom on a turn inside “Wario Stadium”.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player gets caught on a tree in the middle of a shortcut if they have “Smart Steering” on when heading from “Starview Peak” to “Dandelion Depths” in “Ice Rally” of “Knockout Tour”.</li>
<li>Several other issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>

                <p dir="ltr">Dungeons &amp; Dragons has exploded in popularity over the past few years, and part of that is due to the success of Stranger Things. The TTRPG features heavily in Netflix's nostalgia-tinged supernatural series--not only do we see the characters play the game, they even give many of the otherworldly creatures they encounter names pulled from Dungeons &amp; Dragons lore. Soon, fans will be able to take part in the Stranger Things crew's tabletop adventures with an all-new D&amp;D crossover game, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Stranger-Things-Adventure/dp/B0FFKL233T?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stranger Things: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The game looks to be a streamlined version of D&amp;D that comes with everything you need, is easy to set up, and includes adventures based on the campaigns made by Stranger Things character Eddie Munson. The final season of Stranger Things doesn't premiere until November 26, but fans will be able to join the Hellfire Club on <strong>October 7</strong>. You can preorder the crossover game for $50 at Amazon.</p><div title="6533505 - Dungeons &amp; Dragons Stranger Things: Welcome to The Hellfire Club Adventure Game" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3985" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6533505 - Dungeons &amp; Dragons Stranger Things: Welcome to The Hellfire Club Adventure Game" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Stranger-Things-Adventure/dp/B0FFKL233T?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dungeons-Dragons-Stranger-Things-Adventure\/dp\/B0FFKL233T?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Stranger-Things-Adventure/dp/B0FFKL233T?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">D&amp;D - Stranger Things: Welcome to The Hellfire Club</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Stranger-Things-Adventure/dp/B0FFKL233T?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dungeons-Dragons-Stranger-Things-Adventure\/dp\/B0FFKL233T?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Stranger-Things-Adventure/dp/B0FFKL233T?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$50 | Releases October 7</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Stranger Things: Welcome to The Hellfire Club takes its name from the in-universe D&amp;D club run by Eddie Munson. Gameplay is based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons and is designed for 3-5 players, accompanied by a Dungeon Master (DM). Rather than rolling up their own unique adventurers, players take on one of several pre-made party roles--which are based on the D&amp;D characters played by Stranger Things' characters like Nog the Dwarf, Lady Applejack, Erica's Rogue, and Dustin's Cleric--and embark on a series of four guided adventures based on the ones made by Munson.</p>                      </div><p dir="ltr">Unlike the full version of D&amp;D that relies on large rulebooks and the theater of the mind, Welcome to The Hellfire Club adopts a board game-style presentation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heroquest-first-light-board-game-revealed-preorders-discounted/1100-6527088/" data-ref-id="1100-6527088">more akin to HeroQuest</a>, featuring numerous cards for spells, items, and monsters. There are also illustrated grid maps and punch-out tokens for each of the playable characters and monsters.

<figure><a title="Fall Guys" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d86780b897dca/fall-guys.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Mediatonic, Epic Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Games are already benefitting in all sorts of ways from the Switch 2's upgrades, and with this in mind, Mediatonic's free-to-play title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fall_guys">Fall Guys</a> has now been updated for the new hybrid platform.</p>
<p>In this update, the battle-royale style game has apparently received an "improvement" on Switch 2 in the form of "uncapped" frame rates, allowing it to run at "up to" 60FPS. Here are the official patch notes via the official developer post on Reddit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IMPROVEMENT:</strong></p>
<p>"We have uncapped FPS on Nintendo Switch 2, allowing the game to run on up to 60 FPS on that platform."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This is part of the 'Tropical Tides' update, so if you're still playing this one, you can update your game now to receive the update. If you haven't played it before, you'll need an Epic account to participate in the cross-platform multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>This title originally made its debut on the Switch eShop in 2022. At the time, we scored it seven out of ten, calling it "chaotic fun" despite the choppy frame rate on the original Switch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Where Winds Meet: Our Thoughts After 3 Hours in its Wuxia World]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/where-winds-meet-our-thoughts-after-3-hours-in-its-wuxia-world</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-winds-meet-our-thoughts-after-3-hours-in-its-wuxia-world.1256670/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last weekend, a global beta test began for Where Winds Meet, the open-world game published by NetEase that is already available in China. This free-to-play game takes place around the year 1000 between the great Tang and Song dynasties during what's known as the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. In it, players take the role of a lone wandering hero during this time of upheaval where one's own strength matters more than the rules of society. IGN readers may not be too familiar with the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, but don’t worry – the same even seems to apply to players in China.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We know that the game takes some influence from Ghost of Tsushima and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild thanks to a past interview with lead designer Chris Lyu, but it can be difficult to imagine exactly what the gameplay will be like. According to Lyu, it is "the world's first wuxia-themed open-world" game. Once I got my hands on the game, I found Where Winds Meet was indeed a wuxia game through-and-through, with the strength of the concept bringing together a variety of elements seen in games today.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Where Winds Meet: State of Play Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you're finished with character creation and begin playing the game, you're first met with a graceful man with flowing hair resting in a bamboo grove while holding a baby to his chest, almost like Zhao Yun from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Then, another handsome and long-haired man comes to talk to him, and it seems that this man with a baby has betrayed his school. He hops on a white horse then gallops through the bamboo while avoiding his pursuer's weapons, at times in slow motion. All of these shots are reminiscent of famous scenes from various Chinese movies of the past, making it clear from the start that this game is closely linked to the wuxia tradition.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This game is closely linked to the wuxia tradition.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A sense of "wuxia-ness" oozes out of this game at every turn even after this opening scene ends and you take control of the character you've created – whether that's through its gameplay in general, its systems and graphics, or its dialogue. A few minutes after I started walking freely through its world, I spoke to an old man on the side of the road who asked me to repel a bear who's been after honey. It seems that the protagonist is able to learn techniques from the movements of the bear, as pressing buttons at the right time according to icons that pop up caused him to learn tai chi from the beast, incredibly enough.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this serves as a tutorial for the Mystic Arts that make up part of your arsenal, but more importantly, this process of observing familiar objects and nature to learn abilities and grow stronger gives the player a strong sense of the game's wuxia flavor. It seems there are other abilities that come from nature, like Lion's Roar and the venomous Toad Style, so I'm sure there will be many other techniques the protagonist learns from all the creatures of the game’s world. Just as you might expect to be able to use magic to create fire in a game with a fantasy setting, the player in this game's wuxia world is able to master strange powers of their own. It's also interesting to note that these abilities can be used outside of combat as well. For example, nearby fish are caught up in tai chi when it's used by the water's surface, making for efficient fishing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most notable things about this thoroughly wuxia game is its inclusion of many elements we've come to expect from combat systems and exploration in action games today. For example, pressing the correct button just before an enemy's attack lands will parry it, creating a back-and-forth tempo during action segments. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While equivalent to the kinds of parry systems that have become a staple in recent action games, this game goes into slow motion when it's time to parry an enemy attack and displays an icon telling you what button to press (though it is possible to turn this icon off in the options). While similar to Final Fantasy XVI's Story-Focused mode, these icons deplete an Insight Points meter when they're displayed and won't show up if you run out, so you can't recklessly fend off every single enemy attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are currently seven weapon types that a player can use (with plans to add more). In addition to standard swords and spears, there are also more unusual weapons like umbrellas and folding fans. Each weapon provides for its own unique gameplay, such as the umbrella's skill that temporarily stuns an enemy, or the fan's ability to create a zone that heals the player and their allies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can equip both a main weapon and a sub-weapon, each enabling a variety of martial techniques. What techniques are available to you will also change based on the school you study under, with a total of eleven available schools. The game's combat style changes quite a bit depending on the combination of mystic and martial skills you use, allowing for a wide degree of customization. Between all of the different attacks, the balance between offense and defense enabled by parries, and the overall voracious approach to combat elements, it felt like the game had taken a menu of popular modern features and ordered one of everything.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The bow and arrow is treated differently whether it's being used as a main or a sub-weapon, capable of attacking enemies from afar while also solving puzzles by burning through vines to open up pathways. The way it's positioned shows the influence of another game that was previously mentioned, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It sounds like upwards of a thousand NPCs have reputation levels, allowing you to befriend them on an individual basis.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's core of open world exploration and progression has also been extravagantly created. During the preview, I was able to visit Kaifeng, one of China's eight ancient capitals located in Heinan province that flourished at the time as one of the world's largest cities. Despite the war-ravaged world, the city in the game was open and lively, with its residents chatting away like it was Cyberpunk 2077 after just a short walk through its streets. It sounds like upwards of a thousand NPCs have reputation levels, allowing you to befriend them on an individual basis.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not hard to imagine how people live in the game's detailed streets of Kaifeng, apparently recreated by referring to historical remains that still exist today. Walk down the big street that cuts through it all and eventually you'll find a large arching bridge. A beautiful palace with towering defenses awaits you on the other side, making it clear just how prosperous this Chinese capital was at the time. From there the player will be able to dig into the secrets around their own birth as a wandering hero.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After only about three hours of gameplay, I could tell that Where Winds Meet is packed full of elements that players have experienced before in open-world games. But what shocked me most of all is that while you could call this a mishmash of features, the key concept of wuxia along with the way those elements are presented worked to bring all of them together in a natural way. Perhaps you could say that what best defines Where Winds Meet is this coexistence of the past decade of what has made open-world and action games fun alongside its Chinese creators' love for the genre of wuxia. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/where-winds-meet-our-thoughts-after-3-hours-in-its-wuxia-world]]></content:encoded>

Let’s run it back. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CBB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CBB</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItsInTheGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ItsInTheGame</a> <a href="https://t.co/iBNhGxn2yj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/iBNhGxn2yj</a></p>— EA SPORTS (@EASPORTS) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTS/status/1939703160479637660?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Q1 earnings call, CEO Andrew Wilson was asked about the potential return of College Basketball, likely in response to the above tweet. Per reports back in June and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/16-years-after-the-last-ncaa-basketball-game-ea-sports-is-bringing-back-the-madness">above clever tease</a>, College Basketball is indeed slated to return from EA, though it will be a while yet before we see it - <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6462741/2025/06/30/ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game-return-2028/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it's not expected until 2028</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Wilson's vague, yet promising, response in full:</p><blockquote>We can't say too much about it yet, but if I think about the opportunity, going back to where we are on College Football, college sport has one of the most vibrant fanbase in the world. And that trickles over to basketball certainly. We're seeing momentum of fandom in college basketball also continue to grow. Fans, athletes, universities pour their passion into these sports. And it is that passion that makes it special, that makes the games different.</blockquote><blockquote>But with that comes high expectations, and a demand for deeply authentic experiences: capturing the action on the field or the court, representing the energy, pagentry, the traditions, and celebrating the unique sights and sounds and stories of every school and rivalry. We feel like we deliver that incredibly well with College Football...we'd love to do the same for basketball. All 350 programs, men's and women's teams, the iconic traditions and rivalries, and of course, March Madness.</blockquote><blockquote>So for us, college sports broadly is an exciting opportunity. We feel like we've done a really strong job, and remain committed to doing that in the context of college football. We believe that with what we've done with the teams, the technology, and our commitment around College Football, we'd have a great ability to do the same for college basketball, and as we look to try and activate against that opportunity, we'll be able to share more.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Per reporting from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6462741/2025/06/30/ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game-return-2028/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Athletic</a>, EA Sports' proposal for a College Basketball game, which was recommended for acceptance by the Collegiate Licensing Company, would include all Division I men's and women's teams (730 in total). The games, of which there would be six in total with releases beginning in 2028, would have similar features to College Football such as Dynasty Mode, Team Builder, Road to Glory, and Ultimate Team. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA last produced a College Basketball game back in 2009, but the series was discontinued amid disputes over its use of college athletes' likenesses, and declining sales compared to the College Football series. However, the success of College Football seems to have sparked a new interest in Basketball from EA...though it may be facing competition from 2K Sports, if <a href="https://x.com/NBA2K/status/1939805441468342727" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this NBA 2K official Twitter/X post is any indication</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
