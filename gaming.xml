            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-rogue-incursion">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a> will get a non-VR release on PC later this year, allowing would-be Colonial Marines access to its Weyland-Yutani black site without first requiring you to force your head inside a pair of microscopic televisions. Subtitled "Evolved Edition" - which feels like a real elbow in the kidneys for VR evangelists - it will sport "even deadlier Xenomorphs and enhanced visuals". Hopefully, that'll be enough to juice the VR version's current <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850050/Alien_Rogue_Incursion_VR/">Mixed</a> user review consensus on Steam. </p><!--more-->

<p>As you may guess from the above, I'm not a VR evangelist, partly because I can't afford a modern VR headset and don't have the living space to play VR games without injuring myself, my loved ones or my precious (scavenged) bedroom furniture. I only own an original PSVR, which is curled up in the corner of my cupboard like a dead servo-skull. It was last used to play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-squadrons">Star Wars: Squadrons</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paper-beast">Paper Beast</a>, which are the two VR games I consider worth the discomfort, if not the expense, of VR.</p>
<p>I hear that the latest Zucker Buckets and Gaben Goggles are more comfortable to wear, but I still don't trust myself to put them on without becoming a public health hazard. I have terrible, humiliating memories of previewing some Marvel VR game at an event. Surrounded by the minions of Thanos, I swung Thor's hammer with all of my strength and clanged the PR person over the head. This happened in a converted warehouse about 300 metres wide. Now, imagine if I'd been surrounded by digital xenomorphs. That PR person would be dead.</p>
<p>So yes, I'm delighted that Rogue Incursion has decided to trade in its fancy eyestrain helmet for reassuringly non-engulfing 2D displays. Here's some story blurb about Rogue Incursion. It's the first of a two-act story, with the second act promising "new challenges and deadlier enemies".</p>
<blockquote><p>An all-new action-horror entry into the classic franchise, Alien: Rogue Incursion transforms you into Zula Hendricks-the ex-Colonial Marine hellbent on exposing Weyland-Yutani's black-site experiments-on an extremely dangerous mission to the uncharted planet Purdan. With her synth companion Davis 01 for guidance, Zula must infiltrate the infested Gemini Exoplanet Solutions research facility and survive the ever-present threat of the most cunning Xenomorphs ever encountered, with both skilled stealth and serious firepower at her disposal. And when the threat she discovers has extinction-level consequences, Zula suddenly finds herself with humanity's fate on her shoulders.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Evolved Edition launches on 30th September. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3655390/Alien_Rogue_Incursion_Evolved_Edition/">Steam</a>. Did you play the VR one? Let us know how you got on with it. While we're talking Alien, I'll conclude by shoving you towards <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/duskers-is-getting-a-ship-building-sequel-years-after-the-sci-fi-roguelike-scared-us-to-bits">the next game from the people behind Duskers</a>, one of the finest unofficial Alien games yet made.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The game runs on Epic's Unreal Engine 5, having moved off the proprietary engine previously used in Mafia III and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-definitive-edition-old-school-gangster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mafia: Definitive Edition</a>. Because of that, some concerns regarding the often-present stuttering are inevitable. However, the game is not an open world, unlike previous entries in the franchise. Hangar 13 has instead chosen to go with a linear, narrative-driven experience, as explained by studio president Nick Baynes:</p>
<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country is a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar Mafia gameplay. That focus allows us to deliver a story that’s gritty, grounded, brutal and emotional. Embracing early 1900s era Sicily, this is a mafia origin story that follows our protagonist, Enzo Favara, as he takes the oath and works his way up Don Torrisi's crime family.</em></p>
<p>Without the need to stream in a large, explorable world, stuttering issues could be less problematic than in <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games like The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>. Of course, we won't know for sure until the game launches on August 8.</p>
<p>What we do know is that Mafia: The Old Country <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-the-whole-mafia-franchise-including-old-country-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will also be available to stream via NVIDIA GeForce NOW on day one</a> for all those players whose PCs do not meet the above system requirements.</p>

            <p>That's a wrap on Fallout season two. And what better way to celebrate the end of a hard shoot than peeling off your skin? OK, I can think of many better ways, but that is how actor Walton Goggins decided to share the news.</p>
<p>Goggins plays Fallout's gunslinging Ghoul in the Amazon show, and as his character has been exposed to plenty of radiation and harsh conditions, the actor wears a lot of prosthetics to get the look just right.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJZqMmDOBab/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">post on Instagram</a>, Goggins peeled off his Ghoulish outer layer and threw it at the camera. In true Goggins fashion, though, he made it look good.</p>
<p>Fellow Fallout star Ella Purnell, meanwhile, shared a more wholesome photo to mark the end of production. "aaaaand that’s a wrap on @falloutonprime Season 2 folks! 🤓," Purnell, who plays Vault dweller Lucy in show, wrote with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJZnLWFKUHw/?igsh=MTV6OHNxbWN6ZnZ5Zg%3D%3D">an accompanying photo</a> of the actress next to her on-screen dad Kyle MacLachlan.</p>

<p>The Fallout X account also shared the news, writing "Achievement unlocked! Fallout Season 2 has wrapped production." The account shared Goggins' skin shedding shots, so feel free to enjoy those below.</p>

<p>Fallout's first season was a huge hit for Amazon, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">quickly picked up for a second season</a>. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy - who executive produce the show via Kilter Films - said they couldn't "wait to blow up the world all over again".</p>
<p>As for what we can expect with the second season, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says">Goggins has assured fans it will blow the first season out of the water</a>.

            <p>Rumours of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> remake briefly bubbled up before being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-sorry-put-the-party-poppers-away-chrono-trigger-isnt-getting-a-remake-as-far-as-anyone-knows-anyway">swiftly pin-popped last week</a>, following a mistranslation of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a>'s writer, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> creator Yuji Horii at a panel. The potion-swilling public were understandably chuffed (you still can't Google Horii's name without being served videos of pog-faced excite-os screaming "Chrono Trigger Remake Confirmed!!!"), but it soon turned out that no such remake was actually planned.</p>
<p>Based on a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-yuji-horii-contemplating-a-chrono-trigger-remake-1540193/">Gamereactor</a> at the same event, it sounds like Horii has been considering doing something with Chrono Trigger after all, which isn't too surprising after Square Enix said they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">planned to celebrate</a> the game's 30th anniversary with "various projects" back in March. From Gamereactor:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>"Yes, it is. It has been a long time. Yes, I want to do something", Horii-san tells Gamereactor when asked about the celebrations for the Chrono Trigger 30th Anniversary. "Currently, Dragon Quest has seen III, I-II [HD-2D] Remakes. I get a lot of requests for the remake of Chrono Trigger as well, and so I am starting to contemplate on it",</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is nice, although not all that exciting to me personally for a couple of reasons. Firstly, Chrono Trigger is still extremely playable, and secondly, I've never actually understood what all the fuss was about. I guess I view Chrono Trigger like I view The Beatles: sure, I can accept they pushed the medium forward, but I don't actually care to listen to them for fun except about a third of Sergeant Pepper's. Also, I'm still salty that Frog turned out to be a human named pissing Glenn. Glenn! Just let your talking frog knight be a talking frog knight, game.</p>
<p>That said, the fairground trial scene blew my mind when I first played it, so I can only imagine how wild it was in 1995 to have a JRPG call you a stinking thief for eating a man's lunch after you'd been conditioned to treat layabout items as a purely ludic contrivance. Still, give me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Arms_(video_game)">Wild Arms</a> remake over this any day. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/airships-dinosaurs-and-robots-meet-in-spiritual-successor-to-chrono-trigger-rpg-threads-of-time">Threads Of Time looks nice though</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In a Japanese press release <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/897/G089776/20250508027/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by 4Gamer</a>, SEGA (the game's publisher in Japan) and Avalanche Software have revealed some technical details of the Nintendo Switch 2 port of Hogwarts Legacy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Enhanced Visuals</em></strong><br>
<em>Experience deeper immersion with significantly upgraded graphics, including NVIDIA DLSS support, improved lighting and shadow animation quality, and anti-aliasing. Experience up to 1440p resolution in TV mode and 1080p and HDR in handheld mode.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Smooth Movement</em></strong><br>
<em>Move seamlessly through the open world, including Hogsmeade and its shops, without loading screens.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Smooth Flight</em></strong><br>
<em>Thanks to the improved performance of the Nintendo Switch 2, not only is the frame rate higher than the Nintendo Switch version, but the loading times are also shorter. You can fly around the Hogwarts grounds and beyond comfortably.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Supports mouse operation with Joy-Con 2</em></strong><br>
<em>Supports mouse operation with Joy-Con 2 controller. Enjoy your preferred play style.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 hardware <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution</a>, but developers can choose whether to actually use it or not. It honestly seems like a no-brainer, though, especially for games that have already implemented the feature on the PC version, like Hogwarts Legacy or <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 also technically supports ray tracing, but there's no mention of it being implemented in this game, even though the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions (and, of course, the PC version) support it. Indeed, it's highly unlikely that open world games will implement ray tracing in any capacity on the hybrid console, as it would simply be too taxing on the hardware. It could, however, be supported for simpler, smaller games. Anyway, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Hogwarts Legacy will be available at the console's launch (June 5). The game size is 24 GB.</p>

            <p>New York's Strong National Museum of Play has welcomed four new entries into its Video Game Hall Of Fame: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>, Goldeneye, 1981's arcade side-scroller Defender, and the virtual pet Tamagotchi.

<p>Here's The Strong on Tamagotchi's inclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Beyond cultivating nostalgia, Tamagotchi offered a distinct form of play apart from the prevailing popularity of video game electronics at the time. In the book Millennial Monsters: Japanese Toys and the Global Imagination (2006), scholar Anne Allison argued that Tamagotchi provided young users with feelings of connection, intimacy, and personalization, a respite from competition and fighting games."</p></blockquote>
<p>This is purely speculative on my part - I'd love for someone to give me a little more context or insight - but the first Tamagotchi was released in 1996, the same year as SNES farming game and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> influence Harvest Moon and the original Pokémon. Taken together, that's an incredibly influential year for contemporary <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-non-violent-video-games">non violent</a> or "cosy" titles, and I do wonder if these three games (or two games and Tamagotchi, depending on your view) themselves share common influences.</p>
<p>When I say I'd never thought of Tamagotchi as a videogame, I don't mean it in "not a real game sense", either. Just that it hadn't actually occurred to me to think about in what we might broadly call videogame canon or history. But I came around the idea pretty quickly, honestly. Now I think about, Tamagotchi might actually have been my first exposure to permadeath. I once lost one for months, eventually finding it under my bed to behold my beloved pet dying in a mountain of its own shit. Brutal stuff.</p>
<p>As for Quake's inclusion, The Strong focuses on its use of 3D space, as well as the popularity of its competitive multiplayer "central to the creation of esports as an industry". It was also, <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/games/quake/">they point out</a>, "the first shooter to get widespread mod support", spawning the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>.</p>
<p>These four additions bring the hall of fame's total up to 49 games. The earliest entry is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spacewar">Spacewar!</a>, and the most recent is The Last Of Us. We like to complain about irritating uses of punctuation in game names here at RPS but I suppose they've been with us since the beginning. I'm now wishing they'd named The Last Of Us something like Panic! At The Abandoned Supermarket just for the sake of symmetry.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Grand strategy country crusher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis 5</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-grand-strategy-game-from-paradox-is-europa-universalis-5">announced yesterday</a>, revealing a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-we-know-about-europa-universalis-5">complex century-spanning historical sim</a>. But one thing we still don't know is the price or how it'll be sold. If you want to buy the previous game in the series, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-iv">Europa Universalis 4</a>, you'll find a slew of subscription models and a big library of DLC alongside <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/">the base game</a>. Which might cause some fans to worry that the sequel will launch with some sort of similar subscription model. But this won't be the case, say developers Paradox Tinto. They're going to sell it normally. At least for now.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Obviously, when we have enough DLCs there will be subscription models, because subscription models are great," said game director Johan Andersson in an interview with RPS. But when asked if the publisher was planning to have a subscription model straight out of the gate, he said no.</p>
<p>"No, unless we have DLC. I mean, of course, I would love to have a subscription model where people paid me five euros a month, or ten euros, whatever. But unless we actually have any content, I'm not sure people want [to be told]: 'Hey! Pay ten euros now for January, February, March... and in April you'll get DLC!' No."</p>
<p>Paradox started experimenting with subscriptions to their biggest and most expandofied games like EU4 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-are-experimenting-with-a-subscription-service-to-play-europa-universalis-iv-and-its-dlc">back in 2020</a>, and later offered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellaris-launches-expansion-subscription-offering-access-to-all-dlc-for-850-per-month">a subscription to all Stellaris's space stuff</a> in 2024. It costs £8.50 a month and you don't get to keep anything when you unsubscribe. You can still buy each of these games normally, of course. The sub is just an option - one I don't really recommend. It certainly wouldn't make a lot of sense for the publisher's latest grand strategy sequel at launch, and the devs agree. </p>

</figure>
<p>But there is another familiar problem for Paradox. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis">Europa Universalis</a> 5 will be sized up next to its predecessor. How can the new strategy game compete with a decade of DLCs and extras? Will there be enough in the base game of Europa Universalis 5 to entice veterans to hop over to the new game? Andersson thinks so. </p>
<p>"Almost all of the EU4 features that are in its DLCs right now are part of the base game in EU5," he told us. This means EU5 will inherit all of the systems that EU4 has built up over years of expansions and updates. Which theoretically gives it as much value as the entire catalogue of EU4 expansions. Of course, players will be able to verify that promise once EU5 is fully released.</p>
<p>As for DLC plans, Paradox Tinto are not worrying about that just yet, says Andersson. </p>
<p>"We have visions," says Andersson, "but I think it's a bad idea to write ideas and work on things... before you have wrapped up and shipped the game. That's my experience. Of course, salespeople want [to say]: 'we need to have 12 DLCs ready ASAP!' But, yeah... I don't want to do it because it takes away from the base game."</p>
<p>That's quite refreshing and reassuring to hear. Paradox are sometimes accused of milking it when it comes to their many cosmetic packs and expandobits. They have even been accused of "fixing" games with paid DLC - something the company's CEO refuted by comparing their process of making games to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">painting a piece of art</a>. "When is a painting done?" he mused. "When you stop painting it, I guess."</p>
<p>My own view is that Paradox DLC is always, by its nature, going to be hit or miss. And you can easily dodge the duff stuff by reading up on reviews. It's the best way to tell what's a thin soup of hats and what is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-sorry-for-all-the-dead-bodies-i-left-behind-while-walking-from-ireland-to-china-in-crusader-kings-3s-brilliant-new-dlc">rich stew of adventure</a>. You don't need a subscription model when you've got Rock Paper Shotgun, is what I'm saying, friend. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Yesterday, Paradox Interactive unveiled Europa Universalis V, a new installment in the popular grand strategy game. Fans have been waiting for this since Europa Universalis IV launched in 2013. In that regard, they've waited as long as GTA fans.</p>
<p>Europa Universalis V promises more detailed diplomacy, a more sophisticated economic model, a revamped military system, and greater logistical depth. According to Paradox, it offers the following improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>New and Larger Map: Start as a mighty emperor, local chieftain, or warlord in a more detailed and accurate world map with hundreds of playable societies and varied terrain.</li>
<li>Longer Time Scale: Begin in 1337 and guide a nation through centuries of historical change, including the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and other historical ages.</li>
<li>Population-Based System: Rule over detailed populations with cultural, religious, and class dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is particularly interesting, as the developers are touting that populations are represented on the map in detail for the first time in the franchise. This means provinces may be divided by religion or culture. The player's choices will determine how these populations fare under their leadership.</p>

<p>Europa Universalis V doesn't have a release date yet, but you can already add the game to your Steam wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3450310/Europa_Universalis_V/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-expedition-33-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When you write about games for a living, you rarely just sit down and write about a whole damn game. Even reviews, which some people think <em>should</em> be that, are hopefully something more focused and nuanced. Impressions of a game tend to involve the writer choosing a hook, an angle, something to peg their thoughts on before expanding on them over the course of an article.</p><p>It's why, for example, my <em>Infinite Wealth</em> "review"<a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ended up</a> as<a href="https://aftermath.site/infinite-wealth-ichiban-kasuga-friendship-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> two separate pieces</a>, or why<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote about <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows'</em> ending specifically</a>; it's easier for everyone, me and you, if we just find one thing to talk about in detail. And normally, that's pretty easy to do! I wrote about <em>Shadows</em>' ending because it really stood out, and the <em>Yakuza </em>posts were based on themes and impressions that became clear over my time with the game, which I thought were a lot more interesting than talking about "graphics" and "difficulty".</p><p>This week, though, I am having <em>problems</em>. I have been playing <em>Clair Obscur</em> non-stop, it's that good, but every time I go to write about it I find myself struggling to find that hook. Not because there's nothing good or interesting to write about, but because <em>everything </em>in <em>Clair Obscur </em>is good and interesting.</p><figure></figure><p>That's OK, maybe I can pivot to writing about stuff I don't like and...hrm. I guess traversing the levels can suck sometimes, if I have to name <em>one </em>thing I am not completely enamoured by. They can get a bit sprawly and repetitive at times, and you can get lost if you're not careful; they maybe need a map or clearer marker system or something. It gets a bit tedious. But like, that's it? I can't pad a whole post out into me complaining about that.</p><p>Everything else I cast my eyes, hands and ears over is just the best. The music rules. I love the art design. The battles have <em>got me</em>, someone who doesn't normally dabble in this genre outside of <em>Persona </em>and the odd <em>Final Fantasy</em>. The writing is great, the voice acting is great, the interlocking magic and abilities systems are surprisingly elegant.</p><p>I could write about any one of these things, sure, but every time I've tried I look over at everything else and it feels like I'm about to adopt only one kitten from an entire litter, and those left behind are looking at me with the biggest, saddest eyes. Awwww, character art, I love you, but I can't write about you <em>and </em>Charlie Cox, there are only so many hours in a day!</p><p>Though...ah. Maybe this <em>is </em>the hook.

                <p>Mafia: The Old Country is heading to PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC on August 8 and preorders are up at digital storefronts. The linear action game will focus on storytelling and immersion, providing fans with a nuanced new take on the series. Two different versions of the game are up for grabs, and there are preorder bonuses for reserving a copy in advance. Best of all, the <strong>standard edition is priced at just $50</strong>--a nice change of pace from all of today’s $70 and $80 releases.</p><h2>Mafia: The Old Country Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4490903-mafiapreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490903" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4490903-mafiapreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490903"></a><figcaption>Mario: The Old Country</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4490903-mafiapreorders.jpg"></figure><p>All Mafia: The Old Country preorders include the Soldato DLC Pack, which offers the following in-game items:</p><ul><li>“Soldato” Outfit</li><li>“Scannaturi Speciale” Knife</li><li>“Tesoro” Horse and Accessories</li><li>“Lupara” Charm</li></ul><p>You can also sign up for a free 2K account to unlock the “Garzia Tumulto Race Car,” plus additional benefits for other Mafia games.

            <p>
Did you know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> is the 21st best-selling game of all time? It's sold more than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>! At least by the numbers we currently have, anyway. I don't care all that much about sales figures, but if creator Eric Barone cared more about money, I can only imagine that a sequel would be all but guaranteed. As it turns out though, the developer could actually see himself making a sequel to the beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sim</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Barone recently appeared on the podcast Tiger Belly (thanks, GamesRadar), where host Bobby Lee asked why he doesn't just make a Stardew Valley 2 when he's constantly releasing new updates. "It's just so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch," Barone explains. "Because Stardew Valley, all the systems, the major systems, are already all done. That's the stuff that's not fun to do. When I make an update, it's like, throw in this, throw in that, let's add green rain. These random ideas I have. Whimsical ideas."
</p>

<a aria-label="Bobby's Dream Guest, Stardew Valley Creator Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) | Bonus TigerBelly" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83DYlsJoaFk?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83DYlsJoaFk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
He noted that a lot of these ideas come about from playing the game himself and thinking, "'Oh, wouldn't it be cool if there was this or that?' And then I can just do it, and that's a new update. It's really just fun and creative and spontaneous to do it that way than to make a whole new game."
</p>
<p>
And then came the comment that struck fear into my heart: "I might eventually make a Stardew Valley 2, to be honest." I say fear, because Barone struggles to not update the original game, so much so he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-knows-if-stardew-valley-is-finally-done-but-the-dev-behind-it-is-committed-to-not-working-on-it-until-haunted-chocolatier-is-done">somewhat forcing himself to stop working on it so he can actually finish Haunted Chocolatier</a>. However, Barone did also say that while he won't deny the possibility of a Stardew Valley 2, he doesn't "want to just be the Stardew Valley guy, that's why I'm making <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>."
</p>
<p>
So, really we've got a Schrodinger's Stardew Valley sequel here. Fingers crossed Barone doesn't get carried away and do it, I'd like to play Haunted Chocolatier before I retire.

So they looked back at <em>3</em> and <em>4</em> before developing this new remake. </p><p> “We looked at <em>3</em>, and that was obviously another very highly regarded title in the franchise. So then it was, ‘Let’s look at <em>4</em>. It’s quite different, but what, at its essence, is it?’ Our goal here is to make the ultimate package of <em>3</em> and <em>4</em>. So ultimately, we felt that taking it into feeling more towards the <em>3</em> format, as opposed to what <em>4</em> did originally, was a better representation for a cohesive package that we were making.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamingbible.com/features/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-preview-605531-20250508&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamingbible.com/features/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-preview-605531-20250508" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a different interview with <em>Gaming Bible</em></a></span>, <em>THPS 3+4 </em>game director Kurt Tillmanns said that once they put the timer in <em>THPS 4</em>'s levels, they knew that “this is totally going to work.”</p><p>“We recreated some of those classic goals that you remember [from <em>THPS 4</em>]; skitching the professor’s car, freeing the prisoner — in this new format all of those things still work.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/05/09/we-got-to-chat-with-iron-galaxy-about-bringing-tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-to-life/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/05/09/we-got-to-chat-with-iron-galaxy-about-bringing-tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to <em>Press Start</em></a></span>, Rossi was asked if the inclusion of an option to  extend the timer in <em>THPS 3+4</em>'s career mode  for up to an hour—as opposed to the hard and fast two minutes found in the old games—was a reaction to the negative feedback they received from fans who wanted the open-world career mode of <em>THPS 4. </em></p><p>“No,” said Rossi. “We knew going into it that it was going to be tough and that people were going to be looking at it. But we felt this was the right way to approach it, and it made it a more cohesive package. We had already been thinking, you know, we’ve got the mods, which, in our eyes, is another way of putting accessibility things in.”</p><p>“And a lot of the feedback we were getting internally, plus we’d see online, was that people didn’t always love the two-minute timer. You know, they’d want just a little bit more time. ‘Oh, I was just about to figure that out, or finish this thing. If only I had one more minute.’ And so why not give them that extra minute, or whatever extra time they want? It doesn’t feel like that impacts the overall goal that we’re trying to accomplish; it doesn’t impact progression,” said Rossi.</p><p> “So we just threw that in, it’s a nice coincidence, and now, hopefully, we can point to that as a solution for those people who are looking for more time in those levels.”</p><p>I’m not sure these answers will calm fans who believe the open-world format of <em>THPS4's</em> levels was a big part of the game’s identity. But at this point we are just a few a months away from launch and the devs sound committed to the objective-based run format for <em>THPS 4.</em> It’s a shame for fans of the OG game, but at least the original game is still around for those who prefer it. </p><p><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</em> launches July 11 on Xbox, Game Pass, PlayStation, Switch, and PC.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/eberron-forge-of-artificer-newest-dungeons-dragons-2024-supplement-is-available-for<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> 2024</em> supplement is now available for pre-order. Wizards of the Coast is returning to the beloved setting of Khorvaire with <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em>, bringing the magical tinkerer player class to the latest version of the fantasy TTRPG.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> is a new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 supplement. The supplement will contain new player options, monster statblocks, and magic items. These options will be based on the titular setting created by Keith Baker.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eberron-forge-of-the-artificer-armorer-artwork.jpg?itok=wF401Fu8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eberron-forge-of-the-artificer-armorer-artwork.jpg?itok=tjKb3t4M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The biggest draw of the player options is the newly revised Artificer class. This class is a staple of the Eberron setting, embodying the power fantasy of channeling magic through gadgets and scientific devices. It was absent in the 2024 core rulebooks until it returned in recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unearthed Arcana</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, not only will <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> contain revised versions of all four Artificer subclasses, it will also contain a brand new subclass: the Cartographer. In addition to this revised class, the supplement will include an overhauled Dragonmark system, new player species including the Warforged, and new player bastions.</p>

<p>Lastly, the book's official store page on D&amp;D Beyond, mentions campaign templates for Game Masters. The book contains three distinct, genre-based templates based on the key thematic elements of Eberron: fantasy noir, political thriller, and pulp adventure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aside from these templates, it is unclear if the book will contain new lore or background details on the setting. This inclusion seems to go against the company's production roadmap as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-direct-2024-highlights-future-of-dd-and-showcases-project-sigil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Direct 2024</a>. During this presentation, it seemed future books would be separated into Player Guides and Campaign Guides intended for GMs.</p>

<p>Considering one of the critiques of <em>D&amp;D</em> books has been unevenly distributed material across several books, this appears to be WOTC falling back into bad habits. But considering, the 2014 supplement, <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>, is still compatible with the 2024 ruleset, it is more likely WOTC is avoiding reprinting old information.</p>

<p><em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> is available for pre-order now on <a href="https://marketplace.dndbeyond.com/category/5147000?pid=D5147000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Beyond</a>. It is available in digital for $19.99, a physical book for $29.99 and an Ultimate Bundle for $39.99 which includes digital and physical books alongside digital maps and digital dice. The books are set to release August 19.</p>

            <p>
Alien: Rogue Incursion, the action-horror adventure from developer Survios, is ditching its headset requirements and getting a non-VR release on PS5 and Steam this September.
</p>
<p>
Alien: Rogue Incursion initially launched for PSVR 2 and PCVR last December, putting players into the big clompy boots of ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks as they - alongside their ever-present synth companion Davis 01 - embarked on a dangerous mission to the uncharted planet Purdan, in the hope of exposing the Weyland-Yutani's black-site experiments. Unsurprisingly, it doesn't take long for those pesky Xenomorphs to make their presence known.
</p>
<p>
Survios calls Alien: Rogue Incursion (which additionally launched for Meta Quest 3 earlier this year) part one of a two-part story, albeit one that "stands alone as a complete story" if you don't include "thrilling cliffhanger". It's newly announced non-VR release is titled Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition, and is described as having been "re-envisioned" for console and PC. What that means in specific terms isn't entirely clear, but there's talk of "even deadlier Xenomorphs and enhanced visuals."

<p>
The original Alien: Rogue Incursion currently has a 'mixed' rating on Steam, having garnered criticism for issues ranging from wonky AI to poor performance - but the general concensus seems to be it's built on solid foundations and manages to capture the essence of the beloved sci-fi series. And if that works for you, Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition will be available in two guises when it launches for PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3655390/Alien_Rogue_Incursion_Evolved_Edition/">Steam</a> on 30th September.
</p>
<p>
There's a $29.99 USD Standard Edition featuring just the base game, plus a $39.99 Deluxe Edition. This includes the base game, a Blue Camo armour skin, a Blue Camo weapon skin, and The Art of Alien: Rogue Incursion in-game art book. It's unclear, however, if owners of the earlier VR edition will be able to access the new version without forking out for the new release.
</p>
<p>
So to recap, Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition launches for Steam and PS5 on 30th September. And if that's put you in an Alien mood, why not take a trip to last year, when Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-decade-of-alien-isolation-how-creative-assembly-made-an-all-time-horror-classic">celebrated a decade of Creative Assembly's all-time horror classic Alien: Isolation</a>?

            <p>
I'm not sure if the words cosy and apocalypse are generally ones that go hand in hand together, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doloc-town">Doloc Town</a> is positioning itself as just that. Specifically, it's a quite lovely looking pixel-art <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sim</a> set in a post-apocalypse, and it just launched in early access today. Like in many farming sims before it, there's the usual thing of tending to and growing your crops, cooking them up, fishing, that sort of thing. Where it differs is it's all on a 2D plane, obviously meaning you'll have to think about space quite differently.
</p>

<p>
Having a post-apocalyptic setting means you'll have to go off and explore a bit sometimes too. You might find some treasures, some secret relics, occasionally you'll need to fend off robot enemies. It's all just a little bit futuristic, but without the ability to completely rely on technology. I like the look of it a lot, there's a story too and I'm quite into the idea of a 2D farming sim with platforming elements. Not exactly revolutionary, just a combo that looks well done with some really well lit pixel art here.

<p>
Speaking of story, the current version of the game will apparently have a bit more than 20 hours of main story to get through, on top of side quests, so it sounds quite beefy. RedSaw Games Studio, the devs behind Doloc Town, say that they plan for the early access period to be no more than a year, with a more detailed roadmap coming soon.
</p>
<p>
Like a lot of Steam games, it has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2285550/Doloc_Town/">launch discount on Steam</a> too. Nothing much, just 10%, but if Doloc Town looks like a good time to you, now might be the best time to pick it up.
