			<p>Nintendo knows that gaming is a social activity, but as gaming has moved increasingly online, they haven’t consistently kept pace with changing habits. The Switch 2, though, is the most social Nintendo platform we’ve ever had. GameChat and GameShare are two new features built into the console’s very fabric, bringing family and friends together to play through innovative multiplayer, multi-console streaming and, well, the slightly less timely ability to chat with each other.</p>
<p>Mario Party, then, is the perfect game to showcase the Switch 2’s new features. Alongside the Switch 2 camera peripheral, the now excessively titled Super Mario Party Jamboree – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV DLC is here to make group gaming more social, vibrant, and silly, while emphasising the human connection. As you crush your family in a minigame melee, of course.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/">Mario Party Jamboree was a great return to form</a> for Nintendo’s long-running digital boardgame, and it did so by focusing on the basics. The central mode once again sees you travel around the various boards, attempting to earn more Stars than your opponents through canny use of special items, thoughtful route planning around the sometimes-convoluted multiple pathways and battering everyone in the different minigames that punctuate each round.</p>
<p>For the Switch 2 Edition, the main game has been given a scrub-up, but it’s the added social systems of the game and the Switch in general that bring the biggest changes. Similar to Mario Kart World, you can see your friends while playing if you have cameras attached and enabled. Sure, the Switch 2’s built-in microphone and GameChat makes talking to your friends easier makes this easier than ever, but there’s something just that bit more personal and immediate by being able to see them as well.</p>


<p>The camera is capable of zooming in on up to four people playing in the same space, and you can gurn, smile, cry or, well, make rude gestures when things don’t go your way. My 9-year-old son believes that this is the best new feature, purely because it allows you to have your head next to your avatar and you can make silly faces in it. It adds a level of life and humour into the game that actually overrides some of Mario Party’s slower moments, helping you breeze through the 90+ minutes of a full game session.</p>
<p>Through the main Mario Party game it is, fundamentally, just a camera, but the Jamboree TV DLC makes it an integral gameplay tool. There are 20 new minigames here that utilise the Switch 2’s impressive new features, with a variety of Eye-Toy-like CameraPlay minigames, microphone-driven tasks, and a batch that utilise the Joy Con 2’s mouse controls. They show some of the system’s huge potential, while highlighting some of its weaker elements as well.</p>

<p>There’s three core modes to Jamboree TV, with the first being Bowser Live, which sees you participating in a live show hosted by Mario’s nemesis, where the losers will be burned to a crisp by his fiery breath. You choose to focus on either camera or microphone games – though oddly, not both at the same time – and fight it out through three rounds. Camera-led games might see you trying to stack Goombas on your head, or repeatedly hammering a ? block for coins by punching the air, while microphone ones have you shouting at your console to move objects around. You can definitely ruin these for your opponents by shouting at the wrong time, and I can see multiple households descending into chaos because of it.</p>
<p>Bowser Live is a much shorter experience than many of the other Mario Party modes, only taking place across three stages. The third and final game is also something of a disappointment as it’s the same thing every time. At the close, you and your teammate have to shout, holler and hoot to win over Bowser and the crowd, but as a co-op pair, no matter how loud we shouted, we never won, with the AI team soundly beating us. Playing against each other, or as a four, will do away with that, but it’s not a minigame in the true sense, and its repeated use as the closing point of the mode sees it wear thin extremely quickly.</p>

<p>The mouse-led minigames are the clear winners in Jamboree TV, though you’ll obviously need an extra pair of Joy-Con 2 if you want to play with more than two players. Carnival Coaster is the overarching mode for these, putting you on a rollercoaster that’s also an on-rails shooter. You blast Koopas and Para-Biddybuds, as you race down the rails, putting your arms up for a speed boost, before hitting the next minigame.</p>
<p>This batch of mousey minigames have proven to be the Jamboree TV’s highlight, from sorting through emails – any from Bowser go in the trash – to co-op climbing with each player taking control of one springy arm. They showcase just how good the mouse controls are, and they feel fresh, fun and compellingly different to the wider Mario Party canon. Just as with the main game, you can forgo the wider framing of Bowser Live and Carnival Coaster to hop in and out of your favourite minigames, and this is probably the best way to experience the newest additions, with a solid stream of competitive diversions.</p>

<p>GameShare takes Nintendo’s focus on social play to the next level, and here it lets you share the game across multiple players and multiple platforms so that you can all play together from one copy of the game. That includes the original Switch, Switch OLED and Switch Lite, though you’ll only be able to play the main game’s modes, and none of the newer Jamboree TV content when connected to the older generation. It’s the ideal endpoint for the game though, and I can see it helping to drive Mario Party’s popularity to new heights, albeit while potentially selling fewer copies of the game.</p>

			<p>Unreal Engine was considered for Halo Infinite, but developer 343 Industries eventually went with its Slipspace Engine again due to a few issues, including how the engine would have impacted the vision for the game.</p>



<p>As reported in a new video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming">Rebs Gaming</a> recently discovered an official Halo Infinite documentary created in 2017 to reframe 343 Industries' vision for the game and pitch to Xbox leadership for funding on the Vimeo profile page of a former 343I developer. The documentary, which has been made private following its discovery, features a presentation given by studio head Chris Lee revealing that, as it has been rumored a while back, 343 Industries indeed considered using Unreal Engine for the latest entry in the iconic series. In May 2017, the developer visited The Coalition, spending two days presenting their findings on the Unreal Engine before deciding on which engine to use the following month. This was a tumultuous time at the studio, as a former developer revealed that the game's art team threatened to quit if leadership didn't investigate a possible switch to Unreal Engine.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the findings were more favorable for the Slipspace Engine, as the Unreal Engine proved to be better in some areas, but the studio's proprietary engine was considered more powerful in others. In addition, rebuilding the foundation would have taken two years, and an engine switch would have impacted the vision. A vote with leadership was also held, and 85% chose Slipspace over the Unreal Engine, which is the engine 343 Industries ultimately used for Halo Infinite.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although 343 Industries, now <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-has-multiple-projects-on-the-way-made-with-unreal-engine-5/">Halo Studios</a>, ended up going with Unreal Engine 5 for the development of the next entry in the series, up until late 2022, the Slipspace Engine still seemed to have some life left in it, as it is rumored it would have powered a direct sequel to Halo Infinite. With the change of leadership on September 22 also came a change of plans, and thus, the Slipspace Engine was replaced by Unreal Engine 5 as the engine that will power future entries in the series, which may include a remake of the first entry in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-2026-release-campaign-only/">Combat Evolved.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-party-jamboree/">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> came and went without all that much noise, delivering a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-party-jamboree/">solid, if not exactly (mini)game-changing entry</a> in the long-running series. So, the announcement that Jamboree would be one of the first Nintendo Switch titles to receive a major paid <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> upgrade came as a bit of a surprise to some. But perhaps the laboriously-titled Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV shouldn’t have been <em>that</em> unexpected, as Nintendo is basically using the upgraded game as a showcase for the Switch 2’s new features and peripherals, such as Joy-Con 2 mouse controls and the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera.</p>



<p>Does the Switch 2 version of Super Mario Party Jamboree take the festivities to the next level? Or is it okay to leave this party in the past? Boogie on down for my impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full, scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>From the title screen, you'll find most of Super Mario Party Jamboree's new Switch 2 content by selecting Jamboree TV, which includes a couple of new game modes that provide quick access to the game's roughly 20 new minigames.</p>



<p>The “Bowser Live” mode serves up minigames that require the use of the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera and the console’s new built-in microphone. Basically, two teams compete in a trio of camera or microphone-focused minigames, and whoever does best over the course of all three, wins. The loser gets roasted alive by Bowser. Pretty simple.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Switch 2 camera is basically functional, I suppose. Simple minigames that involve doing things like punching upwards to bash a coin block or pulling various basic poses Simon-Says-style <em>do</em> work, but the experience isn’t overly thrilling. I’m not providing my own screenshots for privacy purposes, but Nintendo’s screenshots showing what people look like when captured in game are very much a best-case scenario. I don’t know if conditions in the room I was playing in weren’t right, but the images of myself and my fellow players captured by the game were very low quality. The camera/game is also bad at finding the edges of a person – often large chunks of background would be included or, alternatively, arms and legs would be cut off. The game is also not particularly good with players of various sizes, as my family members, who range from around 4 feet to 6 feet tall, all had to stand at odd varying distances from the camera.</p>



<p>Minigames based around the mic are similarly functional, but also not that exciting, and background talk and other extraneous noise easily confuses the game. Ultimately, Bowser Live was good for a few chuckles, particularly when my seven-year-old discovered he could stick his butt into other players’ sections of the screen, but nobody who experienced the heady 2010s era of Kinect and the PlayStation Eye are going to find anything here terribly impressive or innovative.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Significantly more successful is the new “Carnival Coaster” mode, which revolves around the new Joy-Con 2’s mouse functionality. Carnival Coaster asks players to team up to get to the end of one of five different on-rail rides. You have a limited amount of time to reach the end, but successfully shooting down groups of enemies will net you bonus time. You'll also periodically play a mouse-controlled minigame, with further time being added to the clock if you do well.</p>



<p>While the shooting aspect of Carnival Coaster mode is quite simple, it works well enough, and the minigames you play are almost all winners -- some of the best in all of Jamboree. While some of these minigames are quite simple, asking you to pluck and sort mail into folders or scoop ice cream cones, others throw in a literal twist as you use mouse and motion controls simultaneously to, say, stack and manipulate blocks and other items to build the highest tower.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, the Switch 2’s built-in features bring some added functionality to the standard Mario Party experience as well. Players can capture a live image of their face to give the party a personal touch and GameChat has the potential to make online games a little more rowdy. GameShare support also means both Switch 2 and OG Switch owners can test Jamboree out with you, even if they don't own the game. Meanwhile, Jamboree’s resolution has also been bumped up (it already ran at 60fps on the OG Switch), which is nice, although I don’t know if many people play Mario Party for its graphical fidelity.</p>



<p>With all these additions, the Switch 2 version of Super Mario Party Jamboree is probably the most feature- and content-rich entry in the series to date, which is good, because it’s also the most expensive game in the series at a full $80 (those who own the Switch version can upgrade for $20). Whether you’re willing to pony up that much to party hardy is up to you.</p>

<p><strong>A Sometimes-Stimulating Switch 2 Showcase</strong></p>



<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV is an interesting showcase of Nintendo’s latest hardware features, for better or worse. The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera feels like a late-to-the-party retread of a style of gameplay that went out of fashion a decade ago, but pretty much any mode and minigame that relies on Joy-Con 2 mouse controls works out quite well. Nintendo’s asking price may be hard to justify for some, but if you’re looking for a single product that shows off all of the Switch 2’s unique abilities, this multi-talented upgrade may be worth an invite.</p>



<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV launches on July 24. As mentioned, those who already own the Switch version of Jamboree can upgrade for $20 or you can buy the original game and upgrade together for $80.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a twist that no one could have predicted a few years ago, the best-selling game released on PlayStation 5 in 2025 so far is Forza Horizon 5, a game published by Microsoft.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/forza-horizon-5-is-now-2025s-top?just_subscribed=true">Alinea Analytics</a>, the fifth entry in the series by Playground Games, which was released on PlayStation 5 this March, has surpassed 3 million copies on Sony's system, overtaking <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which sits at 2.9 million copies, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which sold 2 million, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, which sold 1.4 million copies, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which sold 1.3 million units.</p>



<p>While selling 3 million copies in just a few months, by itself, is a very good indication of how well Forza Horizon 5 is doing on PlayStation 5, the Microsoft game seems to be doing even better on the system, looking at other data, as it is also outselling other first-party exclusives. According to the data provided by Alinea, Forza Horizon 5 sold 2 million copies on PlayStation 5 in 25 days, while other first-party exclusives like Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Astro Bot failed to achieve similar results. The second entry in the Kojima Production series only sold 1 million copies in 25 days, while last year's GOTY only passed two million copies sold in three months. As such, it's becoming clearer how Microsoft's decision to go multiplatform has been the right one to offset low sales on Xbox systems and stagnating Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 5 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about this excellent racing game by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/">review.</a></p>

Staff say the manner in which the corp let go of around 9k staff was "inhumane" and has left those who remain facing an incredibly tough future.</p>
<p>An unannounced MMO in development at ZeniMax, codenamed Project Blackbird, was one of the games cancelled by Microsoft as part of the corporate bloodletting, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">Rare's Everwild</a> and The Initiative's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">being canned</a>. Just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-union-say-theyre-fighting-for-staff-left-in-limbo-by-microsoft-cancelling-mmo-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">last week</a>, the ZeniMax Online Studios United (ZOSU) union said they're still fighting on behalf of workers at the studio left in limbo by Blackbird's cancellation.</p>

<p>The staff <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/zenimax-staff-lambast-inhumane-xbox-layoffs-it-s-difficult-to-work-when-you-re-looking-at-a-graveyard-">Game Developer</a> spoke to for the report paint a horrifying picture of the day that saw Microsoft jettison all of those people and projects. They claim staff were removed from company communications such as Slack and email before human resources had even made contact to inform them whether they'd been let go. "It was so sad seeing people so distraught and confused and not knowing if they would have a job by the end of the day - or even if the layoffs were done by the end of the day," said current ZeniMax worker and ZeniMax Workers United - CWA union member Page Branson.</p>
<p>"It's not okay. It wasn't normal," added ZeniMax senior QA tester and fellow ZeniMax Workers United member Autumn Mitchell. "I don't care how many times they do it to try and make it seem normal — it's not. The way they do it is inhumane. I don't care how much they say that it's dignified or they want to do it in a respectful way - it's not."</p>
<p>"Making it so that people have to rush to type a goodbye message into Slack to their colleagues that they've been working with on various projects, that have been making your corporation money for 15 years, is disgusting," the QA tester continued.</p>
<p>Both Branson and Mitchell believe the cuts at ZeniMax, which Game Developer report have affected "hundreds" of workers, would have been worse if a significant number of the studio's staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-have-reached-a-tentative-contract-agreement-with-microsoft-paving-the-way-for-better-wages-and-more">hadn't unionised</a>. As is, they say the layoffs have seen key developers be let go, leaving those who remain facing a bleak future.</p>
<p>"A lot of practical knowledge just disappeared overnight," Branson said. "Everyone left now has to pick up the pieces as best they can. The [dwindling] morale and general confusion of it all has extended into our general workflow. We used to have very, very reliable people working on things and they're no longer there. They were integral. I feel like they were numbers on a sheet that got cut, but the real application of what they were doing was integral to making everything run correctly."</p>
<p>"This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games," Mitchell added, later likening the situation to having to keep on working while "looking at a graveyard".</p>

            <p>It seems that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> could be getting a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> port.</p>
<p>During Ubisoft's latest quarterly earnings call, which was listened to by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-might-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">IGN</a>, the company's CEO Yves Guillemot commented that Assassin's Creed Shadows has "some new versions" coming, which will be available "on other machines". Given that Shadows is already available on PC, Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, that only really leaves Nintendo's hardware under that 'other machines' banner, unless the studio exec was referring to previous generation consoles or mobile.</p>

<p>However, during the same call Ubisoft's CFO Frederick Duguet seemed to further cement this idea that Assassin's Creed Shadows may make its Nintendo debut. Responding to one investor, Duguet said: "And we also have a game that will be launched on the Switch 2."</p>
<p>Before you say, 'but Victoria, this is clearly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">which we know is headed to Switch 2 already</a> - Duguet was talking about games "beyond the announced releases". So, evidently there's at least one other Ubisoft title bound for Nintendo's latest console.</p>
<p>Couple these comments from Ubisoft's leadership with that <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-assassins-creed-shadows-has-appeared-on-the-pegi-website.1168491/">Nintendo Switch 2 PEGI rating for Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> that started making the rounds in April, and it seems an announcement of some sort is ultimately on the horizon.</p>

<p>In addition to these little Shadow nuggets, Ubisoft also recently celebrated welcoming five million players to its latest Assassin's Creed game. "Assassin's Creed Shadows delivered on its expectations, with now more than five million unique players since its launch," Guillemot wrote in Ubisoft's FY26 Q1 sales report.</p>
<p>The team elaborated further on social media, revealing that along with those five million assassins, there have been 2bn stealth kills and 38 million animals petted. Meanwhile, players have travelled 1bn kilometers since the game was released in March.</p>
<p>"And still, you paused to take in the view," <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1947688095123460139">Ubisoft wrote</a>. "Thank you for forging legends with us."</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blades-of-fire">Blades of Fire</a>, the dark fantasy action-adventure from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-dread">Metroid Dread</a> studio MercurySteam, has "underperformed" following its console and Epic Games Store-exclusive PC release in May, contributing to a €10m loss for publishing group Digital Bros. The company has blamed the game's failure on "an oversupply of new releases and increasingly selective consumers".
</p>
<p>
Blades of Fire marked MercurySteam's first new title since it collaborated with Nintendo on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-dread-review-a-sublime-return-for-a-nintendo-icon">2021's widely acclaimed Metroid Dread</a>, and it launched to generally positive reviews. Eurogamer, for instance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blades-of-fire-review">called it</a> "original, lovable, and born of genuine passion, despite the near overwhelming number of problems that could have extinguished it." Other upbeat reviews followed, but that clearly hasn't been enough to tempt a sufficient number of players into Blades of Fire's world.
</p>
<p>
Digital Bros (which owns Blades of Fire publisher 505 Games) has <a href="https://digitalbros-com.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025.07.22-FY2024-2025-Trade-update_cript.pdf">announced</a> it now expects revenue for its fiscal year ending 30th June 2025 - already projected to decline year-on-year - will "contract even further". The company says it currently anticipates a loss of "at least" €10m (approximately £8.7m), which it blames directly on the "underperformance" of Blades of Fire and higher-than-expected write-offs due to "persistent market uncertainty".

<p>
"The video game market remains affected by challenging competitive dynamics, driven by an oversupply of new releases and increasingly selective consumers," Digital Bros wrote. "These conditions make it particularly difficult to successfully launch new titles and to develop reliable forecasting models capable of accurately projecting sales and volumes at launch."
</p>
<p>
This, it added, "confirms the challenges faced by most industry peers and competitors in attracting consumers to new titles, particularly when these are not backed by an established brand driving a loyal player community."
</p>
<p>
Digital Bros' announcement mirrors similar struggles from other publishers in recent years. Last September, for instance, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage studio Don't Nod blamed an "extremely competitive and selective market" for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-bets-on-lost-records-bloom-rage-as-multiple-projects-fail-to-meet-expectations">commercial underperformance</a> of its critically acclaimed Jusant and Banishers, while Ubisoft highlighted an industry shift toward "mega-brands and long-lasting titles" following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-again">considerably lower-than-expected earnings</a> in 2023.
</p>
<p>
But it's also clear 'established brands' are no guarantee of success either. Despite its strategic shift, Ubisoft was forced to admit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws had seen a "softer than expected launch" last year</a>, and the might of Batman couldn't save Warner Bros' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flop-leads-to-41-drop-in-warner-bros-gaming-revenue">performed so badly it lead to a $200m loss</a> for the company.

<p>We wouldn't HATE it if he was correct</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Yes, we already reported a little while back that well-known YouTuber, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate">NateTheHate</a>, has suggested that a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/rumour-a-nintendo-direct-is-set-to-take-place-later-this-month-its-claimed">Nintendo Direct is incoming</a> sometime in and around July. That's this month!</p>
<p>Speaking on his YouTube show, Mr TheHate (hope we got that right) had said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What I have been told... There is a Direct this month, so the month of July. But, that Direct will not take place until after Donkey Kong Bananza releases. Beyond that, I have no additional information, I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>If I had to speculate, I would say probably the last week of July because Friday of that week is August 1st, right, which is Nintendo's earning report day. So I could see them having a Direct that week leading to that investor's report."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it seems he has now doubled down on this belief, with precious little time left for it to transpire. As seen over <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">on on his social media</a> (cheers <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/23/natethehate-states-again-that-he-believes-nintendo-direct-happening-this-month/">MyNintendoNews</a>), in answering another poster, Nate reveals that "to my knowledge"the Direct is still on the cards.</p>
<figure><a title="DIRECT IN JULY?" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7f16c52ccdeb/direct-in-july.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: x/@natethehate2</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nate has been reliable in the past, getting the Switch 2 announcement date correct, as an example, but we will all just have to wait and see with this one. At least there's not too long to go either way. One thing that may add a little credence, though, and it's something we've also reported on already, is that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/rumour-major-third-party-devs-reportedly-sitting-on-multiple-switch-2-announcements">a whole bunch of major devs are sitting on "multiple Switch 2 announcements".</a></p>
<p>Let's keep our fingers crossed that he's right, and a big juicy content drop is just around yonder corner.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Reckon there'll be a Direct in the window Nate points out? Looking forward to anything being announced in particular? make sure to let us know in the comments!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Square Enix and Tactic Studios have announced that the multiplayer murder mystery game KILLER INN will host a Closed Beta Test this weekend on Steam. The CBT is set to begin on Friday, July 25, 2025 at 3 PM Pacific Time and will be live until Monday, July 28, 2025 at 3 PM Pacific Time. Access can be requested <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1598230/KILLER_INN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the store page</a>.</p>



<p>The developers warned that this is first and foremost a test meant to verify how the servers hold up when a large number of players join the game at the same time. This version also lacks the tutorials that will be available when the game actually launches in the near future.</p>



<p>KILLER INN is an asymmetrical competitive game where players are divided into two teams. The larger group (16) of players is called Lambs and faces off against a smaller group (8) of Wolves. Each team must reduce the other team's ranks through combat—the first team to eliminate all of the other team's members wins. The difference is that the Wolves know who their teammates are from the start, but the Lambs don't know which of their teammates may actually be a Wolf.</p>



<p>Whenever a Wolf kills a Lamb, at least one clue is left behind. Lambs must gather these clues to figure out the Wolves' identities. When coming across a corpse, players must ensure to pick up any clues on it, as this is an essential aspect of the game. To survive, players will need weapons and armor. They can get them either by opening chests with tokens earned after completing quests for the castle's staff members in the castle, or saving up gold to buy items from the in-game shop.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles' Classic mode, which will allow players to experience the original game released back in 1997 on the first PlayStation, has been built from scratch, as the original source code has been lost, but this allowed the development team to add content that was cut from the original release.</p>



<p>In a new post shared on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/21/the-secrets-behind-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-makeover/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, the game's director Kazutoyo Maehiro confirmed once again that the Classic mode, which attempts to recreate the original as faithfully as possible, has been created from scratch, as the original master data and source code have been lost. As Maehiro-san highlighted, back in the day, developers didn't have effective resource management tools as they do today, and games were essentially developed by overwriting the previous code every time a bug was fixed or a language option was added.</p>



<p>As the Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Classic mode is meant to provide an experience faithful to the original, the development team also had the option of emulating the original, but doing so would have prevented them from making granular improvements. Eventually, it was decided that the best option would be to rebuild the original game from scratch. This choice paid off in a big way, as recreating the original experience gave the team a solid foundation upon which to create the Enhanced version, and add features that were cut from the original, such as character dialogues playing during battles under certain conditions that will help flesh out story character after they have joined Ramza's party. This is, in my opinion, a great addition, as it was sad to see this characters slide in the background and essentially become like generic units.</p>



<p>Although Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles will include some new features not seen in the original, it may not be the definitive edition some were waiting for, as tt won't feature the additional content seen in the War of the Lions PSP release, upon which the mobile release is based. <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-tactics-interview">The decision</a> to not include this extra content was made because the remaster's main goal was to be as faithful to the original as possible.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles launches on September 30th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft’s push to separate the concept of Xbox games from the Xbox console itself has always felt a little...annoying?

However, the really significant aspect of this detaching of the games from the machines is the releasing of once-Xbox exclusives onto Sony’s consoles. And in the case of flagship release <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, it’s proven such an enormous success that the game has outsold everything else released on the PS5 this year.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197533" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why People Are Rushing To Sell Their Xbox Series X To GameStop Right Now" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="197533,196181,197567" data-current="197533"><div><p>Why People Are Rushing To Sell Their Xbox Series X To GameStop Right Now</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23065.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> While we should always take industry analysis figures with a bucket of salt, it’s being reported by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/forza-horizon-5-is-now-2025s-top?just_subscribed=true&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/forza-horizon-5-is-now-2025s-top?just_subscribed=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alinea Insight newsletter</a></span> (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xboxs-forza-horizon-5-is-the-top-selling-new-ps5-game-of-2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xboxs-forza-horizon-5-is-the-top-selling-new-ps5-game-of-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thanks <em>GI.biz</em></a></span>) that <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> has now sold over 3 million copies on the PS5, pushing it ahead of <em>Monster Hunter World</em>, and seeing it outselling last year’s PlayStation exclusive&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em> in a third of the time, and far ahead of one of this year’s big PS5 launches, <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which Alinea says has sold one million over the last month, but is now leveling out. </p><p>Platform exclusivity has long been held as vital for the success of a console, ensuring people are forced to pick up <em>this</em> $500 box rather than <em>that</em> one. And once you’ve got your customer locked in, they’re yours for the generation. This led to the nonsense of the “console wars,” a successful marketing campaign of tribalist disharmony that’s still fought out in comments sections and X replies to this day. Gross. But <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">as Zack observed at the beginning of this year</a></span>, that era is now over.

But if any argued that it would fail, that door is well closed. According to Alinea, what drove <em>FH5</em> into the lead was a recent 25-percent-off sale.</p><p>The weird thing is, as much as it may upset those who formed parasocial relationship with their console manufacturer, this is pretty much a win for everyone involved. Most importantly as far as I’m concerned, it means more people get to enjoy a truly fantastic game without having to buy a whole new console or PC. But it also means millions more dollars for both Microsoft <em>and</em> Sony, given that the PlayStation owner will be getting a chunk of every sale.</p><p>Obviously, Microsoft’s moves are in large part a tacit admission of having lost this console generation—it was reported last year <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-outselling-xbox-50-million-data-sony-microsoft-1851243811&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-outselling-xbox-50-million-data-sony-microsoft-1851243811">that the PS5 could be outselling the Xbox Series two to one</a></span>, although some estimates claimed the difference <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/gaming/the-ps5-is-massively-outselling-the-xbox-series-x-and-s-combined-analyst-claims&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/the-ps5-is-massively-outselling-the-xbox-series-x-and-s-combined-analyst-claims" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could be as much as five times</a></span>. If you’ve got millions more people owning a PlayStation, it makes a lot of sense to sell your games to them, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-ceo-phil-spencer-console-wars-over-ps5-switch-era-1851765304?_gl=1*1p83dbw*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI2OTg5ODYkbzE4MSRnMCR0MTc1MjY5ODk4NiRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ceo-phil-spencer-console-wars-over-ps5-switch-era-1851765304?_gl=1*1p83dbw*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI2OTg5ODYkbzE4MSRnMCR0MTc1MjY5ODk4NiRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">even if you’re losing a portion of each sale</a></span>.</p><p>This means we’ll likely see former Xbox exclusives now hitting PS5 on day one—<em>Forza Horizon 6</em> could be an example. The argument for Xbox remains that these games will also be on Game Pass, with that accompanying sense of being “free.” Meanwhile, Sony still refuses to put its own first-party games straight onto its own subscription service, PS Plus, and is certainly showing no signs of reciprocating when it comes to launching its games on Microsoft’s consoles.</p><p>It all makes for far more interesting times, and if nothing else, hopefully the increased sales might stop sodding Microsoft from closing more studios.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-ps5-microsoft-xbox-1851786765]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime has launched a new live-service game with the new publisher he co-founded, Dreamhaven.</p>
<p>Wildgate - not to be confused with Splitgate 2, which has just gone back into beta - is a crew-based first-person space shooter available now across PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.</p>
<p>It's been developed by Moonshot Games, one of two developers under the Dreamhaven umbrella. The other is Secret Door, which recently launched its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sunderfolk-from-former-world-of-warcraft-boss-is-streamlined-tabletop-dd-by-way-of-final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles-and-some-is-hidden-on-your-mobile">tabletop-inspired RPG Sunderfolk</a>.</p>

<p>Wildgate casts players as "prospectors", teaming up and exploring space in search of an ancient relic known as the Artifact. Crews must either collect the Artifact and safely reach the exit, or destroy all rival ships to dominate space.</p>
<p>It's all presented in an over-the-top cartoonish style, filled with colourful alien characters and a vibrant sci-fi aesthetic.</p>
<p>"The response to Wildgate's open beta was incredible," said Morhaime. "It was truly inspiring to see so many players teaming up, jumping in, and having fun.</p>
<p>"Wildgate represents what Dreamhaven believes games can be: rich, imaginative, and deeply engaging. We're just beginning to open the gate to a galaxy full of wonder, strategy, and discovery, and we hope the game resonates with players of all kinds."</p>
<p>The development team has already shared its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3504780/view/530976484112732607">planned roadmap</a>, including bi-weekly updates, mid-season patches, and seasonal content drops.</p>
<p>"We're also going to present a few opportunities for players to purchase in-game content; however, our goal for paid content in Wildgate is for it to remain cosmetic and opt-in," the developer said.</p>
<p>At Blizzard, Morhaime was heavily involved in the development of World of Warcraft, and was CEO during the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>.</p>
<p>No doubt Morhaime and Dreamhaven will be hoping for live-service success with Wildgate, despite the difficulties of launching a new game in this genre.</p>
<p>As mentioned, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">Splitgate 2 will return to beta</a> following its full launch less than two months ago, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-tanks">World of Tanks</a> developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yet-another-live-service-game-announces-shut-down-just-three-months-after-early-access-launch">Wargaming will soon shut down its live-service mech shooter Steel Hunters</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is finally getting a reveal livestream tomorrow, where the public will be able to get their first look at the upcoming modern FPS in-action.
</p>
<p>The livestream will take place on the 24th July, at 4PM BST / 5PM CEST / 11AM EST / 8AM PST. You can watch it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgNCgJG0vnY&amp;ab_channel=Battlefield">the official Battlefield YouTube channel, right here</a>!
</p>
<p>The livestream will be the first <em>official</em> reveal of Battlefield 6 for those who haven't been able to jump into the game's closed beta tests, which have been running over the past few months. There's no word as of writing what exactly will be shown, nor the exact length of the trailer we'll be seeing.

<p>Despite there being little revealed from the game's developers or publishers, there have been some leaked details in recent months. Earlier this month leaks <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-image-suggests-the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-called-battlefield-6-and-the-reveal-event-is-coming-very-soon">indicated that the game would in-fact be called Battlefield 6</a>. Details on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">Battlefield 6's single player component</a> have also crept out, plus the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">fan-favourite Rush mode</a>.
</p>
<p>Information on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">Battlefield 6 weapons and the game's battle royale mode</a> have also been sneakily dropped by closed beta testers. Reporting has also claimed that lofty expectations have been levied against Battlefield 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-expects-battlefield-6-to-have-100-million-players-three-times-more-than-the-series-best-seller">with a 100m player figure established internally</a> for the main game and its free-to-play battle royale.
</p>
<p>Excitement for Battlefield 6 is palpable among FPS lovers and series diehards alike. This group <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-youre-worried-about-one-of-battlefield-6s-most-controversial-design-changes-dice-just-confirmed-your-fears">has been torn as of late due when it comes to classes</a>. In the past, weapons and gadgets have been locked to these dedicated classes, and old fans love this system. A classless approach has been announced for Battlefield 6, though official Battlefield social media accounts has recently announced <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1947310614411616383">playlists for both class and classless matches</a>.

<figure><a title="grounded peer to peer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/29ce1cc0c3a7d/grounded-peer-to-peer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Obsidian</em></figcaption></figure><p>We reviewed Obsidian's excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> back when it released on Switch last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/grounded">giving it a 7/10</a> and remarking that it was really only the game's performance on the console that held it back from a much better score.</p>
<p>Indeed, Grounded, when it's running well, is perhaps one of our favourite survival games of the past console generation or two. With this in mind, and given that the game does now perform better if you happen to have a Switch 2 (well, it's much less blurry, that's for sure), Switch players may be wondering if it's going to suddenly disappear, now that the dev has moved onto the final prep phase for Grounded 2 (which sadly is only aiming at xbox and PC, for now).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vnzhgs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Thankfully, during an interview (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-going-anywhere-if-people-still-want-to-play-it-as-grounded-2-gets-ready-to-launch-obsidian-promises-its-not-the-end-of-the-road-for-the-original-game">Eurogamer</a>) the game's executive producer, Marcus Morgan, has said that, "We actually have this strong passion to ensure our games can stand the test of time and keep updating through history...There's a strong desire on our side to make sure that our games are preserved,"</p>
<p>He continued, "Now, are we going to be doing content and these story expansions to Grounded 1? No, that's the continuation of Grounded 2. But even as recently as April we released 1.4.7 to Grounded 1, so there's a maintenance and a desire that that game will always exist. So we'll keep that up, it's not going anywhere if people still want to play Grounded 1 as well." They did also give us gyro controls in an update last year, so you can't knock the enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Recently, of course, there's been a little extra attention on what happens with games when they've had their time in the limelight, with groups such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/it-will-have-a-chilling-effect-on-game-design-eu-group-responds-to-stop-killing-games">Stop Killing Games</a> drawing attention to the issues faced when games are taken offline.</p>
<p>To this end, Morgan gets a little more detailed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One of the things that we did in terms of how we structured Grounded is multiplayer is done through peer-to-peer, which in first blush, feels antiquated versus dedicated servers. But we were able to blend that with shared worlds, and what that does is it allows you, effectively, a cloud save that you can share with your friends. So it gives that experience of being able to have a more dedicated server vibe, but it doesn't have that same requirement of actually having servers.</p>
<p>And this is no commentary on the Stop Killing Games stuff or anything like that...More to say it does establish (the game) so it can exist into the future a lot easier than if you're on the other side, where you are more of a server-based game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, while we wait and hope that Grounded gets one last switch drop in the form of a gentle Switch 2 upgrade (you know you want to, Obsidian), us Grounded fans can at least rest assured in the knowledge that the game isn't just gonna disappear on us. Probably.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> is being taken "back to beta" by developers 1047 Games, who say it "launched too early" and are now planning to rerelease it next year. The move has reportedly seen the studio lay off 45 workers, and they've confirmed that the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate">Splitgate</a>'s servers will be shutting down in a month's time.</p>
<p>The news comes following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-remains-a-portal-hopping-fps-delight-but-it-really-needs-to-lighten-up">mixed launch reception</a> for the portal-filled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, which likely wasn't helped by studio CEO Ian Proulx controversially announcing that it was going live while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-boss-admits-the-trumpish-hat-he-wore-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-publicity-stunt-after-it-goes-sour">wearing a MAGA-style “Make FPS Great Again” hat</a> on stage at Summer Game Fest. The exec subsequently apologised for that boneheaded publicity stunt.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In an update posted to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/510712444576860070?l=english">Steam page</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1947717804364353641">socials</a> Proulx and fellow 1047 Games co-founder Nicholas Bagamian wrote that they "had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2", but "rushed certain features, made some boneheaded mistakes, and most importantly – we didn't give you the polished, portal-filled mayhem you fell in love with".</p>
<p>So, the game is returning to beta until early 2026, with the studio promising a major overhaul that'll include "reworking progression from the ground up, adding more portals to our maps, simplifying monetisation, refocusing on classic game modes you've been asking for, and more". Though, 1047 say Splitgate 2'll remain playable in the interim, with its Chapter 3 update and some bug fixes still incoming.</p>
<p>The update acknowledged that this decision has been accompanied by layoffs at the studio, but didn't state how many. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-will-go-back-to-beta-to-undergo-a-massive-rework-amid-more-layoffs-and-splitgate-1-shutdown?utm_source=threads,twitter">IGN</a> reports that 45 workers have been affected. This is the second round of job cuts at 1047 this year, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-their-hat-and-pricing-controversies-splitgate-2-studio-1047-games-have-laid-off-an-unspecified-number-of-devs">an unspecified number of devs having been let go</a> in June.</p>
<p>The studio are also planning to shut down the original Splitgate's servers in a month's time. "While we'd love to keep servers online indefinitely, it's cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past couple of years, and we have to prioritize our team," Proulx and Bagamian wrote. "Like us, we know this game means a lot to so many of you, so we are exploring the possibility of supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches."</p>
<p>Hopefully the folks affected by these layoffs can land on their feet.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-devs-1047-games-lay-off-more-staff-as-the-shooter-heads-back-to-beta-eyeing-a-2026-rerelease]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Obsidian has given Eurogamer a good indication of how long Grounded 2 will be in early access for, and whether the game will come to PlayStation and other platforms besides Xbox and PC.</p>
<p>As with the original ant-sized backyard survival game, Grounded 2 will launch in early access, starting next week, from 29th July. But how long will it remain in open development for? "As long as we need to to get the game right," executive producer Marcus Morgan told me.</p>
<p>"We don't plan on being in early access forever," he added, "but you definitely need the time. We were in early access for Grounded 1 for about two years and that gave us enough time to meaningfully take community feedback and actually adjust the game. Roughly that window again, but the appropriate amount of time to make it right."</p>

<p>Grounded 2 will be a PC and Xbox game because Obsidian is a Microsoft-owned studio. But Grounded was also one of the series Microsoft experimented with offering on other platforms, on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. Those versions launched last year and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">they seem to have performed well</a>. Tonally speaking, Grounded is a perfect fit for Switch, and though there were performance issues on original Switch hardware, we are now of course in the era of the more powerful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Will Grounded 2 come to other platforms besides PC and Xbox, then? Marcus Morgan smiled when I asked him this, specifically about a PlayStation release, then said, "Can't talk about that right now. But I will say that Grounded 1 is on all of those platforms so..." And then he smiled again.</p>
<p>Grounded 2 will bring a bevy of new ideas to the Grounded formula, notably insect mounts to ride around a much larger playing world in, that of Brookhollow Park, which will have ice dungeons and other varied biomes to explore. There are also deeper gameplay systems now and added nuance in combat, which lends the game much more staying power and interest over time.</p>
<p>I can tell you more about Grounded 2 when the embargo on early access impressions lifts on 29th July.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/will-grounded-2-come-to-playstation-and-switch-2-grounded-was-on-all-those-platforms-teases-obsidian-executive-producer]]></content:encoded>

            <p>They do say pride comes before a fall, and despite donning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-director-apologises-for-causing-division-following-controversial-summer-game-fest-appearance">a hat proclaiming "Make FPS Great Again" at Summer Game Fest earlier this year</a>, studio founder Ian Proulx and 1047 Games are putting Splitgate 2 back into the beta box. Not only that, the studio is also taking the original Splitgate offline and laying off members of staff. </p>
<p>In a statement shared on Tuesday addressing the Splitgate 2 community, the studio admitted  it had exited the sequel's initial beta far too early. "We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew. We rushed certain features, made some boneheaded mistakes, and most importantly - we didn't give you the polished, portal-filled mayhem you fell in love with," 1047 Games wrote.</p>
<p>As such, Splitgate 2 is going back into beta, less than two months after its official launch. The studio will now do a significant amount of rework on areas including progression, as well as adding more portals to maps and "simplifying" monetisation.</p>

<p>This rebuilding phase will last "until early next year", the developer said, and Splitgate 2 will remain playable during this time. The game's third chapter will still ship, and the team has promised "fixes and high priority changes" for those who stick around. "We hope you will continue to play and support the game," it wrote.</p>
<p>However, all of this has come with a human cost, and as a result of this decision the studio is laying off staff, and that's after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-developer-1047-games-lays-off-small-group-of-valued-staff">already laid off other team members shortly after Splitgate 2's initial launch</a>. "This is heartbreaking. These are our teammates and our friends, and they helped build what we have today," 1047 Games said of the studio's most recent layoffs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Elgato has announced that its latest 4K-capable capture card, the cunningly-named Elgato 4K S, is 100% compatible with the Switch 2 - and it's a<a href="https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/p/game-capture-4k-s">vailable for purchase right now!</a> (Thanks, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/elgatos-new-game-capture-4k-s-is-switch-2-compatible-164745527.html">Engadget</a>).</p>
<p>The 4K S, which is also the most budget-friendly card in Elgato's range, coming in at a price of $159.99/£149.99, sits externally to almost any console you can think of, to capture your latest <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> antics at up to 4K/60fps with zero-latency passthrough.</p>
<p>The card replaces the ever-popular Elgato HD60 X, which was only capable of 4k/30fps (and was more expensive at launch), and you can betcha there's gonna be some clamouring for them right here at Nintendo Life HQ. Oh yes, sir.</p>
<p>Here's some more official details from Elgato:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Capture in True 4K60<br></strong>Capture crystal-clear 4K gameplay at a silky-smooth 60 frames per second. Colors pop, details shine, and your footage looks amazing in every moment. On Windows, you can even capture vibrant 1080p HDR gameplay, perfect for bringing cinematic moments to life.</p>
<p><strong>Gameplay First, Capture Second<br></strong>4K S keeps your games smooth and responsive while you record. You can:<br>
Enjoy full <strong>4K60 passthrough</strong> with <strong>HDR and VRR</strong>, so your gameplay stays crisp and tear-free<br>
Chasing higher frame rates? Play at up to <strong>1080p240</strong> or <strong>1440p144</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next-gen ready by design</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Switch 2<br></strong>Capture gameplay in 4K60, 1440p120, or 1080p60 HDR while you play titles like <em>Mario Kart World</em> or <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Capture Audio, Your Way<br></strong>Thanks to 4K S’s ultra-low latency, you don’t need extra gear to monitor or record game audio.<br>
Need real-time audio to your headset? Chat Link Pro delivers zero-latency audio for both game and chat, ideal when timing is everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With regards to the card itself, and whether or not you should be excited to run out and nab one, well our very own Alex, the lovely person, is a bit of an expert when it comes to these things and he's weighed in with some buyer's advice from his time with the 4K X, which we'll stick here for further reading!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's always great to see cheaper hardware appear alongside premium options, but I do think it's important to consider Elgato's software support with the 4K X, which is less than stellar to say the least. I've been using the card for the Switch 2 since before launch, and at every turn I've had to either sacrifice control, quality, or performance.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>I've battled with dropped frames, terrible HDR tonemapping, a lack of audio downmixing, sync drift, and many other problems besides. OBS seems to be the way to go, as their own software comes with its own issues and you'll have to sacrifice all sense of control.When the card works, it works well, but if the 4K S is anything like its big brother, be prepared for a lot of frustrating hoops and hurdles to achieve acceptable results. Just be wary before taking the plunge."</p>

<p>Now, we're off to record some primo footage of our best run in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/balan_wonderworld">Balan Wonderworld.</a> Beautiful 4K Wonderworld...</p>

			<p>While <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5wMXD5U7aP5imdxB186rmg/d3ffd32ed3c2821d7e89d3c48d0ade35/Ubisoft_FY26_Q1_Sales_EN_vf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting its Q1 2025 financial results</a>, Ubisoft revealed that Assassin's Creed Shadows continues to perform well. After reaching 3 million players <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the end of March</a>, the game has now surpassed 5 million unique players, who have collectively performed 2 billion stealth kills, traveled 1 billion kilometers, and petted 38 million animals. However, the publisher's quarterly financial results still reported lower than anticipated net bookings, mostly due to issues with Rainbow Six Siege, as noted in the below statement by Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot:</p>



<p><em>The first quarter delivered mixed results. On the positive side, Assassin’s Creed Shadows delivered on its expectations, with now more than 5 million unique players since its launch, and Rainbow Six Siege X received highly positive player feedback thanks to its renewed gameplay and enhanced features that drove significant player engagement growth. However, player spending in Rainbow Six Siege faced temporary but significant disruptions due to technical pricing issues, which have now been identified and addressed. Despite this one-off setback, the growth potential of the game is strong with solid traction on activity and in-game spending.</em></p>



<p>Ubisoft also noted that the other two causes for the lower net bookings include a 'partnership that is now expected to materialize in Q2 and, to a lesser extent, an unfavorable foreign exchange impact'.</p>



<p>Guillemot then added that Ubisoft will continue creating so-called Creative Houses. The hope is that these business units will boost creative vision and business performance. The first one is, of course, the subsidiary <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> earlier this year, which is set to oversee the Rainbow Six, Far Cry, and Assassin's Creed franchise. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> recently, it will be led by Christopher Derennes and Yves Guillemot's own son.</p>



<p>As for the Assassin's Creed Shadows expansion, Claws of Awaji, Ubisoft only reiterated that it's coming in their fiscal Q2 and will offer more than 10 hours of new content, as well as a new weapon, skills, and abilities. <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-reportedly-set-for-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, it might launch as early as September, although if that's truly the case, an official announcement will have to be made soon by the publisher.</p>
