            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/football-heroes-league-preview-pax-east-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The newest title from Run Games, <em>Football Heroes League</em>, is a fun and fast-paced 2 vs. 2 co-op experience where you go up against friends in a match of soccer (football for our international readers). We got to go hands-on with this at PAX East, so read on to check out our <em>Football Heroes League</em> preview!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Football Heroes League </em>Preview - A Love Letter to Soccer&nbsp;</h2>

<p>What sets <em>Footballl Heroes League </em>apart from other soccer games is its sense of on-the-field presence and the special abilities that each hero has. Where a game like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fifa-21" rel="nofollow"><em>FIFA</em></a> gives you a bird's-eye view of the field, the <em>Football Heroes League </em>developers wanted to capture that feeling of being on the field yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My background is, I'm a soccer player," Run Games Creative Director Michael Marzola told me. "I've been playing it my whole life, it's a giant part of my life. I wanted to bring something to gamers where it feels more like playing real soccer, when you're running down the field and you have that tunnel vision."&nbsp;</p>

<p>A game of&nbsp;<em>Football Heroes League</em>&nbsp;starts as a routine soccer match, but each of the current five heroes (with more on the way) has special abilities that the player can unleash at any time. The current slate of heroes includes Kenzo, Frostine, Beckers, Bun-E, and Leo.</p>

<p>During my preview, I first played as Leo, a hulking lion man with abilities that allow him to leap great distances and charge, and then as Frostine, gliding around the field on an iceflow.</p>



<p>Adapting to the opposing team kept me constantly changing direction and redirecting my offensive and defensive strategies, especially when an enemy Frostine would surge forward with her Glacier Glide, creating a path of ice through the air that she slides on to get ahead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marzola still plays in a soccer league, but his inspiration to make <em>Football Heroes League </em>comes from the inescapable fact of getting older.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"My wife keeps asking me to quit, saying I'm going to tear my ACL," Marzola said. "I realized I don't have that many years left to play, so this is a love letter to soccer fans and also to myself to say, 'This is something when I'm old and gray, when I'm 80 years old, I can still play this when I can't play the real thing.'"&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Football Heroes League </em>&amp; Global Influence&nbsp;</h2>

<p>With how ubiquitous soccer is around the world, Run Games was able to leverage its international team to put everything they had into <em>Football Heroes League</em>. The team initially unveiled <em>Football Heroes League</em> at Gamescom Latam in Brazil and were thrilled to see the fan feedback they were receiving from a part of the world where soccer is so huge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marzola brought up a photo the team took with a young boy at Gamescom Latam and told me how he would play <em>Football Heroes League</em> again and again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"He played probably 30 times," Marzola said. "Every time he'd play, he'd go to the back of the line to play again. We had these trophy matches, and when he won his trophy his dad had us all autograph it for him. It was honestly one of the best moments in my game-development career, and I've been making games since 2000."</p>



<h2><em>Football Heroes League</em>&nbsp;Preview - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Football Heroes League</em> was an unexpected delight on the PAX East show floor, one that I went back to multiple times even after my initial preview appointment was finished. The matches are quick, and it's easy to jump into<em> Football Heroes League t</em>o play a quick session if you don't have much time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The abilities of each hero make <em>Football Heroes League </em>feel more like a battle royale than a soccer game, while still showcasing crisp and reactive soccer gameplay that makes this experience stand out.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Football Heroes League </em>is currently in early access and free to play on Steam with a promise of more heroes to be released over time. For the dev team, this was a total dream to be able to work on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This game for me is a dream project, a passion project," Marzola said. "It's something that I feel so lucky that I'm able to share with the world. It's genuine. It's not just business; it's business and art."</p>

But even though the latest entry in the long-running franchise is not even out yet, fans are already looking beyond it to the series’ future. Specifically, many want to know if <em>Tony Hawk’s</em> <em>Underground </em>and <em>Underground 2 </em>will get fancy remakes one day. According to Tony Hawk, he wants those remakes, too, and will “campaign” to make them real. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,195752,195618" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-officially-revealed-launchin-1851767654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-officially-revealed-launchin-1851767654"><em>THPS 3+4 </em>is  an upcoming remake</a></span> of the third and fourth entries in the <em>THPS</em> franchise, which were released in 2001 and 2002 respectively on PS2. The games are incredibly popular and received rave reviews back in the day. But for many fans, the best game in the series is the one that followed those two: 2003's <em>Tony Hawk’s</em> <em>Underground</em>.

I’ll campaign all I can, but I’m working with a much bigger company that’s a lot smarter than me.” </p><p>When <em>ScreenRant </em>pushed again, asking if Activision has hinted that it wants to do a <em>THUG </em>remake after <em>THPS 3+4</em>, Hawk responded: “Yeah, we haven’t even released this game.” Which is...totally fair. </p><p>Still, I do hope that Hawk is able to convince Activision to remake <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-tony-hawk-games-from-worst-to-best-1844342766/slides/13?_gl=1*1ykfm13*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcwNTYyMjQkbzg5JGcxJHQxNzQ3MDY5MDIwJGo4JGwwJGgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-tony-hawk-games-from-worst-to-best-1844342766/slides/13?_gl=1*1ykfm13*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcwNTYyMjQkbzg5JGcxJHQxNzQ3MDY5MDIwJGo4JGwwJGgw"><em>Tony Hawk’s Underground</em></a></span> and its sequel at some point.

Sure, you can argue that they also marked the end of the series’ classic era and likely set the franchise on a course that would lead to worse sequels, but that doesn’t change the fact that <em>THUG</em> is a fantastic skateboarding game that would likely be a hit these days. The kids love open-world games and zany antics. They’d likely dig <em>THUG</em>. But I’m not holding my breath, as it took Activision five years to finally give us more <em>Tony Hawk</em> after the success of <em>THPS 1+2</em> in 2020. </p><p>In other <em>Tony Hawk </em>news:<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/news/598275/tony-hawk-pro-skate-3-4-remaster-bam-margera&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/598275/tony-hawk-pro-skate-3-4-remaster-bam-margera" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Bam Margera is going to be a secret skater in <em>THPS 3+4</em></a></span><em>. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-activision-bam-margera-added-thps-3-4-remake-1851772278&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-activision-bam-margera-added-thps-3-4-remake-1851772278">This follows reports that Hawk pressured and demanded Activision</a></span> and the devs to include the skater in the game after he had cleaned up his life. </p><p>You’ll be able to play as Bam, Hawk, and a bunch of other skaters when T<em>ony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</em> launches on July 11 on Xbox, Game Pass, PlayStation, Switch, Switch 2, and PC.</p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The scalper situation is going to happen whenever there's an in-demand product, and it's not very fair on real trainers who just want to collect and play Pokémon for the love of the hobby. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The crypto-turned investor bros aren't helping either, but give someone an opportunity to turn $1 into $5 and they'll do it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This doesn't mean I condone any of this behaviour, far from it, but retailers should and need to do more to ensure everyone has a fair shot at buying Pokémon TCG. Loyalty and member drops, "X" amount per household, invitation-based preorders and re-stocks are all solid way's to control Pokémania.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is only a few retailers are doing this, making it easy for scalpers and bot groups to snap up stock. Retailers such as Costco seem quite happy to let chaos ensue as human beings fight each other for bits of cardboard. Common sense doesn't float with these kinds of people, so restraints and control need to be put into place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If retailers started implimenting these measures and TPC begin to flood the market with enough product for everyone to enjoy, it would make a more accessible hobby for everyone. For collectors, values of legacy chase cards would eventually climb as sealed stock goes out of print anyway, everyone wins. Well, bar the scalpers, but screw 'em.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-taking-a-unique-approach-to-storytelling-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Enjoy the moments of Remembrance.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring is a game steeped with lore. Story details are everywhere, from traditional cutscenes, environmental details, conversations with NPCs, and yes the FromSoft classic: even buried within item descriptions. But Elden Ring Nightreign is a very different type of FromSoft game: It’s an online-driven co-op PVE game with roguelite elements. That makes it a bit difficult to deliver the usual kind of FromSoft narrative. So how is the story in Nightreign conveyed? Well, let’s talk a little bit about Remembrances. Read on and/or watch the video below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So to start, let’s break down what the story of Nightreign even is. And who better to break that down than game director Junya Ishizaki:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nightreign shares essentially the base setting and the world of Elden Ring, but it's played out on a different stage so to speak. So there's this concept called the Night Lord, which is a sort of abstract phenomenon or calamity that has befallen The Lands Between in this alternate timeline, and much like a real-life calamity, it's something that it's not done by design or intention – it's just something that has occurred naturally and it's befallen the lands between and it needed some sort of opposition. It needs something to oppose it, and that opposition comes in the form of the Nightfarers, who are these warriors who are entrusted with the fate of opposing and defeating the Nightlord and putting a stop to this terrible calamity.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s the setup that brings together our eight different character classes who are gathered from all across Elden RIng’s world. Nightreign’s story is more about filling in the details of who these eight characters are, what are their motivations, what was their past before having this responsibility thrust upon them to defeat the Nightlords. And to learn that, we have the Remembrances. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the stops the player can make at the Roundtable Hold in between matches of Nightreign is a journal in the library where you can view your current character’s Remembrances. Some of these are just journal entries that reveal a little bit of information about the character’s backstory. However, some of them are playable snippets of a moment from the character’s past. When you launch into a playable Remembrance, there will be a hazy dreamlike border around the screen, and you’ll be transported to the location of the memory. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After talking with an NPC within a Remembrance, you’ll gain a personal objective. These will differ from character to character and Remembrance to Remembrance. For some, like the Ironeye for example, your personal objective might be to launch into a match, travel to a specific marked location, and then defeat a miniboss that will only appear there if the Remembrance objective is active. Once you do, you’ll gain an item that you can bring back into the flashback, return to the NPC, and then you’ll be able to move forward to the next chapter of that character’s story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The objectives themselves vary between classes and Remembrances. Wylder, for instance, instead of having to fight a boss, might have to find a specific item located in a cavern, which is a location you might not generally go due to the risk of being stuck there when the ring starts closing in. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the Raider, who has a completely different style of Remembrance. He gets transported away from the Roundtable Hold and must participate in gladiatorial-like 1-on-1 battles against a variety of bosses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an interesting and very unique departure when it comes to storytelling for a FromSoft game. I personally have only gotten a small taste of these individual character storylines, but what I’ve seen and played through so far has me eager to see more once I get my hands on the full game. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The exception to this rule will be games released as a partnership and that don't fall under its numbered releases umbrella, as Limited Run will leave this decision up to the developer or publisher.</p>

<p>Game-Key Cards are notably cheaper to produce as well, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/" data-ref-id="1100-6530654">Nintendo has confirmed that these won't be locked to your Switch 2</a> or tied to your account if you buy one and choose to resell it down the line. The reveal of Game-Key cards has been met with some criticism, as it looks like players will be forced to upgrade the internal storage capacity of their Switch 2--the console offers 256GB of storage, but a portion of that will be reserved for system files--with a pricy MicroSD Express card.</p><p>It is worth noting that Switch 2 games that are Game-Key Cards will have a disclaimer on the front cover, and several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-nintendo-switch-2-titles-have-the-full-game-on-the-game-card/2900-6508/" data-ref-id="2900-6508">Switch 2 games will offer the full game on the cartridge</a>. This includes a number of first-party Switch 2 games like Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong: Bananza, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, while a handful of third-party games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar will also be full-game releases.</p>

Serving as a prequel to 2016's <em>Doom</em>, this newest entry in the franchise features a heavy medieval flavor, so you’ll need to master using a shield and flail alongside the usual bevy of deadly guns you’ve come to expect. If you’re diving into the game and want a few tips on how to approach this fresh take on the series, we’ve got you covered below.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195371,195386" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#difficulty&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#difficulty">Customize the experience</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#explore&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#explore">Explore your environments (it’s worth it!)</a></span><br>3. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#defense&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#defense">Master your shield</a></span><br>4. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#challenge&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#challenge">Take on every mission challenge</a></span></p><hr><h2 id="h828367"><a id="difficulty"></a>You can customize your gameplay to suit your preferences</h2><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> doesn’t gatekeep. While you’re free to tackle the game on a pre-set difficulty, <strong>you can also customize your gameplay experience with a variety of sliders</strong>. These give you control over things like the difficulty and aggression of enemies, how much damage you do to demons, your parry window, and even the overall game speed. <br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages: </em>The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>And remember: There is no wrong answer here. Gaming is meant to be fun, so adjust these settings to wherever they need to be for you to have a hell of a good time. Besides, if you decide you want to increase or decrease the challenge, you can hop into the menu and change the sliders at any time.</p><h2 id="h828368"><a id="explore"></a>Exploration is more important than ever</h2><p>Exploration has always led to useful things in the <em>Doom </em>franchise, but you’re <em>really</em> going to want to seek out every nook and cranny in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. <strong>By thoroughly exploring each mission, you’ll uncover vital upgrade materials that are necessary for improving your weapons and abilities</strong>. Without these killer upgrades, you’ll be leaving a lot of damage and utility on the table, so keep a close eye on any icons on your map and hunt those materials down!</p><p>In addition to upgrade materials, you’ll also find plenty of collectibles and skins for your weapons scattered about missions. So if you’re a fan of looking stylish while you mow down Hell’s hordes, then you have even more reasons to chase down every question mark on the map. </p><h2 id="h828369"><a id="defense"></a>Sometimes, the best offense is a good defense</h2><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> differs from previous <em>Doom </em>titles in that you’ll spend a lot of time parrying with a shield, which deflects damage back at whatever demon thought it was a good idea to mess with you. While this might initially feel a bit at odds with the franchise’s fast-paced first-person shooting, you’ll soon find that parrying flows effortlessly into the rest of your kit to become one of your most useful strategies for making quick work of baddies.</p><p>If you see demons coming at you with a green attack or firing green projectiles your way, that’s your cue to deflect and then lay into them. Once you master this thrilling dance between offense and defense, you’ll finally be the Doom Slayer we always knew you could be.</p><h2 id="h828370"><a id="challenge"></a>Missing mission challenges would be a mistake</h2><p>Early in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, you’ll be introduced to mission challenges, which provide you with three optional tasks in a level. Completing these tasks earns you rewards like weapon skins or extra gold to be used toward all-important upgrades, so it’s a smart idea to always check them in your menu at the beginning of a level so that you can be sure to work on them as you explore.</p><p>Moreover, mission challenges can sometimes give you vague hints as to where you may find some well-hidden secrets. For instance, one level has a mission challenge that specifically asks you to land at two secret spots while exploring an open-ended area with your dragon. If you didn’t know those existed, you may have been left frustrated about why you could never find the final secrets in the level. Thanks for all you do, mission challenges. We love you.</p><hr><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Luckily, we’ve played the game and can let you know how long it takes to beat <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. </p><h2 id="h829633"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>?</h2><p><strong>A standard playthrough of <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> focused mostly on just beating the game is likely to take around 20 hours</strong>. There are 22 chapters this time around, and most will take around a little under an hour to finish. That’s a hell of a lot of demon slaying.</p><p>Of course, completionists can no doubt get even more out of this satisfying gorefest, as there’s an abundance of upgrades and optional collectibles to find throughout each level, including codexes, toys, and even weapon skins. <strong>Aiming to collect all of these can push the total playtime beyond 25 hours</strong>. Don’t worry, though, as you can revisit chapters any time to wrap up anything you’ve missed.</p><p>Luckily for trophy and achievement hunters, <strong>there are no multiplayer requirements this time around</strong>, which means no grinding out wins against other players to earn that sweet 100%. But that being said, the small but dedicated multiplayer fanbase from the previous two entries may be a little disappointed. Hey, maybe next time, ya’ll.</p><hr><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

PS5 owners have previously been able to use Apple Pay via the PlayStation App or the PS5 browser, but it's taken over four years to get native support for the popular payment method on the console.</p><p>Now, rather than having to take any extra steps, customers can simply select Apple Pay during the checkout process on their PS5s. They will then be greeted by a QR code they can scan using their iPhone or iPad to complete the transaction.</p><p>Apple Pay is the world's most popular digital wallet with over a 90% market share in the US alone, so it makes sense that Sony and Apple would want to work together to ensure users can take advantage of it. And with Apple Cards providing 2% cashback on purchases, it's all but certain to rapidly become a favorite payment method for the PS5's storefront.</p><p>Not every region has implemented Apple Pay, but you can check <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/store/ps-store-apple-pay-payment/#countries" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's website</a> for a full list of countries that support the feature.</p><p>Apple Pay joins PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App as alternative payment methods on PS5, with support on PS4 expected at a later date.</p>

			<p>Remedy put out a call on its <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1921933626389786975">social media channels</a> asking for players to sign up for a new closed technical test for <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/">FBC: Firebreak</a> taking place this weekend.</p>
<p>The studio is focusing on testing the crossplay functionality in FBC: Firebreak during this test, so players on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S are all <a href="https://firebreak.firstlook.gg/waitlist">encouraged to register their interest</a> in joining. The test will begin on May 15 and run until May 19.</p>
<p>Firebreak is due to release in<a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-is-out-on-june-17-reveals-remedy/"> a little over a month</a>, and this closed technical test is one of the final steps towards release as Remedy gets set to launch its first multiplayer-focused game. It's a big 'first' for the studio known for crafting exceptional single-player experiences, so it'll be interesting to see if it can land with the players who go to Remedy for those single-player games.</p>
<p>Though perhaps more important than getting Firebreak to land with Remedy's current fans is Firebreak being able to bring in new players to Remedy's titles. Fans of multiplayer games who've yet to try out a Remedy title might find Firebreak to be their avenue into Remedy's other games like Alan Wake and Control, which could be significant in the lead up to Remedy's next major single-player release, Control 2.</p>
<p>However, players who are fans of Control and can't wait for its sequel should note that they don't necessarily need to jump into Firebreak to keep up with the story. <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-info-all-post-launch-content-will-be-free/">When we spoke to Remedy</a> earlier this year about Firebreak, the studio confirmed that the core narrative will continue in Control 2, and while there will be some Easter eggs to discover, Firebreak won't include some key narrative details that players should have before jumping into Control 2, whenever it releases.</p>

That’s what makes the VMU Pro unique. Although it’s been upgraded with a 16-bit IPS TFT color screen and enough power to emulate NES, Sega Master System, and even Game Boy Color titles, it can still be inserted into an original Dreamcast controller and used to store save game data.</p><p>Other upgrades include a rechargeable battery (the original Dreamcast VMU was notorious for going through CR2032 coin cell batteries when used on its own), MP3 playback for those living without a smartphone, the ability to copy and backup save game data directly from an original VMU, Wi-Fi, and unlimited storage through microSD memory cards.</p><p>The retro emulation on a full-color screen is a fun feature, but if that’s the only reason you’re considering the VMU Pro, the <a href="https://anbernic.com/en-ca/products/rg-nano">Anbernic RG Nano</a> offers far superior emulation (including 3D consoles like the N64 and PS1) on a similarly-sized handheld. The VMU Pro will appeal more to those who still have a Sega Dreamcast in regular play rotation but are looking for a more reliable and easier way to store and swap game saves.</p><p>That’s assuming the VMU Pro isn’t going to be prohibitively expensive. In 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/21/23365268/sega-dreamcast-vmu-virtual-memory-unit-card-2022-fundraiser-indiegogo-console">Dreamware Enterprises launched its own upgraded VMU called the VM2</a> with a backlit but monochromatic and pixelated screen for $114. It was a pricey upgrade for a console that Sega no longer supports, so hopefully three years of electronics evolution will result in a cheaper price tag for the VMU Pro.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And while going back to this 20 minute show is a bit embarrassing now, it’s wild how Microsoft and Xbox really did see the future coming before the rest of the industry. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197533" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why People Are Rushing To Sell Their Xbox Series X To GameStop Right Now" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="197533,196181,196230" data-current="197533"><div><p>Why People Are Rushing To Sell Their Xbox Series X To GameStop Right Now</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23065.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But before we praise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-celebrates-20th-anniversary-with-a-museum-that-mig-1848113162&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-celebrates-20th-anniversary-with-a-museum-that-mig-1848113162">Xbox</a></span> for predicting the online future of games and get really sad at how cosmetic microtransactions were already part of the plan in 2005, let’s make fun of this weird 20 minute infomercial that is the most ‘00s thing ever created. Here’s the full special if you’ve not seen it: </p><p>“Fact: Gaming isn’t just a hobby. It is a lifestyle,” says an unnamed narrator during a short video at the front of the special. It explains video gaming started with <em>Pong</em> and Atari,  some other stuff happened, then the original Xbox launched and don’t worry about that thing called the PlayStation. </p><p>After that, the funniest moment in the entire special happens. Remember, up until this point we didn’t know the console was to be called the Xbox 360. It was just the “Next Gen Xbox.” So young Zack, who watched this MTV special back in 2005, was excited to learn more about the next Xbox. Elijah Wood yells, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/LTs0AoaMYGA?t=166&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/LTs0AoaMYGA?t=166" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The future of gaming!” and points off screen</a></span>. The camera cuts to a...woman carrying a gray bag. Can you imagine the online chuds today watching this? Their heads might explode. </p><figure id="" data-id="74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-recommend-id="image://74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-format="png" data-width="639" data-height="360" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox /hunchbiscuit / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-recommend-id="image://74bd24e62beb56dfa61ab2411665a669" data-format="png" data-width="639" data-height="360" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In reality, the woman is carrying the Xbox 360 in her shoulder bag. She saunters up to a podium and pulls out the console. Sets it up. Hits a button. Green lights turn on. And the console’s name is revealed.</p><p>The rest of special is mostly MTV nonsense, celebrities, and The Killers performing music. The only segment that is actually somewhat interesting happens about 11 minutes into the show: Sway from MTV is invited to talk to the designers behind the Xbox 360 and J Allard (one of the OG Microsoft execs behind the Xbox project.) It’s during this segment that we see a bunch of 360 prototypes and learn about why it looks the way it does. And then Allard walks Sway through the idea of buying digital content on a video game console using the internet. </p><p>Today, this is something every device can do. Back in 2005, this was the future. It was hard for young Zack to believe that one day we’d buy games digitally on a console. 20 years later, it’s clear Microsoft was on to something with Xbox Live, the marketplace, a single username that follows you from game to game, and hanging out online with friends in voice chat. Though, the moment when Allard mentions buying clothes for your digital character, I realized microtransactions were being invented in front of my eyes and got sad. </p><p>At the end of the event, Wood got on stage and signed off by saying: “I think we can all agree on one thing tonight: Xbox 360 is going to be amazing and I look forward to meeting all of you in the Xbox 360 universe.” I never met Elijah Wood online. But I do agree, the Xbox 360 was amazing and will likely be the one and only time Microsoft was at the top of the console gaming market. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-unveils-warframe-1999-update-named-techrot-encore-releasing-in-march/">Digital Extremes</a> took over the PAX East 2025 main stage to discuss a bunch of new information about Warframe and <a href="https://wccftech.com/digital-extremes-soulframe-devstream-showcases-companions-new-social-hub-more/">Soulframe</a>, including the next major update to Warframe, Isleweaver, coming in June, a new Soulframe trailer, and how Digital Extremes is overhauling the experience for brand-new players to make it easier to get into Warframe in the first place.</p>
<p>The Isleweaver update is the next narrative chapter in Warframe's story, continuing the narrative threads that were pulled in Warframe's big 1999 update. Players will return to Duviri and clash with Major Rusalka once again, with new Murmur enemies to fight in the new clan operation, Eight Claw.</p>

<p>The new Soulframe trailer showed off more gameplay from the upcoming co-op RPG, including a new boss that players will fight called the Tired King. The panel also discussed the development journey Soulframe has been on so far, and while there's still no release date in sight, the team did say that those interested in hearing more about Soulframe should tune in to Tennocon 2025 to learn more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Soulframe: Preludes - Gameplay Spotlight" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_mLydrgmH4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest news of the panel came halfway through, when principal writer Kathryn Kingsley discussed how the new player experience in Warframe has been streamlined to get brand new players to the 1999 content as soon as possible, which will prepare them for everything else beyond that.</p>

<p>"<em>One of the things we did was lay out what ever new player has to do from account creation to 1999, and just tried to streamline that as much as possible to remove as many trip hazards,</em>" Kingsely began saying.</p>
<p>"<em>Making sure that all of the content there sort of made sense and make that as friendly as possible, especially now that we have so much more content at the end of the game. And not removing any content, just making sure that it all just sort of now makes sense now that we have so much cool stuff.</em>"</p>
<p>You can see in the slides below that Vor is getting a rework, Digital Extremes is continuing to work on the Junction, a few enemies are being refreshed and you no longer have to scan a plant before picking it up, you can just pick it up.</p>
<p>Also, Digital Extremes is changing how melee slams work. To prevent players from spamming the melee slam with small hops, you'll soon need to jump much higher to have the same hit radius you can have now with a small hop.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>All of these updates are coming in the Isleweaver update in June.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This dev stream was the last major update for Warframe that players will get until TennoCon, which is taking place <a href="https://www.warframe.com/tennocon">July 18-19</a> this summer, and where we'll find out a lot more about what's to come for Soulframe and Warframe for the rest of the year and beyond.</p>

            <p>For too long have our video games been tainted by the spectacle of people moving around using their own feet and legs. For too long have our NPCs been left to rot in the grip of "simple town life", surrounded by acres of thriving grass that have never known the blessed touch of a Chevron or a Ford, let alone that duchess of the asphalt - the Banana Mobile.</p>
<p>All that changes... well, they haven't shared a release date yet, but rest assured that Car Park Capital will soon be here to transform all of your awful virtual countryside into a sea of rumbling isometric bonnets. Here is a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Car Park Capital is a satirical business <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim in the tradition of Rollercoaster Tycoon, built using a custom rendering engine. Your job is to tarmac over the world's last remaining stretches of vegetation and fill the screen with neat lines of parking places, plus the occasional zebra crossing for those pitiful pedestrians that yet remain, shaking their fists at the uncaring sky.</p>
<p>Any townsfolk who object to driving must be persuaded otherwise using propaganda. You can, for instance, put up billboards with dastardly mind-control slogans such as "you love cars", "how about a nice car, eh" and "eat smog you filthy little piggies". I may have invented one or two of those, but I did not invent the below bullet points, lifted direct from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3031880/Car_Park_Capital/">the Steam page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Real time simulation with hundreds of vehicles and citizens.</p>
<p>Per-person behavior simulation: Each person is different, except they're all bald.</p>
<p>Play into their minds with propaganda.</p>
<p>3D map editing: Be creative when designing car parks or other buildings. You can make multi-floor structures.</p>
<p>Expand as the demand increases. Get rewarded accordingly.</p>
<p>Elevators!</p>
<p>Retro styled graphics with a playful color palette.</p>
<p>Moddability: Scripts and content can be altered if you possess some Lua skills.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's not quite clear how the levels work from the trailer, but I wonder if each map starts out as a proper settlement, and your goal is to stealthily insert and obfuscate roads until the commutes become endless and the gridlock becomes self-sustaining, allowing you to remove the homes, shops and businesses like Jenga blocks, without interrupting the circle of fumes and frustration. Regardless, this is a lovely visual confection for all its baleful premise. These are the best cars I've seen in a game since, oh, let's say Rollcage.</p>
<p>Developer <a href="https://hilkojj.nl/">Hilko Janssen</a> is based in the Netherlands, and is a Ludum Dare game jam regular. I like <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/hapman-the-inevitable">this thing they made</a> about a fly trying not to get eaten by Pac Man.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/nintendo-threatens-to-brick-switch-consoles-for-hacking-piracy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Switch and Switch 2 users who try to hack their consoles or play pirated copies of games may find their devices rendered completely inoperable by Nintendo. That new warning was buried in a recent update to the Nintendo User Account Agreement, as <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-emulation-hacking-brick-warning-terms-of-service">first noticed by Game File last week</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/eula-update/">May 2025 EULA update</a> adds new language concerning the specific ways users are allowed to use "Nintendo Account Services" on the console, a term defined here to encompass the use of "video games and add-on content." Under the new EULA, any unlicensed use of the system not authorized by Nintendo could lead the company to "render the Nintendo Account Services <em>and/or the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part." </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>
<p>That language would apply to both the current Switch and the upcoming Switch 2.</p>
<p>Later in the same EULA, Nintendo adds new language clarifying that it reserves the right to "suspend your access to any or all Nintendo Account Services, in our sole discretion and without prior notice to you." That suspension can even come before a EULA violation occurs if Nintendo has "a reasonable belief such a violation... will occur, or as we otherwise determine to be reasonably necessary for legal, technical or commercial reasons, such as to prevent harm to other users or the Nintendo Account Services."</p>
<h2>Play inside the lines</h2>
<p>So what kind of Switch usage counts as a "violation" here? Unsurprisingly, playing pirated games is high on the list; the EULA now specifically calls out "obtain[ing], install[ing] or us[ing] any unauthorized copies of Nintendo Account Services." That language would likely apply to users with hacked console hardware and those who use any number of third-party flash carts to play pirated games.</p>

                <p>Nintendo is recommending that Switch 2 owners turn on a "Stop Charging Around 90%" setting to prevent the system's battery from deteriorating as fast. The company shared the news--and an in-depth video explaining where to find the new setting--in a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-today-app-announced-will-include-switch-2-news-and-more/1100-6530427/">Nintendo Today</a> post.</p><p>Recently, Nintendo has been sharing system setting-related videos on its daily news app, including one showcasing the use of mouse controls on the home screen. The latest one highlights the Stop Charging Around 90% feature of Switch 2, with Nintendo explaining that "pausing the charge at around 90% reduces deterioration to the battery." A video showcasing how to turn on the feature was also included, and has since been shared by industry insider Stealth40K on X.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1921945387880808898" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Nintendo revealed Switch 2 stops charging at about 90% remaining battery.<br>Pausing the charge at around 90% reduces deterioration to the battery.<br>If “Stop Charging Around 90%” is turned on, the charging speed will slow down around 90%. <a href="https://t.co/53Y0ORyFvd" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/53Y0ORyFvd</a></p>  — Stealth (@Stealth40k) <a href="https://twitter.com/Stealth40k/status/1921945387880808898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>If you plan on frequently playing your Switch 2 over the long term, this is definitely a feature you should be aware of. Keeping the system's battery healthy is important if you want to maximize your handheld mode play time. Currently, Nintendo says the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-long-nintendo-switch-2s-battery-life-lasts/1100-6530574/" data-ref-id="1100-6530574">Switch 2's battery life</a> lasts between two to six-and-and-a-half hours, depending on what games are being played. Nintendo also said the system will take three hours to charge, although that may be a bit shorter if this specific new setting is turned on.</p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, and those looking to secure a console should keep an eye on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">GameSpot's preorder guide</a>.</p>
