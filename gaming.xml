<p>According to Insider Gaming, a new job listing from Sledgehammer Games - seeking a "Senior Technical Artist" - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4347622051/">has surfaced on LinkedIn</a>, and in the 'Bonus XP' section of the application, the team notes how it would appreciate someone with "AAA mobile or Switch experience".</p><div><figure data-videoid="SLvDnhHkJZk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSLvDnhHkJZk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3938bdomwrnv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Although Sledgehammer only provided support on the latest Call of Duty title, it has previously taken the reins for major titles such as <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_3"><strong>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This small discovery follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/yes-call-of-duty-is-still-on-the-way-to-nintendo-hardware">an update earlier this year in June 2025</a>, with a report at the time suggesting Microsoft and Nintendo still had plans to announce <em>something</em> related to this series in the future.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Nintendo originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/12/microsoft-enters-10-year-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo">entered a 10-year commitment</a> to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms in 2022, with the deal becoming legally binding in 2023. This was followed by Microsoft being given the all-clear on the Activision Blizzard acquisition in the same year.</p>
<p>According to a previous story, Sledgehammer Games is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-office/">rumoured to be releasing its next Call of Duty</a> title in 2027.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-technical-rundown-detailed-by-ubisoft</link>
            <guid>1367008</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="1c4b88860f604"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c4b88860f604/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is out for the Switch 2 next week, and ahead of launch, Ubisoft has published a "deep dive" about the technical aspects of this port. Here's the rundown:</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h3 id="frame-rate">Frame Rate</h3>
<p>Firstly, in both docked and handheld modes, the frame rate will target 30 fps. The resolution was not included here.</p>
<h3 id="adapting-to-switch-2">Adapting to Switch 2</h3>
<p>As for adapting the title to this system, the team says it has done <em>a lot</em> of "code-level work" to optimise and adapt the game architecture. This includes "modifying game assets to streamline certain technical aspects of the quality" without compromising the overall player experience.</p>
<p>"Behind the scenes, we've worked a lot to make the world run smoothly and remain visually stunning and dynamic... For example, we're using the same cloud and cloth simulation systems, but we've optimized certain elements for the ARM processor and downscaled simulation data where needed to reduce GPU load, all while preserving visual fidelity."</p>
<p>Although the Switch 2 supports Ray-Traced Global Illumination, the team opted to use its solid baked Global Illumination system (which it also uses for "low-spec PC setups and Xbox Series S versions" of games), citing "RAM memory reasons" as the main decision behind this. It apparently allows the developers to preserve the overall experience as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="optimisation">Optimisation</h3>
<p>In terms of optimisation – Level of Detail (LOD), draw distances, texture resolution and element loading were all "carefully adjusted to maintain performance without compromising the world's depth" - with the environmental richness of the world still "largely intact". However, NPC counts have been reduced in highly populated areas to maintain "smooth gameplay".</p>
<h3 id="dlss">DLSS</h3>
<p>DLSS has also been utilised, resulting in a "sharper image, with more accurate colors, improved textures, and fewer visual anomalies". Performance is described as being "smoother, offering higher FPS through upscaling, better fluidity, and reduced latency".</p>
<h3 id="handheld-and-docked-experience">Handheld and Docked experience</h3>
<p>The same post goes into more detail about each mode on Switch 2 – explaining how handheld mode is GPU-limited, with adjustments to image quality, draw distance and LOD settings to prioritise performance. And in docked, players can expect HDR support. VRR is also leveraged in handheld, offering "smoother gameplay".</p>
<p>One feat, in particular, is how "the lower framerate limit for VRR is typically 40 fps, but Assassin's Creed Shadows runs at 30 fps on Switch 2" and the team "didn't want to compromise on that aspect" so it built a "dedicated algorithm that keeps VRR enabled even at 30 fps" to ensure the experience remains as "fluid and responsive as possible".</p>
<h3 id="switch-2-specific-features">Switch 2-specific features</h3>
<p>Last but not least are some Switch 2-specific features including touch screen navigation for menus and maps. Nintendo players can also expect this version to include "all post-launch content" excluding the "Claws of Awaji expansion" due out in 2026. Cross-progression is supported as well via Ubisoft Connect, so you can continue your adventure across platforms.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Control Resonant Trademark Discovered Ahead of The Game Awards]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/control-resonant-trademark-remedy-the-game-awards-2025/</link>
            <guid>1366993</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A possible trademark registration from Remedy may hint at a new Control project. Furthermore, its timing is coincidentally near <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>, set to go live on December 11th.</p>



<p>The Control series is a fairly new series, starting in 2019. The first sci-fi mind-bending title follows new Director, Jesse Faden, as she travels the mysterious Oldest House. When it released, Remedy Entertainment and the game were praised immensely, receiving multiple year-end awards and nominations. While not a direct sequel, the multiplayer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-still-underperforming-remedy-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC: Firebreak </a>does take place in the Oldest House and ties into Control. The series is connected to the wider world of Remedy, including Alan Wake and it’s sequel’s DLC. However, a new trademark may hint at an even bigger expansion to the universe, if done by Remedy.</p>







<h2 id="h-a-new-control-project-may-be-in-the-works-at-remedy-trademark-hints">A New Control Project May Be In The Works at Remedy, Trademark Hints</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A trademark for CONTROL Resonant was filed by Remedy today ahead of The Game Awards on the EUIPO site.</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the European Union Intellectual Property Office website, the title <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019282647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“CONTROL Resonant”</a> has been filed for trademark. In addition, it’s been done by Nordia Attorneys at Law LTD. Interestingly enough, Remedy Entertainment uses those lawyers, making it seem like this is, indeed, a new Control title.</p>



<p>However, it’s important to note that Remedy has not announced a new title or project for Control, so take it with a grain of salt for the time being. As to what it could be, there are a few different ways. The most obvious is a sequel to the 2019 original, possibly continuing Jesse Faden’s narrative. However, Remedy has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-partner-annapurna-control-alan-wake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s been exploring film and TV</a>, so maybe Control: Resonant is a TV series.</p>



<p>Of course, the timing is rather convenient, as The Game Awards 2025 are just around the corner on December 11th. Remedy is no stranger to the Geoff Keighley-hosted show, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2023-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a> and Control had huge presences there, both as nominees/winners and reveals. Sam Lake, the face of the studio, is a frequent presenter at the awards and it wouldn’t be surprising if the company decides to reveal Control Resonant, if true. Either way, it’s more Control and fans are sure to enjoy that.</p>

<p>Nintendo continues to promote its latest game releases with new events in its mobile runner <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, and next up is a collaboration with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>.</p>
<p>This event is already underway and like previous events, you'll be able to unlock themed statues. For this particular one, this includes statues for Bee Mario, Rosalina and Balloon Yoshi. During this event, one course will be open a day for free.</p>
<p>Here's a look at each of these statues, with the event scheduled to run from now until <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="2992fd063fde2"><a title="Super Mario Run" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2992fd063fde2/super-mario-run.large.png"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows previous Super Mario Run events for games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brother Ship</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Wonder</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo released Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 on the Switch last month. If you haven't already played it, we can confirm it's still out of this world, even if the entire package comes at a high price:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There’s no question about it: Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2 are two of the most sublime games ever created. With gameplay that subverts expectations and scenarios that wouldn’t be possible if not for the creative freedom of the cosmos, they represent the Mario series at its absolute best. They look better than ever, boast small yet welcome additions, and expand upon the narrative with new storybook pages...These games command a high price on Switch, to be sure, but you’ll be playing them for the rest of your life."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

              <p>Apple maintains its tradition of avoiding Black Friday deals on their own retail website while quietly liquidating inventory through Amazon with more generous discounts than previous years.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/"> At $449, down from $599, this 11-inc 128GB/WiFi iPad Air (M3 chip) joins Apple discounting</a> spanning MacBooks, AirPods, Apple Watches, and iPads. The only product category notably absent from Amazon’s Black Friday Apple selection remains the iPhone 17 series, which still hasn’t launched on Amazon’s platform despite being available through carriers and Apple directly. This 25% discount on the<strong> iPad Air represents a record-low price</strong> for Apple’s mainstream tablet that balances capability with accessibility.</p>

<p>The basic iPad costs about $329 and comes with an A14 chip from the previous generation and a standard Retina display, and it’s for people who want a cheap device for browsing and basic productivity. The <strong>M3 chip in the iPad Air gives it a lot more processing power</strong> because it has desktop-class architecture that can handle demanding games and creative applications that would be too much for the basic model. The <strong>Liquid Retina display with P3 wide color and True Tone is better</strong> than the basic iPad’s display because it has more colors, better viewing angles, and adaptive white balance.</p>



<p>The iPad Pro positioned above the Air commands $800+ through M4 chip, mini-LED ProMotion displays reaching 120Hz and Face ID replacing Touch ID. Professional photographers, video editors, and digital artists justify Pro pricing through workflow advantages including ProRes video recording, LiDAR scanning, and reference-quality displays. <strong>But most users find the Air’s M3 chip provides more than adequate performance</strong> for typical tablet workflows and the $350+ savings compared to iPad Pro base models enables purchasing Magic Keyboard or Apple Pencil accessories for instance.</p>
<p>The M3 chip made for Apple Intelligence has an <strong>8-core CPU and a 10-core GPU architecture</strong> that makes it almost as powerful as a desktop computer. When you edit videos in iMovie or LumaFusion, the effects happen in real time and the timeline scrubbing is smooth.</p>



<p>The <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display has a resolution of 2360 x 1640 at 264 PPI</strong> which makes individual pixels impossible to see. The P3 wide color gamut shows more colors than the standard sRGB display, and it makes colors that look washed out on other displays stand out more in photos and videos. The ultralow reflectivity coating keeps the screen visible outside where glossy screens wash out completely. The True Tone technology <strong>changes the white balance based on the lighting around you</strong> to make it easier on your eyes when you use it for a long time.</p>
<p>Stage Manager is one of the features of iPadOS that makes real work possible: It <strong>lets you create resizable and overlapping app windows</strong> like those on desktop operating systems instead of forcing you to switch between apps in full screen. Support for external displays makes the workspace bigger by adding monitors, and Scribble turns handwriting into text wherever you can type.</p>
<p>At $449, the iPad Air 11-inch is the best value for money iPad you can get during Black Friday. If you need tablet computing with good performance, this record-low price makes Apple’s mainstream iPad accessible without compromise.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-gave-up-on-fire-10-inch-hd-tablet-own-hardware-burned-with-zero-margin-2000648193</link>
            <guid>1366969</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <strong>Fire HD 10</strong> packs a 10.1-inch Full HD display, octa-core processor with 3GB RAM and 13-hour battery life into a package that <strong>costs seven times less than entry-level iPads</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/">At $69, down from $139, this tablet has become the #1 bestseller across Amazon’s entire computers and tablets category</a> while hitting a record-low price that makes it cheaper than many restaurant dinners. Amazon removes profit margins on own-brand hardware during Black Friday to drive Alexa and Fire OS adoption. The <strong>50% discount transforms tablets</strong> from considered purchases into impulse buys that justify owning multiple units for different family members.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD Display That Works</h2>
<p>The <strong>10.1-inch screen has a resolution of 1920 x 1080</strong> which means that Netflix, Disney+, and YouTube look clear instead of blurry. Text stays clear while you read instead of making your eyes hurt by being fuzzy. Rich colors make photos, videos, and games come to life with levels of saturation that are as good as those of tablets that cost a lot more.</p>



<p>With an octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM, <strong>this Fire HD 10 is 25% faster than previous generations</strong>. It can handle web browsing with multiple tabs, video streaming, and casual gaming without any lag. Kids use educational apps, parents watch cooking videos, and students read textbooks, and the tablet’s performance is always responsive, so it never feels like a limitation.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery lasts for 13 hours which is enough for a few hours of streaming</strong> and browsing each day. This means you can go on weekend trips, long flights, or full days without worrying about running out of battery. The 32GB of base storage is enough for basic apps, downloaded videos, ebook librarie, and photos, so you don’t have to add more right away. The <strong>microSD slot can hold up to 1TB of extra storage</strong> for growing content libraries.</p>
<p>Parents can also set up <em>Amazon Kids</em> parental controls to make tablets safe for kids by filtering content, setting time limits, and choosing educational content. With easy-to-use controls, parents can limit access to apps and videos that are appropriate for their child’s age and stop them from making purchases or seeing inappropriate content.</p>
<p>At $69, this is the lowest price Amazon has ever offered on its own brand on Black Friday. The combination of real Full HD quality, real performance improvements, and incredible durability at half the already-low retail price makes it a better deal than any other iPad competitor. The fact that this is the #1 best-selling item on all computers and tablets shows that buyers know a great deal when they see one.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-stuck-with-too-many-airpods-pro-3-now-selling-newest-earbuds-at-all-time-low-to-clear-stock-2000648166</link>
            <guid>1366960</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This year marks a turning point in Apple’s historically rigid pricing strategy where discounts remained rare and controlled. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">At $219, down from $249, the AirPods Pro 3 that launched just months ago join Apple’s unprecedented Black Friday selloff</a> happening exclusively on Amazon rather than through official channels.</p>
<p>The entire AirPods lineup received aggressive discounting including the <strong>AirPods Max at $399</strong>, <strong>AirPods 4 with ANC at $99</strong>, <strong>standard AirPods 4 at $69</strong>, and these flagship Pro 3 models. Apple appears determined to clear inventory quickly but discreetly through Amazon’s platform rather than diluting brand perception on their own website where premium pricing remains intact.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Live Translation That Lets You Talk to Anyone</h2>
<p>With<strong> the real-time translation feature</strong>, you can talk to people who don’t speak English face-to-face. The earbuds translate speech right away and show the text on your paired iPhone: Ordering food, asking for directions or doing business in a foreign language is less scary when AI can help with these things. The feature works for <strong>phone calls as well and translates both sides of conversations in real time</strong> for international calls with coworkers, family or business contacts who don’t speak your language.</p>



<p>The <strong>heart rate sensor turns AirPods from simple audio devices into health monitoring tools</strong> that can keep track of heart health metrics during workouts without the need for chest straps or wrist-worn devices. The optical sensors measure blood flow through the ear canals and send heart rate data to Apple Health so you can keep track of your fitness in real time.<strong> Runners can see their heart rate zones</strong> in real time while they train without having to wear an Apple Watch.</p>
<p>The <strong>hearing aid feature is a huge step forward</strong> in accessibility because FDA-approved hearing aids can now work through regular earbuds instead of expensive medical devices. The feature runs built-in tests to figure out your hearing profile, then boosts certain frequencies where you have hearing loss while keeping the sound quality natural. People with mild to moderate hearing loss can get help with everyday tasks without the stigma or cost of traditional hearing aids, which can cost thousands of dollars.</p>



<p><strong>Active noise cancellation works better</strong> now because the processing has been improved to sample background noise and make anti-phase sound waves that are more accurate. The noise of airplanes, people talking in the office and traffic all fade away into silence and let you fully concentrate on music, podcasts or work without any outside noise. The <strong>adaptive transparency mode</strong> lets in background noise when you need it for conversations or to be aware of your surroundings – and it changes automatically based on how loud the noise is around you.</p>
<p>With dynamic head tracking, <strong>Spatial Audio makes three-dimensional soundstages</strong> where sounds seem to come from certain places in space around you. Directional audio cues that put dialogue in the center of the screen and sound effects that pan left and right make movies and shows more immersive than flat stereo can. More and more music producers are using spatial audio which means that artists mix tracks specifically for this format to make immersive experiences where instruments are in different places.</p>
<p>If you want Apple’s most advanced earbuds, this record-low price represents the best value available.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-zero-profit-on-airpods-max-price-so-low-it-makes-you-forget-bose-and-sony-exist-2000648175</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon officially launched Black Friday last Thursday, November 20th, when the AirPods Max dropped from $549 to $479, surprising everyone since Apple rarely discounts premium products. This <strong>Thanksgiving Thursday brought an even more aggressive markdown</strong> as Amazon pushed these flagship noise-cancelling <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/">headphones down to $399, down from $549, representing nearly 30% immediate savings</a>.</p>
<p>At $399, these over-ear headphones have hit <strong>an unprecedented record-low price</strong> that shatters all previous discounting patterns for Apple’s premium audio hardware.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Noise cancellation at the pro level</h2>
<p>The <strong>active noise cancellation can get rid of up to twice as much background noise as previous Apple models</strong>: This is because eight microphones work with the H1 chip to sample ambient sound and create precise anti-phase waves. The computer audio processing happens all the time, every microsecond and it changes to fit the noise level as you move from one place to another or as the sounds around you change.</p>



<p>The<strong> transparency mode lets ambient sound through with little processing latency</strong> which makes people more aware of their surroundings: This lets people talk without taking off their headphones or missing important environmental cues. The mode uses the same microphone array and computational audio pipeline as ANC to process outside sound which keeps the sound quality instead of just lowering the cancellation.</p>
<p>The iPhone’s <em>TrueDepth</em> camera scans your ears to figure out their shape, and then<strong> personalized spatial audio adjusts the sound delivery to fit your body</strong> so that you can hear it in the <strong>best three-dimensional way</strong>. Directional audio cues are great for movies and TV shows because they keep dialogue in the middle of the screen while sound effects move left and right, and this makes the experience much more immersive than flat stereo. <strong>Dynamic head tracking keeps the audio in the same place</strong> as your connected device so when you turn your head, the soundstage doesn’t change.</p>



<p>The acoustic-first design philosophy puts sound quality first by <strong>using custom 40mm dynamic drivers that give you high-fidelity audio</strong> across the entire frequency range. Deep bass reproduction goes all the way down to sub-bass frequencies without distortion. Midrange clarity makes sure that vocals and instruments sound natural instead of colored. Treble detail shows subtle differences in recordings that headphones that are compressed or poorly tuned hide.</p>
<p>The <strong>computational audio uses the H1 chip’s processing power</strong> and advanced algorithms that change the sound in real time based on how well it fits, how loud it is, and what type of content it is. The system keeps the sound balanced at any volume by changing the frequency response as you change the volume. It also makes up for changes in the seal as the cushions compress or move, and it processes music, movies, and podcasts differently based on their content.</p>
<p>When you<strong> integrate your ecosystem with your iPhone, iPad, and Mac</strong>, you get seamless experiences because your devices switch automatically and follow your attention without having to pair them manually. Start music on your iPhone while you’re on the bus, switch to your Mac for work without changing any settings, and then switch to your iPad for streaming in the evening: Your headphones will automatically connect to the devices that are currently in use.</p>
<p>If you want Apple’s best audio quality with unmatched noise cancellation, this record-low deal makes premium over-ear headphones accessible without the usual premium pricing.</p>

Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We’ve seen Sony’s DualSense Edge discounted on a few occasions this year, and now it’s back on sale ahead of Black Friday as part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/824326/playstation-5-ps5-pro-black-friday-deal-sale-2025">Sony’s ongoing holiday promo</a>. Right now, you can snag the pro-style gamepad in either black or white at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSYFB99D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PS5-DualSense-Edge-Wireless-Controller%2F1707140316" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsony-interactive-entertainment-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-for-ps5-pc-mac-mobile-white%2FJXHQ3CJ4RR%2Fsku%2F6532912" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for around $169 ($30 off), which is just $10 shy of its previous low. The black version of the DualSense Edge is seldom discounted by this much, so now’s a good time to pick one up if you prefer the stealthier look.</p><p>If you spend a lot of time gaming on the PlayStation 5, the DualSense Edge elevates the experience by offering more customization than Sony’s standard DualSense controller. For starters, its deep software integration with the PS5 lets you create up to four profiles, each with customization options for button mapping, stick sensitivity, and assigning commands to the rear buttons. You can create separate profiles for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/784888/ghost-of-yotei-review-ps5"><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></a> and <em>Arc Raiders</em>, for instance, and swap between them on the fly without having to leave your game.</p><p>In addition to custom profiles, the DualSense Edge lets you adjust the feel of the triggers (L2 and R2), so you can tailor them to specific play styles and games. You can set the triggers to be more sensitive for online shooters like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, or less sensitive for racing games to achieve smoother acceleration and braking. Moreover, the Edge makes it easy to swap out stick modules in case one stops working.</p><p>As much as we enjoy how much you can customize the DualSense Edge, though, it’s not without its faults. In his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">review</a>, <em>The Verge</em>’s Cameron Faulkner found that the controller averaged only about eight hours of battery life on a full charge, which is worse than the standard DualSense controller. It does, however, come with a long charging cable that can lock into the controller, preventing it from accidentally being yanked out.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/822252/sony-dualsense-edge-controller-black-friday-deal-sale-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-forgot-how-math-works-15-6-512gb-laptop-drops-72-from-2k-to-almost-nothing-2000648161</link>
            <guid>1366927</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>HP keeps premium positioning in the Windows laptop segment where finding capable machines under $1,000 proves challenging, particularly on their official website where aggressive discounting rarely appears. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6024/">at $569, down from a typical $1,999, this 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop</a> featuring <strong>Intel’s 13th Gen i3-1315U processor, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and Windows 11 Pro</strong> has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6024/">crashed 72% below typical pricing</a> during Black Friday on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6024/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Can Handle Real Workloads</h2>
<p>The<strong> Intel Core i3-1315U processor has 6 cores</strong> that are split between performance and efficiency designs, and this hybrid architecture speeds up demanding tasks while keeping battery life. The performance cores take care of heavy tasks like video conferencing, photo editing, and data analysis while the efficiency cores take care of light tasks and background tasks without wasting power.</p>



<p>The <strong>15.6-inch HD touchscreen makes it easy to use Windows by letting you pinch, zoom, swipe, and tap</strong> to navigate – and it changes how you use the keyboard and trackpad. The touchscreen makes<strong> Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface elements</strong> even better: These elements are made for finger use, not mouse precision. The <strong>display has an 85% screen-to-body ratio</strong> which means that the bezels are very thin and the viewable area is as large as possible.</p>
<p>The 16GB DDR4 RAM gets rid of memory bottlenecks that annoy people who use memory-heavy programs like virtual meetings, big spreadsheets, or a lot of professional software at once. This amount of memory<strong> lets you run Windows 11 Pro and a lot of productivity apps at the same time</strong>, do a lot of research in your browser, and keep your communication tools running without slowing down the system.</p>
<p>The 512GB SSD has enough space for the operating system, professional software suites, project files and media libraries, so you don’t have to rely on external drives all the time. The <strong>solid-state storage boots up in less than 15 seconds</strong> and opens applications in less than 10 seconds because NVMe speeds are faster than those of regular SATA drives. High-speed storage subsystems speed up the transfer of large files, the saving of video projects, and the operation of databases.</p>



<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro has business</strong> features that Windows Home editions don’t have like BitLocker encryption, Remote Desktop and Active Directory support. The built-in Copilot AI assistant helps you come up with ideas, organize your tasks, write documents and answer questions in a way that feels natural. For tasks that need privacy, <strong>the AI runs on your computer</strong>.</p>
<p>HP’s premium brand quality combined with Amazon’s zero-margin Black Friday strategy creates exceptional value that rarely materializes on current-generation hardware. If you need capable daily computing without premium pricing, this record-low deal makes professional Windows laptops accessible.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/philips-skipped-profit-on-hue-smart-bulbs-3-pack-color-lights-now-cost-what-basic-bulbs-do-2000648180</link>
            <guid>1366921</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Philips Hue represents the premium brand in smart lighting where default pricing remains consistently high enough that shoppers wait specifically for Prime Day or Black Friday to make purchases.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5759/">At $69, down from $109 (36% off), this 3-pack of white and color smart bulbs</a> costs barely more than a <strong>single bulb at regular pricing which runs at $54</strong> <strong>individually</strong>. This record-low pricing transforms smart lighting from luxury upgrade into practical home improvement that justifies outfitting entire rooms or homes rather than installing single bulbs as experiments.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>16 million colors that change the look of a room</h2>
<p>The white and color ambiance range lets you control the whole spectrum with <strong>millions of color combinations and white temperatures</strong> that can be changed from <strong>warm 2700K to cool 6500K</strong>. This flexibility lets you match the lighting to your activities, moods and times of day instead of being stuck with fixed color temperatures that make you compromise.</p>



<p>The<strong> 24-hour natural light scene changes its color temperature and brightness</strong> automatically during the day to match the patterns of sunlight. This keeps your circadian rhythm in sync which helps you sleep better and stay alert during the day. In the morning, the light slowly gets brighter, like the sun rising, instead of waking you up with a loud alarm. In the evening, the light slowly gets warmer and dimmer and signals that it’s time to go to bed.</p>
<p>With Hue Bridge integration, you can use advanced <strong>features like automation based on schedules or sensor triggers</strong>, remote control from anywhere with an internet connection, and rock-solid Zigbee connectivity that doesn’t slow down WiFi networks. The secure, dedicated wireless protocol stops the connection drops and delays that WiFi-based bulbs have when they are on busy home networks. <strong>Matter protocol support lets Philips products </strong>work with a wider range of smart home systems, making them compatible with other platforms and protecting investments from being locked into a single ecosystem.</p>



<p><strong>Voice control with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri</strong> lets you use natural language commands to control things without having to touch anything. This is easier than navigating apps. This voice integration is especially useful when your hands are full cooking, carrying things or getting ready for bed and you don’t want to have to grab your phone.</p>
<p>Dynamic light effects <strong>make subtle animations like slow color changes, breathing pulses, or candlelight flickers</strong> that make the lighting more interesting than just being static. These effects turn regular rooms into lively spaces where lighting is more than just a tool. When combined with Hue Sync software, immersive effects that sync with on-screen action make gaming setups better.</p>
<p>These<strong> bulbs can be used as main light sources because they are bright enough (800 lumens) for general room lighting</strong>, not just accent lighting. The LED technology <strong>uses only 9 watts of power</strong> while giving off the same amount of light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb. This saves a lot of money on electricity over the 25,000-hour life of the bulb.</p>
<p>This three-for-one price makes it possible to buy premium smart lighting for whole rooms instead of just one bulb.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Quietly Dumps Thousands of iRobot Vacuums, Roomba 105 Now Going for All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-quietly-dumps-thousands-of-irobot-vacuums-roomba-105-now-going-for-all-time-low-2000648154</link>
            <guid>1366909</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robot vacuums span a massive price spectrum where premium models costing $1,000 to $2,000 deliver great performance across all metrics while budget options fluctuate wildly in quality and reliability. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6023/">At $249, down from $449, the iRobot<em> Roomba 105</em> (with auto-empty dock) represents the sweet spot where proven brand reliability meets accessible pricing during Black Friday</a> on Amazon.</p>
<p>iRobot dominates the category through decades of refinement that established <strong>Roomba as the generic term for robot vacuums</strong>, similar to how Kleenex represents tissue. This r<strong>ecord-low deal includes the game-changing auto-empty dock</strong> that transforms occasional convenience into genuine hands-off cleaning.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6023/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>75-Day Self-Emptying That Changes Everything</h2>
<p>The auto-empty dock empties the robot’s dustbin automatically after each cleaning session, and it compresses the dirt into a <strong>big bag that needs to be changed about every 75 days in normal household conditions</strong>. This longer maintenance schedule turns robot vacuums from things that need to be cleaned every week into real <em>“set-and-forget”</em> cleaning tools that can run on their own for months.</p>



<p>The<strong> 70x power-lifting suction of the new Roomba 600 series creates real cleaning power</strong> that pulls embedded pet hair out of carpet fibers, lifts dirt that has been ground into tile grout lines and picks up fine dust particles from hardwood floors. This suction power is on par with that of upright vacuums and it comes from small robotic shapes. This means that robot vacuums can do the same job as traditional vacuums without needing to be used with them.</p>
<p>The <strong>three-stage cleaning system</strong> has a strong suction and a brush that works on both carpet and hard floors. It also has an edge-sweeping brush that pulls dirt out of corners and baseboards that the main brushes can’t reach.</p>
<p><em>ClearView</em><strong> LiDAR navigation maps your home</strong> by measuring distances with lasers, and this makes accurate floor plans that let you clean each room in a planned way instead of randomly bumping into things. The LiDAR sensor accurately measures how far away walls and other obstacles are, and this makes cleaning paths that cover the whole floor plan without missing any spots or having to clean the same areas over and over.</p>



<p>You can<strong> program certain rooms to be cleaned based on your daily schedule</strong> so you can focus on cleaning the areas where you actually live instead of spreading the battery evenly across the whole house: Plan to clean the kitchen after dinner, the bedroom before bed or the living room before guests arrive. You can change the cleaning passes and suction levels to fit the area: For example, you can use the most power on carpets that get a lot of traffic and save battery on areas that don’t get used as much</p>
<p>The <strong>iRobot Home app gives you full control over your robot</strong> and allows you to set up custom cleaning schedules, get time estimates for different tasks, keep an eye on the filter’s life, and set up virtual keep-out zones that stop the robot from going into certain areas. Without physical barriers getting in the way, you can make invisible walls around pet food bowls, fragile floor vases, or rooms that are being remodeled.</p>
<p>At $249, the iRobot Roomba 105 is at 45% below retail this Black Friday. If you want great hands-off floor cleaning with proven brand quality, this record-low price makes premium robotic cleaning accessible without the usual four-figure investment.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung 65″ OLED S90F TV Hits All-Time Low, 2025 Model Now Cheaper Than Last Year’s Version]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-65-oled-s90f-tv-hits-all-time-low-2025-model-now-cheaper-than-last-years-version-2000648184</link>
            <guid>1366882</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung committed fully to Black Friday by discounting every product category and Amazon delivering the most aggressive pricing across smartphones, tablets, earbuds, and TVs. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6025/">At $1,397, down from $1,997 ($600 off)</a>, the <strong>65-inch OLED S90F featuring the NQ4 AI Gen3 processor, 4K AI upscaling, OLED HDR+, and 144Hz Motion Xcelerator</strong> is the pinnacle of Samsung’s display technology at a record-low price.</p>
<p>This deal applies across all size variants, though the <strong>65-inch model dominates sales</strong> through optimal balance between screen real estate and living room proportions. The 30% discount makes OLED technology accessible at pricing that approached mid-tier LED TVs just years ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6025/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Neural Network Processing That Changes Content</h2>
<p>The <strong>NQ4 AI Gen3 processor uses 128 dedicated neural networks</strong> that have been trained on millions of images to look at content frame by frame and make smart improvements that make the picture quality much better. The AI can tell the difference between sports, movies, news, and games and then it processes each type of content in the best way for that type: Sports broadcasts get motion smoothing that cuts down on blur when the camera pans quickly; Movies keep the cinematic frame cadence without the soap opera effect that aggressive processing makes.</p>



<p>The <strong>4K AI upscaling uses the same neural network architecture</strong> to look at lower-resolution content and intelligently fill in missing details to make it look like it was shot in 4K. Cable broadcasts, streaming services that deliver 1080p and older content libraries all get sharper and clearer when you play them back because of edge enhancement, texture synthesis, and noise reduction. The upscaling is especially useful because the content mixes true 4K productions with upscaled or natively lower-resolution material, which keeps the visual quality the same no matter where it comes from.</p>
<p>OLED technology uses self-emissive pixels that <strong>turn completely off when showing black</strong> instead of backlights that leak through, and this gives you perfect blacks and infinite contrast. This basic benefit makes picture quality that LCD panels with local dimming can’t match: It shows shadow detail in dark scenes while keeping bright highlights without blooming or haloing. With HDR content, stars shine against really black space backgrounds, and horror movies show intentional shadow detail instead of washing everything gray.</p>



<p>Motion <em>Xcelerator</em> 144Hz makes motion look smooth by using high refresh rates and smart frame interpolation to cut down on judder and blur during fast action. VRR support <strong>up to 4K 144Hz is good for gaming</strong> because it stops screen tearing and keeps input lag low, which is important for competitive play. When cameras move quickly, sports broadcasts become clearer.</p>
<p>Samsung <em>Vision AI</em> uses scene-by-scene analysis to adjust brightness, contrast and color saturation based on the content and the lighting in the room. The system makes the screen brighter when you watch it during the day in bright rooms and less bright when you watch it at night to keep your eyes from getting tired. Dark scenes get targeted brightening that shows shadow detail without making the whole picture look washed out.</p>
<p>The full range of connections, such as HDMI 2.1 ports, USB inputs, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, works with modern gaming consoles, streaming devices, sound systems, and wireless accessories without the need for adapter dongles or connection issues.</p>
<p>If you want the best picture quality Samsung produces, this record-low price makes flagship OLED TVs attainable without waiting years for depreciation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Another Black Friday, a whole new batch of deals for those patient players who were willing to wait for a good deal, and for Final Fantasy fans, or anyone wanting to see what all the fuss is about, that deal seems to be here. On Amazon, you can grab the entire Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy (so far) for just $50.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy Remake Intergrade is the complete version of the beginning of this trilogy, including the base game and the Intergrade DLC expansion that Square Enix released for it post-launch. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-PlayStation-5/dp/B08XNRM6QN?ref=dlx_black_dg_dcl_B08XNRM6QN_dt_sl5_1b&amp;pf_rd_r=QCW56TG1GYQ3BMXVYHQ3&amp;pf_rd_p=c9437b84-952c-4286-a349-4962d23bba1b&amp;th=1" rel="sponsored noopener">You can grab it on PS5 right now on Amazon for only $20</a>.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the second installment in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Rebirth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CGXZQ4CD?ref=dlx_black_dg_dcl_B0CGXZQ4CD_dt_sl5_1b&amp;pf_rd_r=QCW56TG1GYQ3BMXVYHQ3&amp;pf_rd_p=c9437b84-952c-4286-a349-4962d23bba1b&amp;th=1" rel="sponsored noopener">you can also grab it for PS5 on Amazon right now for only $30</a>. Some quick maths will tell you that for just $50, you can get the entire Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, save for the third and final game in the trilogy, which Square Enix is still working on.</p>



<p>Development of which, according to Square Enix, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/">is coming along quite well</a>. It might still be a while until we find out more about the game, but it's good to hear positive updates from Square Enix on the game's progress.</p>

			<p>Today is Thanksgiving for the United States, which is really only significant for Americans. For the rest of the world, though, it means that tomorrow is Black Friday, and along with that come scores of deals available globally that players outside of the US care about as well, like the fact that you can now grab one of the hottest shooters of 2025, Battlefield 6, for just $35.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-black-friday-deal-2025" rel="sponsored noopener">IGN</a>, this is arguably one of the best Black Friday deals available for recent 2025 releases, especially when you consider that Battlefield 6 only launched on October 10, and a little more than a month later, it is available for half off. It was available at Amazon, but it very quickly sold out. You can still grab it at GameStop, however.</p>



<p>Here's both links to grab it for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/playstation-5/products/battlefield-6---playstation-5/428792.html" rel="sponsored noopener">Battlefield 6 PS5 - GameStop</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/xbox-series-x%7Cs/products/battlefield-6---xbox-series-x/428791.html" rel="sponsored noopener">Battlefield 6 Xbox Series X/S - GameStop</a></li>
</ul>



<p>This is one deal you'll want to try and grab as quickly as possible, because it'll likely sell out or be removed before the weekend is up. It's an especially good deal if you've already been playing Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-battlefield-6-free-multiplayer-trial-week/">through the free trial currently ongoing this week</a>, because now you'll be able to continue the progress you've made.</p>

			<p>Around a month ago, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Assassin's Creed Shadows, the latest mainline entry in the publisher's biggest open world franchise, would release on Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2. The game's engine, the latest version of Anvil, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-report-a-ray-traced-leap-forward-for-ubisoft-anvil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured many big improvements</a>, ushering the franchise into the next generation with technologies like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Extensive ray tracing effects (global illumination and reflections)</li>



<li>Dynamic wind and rain driven by fluid simulation that affect trees, foliage, leaves, and even rainfall direction</li>



<li>Physics‑based, procedural cloud and weather simulation that continually evolves cloudscapes</li>



<li>Nanite‑style micropolygon system that virtualizes geometry, letting the engine render extremely detailed terrain and assets while smoothly adjusting triangle density with distance</li>



<li>Expanded destruction physics and improved cloth and material interaction</li>



<li>Overhauled terrain and asset streaming built around the aforementioned virtualized geometry system, keeping dense villages and varied topography loaded without hammering CPU or storage bandwidth</li>



<li>Deeper integration of GPU instancing and mesh shaders to cut CPU submission overhead and render many small objects efficiently</li>
</ul>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 platform, however, is far less powerful than the platforms on which the game was first released on (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X). According to Ubisoft's Project Lead Programmer Bruno, the developers had to fundamentally redesign how the world is rendered and even how the game systems of Assassin's Creed Shadows interact with each other.</p>



<p>Core simulation systems like clouds and cloth are preserved but heavily optimized and sometimes downscaled to lower GPU load, while global illumination uses the baked solution already employed on low-spec PC and Xbox Series S to save RAM rather than relying <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the console's hardware ray tracing support</a> to deliver ray traced GI.</p>



<p>Beyond that, Ubisoft had to extensively tune down every parameter (LOD, draw distances, texture resolution, and object streaming) per scenario, reducing NPC counts only where necessary in dense hubs to uphold performance.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The developers leveraged the Nintendo Switch 2's support of NVIDIA DLSS to reconstruct a sharp image from a lower resolution base, thus accelerating performance. Ultimately, however, Ubisoft settled on achieving a stable 30 frames per second in both handheld and docked modes. The difference, then, lies in the visual quality, which is further diminished in handheld mode, whereas docked mode offers improved image quality, increased draw distance, and more refined LOD settings.</p>



<p>The handheld mode does have a few tricks up its sleeve, such as HDR support and a tweaked implementation of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR). Bruno explained:</p>



<p><em>The lower framerate limit for VRR is typically 40 FPS, but Assassin's Creed Shadows runs at 30 FPS on Nintendo Switch 2. We didn't want to compromise on that aspect, and so we built a dedicated algorithm that keeps VRR enabled even at 30 FPS, keeping the game as fluid and responsive as possible.</em></p>



<p>Ubisoft is leveraging a few platform-specific features for this version of the game, such as touchscreen support for menus, maps, and hideout interactions. There are also plans for future mouse and keyboard compatibility in docked mode.</p>

            <p>
If you've been patiently waiting for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, your time has nearly come: it slinks onto the console next Tuesday, 2nd December. And ahead of its arrival, Ubisoft has shared a bit of a deep-dive detailing some of the technical jiggery pokery it used to make it work on Nintendo's platform, alongside some of its exclusive features.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows launched for other platforms back in March following a number of delays, whisking the series to 16th century feudal Japan for an adventure focused on dual protagonists Yasuke and Fujibayashi Naoe. It was well-received too, with Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Tom Phillips calling it "majestic in scope, impressive in detail" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">his four star review</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the Switch 2 version, Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3eHpj3aktX4nWY150OEHJL/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-the-nintendo-switch-2-system-port">latest blog post</a> confirms it'll include all updates released for Assassin's Creed Shadows so far, with the exception of its Claws of Awaji expansion, which is due in 2026. The company also notes future Switch 2 updates will align with other platforms, and it'll be working on console-specific improvements too, with talk of optimisation patches plus keyboard and mouse compatibility when docked.

<p>
Wondering what else you can expect on Switch 2? Ubisoft is targeting a "stable 30fps" in both docked and handheld modes, saying it's done a "lot of code-level work... to optimise and adapt the game architecture". This, it adds, has enabled it to "streamline certain technical aspects of the quality, without compromising the player's experience or the richness of the game."
</p><p>
Elsewhere it's foregoing Switch 2's ray-traced global illumination support in favour of baked global illumination "mainly for RAM memory reasons", while level of details, draw distances, texture resolution, and element loading have been "carefully adjusted" in an effort to maintain performance. Switch 2 will also feature fewer NPCs in highly populated areas to "ensure smooth gameplay", although Ubisoft reckons environmental richness "remains largely intact". There's also DLSS support for "smoother" performance.
</p>
<p>
As for handheld mode compromises, there've been "adjustments to image quality, draw distance, and LOD settings" to accomodate GPU limitations. However, variable refresh rates make an appearance, as does HDR.
</p>
<p>
If it's Switch 2-specific features you want, there's touch screen navigation when interacting with maps and menus. Additionally, cross-progression is supported via Ubisoft Connect, meaning it's possible to seamlessly hop between platforms if you've been playing - or were planning on playing - Shadows elsewhere. And as a reminder, Assassin's Creed Shadows arrives on Switch 2, next Tuesday, 2nd December.

With this being the second remake of Dragon Quest VII, following the 2016 Nintendo 3DS remake, I was curious about where you even start with a project like this.&nbsp;</p><p>So I asked producer Takeshi Ichikawa and director Masato Yagi about their thought processes behind developing the game, which elements are sacred ground in Dragon Quest VII, if there's any pressure involved, and more. Here's what I learned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"To be honest, I did feel some pressure, but for the most part, I felt the same as Ichikawa here," Yagi tells me. "I was excited with the idea of bringing these new changes." Ichikawa, on the other hand, didn't feel much pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was certainly excited with the prospect of bringing these changes,” he tells me. “When we first kicked off the project, we had in mind three main components that we really wanted to reimagine for this version; the first one being the visuals, the second one being the scenario or the story, and the third one being the battle. [...] It is one of the most popular installments in the series, but our goal was to offer a reimagined experience to players all around the world. But again, I didn’t really necessarily feel pressure.”</p><p>When I ask where the team started with Reimagined, Ichikawa explains it's a remake focused on showcasing what makes Dragon Quest VII so great to modern audiences. That means keeping the story intact, although lead scenario writer Sayaka Takagi explained to me in a different interview how the team streamlined the main scenario; <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/10/heres-how-the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-team-streamlined-its-main">you can read about that here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I really thought that the story of the original was essential to keep," Ichikawa says. "When you look at [all of the] mainline installments, Dragon Quest VII's story is quite unique and not really like the others. These characters [...] go through a lot of struggles, and it is, overall, kind of a bit darker. That [darkness] is the one thing that I wanted to retain for sure in the remake."&nbsp;</p><p>Yagi agrees with Ichikawa, telling me in a series full of lighthearted stories with a more loving tone, Dragon Quest VII is darker. He remembers asking, "Is this actually a Dragon Quest story?" while playing the original game on PlayStation. Retaining this tone was important for Reimagined, he adds, lightly dipping into spoiler territory to discuss Prince Kiefer, a party member of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>I won't spoil anything here, but if you're familiar with the game, Kiefer makes a crucial decision in the story, and though in the initial stages of development the team pondered keeping it (and other narrative moments) in the game, it remained.&nbsp;</p><p>"That's definitely one thing that we were debating if we should keep or not, but in the end, we decided it's just too essential for the story," Yagi says. "There are a lot of areas where we debated to keep or not keep, but in the end, for the most part, we decided to keep [things in place]. But it's not keeping them as is. We did end up making some little adjustments and arrangements here and there."&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The use of generative AI tools in game development has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a major point of controversy within the video game industry. Some figures, notably, many studio heads and executives, <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-game-characters-should-be-ai-trained-human-scripts-more-natural-conversations/">are all for using generative AI in game development</a>. Others <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/">don't think it's necessary at all</a>. While we know Epic Games chief executive officer Tim Sweeney <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">sits firmly in the former camp</a>, he has also weighed in on another aspect of the issue, the fact that digital stores like Steam require developers to disclose that generative AI tools were used in the making of their game.</p>



<p>Currently, games published to Steam that were made with generative AI tools must disclose their use. ARC Raiders, for example, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">includes such a disclosure at the bottom of its Steam page</a>, though with how forward Embark Studios has been about its use of generative AI, we wouldn't have needed the tag to know generative AI tools were used.</p>



<p>In other cases, though, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3823370/Beyond_Words/">like the recently announced game Beyond Words from former Timesplitters and GoldenEye developers</a>, if not for the disclosure at the bottom, we'd likely not know generative AI tools had been used. And then there are those who still don't disclose its use, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-generative-ai-assets/">admitting it only after they are caught having used it</a>, or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lsx5lwmsmk2j">don't admit it at all, and quietly patch it out</a>.</p>



<p>In response to Unreal Engine developer Matt Workman arguing for the removal of generative AI tags and disclosures on storefronts like Steam <a href="https://x.com/cinedatabase/status/1988991435358482621">in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Tim Sweeney agreed with Workman's post, saying that having generative AI tags on platforms like Steam "<em>makes no sense</em>."</p>



<p>Not because those who care about avoiding games made with generative AI have to keep an eye out for the disclosure, and even if it's not there, keep themselves aware for any signs of it. But because in his mind, there will come a day when every game is made with generative AI tools. </p>



<p>"<em>The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Agreed. The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.</p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>GenAI being used in "<em>nearly all future production</em>" might be what the future looks like in Tim Sweeney's head, but it's debatable that GenAI tools will catch on to such a degree. When Nexon's chief executive officer <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">claimed that players should already be assuming all games are made with GenAI</a>, multiple developers stood up to point out that they would never use GenAI tools for their creative endeavours.</p>



<p>Whichever side you fall on, GenAI tools in game development, especially in triple-A game development, are undoubtedly here to stay. So there will continue to be games made with these tools, and we could get to a point where the disclosures are removed because enough games are using these tools. However, it would be interesting to see if developers who are against using GenAI would respond by highlighting that they did not use GenAI in making their game. It would seriously put to the test what executives are saying, <a href="https://wccftech.com/consumers-dont-care-about-ai/">that consumers "<em>do not care</em>" if something was made with GenAI or not</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-goes-full-liquidation-on-santas-sleigh-set-now-selling-at-zero-profit-to-clear-before-christmas-2000648144</link>
            <guid>1366783</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Thanksgiving brings a welcome surprise as <strong>LEGO’s most popular Christmas set returns to Amazon inventory</strong> after two weeks of complete stock depletion that frustrated holiday shoppers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6021/">At $25, down from $39, the Santa’s Sleigh building set hits a Black Friday price</a> that likely removes LEGO’s profit margin entirely as they race to clear seasonal inventory before Christmas passes and demand evaporates.</p>
<p>The aggressive pricing reflects LEGO’s urgency to move remaining units rather than holding stock that becomes instantly obsolete on December 26th. With over <strong>30,000 units already sold</strong> and limited time remaining before the holiday, this inventory replenishment at record-low pricing creates the optimal purchasing window.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6021/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>343-Piece Build That Is Fun and Challenging</h2>
<p>The <strong>343-piece count gives builders a lot of time to build, about 2 to 3 hours for experienced builders</strong> and even longer for kids working on their first multi-hour LEGO projects. This piece count strikes a good balance between being fun and easy to use. It has enough pieces to keep kids ages 9 and up happy without overwhelming younger builders with too many pieces that make them angry.</p>



<p>The <strong>Santa minifigure and four poseable reindeer figures</strong> that come with it let kids act out Christmas Eve delivery scenes instead of just looking at static displays. The saddles can be taken off and decorated, which lets you personalize them. The<strong> eight wrapped gifts</strong> that can be built also give you props for storytelling which makes the toy more fun to play with after it’s been built. The <strong>guitar, skis, and teddy bear accessories</strong> hint at certain story elements, but they also leave room for people to use their imaginations to figure out whose gifts these are and where Santa brings them.</p>
<p>The <strong>sleigh is 3 inches high, 11.5 inches long, and 2.5 inches wide</strong> which makes it a great holiday decoration that doesn’t take up too much space on mantels or shelves. The size is perfect for showing off on fireplace mantels, entry tables, or holiday vignettes without needing special furniture. LEGO’s precise manufacturing tolerances guarantee that the structure will stay strong even when it is handled carefully and stored once a year.</p>



<p>The set works just as well as a <strong>hands-on gift that the recipient puts together themselves or as a decoration that the gift-giver</strong> puts together before giving it. Kids who get the unbuilt set get to build it and use it at the same time while adults who get pre-assembled sets like how they look right away without having to spend time building them, which they may not have during busy holiday seasons.</p>
<p>Because it’s seasonal, the set naturally follows a pattern of being displayed in December and then packed away with other holiday decorations. This way, it stays fresh each year instead of becoming stale decorations that are always there. This cyclical use makes the perceived value last longer by building up excitement around yearly unpacking traditions that kids look forward to along with other holiday traditions.</p>
<p>LEGO Santa’s Sleigh comes with 343 pieces, a Santa mini-figure, four reindeer and the ability to display Christmas decorations. LEGO’s zero-margin seasonal clearance pricing combined with restocked inventory after 2-week depletion creates the optimal moment to secure this popular set before final sellout.</p>

<p>Kirby has proven his absolute dominance in the region once again, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> getting off the start line in style with a sweet 195,594 sales under its belt.

<p>Switch 2 hardware sales have seen an expected boost by the presence of a new exclusive Kirby in town, with the console finding itself comfortably at the top of the hardware chart with an additional 126,953 units to its name. It has also been a strong week for PS5 sales, mind you, with the Digital Edition achieving 23,381, and the Pro even overtaking the Switch Lite and standard models with 11,367.</p>
<p>All this means that combining the console SKUs swings things in Sony's favour this time, with the three PS5 units clocking in at 36,920, while the Switch 1 models combine for 29,370.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> probably won't get a second major DLC expansion on the scale of Claws of Awaji, Ubisoft's associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois has revealed. It's a blow to fans who are accustomed to getting a couple of major expansions per Assassin's Creed, and a boon to people who haven't even played Shadows yet, let alone the 10-hour-long Claws of Awaji, and are getting dry heaves from FOMO. It's me, I am people.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"As of now at this moment for Year Two there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned currently," Lemay-Comtois revealed in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s">JorRaptor</a>, via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">Ian Games</a>. "We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but it's not a full-on DLC the way a Season Pass would have had in the previous years." The developers are trying "to keep things small and reactive and see how the community feels about it."

<p>Claws Of Awaji aside, the first year of Shadows updating brought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-adds-a-self-driving-horse-but-i-implore-you-not-to-use-it">self-driving horses</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-getting-a-much-needed-parkour-update">posher parkour</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-latest-update-adds-in-collabs-with-dead-by-daylight-and-balatro-of-all-things">Balatro collaborations</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-latest-update-brings-in-a-nightmare-difficulty-mode-and-another-weird-collab">nightmare difficulty</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-date-assassins-creed-shadows-new-game-mode-alongside-plans-to-make-its-open-world-more-convenient">a more conveniently made open world</a>, amongst other tweaks to the furnishings. The second year "will probably be more sparse, not a drip-feed, but chunkier updates that shake things up a little more," Lemay-Comtois suggested in the interview.
</p>
<p>"I'm not announcing anything at this point," he went on, "but our strategy for Year One was to be quick and reactive, so it means smaller drops often, but for Year Two we don't need to put fires out or anything, so it's more what good, chunky little piece of meat we can drop and have people come back and enjoy it." 
</p><p>As IGN note, 2017's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a> and 2018's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a> both had two expansions, while 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla got three, with 2023's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> starting out as yet another Valhalla expansion. Why is Shadows getting stiffed with a measly single expansion? Because it was uncommonly hard to develop, Lemay-Comtois explained, with a major technological overhaul that contributed (along with the "soft" performance of stablemate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>) to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">a delayed release</a>.
</p>
<p>"I think with Shadows, we had a big jump in generations," he said. "The engine work that we had to do on Shadows took a lot of time and a lot of our resources. The planning for the post launch was not really as clear as it would have been on [previous AC games] where the technology is more stable and well known."
</p>
<p>Shadows originally had a proper season pass, but Ubisoft canned it alongside the delay announcement, and decided to give away Claws of Awaji for free. "I remember during pre-launch we had the Season Pass," Lemay-Comtois added. "And that situation changed when we pushed back on the release date. That plan changed quite a bit and then we had to kind of adapt to the situation. So because of the new tech, because of the new generation, because of the pushes we had in production."
</p>
<p>It seems possible the decision to stop at one Shadows expansion also reflects wider turmoil at Ubisoft, who are busily <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">restructuring around a Tencent-funded subsidiary</a> dedicated to Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six. Anyway, the upshot is that you AC diehards now have around 10 hours of playtime back to fritter away on something else. I recommend the similarly shadowy and backstabby <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mark-of-the-ninja">Mark Of The Ninja</a>. Alternatively, you could spend it playing the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake that absolutely isn't coming in 2026</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bag-the-razer-iskur-v2-x-ergonomic-gaming-chair-while-its-going-for-just-250-on-amazon-2000647135</link>
            <guid>1366759</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As someone who’s in front of the screen for several hours a day, six days a week, I can tell you just how important a good-quality chair is. You’re not just sitting on it; it’s providing your upper and lower back, plus arms, the support they need so you can keep working comfortably.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, the best options on the market don’t come cheap. On a regular day, you can expect to pay over $300 for a top-rated option from a known brand. Thankfully, that changes today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/">Right now, you can grab the Razer Iskur V2 X ergonomic gaming chair for just $250, after a nice 17% discount on its retail price of $300.</a></p>
<p>It’s a Black Friday deal, and the offer applies to both black and dark gray color options. The discount, however, ends soon, so it’s best to bag it as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Adjustable Design With Plush Fabric</h2>
<p>The fabric is cool to the skin and smooth to the touch. Thicker cushion padding molds to the unique shape of your body, while the breathable, multi-layered fibers prevent sweat and moisture buildup during those longer, intense work and play sessions.</p>
<p>The wide seat base is sculpted with reduced edges that distribute the pressure around evenly, which prevents soreness in the buttocks and thighs. It also promotes healthy blood flow, so you won’t have to change positions every few minutes to keep those uncomfortable numbness or tingling sensations away. There’s an integrated lumbar arch that encourages a neutral sitting position with lower back support, because it’s high time you start taking your posture seriously. We don’t mean to creep you out, but Tech Necks don’t just look awkward; they can lead to long-term spine damage and nerve pinching if you don’t make necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>Of course, sitting upright for longer hours can get tiring. To tackle that, the Razer Iskur V2 X has an adjustable recline of up to 152 degrees. Stretch out a bit, and use this mode for relaxing gaming or streaming sessions that don’t require intense focus.</p>



<p>Arms get a break, too. The 2D armrests can be adjusted in height and rotated inwards or outwards for a neutral position. When typing long documents, adjust the height to match your desk and keep them in the outward position for proper arm and wrist support. Planning to relax with a quick gaming session? Pull them inwards for a bit more stability with the console.</p>
<p>The chair is available in two color options, so you can pick whichever suits your aesthetics the best. Go for the black one for a cleaner, classic look. Like your gaming setup with a bit more personality? The dark gray version is going to upgrade the overall look instantly!</p>
<p>This gaming chair does not come pre-assembled, so you’ll need to put it together yourself. The process is straightforward (instruction manual included), and should not take more than 30 minutes. If you’d rather skip the hassle, you can get professional assembly through Amazon for an additional $100.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/"> To wrap it up, this Black Fridy deal brings the price of this ergonomic gaming chair down to just $250, after a nice $50 discount.</a> It’s great for gamers, work professionals, creatives, and even casual users looking for better support as they use their PC or laptop. It ends soon, though, so it’s best to grab yours before the price goes back up, or the stock ends for good.</p>

<p>The Final Masterpiece</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, here's a welcome surprise! Hot off the back of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, Bloober Team has shared with us the <em>next</em> project that it's working on for Switch 2, and it's none other than an all-new <strong>Layers of Fear</strong> package.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: Final Masterpiece Edition</a> will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>19th December</strong>, bundling together <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/layers_of_fear">Layers of Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_2">Layers of Fear 2</a>, every DLC expansion, and brand-new chapters into one spooky edition fully optimised for the new system.</p>
<p>There are the added bonuses of HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, too, <em>and</em> you have the option to play with motion controls or touchscreen inputs if you see fit. Here's the official blurb from Bloober Team and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Layers of Fear</em> is a first-person experience that blends story-driven exploration, environmental puzzles, and psychological horror. The Final Master Edition brings together the intertwined stories of three characters — the Painter, the Actor, and the Writer — each consumed by their devotion to art. The atmosphere is elevated by a chilling yet hauntingly beautiful soundtrack composed by award-winning musician Arek Reikowski. Rebuilt with HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, this edition deepens immersion in its melancholic and spine-chilling world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It all sounds like a pretty strong way to experience these psychological horror titles. The full Final Masterpiece Edition will be available on the eShop for <strong>$39.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) next month — because the holiday season <em>really</em> needs some more scares, right?</p>
<p>For those curious, we had a perfectly good time with Cronos: The New Dawn when it arrived on Switch 2 back in September, describing it as "a celebration of survival horror, paying homage to all the genre greats effectively, although failing to do anything truly original" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">our review</a>.</p>
