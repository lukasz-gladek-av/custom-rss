            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/660272/shotgun-cop-man-review-pc-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Shotgun Cop Man</em> is a strange platformer. You play as a square man with a round, bald head who’s chasing Satan to arrest him. At the beginning of each of the game’s nine worlds, Satan gives you the middle finger. And you don’t just use guns for fighting, but for traversal as well.</p><p>You start each world with two guns: a rapid-fire but weak pistol and a more powerful shotgun that only has three blasts. When you’re on the ground, your ammo constantly refills, meaning you essentially have infinite ammo. But when you’re in the air, if you run out of bullets, you won’t get a refill until you touch the ground.</p><p>This all matters because there’s no jump button. That means you get into the air by shooting your guns: the pistol lets you hover, while the shotgun can rocket you upward to reach high platforms. You can aim in any direction, so the shotgun can blast you backward and forward, too — it’s a speedy and fun way to get around. It’s all a little bit like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/15/9538815/downwell-hp-lovecraft-game-iphone-steam">Downwell</a></em>, but sideways.</p><p>You’ll need to get around quickly to dodge Satan’s minions. Most often, you’ll take on little devils that spit bullets and are generally a nuisance. But there are a few more difficult enemies, such as flying sentient saws with one eye. There are bosses at the end of each world, too, like a flying skull with horns that can manifest a body to attack you with.</p><p>If you get hit by an enemy or stung by a spike, your heart will fly a short distance away from your body. If you get the heart back, you’ll survive another hit and the heart will float away again. It’s similar to a <em>Sonic</em> game, where you can take a hit so long as you have at least one ring. If you’re hit while your heart is out, you’ll die — though thanks to the game’s generous checkpoint system, you usually won’t start too far from where you were killed.</p><p>Each world has 17 short levels that are filled with typical platforming dangers including baddies, spikes, moving platforms, lasers, and block pushing puzzles. (Block shooting puzzles?) Individual levels generally take 30 seconds to a couple minutes to beat, so depending on how skillful you are with your guns, you can zip to the goal quickly and feel like a speedrunner.</p><p>You’ll frequently find new guns, too. I was a big fan of one that made bullets bounce off walls, which doubled as a useful puzzle-solving tool. The sniper rifle was a welcome upgrade because it could blast through multiple enemies at once.</p><p>Visually, the game looks like a platformer in dark mode: black is the primary color, and enemies are generally a shade of red. Throughout the game, you’ll hear a persistent, thumping, and unnerving soundtrack that sounds like what you’d hear at some kind of Satan-worshipping club. The whole vibe makes you feel as if you’re actually descending into the pits of some dark hell.</p><p>My favorite part of the game was that you could accomplish a lot in a short amount of time. My full playthrough was about three and a half hours, and I could get through most of the nine worlds in about 20 or 30 minutes. I appreciated the brevity, because even though I very much enjoyed the game, the intentionally uncomfortable atmosphere got under my skin, and I could only play it in short bursts.</p><p>Once you understand how to navigate just with <em>Shotgun Cop Man’s</em> guns, you can really fly around the levels like some kind of cartoony action hero. By the end, you’ll use those guns to give the finger right back to Satan.</p><p><em><sub>Shotgun Cop Man is now available on PC and Nintendo Switch.</sub></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/chips-arent-improving-like-they-used-to-and-its-killing-game-console-price-cuts/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Consider the PlayStation 2. Not all of the PS2 Slim's streamlining came from chip improvements—it also shed a full-sized 3.5-inch hard drive bay and a little-used IEEE 1394 port, and initially required an external power brick. But shrinking and consolidating the console's CPU, GPU, memory, and other components took the console from its original design in 2000, to the Slim in 2004, to an even lighter and lower-power version of the Slim that returned to using an internal power supply without increasing the size of the console at all.</p>
<p>Over that same span, the console's price dropped frequently and significantly, from $299 at launch to just $129 by 2006 (the price was lowered again to $99 in 2009, deep into the PS3 era).</p>
<p>Or look at Microsoft's Xbox 360. Its external design didn't change as much over the years—the mid-generation "slim" refresh was actually only a little smaller than the original. But between late 2005 and early 2010, the CPU, GPU, and the GPU's high-speed eDRAM memory chip went from being built on a 90 nm process, to 80 nm, to 65 nm, and finally to a single 45 nm chip that combined the CPU and GPU into one.</p>
<p>Over that time, the system's power supply fell from 203 W to 133 W, and the base price fell from $300 to $200. The mid-generation 65nm refresh also substantially fixed the early consoles' endemic "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems#General_Hardware_Failure_errors">red ring of death</a>" issue, which was caused in part by the heat that the older, larger chips generated.</p>
<p>As you can see when comparing these various consoles' external and internal design revisions, shrinking the chips had a cascade of other beneficial and cost-lowering effects: smaller power supplies, smaller enclosures that use less metal and plastic, smaller heatsinks and cooling assemblies, and smaller and less complicated motherboard designs.</p>

<p>A slowdown of that progression was already evident when we hit the PlayStation 4/Xbox One/Nintendo Switch generation, but technological improvements and pricing reductions still followed familiar patterns. Both the mid-generation PS4 Slim and Xbox One S used a 16 nm processor instead of the original consoles' 28 nm version, and each also had its price cut by $100 over its lifetime (comparing the Kinect-less Xbox One variant, and excluding the digital-only $249 Xbox One). The Switch's single die shrink, from 20nm to 16nm, didn't come with a price cut, but it did improve battery life and help to enable the cheaper Switch Lite variant.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Original story:</strong> Court papers filed in California, USA, show Nintendo is formally suing accessories manufacturer Genki for infringing its trademark, as well as alleging unfair competition and false advertising.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-lawyers-visited-genki-to-discuss-those-switch-2-leaks-reporter-claims">Nintendo lawyers reportedly visited Genki on the CES trade show floor in January</a> after videos of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">its dummy Switch 2 console went viral</a> before the system was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">formally revealed by Nintendo on 2nd April</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Nintendo has filed its copyright claim against Genki, accusing the company of "capitalising" on demand for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> news and giving "contradictory and inconsistent" statements.</p>

<figcaption>Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uGRs-ispRU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Beginning at least as early as December 2024, [Genki] embarked upon a strategic campaign intended to capitalise on the public interest surrounding Nintendo's next-generation console," court papers <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.1.0.pdf">said</a>,</p>
<p>"In January 2025, [Genki] began advertising that it gained unauthorised access to Nintendo's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console, which had not yet been released or even revealed publicly by Nintendo. Following its initial claims of access to a genuine Nintendo Switch 2 console, Defendant's statements were contradictory and inconsistent, with Defendant later stating that it was never in possession of a console. Nevertheless, Defendant has since maintained its representation to consumers that its accessories will be compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2 upon the console's release."</p>
<p>Nintendo said that "ensuring the compatibility of Defendant's accessories would not be possible unless and until Defendant has access to a Nintendo Switch 2 console" and insists it neither provided nor authorised a Switch 2 to the company. Therefore, Nintendo alleges Genki either misled consumers by pretending to have a "genuine console" when it didn't, or "unlawfully or illicitly obtained an authentic Nintendo Switch 2, or proprietary technical information about the Nintendo Switch 2, prior to the console's release to the public".</p>
<p>"Genki boasted its alleged early access to the unreleased console and allowed guests to hold and measure the mockups," Nintendo's lawyers said, adding the videos, renders, and images Genki displayed at its CES booth and on its website infringed Nintendo's copyright and "garnered significant attention from the media and public resulting in confusion among consumers as to the validity of Genki's statements and association with Nintendo".</p>
<p>"Public discourse and confusion over Genki's announcements were so significant that on January 10, 2025, Nintendo issued a statement to reporters about the incident, clarifying that 'the gaming hardware that Genki presented as Nintendo hardware at CES is unofficial and was not provided to the company by us'," Nintendo added.</p>
<p>Then, on 20th January, Genki posted a picture of its CEO, Edward Tsai, on its official Twitter account with the caption: "Genki ninjas infiltrate Nintendo Kyoto HQ", which Nintendo said was "an apparent attempt to further confuse the public as to whether Genki had access to a Nintendo Switch 2 and/or an affiliation with Nintendo". It then updated its website and advertisements "to boast about its early access to Nintendo Switch 2 information", saying: "Can you keep a secret? We can’t..."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>On 1st April, 2025 - the day before Nintendo's Switch 2 Nintendo Direct - Genki allegedly "mass-emailed its marketing list and posted on social media an announcement of its own 'Direct' presentation to be held on the same day as Nintendo's highly anticipated presentation". Nintendo then took issue with the name of Genki's broadcast - Genki Direct - and its branding materials.</p>
<p>"Genki's claims of compatibility would be impossible to guarantee without unauthorised, illegal early access to the Nintendo Switch 2. Thus, Genki has misled and is misleading the public as to its ability to guarantee the compatibility of its products with the Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
<p>Nintendo is asking for Genki to be stopped from using "Nintendo Switch" in its marketing, destroy any products or marketing that does use Nintendo's copyright, and "recover all damages it has sustained as a result of Defendant's infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising, and that said damages be trebled".</p>
<p>Interestingly, the court papers also revealed that Nintendo wasted no time designing the Switch successor, saying: "Shortly after the release of the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo began planning its successor console, with formal hardware development beginning around 2019."</p>
<p>The Switch 2 will release on 5th June and cost £396. Nintendo is gearing up for the launch of Switch 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-prepares-for-switch-2-with-original-console-update-adding-gameshare-virtual-game-cards-and-more">by releasing a chunky update for the original Switch</a>. Update Version 20.0.0 adds a number of features to the console, including the new Virtual Game Card system, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-cards-thatll-let-you-share-you-digital-switch-and-switch-2-games">allows players to share their digital games with another console</a> or Family Group members in the same way they might swap a physical cartridge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Half-Life 3 is not just in development, but it's now "playable, end-to-end".</p>
<p>That's according to Valve insider Tyler McVicker, who posits the eagerly-anticipated sequel could be announced as early as this summer (Q3), with a possible release before the end of 2025, probably winter (Q4).</p>
<p>We already had strong evidence - if no specific confirmation - that Valve is once again working on a major new Half-Life project of some kind, codenamed HLX, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">a trustworthy report last summer detailing datamined assets and code snippets</a> backing up a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">leak from an actor</a> likely involved.</p>

<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/half-life-3-is-reportedly-playable-in-its-entirety-and-could-be-announced-this-year-183030499.html">Engadget</a>, McVicker gave a livestreamed Q&amp;A packed with explosive clues and hints about what's to come, and he has once again stressed: "The game is not VR. Half Life 3 is not a VR title."</p>
<p>"HLX is being playtested so religiously and so widely that there are individuals who will just talk," McVicker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Z9IOIWKHg&amp;t=1300s">said</a>. "I personally have a policy of avoiding any story-related questions or information wherever possible, so I currently have avoided all of them. But I've been offered it by people whom are trustworthy and I know some of my contemporaries have been given it so there is information out there about the plot..."</p>
<p>That said, he did tease that he "actually do[es] think [Portal's] Chell may turn up in Half-Life 3", and stressed: "Erik Wolpaw wants to do Portal 3 so fuckin' bad". McVicker also opined it was possible Portal 3 could be the next single-player project developed at Valve, but that may depend upon who is "gonna retire" after Half-Life 3.</p>
<p>"This is the furthest (HLX) has ever been. Period," he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Z9IOIWKHg&amp;t=8230s">added</a>. "The game is playable - end to end. Period. [Other HL3/Ep3 projects have] never been that far. And they're optimising, polishing, and they're probably content-locked and if they're not then they're mechanic locked."</p>
<p>He also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Z9IOIWKHg&amp;t=2310s">addressed</a> the procedural generation system, saying it has been "misunderstood" by the general public.</p>
<p>"The way Valve is going about that is akin to taking the [AI] Director from Left4Dead 2 and making it significantly more powerful. It's not changing geometry. It's instead changing entity placement, right [... like] doors, physics props, enemies, items. NPCs of any kind." He also disputes claims the story will be procedurally generated.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-cancelled-a-lot-of-games-over-the-last-10-years-including-half-life-3-and-left-4-dead-3">What we <em>do</em> know for sure is Half-Life 3 was in development 2013/2014</a>, and was set to be a procedurally-generated, replayable game that fused <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>-inspired gameplay with scripted story moments. It was cancelled because it was built on the unfinished Source 2 engine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong.1180659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's no mystery that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been a great success, given that developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive have <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it's already a million seller (despite being available on Game Pass, too). How does it compare to other JRPGs, though?</p>
<p>According to our analyst friend Rhys Elliott, who was often <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-hit-all-the-right-notes-according-to-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously featured in exclusive interviews on Wccftech</a>, it's selling much faster, at least on Steam. Elliott, who recently left MIDiA Research to become Head of Market Analysis at Alinea Analytics, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-more-than-twice-as-fast-as-other-jrpgs-on-pc-analyst-says-heres-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke to GamesIndustry.biz</a> about the game's surprising early sales compared to triple-A games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>:</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a certified hit, officially selling more than one million copies. The announcement didn't say players reached – it said copies sold. That was a choice, and I applaud the transparency. It's worth noting that two of these are ports, but the data still speaks volumes for how much gamers are drawn to Expedition 33. The low price point likely also factored in, as our Steam data shows that many players bite the bullet when an AAA game goes on sale and drops below $50.</em></p>

<p>The same doesn't quite apply to PlayStation sales, where Final Fantasy VII Rebirth sold four times faster at launch. However, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is still ahead of the rest of the pack. Besides, losing to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on PlayStation isn't surprising, given the enormous hype surrounding that game ahead of its launch last year.</p>

<p>In the interview mentioned above, Elliott also pointed to the fact that several JRPG fans were waiting for such a realistic JRPG, even with its turn-based combat, in contrast to Square Enix's public statements on the matter:</p>
<p><em>There was also an opening for a modern, realistic-looking JRPG. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has given RPG fans something they always wanted. If you asked Final Fantasy fans from the late '90s/early '00s what the ideal version of a JRPG should look like, it'd be something like this.</em></p>
<p>The reference is quite obvious. Back in June 2022, Final Fantasy XVI Producer Naoki Yoshida openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that it is getting harder to mix turn-based combat and realistic graphics because they create a feeling of idiosyncrasy among some players. Indeed, that game focused strictly on action-based combat, shunning the series' traditional turn-based system.</p>
<p>While I personally don't fully disagree with Yoshida's assessment, there is definitely still space for turn-based combat, especially if it is revamped with key innovations such as in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which features real-time dodges and parries.</p>
<p>Besides, this particular game is just too good at almost everything it does, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's 9.5/10 review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive’s first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself.</em></p>

Do you ever think to yourself, "gee, I wish that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/l-a-noire">LA Noire</a> actually looked like a noir film and also everyone is a furry"? Then boy howdy do I have the game for you: The Shadow Syndicate. It just got announced yesterday at the Gamescom Latam showcase, and I should say it's not exactly like LA Noire in that you don't have to try and read the faces of motion capture actors overperforming their hearts out. What it does have is some detective work, gunplay, and even some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/max-payne">Max Payneish</a> bullet-time. How can you not be into that mixture?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The game is set in an early 1930s Brooklyn, and you play as private detective Sam Marlowe. According to a press release, Sam's mentor has gone missing, and alongside that there's a weird secret group getting up to no good.

I would like to point out there is also essentially zero mention of the fact that everyone is an anthropomorphic animal anywhere in said press release, the only mention it gets is "evocative character designs", which they certainly are. I'm into it though, this is a hard-boildish Noir we're talking about, everyone being a dog or a chicken is just the way of the world, don't think about it too hard.
</p>
<p>
There's two parts to the gameplay, one being the aforementioned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> gunplay, which does seem to borrow from Max Payne's iconic mechanic. The other is talking to citizens to collect clues, as well as interacting with the city at large, all of which gets jotted down in Sam's journal to help open up new dialogue options and story paths.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, The Shadow Syndicate doesn't have an exact release date just yet. It's due out some time in 2026 at the very least, and in the meantime, you can always <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3668300/The_Shadow_Syndicate/">wishlist it on Steam</a>.

            <p>
I'm not sure how they have time for it, but as part of a livestream held earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a> revealed yet another new game. This one isn't a completely new world, it's actually another Honkai game, though right now it doesn't have a name. A very short teaser was shared for it which literally just called it a "brand new Honkai game", but there were a couple of signs that it was one anyway. Namely, the presence of a couple of characters, Kiana and Blade.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Kiana isn't from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Star Rail</a>, she's from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-impact">Impact 3rd</a>, one of the main characters in fact, and Blade is a playable character in Star Rail, so it seems like there's a bit of a crossover going on here. The teaser doesn't have a lick of gameplay, it's just a pre-rendered cutscene, but I think it's a safe bet on being some kind of Pokemon clone. 
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="547"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1kdsy74/new_honkai_game_announced/">New Honkai Game announced</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vegetable-Feedback11/">u/Vegetable-Feedback11</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/">HonkaiStarRail</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
When Kiana rocks up she's accompanied by the most gelatinous looking dog creature you've ever seen in your life. Blade also has a dog thing with him, though his one's a bit cooler, and the two dogs are shown charging towards each other for a fight. You can see a couple of other characters that also have their own critters with them, so, this really does come across as HoYoVerse starting to stake their claim on Pokemon's cash cow.
</p>
<p>
There's as strong possibility of the game being named Honkai: Nexus Anima as the fan-run account <a href="https://x.com/StarRailVerse1/status/1915725508639179139">Star Rail Universe</a> found that a bunch of Twitter accounts have been registered with that name. I guess we'll have to wait and see on that one.
</p>
<p>
Pokemon doesn't seem like the only game that HoYoVerse is going after, as there's been leaks and other social media accounts spotted to do with a <a href="https://www.vg247.com/hoyoverse-stardew-valley-style-game-astaweave-haven-wechat-account-potential-announcement-soon">game that might be in the vein of Stardew Valley</a>. This is what I mean about them being so busy! Guess they really just want to have a game for every genre.

Well, this is all a bit awkward. Yesterday, you might have seen claims that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> writer Yuji Horii accidentally confirmed that a remake of the beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-japanese-games-to-play-on-pc">JRPG</a> is in the works. It all read a bit suspicious right off the bat, because it initially just came from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/1kd1gij/yuji_horii_confirms_chrono_trigger_remake_at/?sort=new">Reddit post</a> from someone who attended a panel Horii was speaking at during Napoli Comicon without any video evidence. Then some other posts started cropping up, alongside commenters saying they were also there and that this was true. Except, it isn't true, because it was all a translation miscommunication.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Later on in the day, a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2448211166?t=18941s">Twitch VOD</a> was shared of the event, where <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lo7v4b6jdc23">Gematsu</a> was able to confirm that Horii didn't actually mention anything about a remake of Chrono Trigger at all. It seems that somehow the interpreter interpreted something Horii said as confirmation of a remake. I can't tell you how that happened though, as I neither speak Japanese nor Italian. Go figure!
</p>
<p>
It's not exactly a surprise that such a story got people so excited so quickly. After all, on the game's 30th anniversary back in March, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> noted that they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">plan to share word of various projects</a> that "go beyond the world of the game" later this year. I can't exactly blame someone for thinking that that's code for "a remake is coming", and for all I know one still is happening. It just hasn't been accidentally revealed by one of its lead writers, that's all.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I don't even think it needs a remake. I'd imagine it would be an HD-2D one in the style of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> 3 and Live A Live, which while pretty, just feels pretty unnecessary. Of course, none of you can hold this against me if one does get announced and I think it looks cool, actually, ok? Cheers.

We're not too far off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> now, with the spinoff game due out right at the end of the month. Some of you might have even played some of it already, unlike James, who struggled to play any of it at all when the test was held <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ten-pc-games-i-could-have-played-in-full-during-the-time-i-spent-failing-to-connect-to-elden-ring-nightreign-on-ps5">back in February</a>. Considering how few of us have actually spent any time on it overall though, quite conveniently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco</a> shared a little overview trailer yesterday that dove into what you'll be doing in the Fortniteish Souls game.
</p>
<p>
When you first drop into Limveld, you'll be doing so pretty weak as a level one character. From there, you can fight just regular old enemies, loot some treasure chests, the typical kind of thing you'd do in the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. One thing that differs is that you can also sneak into different bases to try to get some info from some maps about the land. And, of course, there's also some big blighters that'll knock you down pretty easily if you're not careful you can try to take a whack at if you're feeling brave enough for some bigger rewards.
</p>

<p>
Another big difference is random events that can take place. As you might already know, from session to session the maps change shape, sometimes much more dramatically than others. Sometimes there'll be a volcanic area that erupts, or you'll have to trek through some woods full of rot. That guy that calls you a foul tarnished might rock up too! There honestly looks to be quite a lot of variation.
</p>
<p>
The Fortnite constantly dwindling circle storm aspect of the game isn't just a case of it slowly killing you while you're outside it. By the time nightfall comes, you'll be forced into a very tiny circle, having to fend off some much tougher enemies.
</p>
<p>
You'll also find that this game's version of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-how-to-get-to-roundtable-hold">Roundtable Hold</a> looks a bit different. It's here where you'll equip relics that have different effects. Just your usual stat buffs and improved skills kind of things from the looks of it, but it wasn't a particularly comprehensive look. 
</p>
<p>
There's an in-game currency called murk that lets you buy different outfits for the preset characters, so there'll be some amount of customisation at the very least. And yes, there is a Solaire of Astora costume, amongst references to other characters too. My favourite's the hunter outfit from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, which won't be a surprise to anyone that knows me.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, despite not being able to make your own character, you can find something called fragments which unlock bits of the respective Nightfarers' backstory. And, of course, there's proper boss fights if you make it to the third day in a session. Wouldn't be a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> without boss fights!
</p>
<p>
I'm still not entirely convinced by Nightreign as a concept, it's a smart way to reuse assets that's for sure. I just prefer my FromSoft games to be a little bit more handcrafted. Still, I'll keep my mouth shut until May 30th, when the game launches.

<p>In the Beginning includes 18 new puzzles for fans to solve, with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fhow-to%2Fthe-talos-principle-reawakened-in-the-beginning-subway-escape-puzzle-guide%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2806640%2Fview%2F519709875052217858%3Fl%3Denglish&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=49867ab213c4ee089d653e284f7a2968&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">16 of those puzzles</a> being made by fans who collaborated with Croteam on the expansion. So it's no surprise that these are some of the most difficult puzzles to solve in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>
<p>This guide will take you through how to solve the Castle puzzle in the expansion, one of the more complicated puzzles. If you don't want the whole solution, and just want a hint, then the best hint I can give is that you need to make lasers fly.</p>
<p>If you want the full solution, keep reading.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Castle Puzzle Guide</h2>
<h3>Phase One - Gather all the pieces</h3>
<p>When you enter the Castle puzzle area, you'll notice that the tetromino is on an elevated platform that you can only reach by a fan directly underneath it, and that you'll need to get both a red and blue laser to the nodes on either side of this elevated platform to reach the tetromino.</p>
<p>To do that, you first need all the pieces you'll need. Basically, this puzzle is one part gather the pieces, the other part execution.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Start by grabbing the fan off the vent below where you fly up to the tetromino, and place the fan on the pressure switch directly in front of you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;With the fan on the pressure switch, you'll be able to reach the first connector (C1). Connect it to the red node and red laser generator that you can see through the window, and the red node on the wall behind you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan from the pressure switch, and use the fan that's activated to fly yourself (with the first fan in hand) over the gate and into the walled-off area with a deactivated fan vent and a second connector (C2).</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the fan on the vent to activate it, grab the connector and use it to get back across to the other room, without having to pass through the purple forcefield between them.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Bring C2 into the main puzzle area, and grab the fan you used to fly yourself over the gate the first time, and place it on the first pressure switch you activated. Now you're free to grab C1 and carry it to the center puzzle area, so that you have two connectors and a fan at your disposal.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the fan, and place it on the pressure switch on the left side of the center puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and connect it to the red laser generator that's on the left side of the puzzle area, and place it down on the pressure switch on the right side of the puzzle area. Connect it to the red node in the room on the right side of the puzzle area to clear the path to a box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up the box and bring it to the center puzzle area.&nbsp;Place the box on the pressure switch on the left side of the puzzle area (removing the fan first) and using C1, connect it to the blue laser generator on the right side of the puzzle area and the blue node on the left side of the puzzle area. Place C1 on top of the box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the red laser generator, and the red node that's hidden behind the shield you're deactivating with the blue lasers to release the third connector (C3). Bring the third connector into the center puzzle area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you nearly have all the components you need. All that's left is the box stuck behind a shield on the right side of the center puzzle area, with a red and blue node on either side to deactivate it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Take the box off the pressure switch, and replace it with C1. Connect C1 to the red laser generator.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the blue laser generator, and the blue node in the center puzzle area on the right side.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C3 and connect it to C1 and the red node on the other side of the shield. Place C3 on top of the box, making sure the box is somewhere that you can angle C3 to hit C1 and the red node.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>If you've done it correctly, your laser layout will look something like this.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the second box and bring it to the center puzzle area. You should now have two boxes, three connectors, and a fan at your disposal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two - Make the lasers fly</h3>
<p>Now you have all the components, you're ready to make the lasers fly.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab one box, head up the stairs on the right side of the center puzzle area and place it in front of the fan underneath the blue node. Do the same with the other box on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1, and connect it to the blue laser generator, the blue node above the box, and the blue node that deactivates the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. Place it on top of the box under the blue node when you're done.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the fan, and place it on the pressure switch on the right side of the room. Grab C3 and connect it to C1 and the blue laser generator. Make sure the angles are set, and when you place C3 down, you should see the box and C1 on top of it flying back and forth.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C2 and connect it to the red laser generator, the red node above the box, and the red node that deactivates the shield blocking the way to the tetromino. Place it on the box when you're done.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick the fan back up, and place it on the pressure switch on the left side of the puzzle area. Grab C3 and connect it to C2 and the red laser generator. Again, ensuring the angels are right, when you place C3 down, the box and C2 should be flying back and forth.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Now you can pick up the fan, and place it down on the vent just below the elevated platform where the tetromino is.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Fly up to where the tetromino is, and the shield will be deactivated, letting you grab the tetromino to solve the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's how you solve the Castle puzzle in The Talos Principle: Reawakened's new In the Beginning expansion. A few of the steps can be done differently, but it all leads to the same final shape. At least, I think it does. Let me know if you figured out a different solution.</p>

            <p>As fans come to terms with the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> delay - from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1kd7oq8/i_built_a_gta_6_countdown_website_because_therapy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">creating countdowns "that are cheaper than therapy"</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1kdp5pp/i_think_we_need_to_calm_ourselves_about_the_delay/">pleas to "calm ourselves"</a> - at least one person is delighted by the news: Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 actor, Luke Dale.</p>
<p>Dale, who portrayed Hans Capon in the game, took a glass-half view on the delay, writing on X/Twitter: "WE'RE IN WITH A SHOT! GOTY!", appending the hashtag #KCD2.</p>

<figcaption>Here's Eurogamer's Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAljLcUMomM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>You see, while players have been salivating for the next instalment of the universally-acclaimed series - so much so that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick acknowledged the fervor for GTA 6 is "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-date-is-still-secret-because-take-two-boss-wants-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-excitement">the greatest anticipation [he's] ever seen for an entertainment property</a>" - developers and publishers of other games targeting a similar release window were understandably worried about accidentally butting up against GTA 6's launch. Even Gearbox's Randy Pitchford was forced to strenuously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-not-the-reason-for-borderlands-4-release-date-change-randy-pitchford-insists">deny that bringing Borderlands 4's release date forward</a> had anything to do with GTA 6 (which turned out to be true).</p>
<p>And of course, Luke Dale is <em>not</em> the only person in the games industry to have puffed out a sigh of relief yesterday - he just chose to do so publicly. The silver lining now is that games that have already released in 2025 - and those that had been holding back on solidifying release dates until  GTA 6'a launch was confirmed - can feel more confident about securing an accolade or two in award ceremonies or best games of 2025 lists (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/with-gta-6-delayed-to-2026-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-star-celebrates-were-in-with-a-shot-to-win-game-of-the-year-2025/">GamesRadar+</a>).</p> <div>

<p>We gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 three out of five stars</a>, writing: "This gorgeous medieval RPG continues to be just as divisive, prickly and abrasive as its predecessor."</p>
<p>Following a hugely successful launch that saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hits-1m-sales-in-just-one-day">over 1m people snapping up Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in just 24 hours</a>, developer Warhorse Studios continues to plug away at its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-post-launch-roadmap-bringing-barbers-horse-riding-and-more">post-release roadmap</a>, mostly recently adding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-gets-mod-support-a-barber-shop-and-over-a-thousand-fixes-and-improvements">mod support, a barber shop, and "over a thousand" fixes and improvements</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">Rockstar announced it was delaying the launch of GTA 6 to 2026</a>. The highly-anticipated sequel will now arrive for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May 2026. Rockstar's confirmation of a delay follows months of speculation over whether the game would still make its 2025 launch window, despite assurances from Take-Two that the game was still on track.</p>
<p>No other information was announced by Rockstar at the time. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">Rockstar released GTA 6's first - and so far only - look at the game back in December 2023</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It seems like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is doing quite alright for itself, 'ey? The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">J'RPG</a> was awarded Rock Paper Shotgun's coveted Bestest Bests badge by our own Nic in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">review</a>, and by all accounts it's been received well by most everyone else too. Not that sales matter much in terms of a game's quality, but the fact that it's done well there as well at minimum means the lights are staying on at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/sandfall-interactive">Sandfall Interactive</a>. In fact it seems things are going better than just keeping the lights on, as it sounds like the developer is considering more of it, whatever that might be.

<p>
Earlier this week, screenshots of a conversation with the game's lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen on Instagram were shared on <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/chances-for-clair-obscure-expedition-33-dlc-are-good.1683512/">NeoGAF</a>, where she was asked if there's plans for any Clair Obscur DLC (cheers, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dlc-has-a-good-chance-of-happening-according-to-games-lead-writer/">Vice</a>). Unsurprisingly, Svedberg-Yen said that as of now, there's "nothing concrete that I can say at the moment, we're honestly still just trying to process everything that's happening. It's been a lot to take in!"
</p>
<p>
The interesting bit followed that though, as Svedberg-Yen continued, "we've always said if there is a strong desire from the players that we would love to do something more, and based on the responses so far, I'd say chances are good." Now, that's obviously not a confirmation of any kind. It's not even the writer saying that there'll be DLC necessarily, just that there's hopes to do more, so it's still probably best to temper your expectations.
</p>
<p>
Still, it's nice to see an underdog do so well, especially in such a busy week for RPGs. Personally I'd love to see some DLC where they pop across the border to Germany, if only to have someone put a JRPG there.

            <p>MiHoYo has just dropped a new teaser giving us our first peek at the "brand new" Honkai game on the way.</p>
<p>Developer MiHoYo announced the news in a livestream, and while it didn't get very much away at all - not even a name at this point - the developer urged players to "stay tuned" in a 20-second teaser showing the familiar faces of Kiana, Blade, and what looks like, but is not confirmed to be, Pokémon-esque or monster collecting gameplay.</p>

"I think it’s called Honkai: Nexus Anima. In an investor briefing, they recently showed that GGZ, HI3, HSR are all under the Honkai IP, separate from Genshin/ZZZ/ToT which are their own IPs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Take a deep breath and remember: Delays are good.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">OK, that statement isn’t <em>always</em> true, but it usually is. Delayed projects sometimes result in bad games (looking at you, Duke Nukem 3D), but much more often taking more time produces good stuff. Spending meticulous weeks to get something just right matters in art, as does finding the bravery to throw out ideas that seemed wise in concept but never panned out. Think about how many half-finished games you’ve ever bought and played and then wished the publisher had just delayed until it was right and ready. Got that thought in your head? OK, hold onto it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>GTA 6</u></a> is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026"><u>delayed</u></a>, and that’s good, because it will probably be better for the delay. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has a long history of delaying games to make sure they’re ready for market, a strikingly consistent bit of discipline that places them alongside Nintendo in an elite fraternity of studios that wait until the casserole is fully cooked before serving. And boy, is it always delicious. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been playing GTA games as long as they’ve been around, starting with four-player PC GTA LAN parties. I’ve played the most obscure (London 1969), the best (GTA V), and the true best (Chinatown Wars for DS). I’ve ransacked and crashed and shot my way through these goofy, wonderful worlds for decades. And thankfully, these games are practically always late... and not coincidentally, always great. Here’s every delay in GTA history (and some Red Dead too). </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Grand Theft Auto III </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar’s New York offices were located only a few blocks from the World Trade Center, and Take Two didn’t waste any time briefly delaying GTA III following the September 11 attacks. . Marketing VP Terry Donovan <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/09/19/take-two-examines-changes-fall-games"><u>announced the delay</u></a> only days after the tragedy: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our decision is based on two factors, firstly it has been a little difficult to get work done in downtown Manhattan in the last week since basic communications infrastructure has been intermittent at best, and secondly we felt that a full content review of all our titles and the marketing materials we use to represent them was absolutely necessary for us in light of the horrifying event we all witnessed in the United States last week.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: "As for Grand Theft Auto, since the game is so huge the review is no short process. So far we have come across certain small contextual references that we were no longer comfortable with, as well as a couple of very rare gameplay instances that no longer felt appropriate to us. We apologize to you and all the people waiting for this game to ship for the delays that have now ensued, but I'm sure you can understand our reasoning. Rest assured the game will be phenomenal...and you can expect it to hit shelves in late October.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with only minimal content changes, the delay was a wise decision for Rockstar and players alike. Blasting cops and ambulances in Liberty City so soon after the violent deaths of thousands wouldn’t have been appealing to anybody.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The co-prize for shortest delay is shared between Vice City and San Andreas. Back in the olden days before downloadable game stores and day-one patches, manufacturers guessed ahead of time just how much of a physical product they’d need to produce for a given shelf date, and sometimes they guessed wrong. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-delayed/1100-2879482/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rockstar delayed Vice City</u></a> by seven days to give them time to manufacture more discs (and thus meet the tremendous day-one demand for a GTA III follow-up). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">San Andreas for PS2 also hit streets a week later than planned, a<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/news100904sanandreas" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> strategic decision designed to give the dev team a few extra days to polish their two-year project.</u></a> </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Celebrity in GTA: San Andreas</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories and Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, so real talk: The GTA handheld games go hard... hard enough that it’s worth dusting off your ancient PlayStation Portable or DS to try them. GTA’s excellent forays onto portables usually arrive on time, but Vice City Stories for PSP <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011211856/https://www.gtaportable.com/news/6228/vice-city-stories-delayed-globally" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>was delayed for two weeks</u></a> in North America, and longer in parts of Europe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best GTA of them all (fight me!) didn’t arrive precisely on time. The incredibly creative and intricate DS gamechit shelves <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-delays-gta-chinatown-wars" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>two months later</u></a> than expected. When it did finally arrive, it blew the socks off of critics, and it’s one of gaming’s great tragedies that nobody bought it... we might be playing Chinatown Wars 3 on our new Switch 2s right now if they had.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Grand Theft Auto IV </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After GTA III changed the landscape of video games, anticipation for GTA IV was palpable. With clunky RenderWare left behind and a brand new console generation to work with, Rockstar Leeds was aiming for the stratosphere. Bringing their vision to reality ultimately demanded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/02/grand-theft-auto-iv-delayed"><u>several months of delay</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Rockstar’s Sam Hause explained, “The new consoles [PS3 and 360] are allowing us to create the Grand Theft Auto game we always dreamed about. Every aspect of the game and its design has been completely transformed. The game is huge and is pushing the hardware platforms to their absolute limits. The top engineers from Sony and Microsoft are working closely with the team in Edinburgh right now, helping us to fully leverage the power of both platforms. As always, our goal is to surpass even the wildest expectations of the game's fans, and to create the ultimate high definition video game experience."</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest console game of all time was a long time coming. GTA V finally landed in September 2013, but was originally anticipated to arrive in the spring of that same year. But in late January 2013, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/31/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-a-september-release-date"><u>Rockstar released the following</u></a> message:  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know this is about four months later than originally planned and we know that this short delay will come as a disappointment to many of you, but, trust us, it will be worth the extra time. GTAV is a massively ambitious and complex game and it simply needs a little more polish to be of the standard we and, more importantly, you require. ‘To all Grand Theft Auto fans, please accept our apologies for the delay, and our promise that the entire team here is working very hard to make the game all it can be. We are doing all we can to help ensure it will meet if not exceed your expectations come September – we thank you for your support and patience.’"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They weren't wrong. GTA V went on to become the most successful console game of all time, and alongside RDR2, it’s a true jewel in Rockstar’s crown.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/05/reddeadredemption-performancereview-blogroll-2-1730827905085.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of RDR2... it’s not a part of the GTA series, but it is Rockstar’s best game and I love talking about it. In keeping with the tradition of Rockstar quality-based delays, we’re adding a bit of an appendix by mentioning Red Dead Redemption 2, which was delayed twice, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/25o24118133518/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-Is-Now-Coming-Spring-2018?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=newswire&amp;utm_content=rdr2-05222017" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>first in spring 2017</u></a> for quality assurance purposes. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/01/red-dead-redemption-2-delayed-to-october"><u>second delay</u></a> came in February 2018, pushing RDR2 to late October. The statement from Rockstar explained that, again, this was a quality issue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are excited to announce that Red Dead Redemption 2 will be released on October 26th 2018. We apologize to everyone disappointed by this delay. While we had hoped to have the game out sooner, we require a little extra time for polish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We sincerely thank you for your patience and hope that when you get to play the game, you will agree the wait will have been worth it. In the meantime, please check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/01/red-dead-redemption-2-delayed-to-october"><u>these screenshots</u></a> from the game. We look forward to sharing a lot more information with you in the coming weeks."  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That delay, like all the others here, worked out swimmingly, delivering a true work of art still unparalleled in adventure gaming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So friends, don’t despair. GTA 6 will come, and when it comes, it will almost certainly be very, very good. See you in Vice City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jared Petty is a former IGN editor who likes writing about how wonderful and silly video games are.

<p>EA announced the end of its partnership with the World Rally Championship earlier this week. At the time, it was not clear if - or how many - members of the Codemasters team had been impacted.</p>

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/codemasters-confirms-layoffs-as-ea-owned-studio-shifts-focus-away-from-beloved-rally-games/">VGC</a>, EA again did not confirm the number of its colleagues affected, but did acknowledge: “As a business, we are constantly evolving to meet the growing needs of our players and driving greater focus across our portfolio.</p>
<p>"This has led us to look at reducing some roles, while we redeploy as many as possible against our strategic priorities," the statement concluded.</p>
<p>EA's decision to end its WRC partnership follows its announcement last year - made as it laid off 670 employees - that it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">moving away from "future licensed IP"</a> toward its "owned IP, sports, and massive online communities".</p>
<p>The WRC news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-lays-off-over-300-employees-cancels-new-titanfall-game">followed yet more layoffs at EA</a>, reportedly affecting "between 300 and 400" employees who also lost their jobs earlier this week.

<p>In comparison, competitor Steam - much like other digital stores like the Nintendo eShop - takes around 30 percent, although Valve's store revised its Steam Distribution Agreement and revenue share tiers back in 2018 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-revises-revenue-share-policy-to-let-big-game-developers-keep-more-of-their-profits">so developers can keep more of the profits of their most successful games</a>, taking 30 percent on the first $10 million of revenues earned, 25 percent from $10 million onwards, and 20 percent on any revenue over $50 million.</p>
<p>But that's not the only seismic change, either.</p>
<p>"We’re making some exciting updates to the Epic Games Store to provide an even better deal for developers, starting in June," Epic announced in a <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update">brief statement</a>.</p>
<p>"In June 2025, we are releasing a new feature enabling developers to launch their own webshops hosted by the Epic Games Store. These webshops can offer players out-of-app purchases, as a more cost-effective alternative to in-app purchases, where Apple, Google, and others charge exorbitant fees.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Epic Games Store will take 0% on the first $1,000,000 of payments we process per game per year (vs 15% for Apple), and 12% after that (vs 30% for Apple).</p><p>Next month, we launch EGS Webshops for out-of-app purchases, as an alternative to in-app purchases.<a href="https://t.co/yTufyZbiqR">https://t.co/yTufyZbiqR</a></p></div>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917973199309987970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>"With new legal rulings in place, developers will be able to send players from games to make digital purchases from webshops on any platform that allows it, including iOS in the European Union and United States."</p>
<p>To sweeten the deal, player spend accrued in Epic "Webshops" will also receive five percent Epic Rewards on their purchases.</p>
<p>The changes come after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-updates-app-store-guidelines-in-wake-of-seismic-judgement-paving-way-for-fortnites-return">Apple formally updated its App Store guidelines to reflect the dramatic decision</a> laid down by a US judge around alternative app store payments. In a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">fiery injunction passed this week</a>, Apple was told it could no longer dissuade app makers from offering other payment methods by applying a 27 percent commission on their proceeds. The move allows apps and games to offer direct - and potentially cheaper - options for in-app purchases, at least in the US.</p>
<p>In February, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-store-has-more-pc-players-than-ever-295-million-in-fact">Epic revealed 295 million PC players had used Epic Games Store in the last year,</a> up 25 million from 2023, and 898 million are using Epic cross-platform accounts - that's up 94m. Together, we've run up 7.72bn hours of playtime.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/reviews/658137/gigabyte-aorus-master-16-gaming-laptop-rtx-5080-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is a gaming laptop, and it sure looks like one. It’s an inch thick, weighs 5.5 pounds, and is awash in RGB lighting, stylized text, and curved plastic. </p><p>This Aorus Master offers powerful hardware and a lovely high-res, high-refresh OLED display. It’s the first of several laptops we’re reviewing with the GeForce RTX 5080, Nvidia’s second-fastest laptop graphics card of this generation. At $3,100, it’s actually a few hundred dollars less than similarly powerful models from Razer, Lenovo, and Asus, and over a thousand dollars less than laptops with the RTX 5090, Nvidia’s fastest GPU.</p><p>But in exchange for being a little cheaper than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336394/asus-rog-strix-scar-16-18-specs-price-ces-2025">its direct competitors</a>, the Aorus Master <em>feels</em> a little cheap, and its built-in software includes a useless AI chatbot but no custom fan controls. And those fans get <em>loud</em>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->3100</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Very good game performance from the RTX 5080 GPU</li><li>Lovely 2.5K 240Hz OLED display</li><li>Slightly less expensive than other 5080 competitors</li><li>Solid port selection</li><li>User-replaceable RAM and SSDs</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Fans can get distractingly loud</li><li>Meager battery life</li><li>Plasticky build</li><li>Included 1TB SSD storage is a little slow</li><li>GiMate software is clunky and bad, and its AI chatbot is even worse</li></ul></div></div></div><p>Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review">Razer Blade 16</a>, the Aorus Master 16 comes with a 16-inch 2560 x 1600 OLED display. The Aorus’s panel isn’t quite as accurate as the Blade’s — with <em>slightly </em>lower color reproduction — but it’s just as bright and about as pleasing to the eye in regular use. It’s got punchy colors that aren’t oversaturated, and its 2.5K resolution and maximum 240Hz refresh rate enable games, websites, and videos to look sharp and smooth.</p><div><div><p id="component-report-card"><h2><strong>Component report card:</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Screen:</strong> A</span></li><li><span><strong>Webcam:</strong> C</span></li><li><span><strong>Mic: </strong>C</span></li><li><span><strong>Keyboard:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Touchpad:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Port selection:</strong> B</span></li><li><span><strong>Speakers:</strong> C</span></li><li><span><strong>Number of ugly stickers to remove:</strong> 2</span></li></ul></div></div><p>By contrast, the plastic screen bezel is a bit ugly, and the Aorus Master as a whole isn’t much of a looker. Its plasticky build feels dated and a little low-rentcheap compared to the more grown-up-looking Lenovo Legion Pro 7i or the all-out RGB bombast of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336394/asus-rog-strix-scar-16-18-specs-price-ces-2025">Asus’ ROG Strix Scar</a>, with its wraparound light bar and animated LED matrix on the lid. The lid of the Aorus opens easily with one hand, but the screen can wobble. And the diagonal-line designs in its vents and branding across its trackpad look cheesy. It has “Team up. Fight on” written on the lid for some reason, and it even projects the Aorus wordmark below the rear exhaust fans, which is as gauche here as it is on the <a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/the-ten-most-ridiculous-car-design-details-1743426644/#:~:text=2.)%20Door%20Projector%20Puddle%20Lights">doors of luxury cars</a>.</p><p>While I’ll poke fun at the Aorus’ tryhard design, Gigabyte gets credit for focusing on what counts: the screen, GPU, CPU, ports, and even user-upgradeable RAM and storage. The keyboard and trackpad are solid, with good tactile feedback. The keyboard has a 1.7mm key travel and the trackpad, while a little loud, easily clicks even near its top hinge. </p><div id=":R29dlhr96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The right side ports include USB-A, USB-C, headphone jack, and microSD slot.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>On the left are power (barrel plug), ethernet, HDMI, USB-A, and Thunderbolt 5</em>.</figcaption></p></div></div><p>The 1080p webcam, built-in mics, and speakers aren’t anything special, but you’ll get through video calls looking and sounding fine in most lighting. The speakers sound decently full for music, but dialog is flat. It can be slightly difficult to clearly hear spoken lines in games against loud music and sound effects, especially since you’ll also be competing with the Aorus’ fans.</p><p>Fan noise is my biggest hangup with the laptop. In graphically intensive games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/617587/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-xbox-steam"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a> or <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1749860%2FLushfoil_Photography_Sim%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Lushfoil Photography Sim</em></a> it’s loud and irritating enough that you find yourself cranking the game volume or reaching for a pair of headphones.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The keyboard only has three-zone RGB lighting instead of per-key customization, but the see-though WASD and adjacent keys are fun.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>My wife is used to hearing the fans of gaming laptops in our shared home office, but at one point the Aorus made her turn to me and say, “What the hell is going on over there?”</p><p>I was playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649795/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-release-date"><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a> on a 4K external monitor, and the fans were audible even in the next room, especially during initial shader compiling. At peak rpm, they sound like someone running a small vacuum cleaner across the room. The fans on the Razer Blade 16 and ROG Strix Scar 16 are noticeably quieter and less annoying.</p><div id=":R3pdlhr96:"><div><div><p><figcaption><em>Always be teaming. Always be fighting.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The holographic nameplate is one of three Aorus brandings on the keyboard deck and screen bezel.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The front-facing light bar has three-zone RGB and the rear-facing has two zones of color.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>And unlike Razer Synapse or Asus Armoury Crate, Gigabyte’s GiMate software doesn’t let you tweak the fan curves, only choose between four presets. Switching the laptop from game mode to balanced, and the fans from performance to normal can cut the noise a bit with minimal sacrifice to framerates. Though, even in this mode, the fans can still go loud when necessary. And turbo mode is solely for masochists; it pegs the fans at 100 percent the whole time.</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>System</h3></th><th><h3>Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 / RTX 5080 / Core Ultra 9 275HX / 32GB / 1TB</h3></th><th><h3>Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 / RTX 5080 / Core Ultra 9 275HX / 32GB / 2TB</h3></th><th><h3>Razer Blade 16 (2025) / RTX 5090 / Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 / 32GB / 2TB</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Geekbench 6 CPU Single</td><td>3051</td><td>3113</td><td>2968</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 CPU Multi</td><td>19334</td><td>19709</td><td>15922</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 GPU (OpenCL)</td><td>197539</td><td>200189</td><td>213016</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Single</td><td>136</td><td>137</td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Multi</td><td>1955</td><td>1965</td><td>1287</td></tr><tr><td>PugetBench for Premiere Pro</td><td>13416</td><td>13409</td><td>12593</td></tr><tr><td>PugetBench for Photoshop</td><td>8648</td><td>8482</td><td>8679</td></tr><tr><td>Sustained SSD reads (MB/s)</td><td>4802.21</td><td>6832.06</td><td>6726.25</td></tr><tr><td>Sustained SSD writes (MB/s)</td><td>3893.34</td><td>6550.21</td><td>4931.41</td></tr><tr><td>3DMark Time Spy</td><td>20520</td><td>20977</td><td>22498</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>GiMate’s other features are sparse, limited in scope, and worse than native solutions within Windows 11 and Nvidia’s GPU settings. Its operating modes are just shortcuts to Windows power settings. In some cases, GiMate simply opens Microsoft Copilot or Nvidia’s Control Panel and Broadcast App. But its interactions with other apps get even weirder when you unplug the charger and GiMate prompts you to switch to integrated graphics and kill apps it says are using the discrete GPU. This MUX switch functionality is already handled by Nvidia’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Frtx-laptops-advanced-optimus%2F" rel="sponsored">Advanced Optimus</a>, so I’m not sure why Gigabyte brute forces it this way.</p><p>The GiMate AI chatbot, another misfire, allegedly helps you optimize your laptop. I asked it to tell me the difference between Game Mode and Balanced, and it just enabled Game Mode. You can ask it to do basics like toggle Wi-Fi on or off, but it takes much longer than doing it yourself. That could be useful for someone unfamiliar with computers, but this is a gaming machine.</p><p>Bad software and noisy fans aside, the Aorus Master 16 is mostly a good performer. Its 24-core Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, RTX 5080 GPU, and 32GB of RAM easily handle multitasking across various productivity apps, though it can’t last more than six hours on charge, even using power saving mode. It did okay with some hefty photo editing, but on two occasions on battery power Lightroom Classic slowed to the point where I had to close and restart it — not ideal when you need to edit quickly.</p><p>In gaming performance, the Aorus Master is right in line with an Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 using the same CPU and GPU for $200 more. The Aorus Master is usually on par or a frame or two better in 4K and 2.5K benchmark tests of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. And like the Asus, that puts the Gigabyte within reach of the flagship RTX 5090 in the $4,500 Razer Blade 16. In our tests, the 5090 bested it by an average of just 3.5 fps without frame generation, and by up to 10 fps with frame generation. Those are pretty minimal differences, making the mobile 5080 a much better value — at least, compared to the Blade 16’s power-limited 5090. We haven’t yet tested a laptop with an uncapped 5090. </p><p>I averaged 143 fps in <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> on a 4K display with high settings and frame generation turned on in the game’s prologue. Turning off frame gen dropped it to an average of 99 fps. When I switched to ultra settings in the open world I saw an average of 50 fps without frame gen and 77 with. The one thing I couldn’t turn off was the incessant fan noise.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</strong><span><figcaption><em>The lid has a striped pattern across it that’s most visible when it catches the light.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>If you always play with headphones on, you can mitigate the Gigabyte’s biggest issue. But while the Aorus Master 16 is one of the cheapest 5080 laptops, there are plenty of interesting competitors for just a little more. The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nr0ld1-m005n0-rog-strix-scar-16-2025.html" rel="sponsored">Asus ROG Strix Scar 16</a>, for example, looks cooler and has quieter fans; the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/omen-max-gaming-laptop-16-ah0097nr" rel="sponsored">HP Omen Max</a> and<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1875949-REG%2Flenovo_83f50052us_16_legion_pro_7.html" rel="sponsored"> Lenovo Legion Pro 7i</a> both have OLED screens like the Gigabyte. I think I still prefer the Gigabyte’s OLED to the Asus’ Mini LED, but I need to spend more time with the Asus before making that call. I’ll also be testing the Lenovo and HP; their OLED screens could make them closer competitors to the Gigabyte.</p><p>There’s a lot to like in the Aorus Master 16, but it’s not as easy to love. Its powerful hardware and brilliant OLED display are a treat to game on, but the lackluster GiMate software, basic build quality, and at times maddening fan noise feels like someone knocking the ice cream cone from your hand right after you get it.</p><div><div><p id="2025-gigabyte-aorus-master-16-specs-as-reviewed"><h2>2025 Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 specs (as reviewed)</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Display: </strong>16-inch (2560 x 1600) 240Hz OLED</span></li><li><span><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX</span></li><li><span><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia RTX 5080</span></li><li><span><strong>RAM:</strong> 32GB DDR5 5600MHz (user-replaceable)</span></li><li><span><strong>Storage:</strong> 1TB M.2 PCIe Gen 5 NVMe (with one extra Gen 4 slot)</span></li><li><span><strong>Webcam:</strong> 1080p, Windows Hello</span></li><li><span><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4</span></li><li><span><strong>Ports:</strong> 2x USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, 1x Thunderbolt 5 USB-C (left side), 1x Thunderbolt 4 USB-C (right side), HDMI 2.1, RJ-45 ethernet, microSD slot (UHS-II), 3.5mm combo audio jack, DC power</span></li><li><span><strong>Weight:</strong> 5.5 pounds</span></li><li><span><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 14.01 x 10 x 0.91 — 1.18 inches</span></li><li><span><strong>Battery:</strong> 99Wh</span></li><li><span><strong>Price:</strong> $3,099.99</span></li></ul></div></div><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/660635/polygon-valnet-vox-media-new-owner-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Polygon</em>, <em>The Verge’s</em> former sister site dedicated to covering gaming and entertainment, is now owned by Valnet, a company that owns more than 27 different brands covering gaming, entertainment, sports, travel, and more. The transition is, let’s say, <em>ongoing: </em>a day after the acquisition, the site still said it was a Vox Media property, and the site’s coverage continued more or less uninterrupted. </p><p>But Valnet has indeed acquired <em>Polygon</em>, so to learn more about the deal, why the company acquired it, and the future of the site, I got on the phone with Valnet’s head of mergers and acquisitions, Rony Arzoumanian.</p><p>Polygon is a “triple-A gaming brand” that Valnet has been of “high interest” for “some time,” Arzoumanian said. Valnet’s gaming portfolio also includes <em>GameRant</em>, <em>TheGamer</em>, <em>Fextralife</em>, <em>DualShockers</em>, <em>Hardcore Gamer</em>, and <em>OpenCritic</em>. Arzoumanian said the company is “bullish” on gaming coverage. </p><div><p>“We think Polygon has a lot of potential and could be much more.”</p></div><p>Valnet initiated the <em>Polygon</em> deal, and Arzoumanian said the conversations started a “few months ago.” He declined to share the terms of the deal. </p><p>Going forward, Valnet wants to ensure that <em>Polygon</em> has the “deepest” coverage of the gaming space, Arzoumanian said. He declined to share specific coverage expectations, but said Valnet will “do what’s right for <em>Polygon</em>” and that “we think <em>Polygon</em> has a lot of potential and could be much more.” </p><p>Around 10 existing <em>Polygon</em> staffers are moving over to the site’s new owner, Arzoumanian said. Matt Patches, who was previously <em>Polygon’s</em> executive editor, is heading things up for now. Valnet is also “rebuilding” the team, investing in its operations, and making sure it builds <em>Polygon</em> “for the next five to ten years,” according to Arzoumanian.</p><p>Valnet wants to recruit “triple-A” writers and editors for <em>Polygon</em>, Arzoumanian said. When I asked about what the balance might be of full-time hires and contractors, Arzoumanian deferred on specifics, but said “we will do it right.” Arzoumanian also deferred on whether <em>Polygon</em> would hire another editor-in-chief, saying that right now, the focus is on ensuring continuity following the close of the deal.</p><p>The sale resulted in most of <em>Polygon’s</em> staff leaving or being laid off, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social/post/3lo4mn4noqc26">former editor-in-chief Chris Plante</a>. Chris Grant, Vox Media’s group publisher of <em>The Verge</em> and formerly <em>Polygon</em>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/charstring.com/post/3lo56isadnc2g">said that</a> “Valnet literally refused to meet with me or answer a single question of mine throughout this process.” (It all added to what turned into a brutal day for gaming journalism, which also included the news of <a href="https://kotaku.com/giant-bomb-fandom-dan-ryckert-jeff-grubb-gerstmann-1851778728">Fandom’s changes for <em>Giant Bomb</em></a>.)</p><p>I asked Arzoumanian about Grant’s post, reading him the part of the sentence I quoted above and asking if it was true. Arzoumanian said that Valnet “predominantly dealt” with Jim Bankoff, Vox Media’s CEO, and that “I’m not in a position to answer that, unfortunately.”</p><p>Valnet plans to keep <em>Polygon’s</em> archives available, Arzoumanian said, meaning we won’t see a repeat of GameStop’s Thanos-snap disappearance <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/3/24212291/game-informer-video-game-industry-mourns">of <em>Game Informer’s</em> archives</a>. (<em>Game Informer</em>, fortunately, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">is back now</a>.) When I asked if Valnet plans to introduce AI-generated stories onto <em>Polygon</em>, which has been a disconcerting trend <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158531/gannett-ai-generated-overviews-usa-today-memo">at other publications</a>, Arzoumanian said, “not at all.”</p><p>I also asked if Valnet more broadly is making changes in response to a recent report about Valnet <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/">from <em>TheWrap</em></a>, which included an allegation from one former contributor about “almost sweatshop-level” working conditions at a Valnet publication. Arzoumanian pointed me to Valnet’s press release about <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250425504752/en/Valnet-Inc.-and-its-CEO-File-Lawsuit-Against-The-Wrap-News-Inc.-for-Defamation-Unfair-Competition-and-Other-Illegal-Actions">its recent defamation lawsuit</a> filed against <em>TheWrap.</em></p><p>A year from now, Arzoumanian said he doesn’t expect things to be that different. Valnet wants to maintain course and keep investing in the brand. He deferred to the operations side of Valnet on whether the company wants <em>Polygon</em> to switch to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/9/4/17689100/polygon-reviews-no-scores">scored reviews.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ubisoft has nine Assassin's Creed games currently in development, according to a new report published by Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-further-details-on-the-assassins-creed-roadmap-and-what-games-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Insider Gaming</a>.</p>
<p>We have been aware of at least four for a while.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-jade-mobile-gameplay-leaked-on-reddit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jade</a>, the mobile game set in Ancient China, is one of only two officially announced</span>. There hasn't been any news on this title for at least two years, but Henderson says it'll be the next franchise entry to make its debut.</p>
<p>Then there's Invictus, the Fall Guys-style multiplayer spin-off. Last month, the same insider <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-invictus-an-arcade-multiplayer-game-rumored-to-launch-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> this game would launch in 2025. Today, he added that Ubisoft is prepared to support it for at least five years post-launch, provided it sells according to internal estimates.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a> (codenamed Obsidian) should launch around the same time, so we could be playing it in late 2025 or early 2026 at the latest.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Hexe is the other game on this list that Ubisoft has confirmed. As you might recall, a brief tease was <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-project-red-japan-project-hexe-witchcraft-infinity-hub-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> during a Ubisoft Forward presentation in September 2022. This project is in development at Ubisoft Montréal and is led by Clint Hocking, a Ubisoft veteran who was the Creative Director of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, Far Cry 2, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/watch-dogs-legion-bold-gameplay-mild-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch Dogs: Legion</a>. It was officially described as a 'very different' franchise experience, and it does sound like it will be the next Mirage-like game. The current plan, says Henderson, is to launch it when Assassin's Creed Shadows ends its post-release support. This should happen in around two years, so Hexe could drop in 2027, with one year of planned post-launch support of its own.</p>
<p>The next big open-world Assassin's Creed RPG, codenamed Scarlet, has already entered production. Henderson speculates it might be Assassin's Creed Nebula, a game that should take place in three different settings: the Aztec Empire, India, and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The roadmap gets increasingly hazy from now on. Stardust is the codename of another remake, but there's no info on which game would be remade. Then there's Emerald, reportedly another multiplayer game with a five-year support plan. Emerald is expected to be released close to Stardust.</p>
<p>'RPG 3' is completely unknown at this point, except that it should launch after the usual two years of live support for Scarlet. Similarly, the report could not add anything about 'Remake 3' other than the fact that it will release around one year after RPG 3.</p>
<p>That will be many years from now. Meanwhile, Ubisoft has officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shares-year-one-roadmap-and-theres-no-mention-of-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the year one roadmap for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>

		<p>We might be coming to the end of this heatwave, but there’s still a little time to try and enjoy the last of this good weather through this bank holiday. Given that there’s the extra day (once again) to the weekend, there’s still plenty of time for gaming, and I’ve got a big long list of games big and small that I’ll be sinking time into.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>It was a busy old week for video games news, and while we had the gameplay deep dive for Borderlands 4, it was the GTA 6 delay that was the biggest story of the week. Thankfully, there’s still tons of big games for 2025, so it’s not like we won’t have plenty to look forward to through the rest of this year.</p>

			<p>According to insider Daniel Ritchman (as reported <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/naughty-dog-125394539?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_fan&amp;utm_content=web_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on his paywalled Patreon page</a>), Santa Monica-based developer Naughty Dog quietly canceled an unannounced single-player game earlier this year. The project had been in development for over a year following the cancellation of The Last of Us Online, the ambitious multiplayer game that was ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> because Naughty Dog did not want to turn into a live-service games studio (after Bungie explained to them what it would mean).</p>
<p>As you might remember, towards the latter end of its development, The Last of Us Online was being directed by Vinit Agarwal, who previously worked as Game Designer on Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, and The Last of Us Part II. He then moved on to this unannounced project, which was still in its infancy when it was canceled. Agarwal subsequently left Naughty Dog.</p>
<p>Again, according to Richtman, another unannounced single-player title is in the works at the studio. This one is further along in development, having started around three years ago. Its director is Shaun Escayg, who returned to Naughty Dog in April 2021 after a brief stint at Crystal Dynamics as the Director of the ill-fated Marvel's Avengers. Escayg was previously credited as the Lead Cinematic Animator on The Last of Us and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, and later directed Uncharted: The Lost Legacy.</p>
<p>There's no further information on this game, but we might learn something more concrete in the next couple of years, at least based on the usual development timeframe of a triple-A game. Of course, the main project at Naughty Dog remains Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a brand new sci-fi intellectual property <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2024. This action/adventure game is directed by Neil Druckmann, the company's president and the renowned creator of The Last of Us (and current executive producer on the HBO show). Druckmann recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it'll be a game where players will feel lonely, unlike most Naughty Dog titles, where the protagonist is accompanied by friends and teammates. Religion will be a central theme.</p>
<p>The game has no release date yet, but Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reckons</a> it won't launch before 2027. It will launch on PlayStation 5 and, presumably, on PC after a while.</p>
