			<p>One of the more surprising Nintendo Switch 2 features added to the new console is undoubtedly GameChat. Historically, Nintendo never put a lot of its focus on online communication between players, but this feature is looking to change that in a major way, allowing users to chat, share screens, and even share video (with the dedicated camera, purchased separately from the console).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Nintendo Switch 2 GameChat was designed partly as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, as confirmed by console producer Kouichi Kawamoto <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an official developer interview</a>:</p>
<p><em>Back then, we were using a video conferencing system to check the software we were developing with our team, but the screen-sharing function built into the video conferencing system only allowed us to share one gameplay screen at a time. So, we had each person place their game screen in front of their camera instead of their faces. When we did that, it felt like we were all in the same place, each bringing our own console to play the game together, which was a lot of fun. Based on this experience, we proposed adding a feature to the Nintendo Switch 2 where people can share their gameplay screen with other players.</em></p>
<p>Now, we've learned that GameChat will also support live subtitles (it will transcribe what everyone is saying) and text-to-speech, which is great news as those are excellent accessibility options to have. You can check out those features in action below.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:tf7tjgkrqwai2kbxpx2dbr6k/app.bsky.feed.post/3lpevyywrvw2p" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreib7bn352szlugn7q2nbxwjjulaqbfgt7smjji4hew4jnohedcsace">
<p>[Switch 2]GameChat supports live subtitles. The system can transcribe what everyone is saying and display it in a "chat box" on screen.</p>

<p>[Switch 2]GameChat supports text-to-speech. If enabled, you can type in text and the system will read it for you.While not explicitly confirmed, USB keyboards should be supported too (the Switch 1 already supports them for text input).</p>

<p>Of course, there's a high chance those will only be available as long as you have access to GameChat. As a reminder, the voice communication (activated when you press the new C button on the Joy-Con 2 controller) will only be free to use until March 31, 2026; after that date, it will remain available to active Nintendo Switch Online membership subscribers.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is just a couple of weeks away from its launch. Keep in mind, though, that Nintendo isn't planning to allow pre-release reviews due to a day-one patch issue. As such, you might have to wait until later in June to get our opinion on the new console.</p>

            <p>About 30 minutes into the demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/we-harvest-shadows">We Harvest Shadows</a> a picture appeared on my wall, just by the farmhouse main entrance. The picture is of a long hallway of nested door frames, with a sealed door at the end. Any mystery it offers is, in theory, cancelled by the tutorials, which briskly informed me that the picture is, essentially, an alarm system. It will change in subtle and less subtle ways when danger is nearby. Still, this blunt advertisement of mechanical purpose does nothing to dispel the artefact's menace. It's right opposite the stairs, so that I can't avoid seeing it every morning unless I walk down the stairs backwards, and if I do that, I'm leaving myself vulnerable to anything else that might be waiting in the front hall or the kitchen to the right. </p><!--more-->

<p>I observe several picture changes during my time with the demo. By day, the tunnel of doors appears inverted, perhaps symbolising the subterranean retreat or Tarot-style reversal of whatever supernatural element it registers. Sometimes the door at the end of the tunnel is slightly ajar. And sometimes, the tunnel of doors is replaced by a glaring Rorschach rictus that is all the worse for the silence of its scream. The first time I saw the face in the picture, I had two thoughts: 1) gosh, it's getting late and I have work tomorrow, better wrap this up, and 2) the tutorial doesn't quite specify whether the picture itself might be the source of danger.</p>
<p>We Harvest Shadows, then: quite good fun. In this first-person blend of survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> and Stardewlike, you play Garrett - name very probably a reference to the psychic resonance of attics - a city worker who has randomly bought an abandoned farm in the boondocks and sealed himself off from society forever. Garrett has a lot of baggage, evidently, which is perhaps why he keeps seeing things in the woods. Still, he's a cheery soul, the kind of affable space cadet who says things like "mad skills, Garrett!" when he assembles a chicken coop.</p>
<p>The game follows a day-night cycle. By day, you complete tasks like picking tomatoes according to a to-do list on right controller bumper. You can sell miscellaneous junk and produce by dropping it on the trailer by the kitchen: the process by which said junk and produce is converted into dollars is left cheerfully unexplained, as is the sorcerous summoning of tools and construction recipes from the brochure on the table by the wall. The inexplicability of these things suggests both a shortage of development resources and a developer who is confident that their creation's atmosphere and themes can overpower a few bare fittings. Or possibly, make use of them. I reckon the confidence is justified, so far.</p>
<p>Everything on the to-do list needs to be completed before Garrett can go to bed, saving the game and ending the day. This promises to be a source of tension later on, because the sun rolls swiftly through the sky, and Garrett really doesn't want to be outside watering vegetables after dark. The game's paranormal entities run a gamut from scuttling mutants to giant, staring faces that remind me a little of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nix-umbra-review-occult-horror-at-its-most-focused-and-intense">Nix Umbra</a>. There are firearms, but this doesn't feel remotely like a shooter. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1559720/We_Harvest_Shadows/">The Steam page</a> cites A24 films, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pt">P.T.</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/what-remains-of-edith-finch">What Remains Of Edith Finch</a> as influences.</p>
<p>We Harvest Shadows is the work of David Wehle, crafter of charming fox 'em up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/555150/The_First_Tree/">The First Tree</a>. There's no release date yet. If you find the Steam demo tantalising, you might want to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1559720/view/503946642097963130?l=english">check out this blog about "the advanced dynamic horror system"</a>. If you're more enthused by the Appalachian farming elements, you may be reassured to hear that there's an "endless mode" in the works that sandboxes the story and dials back the spooks. I will conclude by saying that I found this sufficiently chilling that I'm glad I don't currently have any pictures hanging up in my flat.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

On Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Druckmann works with two game directors: Matthew Gallant and Kurt Margenau, and is co-writing the game with narrative director Claire Carré. Druckmann did not say which director is working on the second game, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s another game that’s being worked on at Naughty Dog where I am more of a producer role and I get to mentor and watch this other team and give feedback and be like the executive in the room,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I enjoy all those roles, and the fact I jump between one to the next, it makes my job very exciting and always feeling fresh. I’m never bored.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It is unclear at which stage each game is in production. Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is announced, so you’d imagine it’s further along. But what is the second game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some obvious candidates. Could it be The Last of Us 3? Druckmann has expressed his uncertainty in the past about being able to make the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/if-there-is-no-the-last-of-us-3-would-naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-keep-the-tv-show-going-past-the-games">but has said he has an ending in mind for what the game would be</a>. Based on Druckmann’s comments about having more of a producer role on this mystery second game, it doesn’t sound like it’s The Last of Us 3, as you’d imagine he’d want to be heavily involved and take on a director role for that game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alternatively, it could be another Uncharted game. There hasn’t been a brand new Uncharted game since 2017’s The Lost Legacy. Could it finally be time for a return? And there’s always a chance this second game could be a brand new intellectual property, as Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that there’s always a chance this second game never comes out, or is never properly revealed by Sony. Naughty Dog has endured a tumultuous time in recent years, with the cancelation of its The Last of Us multiplayer game to focus on single-player games coming amid an apparent pull-back of live service titles at Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward"><u>Naughty Dog stopped development on The Last of Us Online</u></a> in December 2023, saying it would have needed to put all its resources into post-launch content for years to come — an approach that would have severely impacted its ability to develop future single-player games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Historically, Naughty Dog has struggled to work on two big games at the same time, with one tending to end up top of the tree internally. The studio hasn’t released a brand new game since 2020’s The Last of Us 2, with remakes and collections in the interim.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/20/gettyimages-2208060751-1747724906242.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Neil Druckmann says Naughty Dog is working on a second game.

Mun, and Kumail Nanjiani of Marvel's Eternals as a man called Colin Graves. It is not expected to release until 2027 at the earliest. It’s a pretty long wait, but speaking to IGN on the red carpet ahead of The Last of Us Season 2 premiere, Druckmann said that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is not only playable right now, but “really good.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I will say we are playing it at the office and it's incredible,” Druckmann teased. “It's really good. I'm so excited to finally put gameplay out into the world and show people about it, because we just showed you the very, very, very tip on the iceberg.

            <p>Nintendo has partnered with Samsung to increase production of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> chips.</p>
<p>The partnership could mean Nintendo has enough stock to sell 20m consoles by March 2026, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/nintendo-turns-to-samsung-to-make-chips-ramp-up-switch-2-output">Bloomberg</a> has reported.</p>

<p>Samsung is aiming to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in producing chips across the world, and this partnership with Nintendo will certainly boost business.</p>
<p>Still, with increased chip supply, production will depend on the capacity of hardware assemblers such as Foxconn Technology Group.</p>
<p>Further, Samsung is reportedly pushing for OLED panels in a potential Switch 2 hardware refresh. The Korean firm already supplies flash memory and OLED screens for the original Switch.</p>
<p>Despite following its original Switch with an OLED model, Nintendo has opted for LCD for its bigger Switch 2 screen. While some have criticised the decision, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-experience">quality of the LCD screen is excellent</a> - and leaves the door open for new hardware in future.</p>
<p>In a Q&amp;A following its latest financial report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-sales-forecast-not-affected-by-production-or-tariffs-nintendo-reiterates">Nintendo was criticised by investors for its conservative forecast</a> of 15m units. The console is expected to be incredibly popular - in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">Japan alone demand for the console "far exceeds expectations"</a>, the company said.</p>
<p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stated the company's sales forecast was not influenced by production capacity or US tariffs. However, he admitted that should US tariffs change, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-considering-switch-2-post-launch-price-rise-if-tariff-situation-worsens">company will consider price adjustments accordingly</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann is undoubtedly a very busy person these days. In an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNtAhRQNfcA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the Press X to Continue podcast</a>, the acclaimed game designer and writer revealed he is producing an unannounced game.</p>
<p><em>Then, you know, there's another game that's being worked out in Naughty Dog where I'm more of a producer role and I get to mentor and watch this other team and give feedback and be, like, the executive in the room. I enjoy all those roles and the fact that I jump between one to the next, it makes my job very exciting and always feeling fresh. I'm never bored.</em></p>
<p>Of course, that is in addition to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which he's personally directing. And he's also an executive producer and episode director on The Last of Us HBO show, which is likely to continue beyond season two, given that it didn't include all of the story from the second game.</p>
<p>Druckmann's statement confirms a recent rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-reportedly-canceled-a-single-player-game-this-year-but-another-unannounced-game-is-still-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by movie insider Daniel Richtman, who mentioned that Naughty Dog recently canceled a game formerly directed by Vinit Agarwal but still has another active project that's been in the works for at least three years with Shaun Escayg as its director.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to what that will be, we inevitably enter guessing territory. The mind immediately goes to The Last of Us Part III, which many fans would like to see at some point. However, Druckmann himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-could-be-it-for-the-last-of-us-says-series-creator-neil-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> just over two months ago that there may not even be a third installment in the beloved franchise. Was he just misdirecting until a proper announcement? Or is Escayg perhaps working on a new installment in the Uncharted IP, which is familiar ground for him, having already co-directed Uncharted: The Lost Legacy with Kurt Margenau? It may be a while until we learn the answers to these questions.</p>
<p>During that podcast conversation, Druckmann also marveled at the improvements made in the gaming medium when discussing things that The Last of Us fans preferred in the game over the TV show adaptation:</p>
<p><em>Lately, I've just been really fascinated with the adaptation and all the various reactions to it. And I just had this moment the other day where I was reading something, actually people were critical of some choices that we've made in the show and they were saying like, oh, I like this better in the game and this was more subtle in the game, and I just had this joyous moment of like, look how far games have come that we could have this conversation. You can compare the two and the game can sit side by side with an HBO show and you can have this conversation and even if people are critical of it, I just love it. And then there's people that love it and there's people that love the show better, and they're like, "Oh, these choices were better than the game." And I'm like, "Isn't that fascinating? Look at that."</em></p>

            <p>Now we're cooking with asbestos: Warhammer Skulls, the yearly power armoured excite-o-thon hosted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Boltgun</a> actor Rahul Kohli, returns this Thursday. It's traditionally a time of reveals and revelry, with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus">Mechanicus</a> sequel a likely contender for the spotlight this year. You can watch it live on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/warhammer">TwitchHam</a> at  17:00 BST/12:00 EST/9:00 PST. Here's a teasytrailyhypeyshouty in the meantime.</p>

<p>There'll also be discounts on a bunch of Warhammer licensed electronic entertainment products. There likely will not be any news on the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> DLC, because Creative Assembly like to keep to their own inscrutable schedule. And, if certain conspiratorial corners of the internet and also <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dawn-of-war-4-linkedin-post/">The Gamer</a> are to be believed, we might also see something <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-war">Dawn Of War</a> shaped.</p>
<p>These rumours have bubbled up from LinkedIn; fetid swamplands where drowning souls beg the local alligators for a swift crunchdeath but are instead tortured with bullet pointed posts by self-styled analysts using 500 of their businessiest words to say "game sold well because fun, also no woke, share if agree" (I really need to get off LinkedIn). Specifically, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dominik-dolenec-57153146_emonacapital-activity-7302358433092030464-x6t8">a post by</a> one Dominik Dolenec, whose UK based investment firm Emona Capital includes both Relic and Blackbird Interactive in its portfolio.</p>
<p>Dolenec shared a picture of himself at Nottingham's Warhammer World, thanking Owen Rees - Games Workshop's head of licensing and project lead on multiple Dawn Of War titles. "Looking forward to deepening our partnership in years to come,” wrote Dolenec. From The Gamer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why is this post suggesting Dawn of War 4, rather than a Baneblade deconstructing game from Hardspace: Shipbreaker devs Blackbird Interactive? That all comes down to Dolenec’s t-shirt, which appears in the corner of one of his photos. It appears to bear the logo of Relic Entertainment, suggesting that he’s in Nottingham on its behalf. He also confirms that we’re not seeing things in the comments and he is, in fact, emblazoned with Relic’s crest.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, there's your grist, rumour millers. Do with it what you will. Me? I don't especially need another Warhammer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> in my life that doesn't have Skaven in it, and I'm not entirely sure I trust modern Relic to deliver a decent one even if I did. I would play it though of course, yeah. Who do you think I am, someone who hasn't bought every Killteam big box this season despite not having assembled the Vespids from the starter yet?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Digital Dragons is Poland’s biggest games industry expo, with developers, publishers, press and support companies descending on Krakow for two days of lectures, interviews and showcases. As part of the conference, last night played host to the Digital Dragons Awards Gala, celebrating the best and the brightest of the Polish gaming scene. Across multiple awards, several big titles duked it out, including global hits like Nobody Wants To Die and The Thaumaturge, but it was survival city-builder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/">Frostpunk 2</a> that took home the top honours, winning Polish Game of the Year.</p>
<p>The awards ceremony began with the Indie Dragons awards, spotlighting smaller studios and new teams. Third place went to Arms of God, while XYZ from Screen Tear Games came second. The ultimate winner, though, nabbing the award, additional funding, and a powerful new AMD workstation from the sponsors, was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868360/Deep_Sleep_Labyrinth_of_the_Forsaken/">Deep Sleep: Labyrinth of the Forsaken</a>, a point-and-click title from scriptwelder. My favourite quote of the night? The presenter for first place saying, “And now, let’s see who baked the best turkey.” I’m going to judge all game award winners as turkey bakers for the foreseeable.</p>



<p>Frostpunk 2 also scooped two additional awards, winning Best Polish Game Design and Best Polish Game Audio, with the post-apocalyptic city builder winning over judges across the board. Its main competitor at this year’s show was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1939970/Nobody_Wants_to_Die/">Nobody Wants To Die</a>, the dystopian detective story winning both Best Polish Game Narrative and Best Polish Visual Art.</p>
<p>Further awards went to Tomorrow: Online Survival for best Polish Mobile Game, while Magdalena Cielecka received a Special Recognition Award for her work within the industry. Finally, Best Foreign Game went to Canada’s all-conquering Balatro, which was well received in the hall.</p>

<p>What was clear throughout the show, and the wider Digital Dragons conference, was the excellent health that the Polish game development scene is in. Hundreds of game studios call Poland home, and while global giants like CD Projekt, Techland and Bloober Team are at the forefront, there’s a wealth of talent here, with Poland hosting the second-largest development community in Europe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/top-10-mission-impossible-villains-ranked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This list contains spoilers for the Mission: Impossible franchise.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mission-impossible-final-reckoning-review-tom-cruise">Mission: Impossible film is hitting theaters this month</a> – the final one in the franchise, if we’re to believe Tom Cruise and the suits at Paramount – and if you’re like us, you’re probably knee deep in a series rewatch right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The focus of the films, spectacular action set pieces aside, has been Cruise’s lead spy, Ethan Hunt. Fellow team agents have often come and gone, and supposedly impossible missions have varied time after time, but Ethan has remained. The only other constant has been a steady supply of villains – men and women with big plans fueled by greed and/or malice, who think they’ll be the one to outwit, outsmart, and outrun Hunt. Fools.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It might seem counterintuitive ranking the Mission: Impossible villains under the banner of “best,” but every great hero needs an equally great villain. Numerous elements come into play when determining the best villain, but we’re zeroing in on the scale of their threat, the weight of the violence (both physical and emotional) they commit against Hunt and his team, and the palpable degree of villainous charisma they exhibit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So cue up that classic Lalo Schifrin theme, here are the 10 Best Mission: Impossible Villains, Ranked!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Mission Impossible Villains</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>10. A.I. The Entity (Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/the-entity-1747682503363.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“A self-aware, self-learning, truth-eating digital parasite infesting all of cyberspace” sounds like a pretty cool threat in any other high-octane thriller, but in the Mission: Impossible franchise it’s only good enough to land at number ten. It underwhelms compared to its human counterparts, because let’s be real – zeroes and ones ain’t got shit and madness and guns – but its power and immense reach are undeniable. The Entity began “life” as a digital weapon designed by the U.S. government before going rogue and hopping through cyberspace with the giddiness of a puppy experiencing its first snowfall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> While toying with and killing a submarine filled with Russian sailors is an act of murderous cruelty, it’s the Entity’s bigger, broader acts of deception that mark it as a true villain. Its early days of online manipulation saw it shifting public opinion and behavior through social media, and it’s a brutal reminder of events in the real world. We live in a present where people with nefarious agendas are influencing easily shaped minds, and with the increased use of A.I. in our online dealings, it’s not hard to imagine something like the Entity stepping in and really turning our daily lives into a nightmare.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>9. John Musgrave (Mission: Impossible III)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/musgrabe-1747693587438.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every villain has direct blood on his hands, but that doesn’t mean they’re any less dangerous. Musgrave is Hunt’s Operations Manager at the IMF, and it’s suggested they may even be minor friends – understandable as he’s played by Billy Crudup, and who wouldn’t want to be friends with Billy Crudup. He brings Hunt in on a mission to rescue one of his proteges, Lindsey Farris, and when that goes wrong and Hunt is blamed for the fallout, it’s Musgrave who helps the agent escape to pursue justice. See? A friend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprise! It’s all a ruse, and Musgrave is actually a traitor working with a man named Owen Davian on some elaborate plan to retrieve a piece of tech nicknamed “the rabbit’s foot.” Musgrave’s a hero in his own mind, though, as he’s hoping to use this as motivation for first strikes against enemy forces. He wants the U.S. and the IMF to play a more aggressive role in the fight against terrorism, and if that means supporting terrorists along the way, well, he’s all for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> Musgrave might think his heart is in the right place here, but in addition to enabling a murderous terrorist in Davian, he crosses an equally big line by pulling Ethan’s wife, Julia, into danger. Worse, he lets Davian shoot Julia in the head right in front of Hunt. Sure, she’s revealed to have been a minor henchwoman in a mask, but the emotional damage is real.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>8. Kurt Hendricks (Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/hendricks-1747682536982.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While some villains act out of greed and others cause misery simply for the fun of it, Kurt Hendricks is a man who only wants the best for humanity. What is the best, you ask? Well, in Hendricks’ mind, our species would benefit from something of a cleanse. From the great biblical flood to the atomic bombing of Japanese cities during World War II, immense disasters lead to rebuilding, recovery, and real improvement… apparently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sounds logical, so Hendricks sets out to trigger just such a global debacle starting with a massive attack on the Kremlin in Moscow and leading to the acquisition of nuclear codes. He proves himself to be one of the greatest threats Ethan Hunt has faced to that point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Except, and this is where casting comes into serious play, the film wants us to see him as a physical threat to Hunt – but that’s nearly impossible. Michael Nyqvist was a fantastic actor, and he makes for a compelling villain through dialogue and intent. But a serious contender in a fight with Cruise? It’s difficult to buy, but that doesn’t stop director Brad Bird from letting him go toe to toe with the film’s star for a weirdly long fight. (To be fair, Chad Stahelski started it by letting Nyqvist seemingly hold his own for a bit with Keanu Reeves in John Wick.) So, while Hendricks is a grand threat on the world stage, he tumbles some in the ranking here as an unserious brawler against the highly trained and in far better shape Hunt. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> Like Musgrave above, Hendricks seriously thinks he’s doing the world a favor by causing harm. His final act results in a nuclear missile being fired towards San Francisco, something that would have killed tens of thousands of people immediately before triggering the death of millions more. That’s no small thing, and he would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn’t been for those meddling IMF agents.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>7. August Walker (Mission: Impossible - Fallout)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/august-walker-1747682556546.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunt and his IMF team have been betrayed by double agents and traitors on numerous occasions, but most of them are greedy middle-aged men in suits who don’t pose an immediate physical threat to our intrepid hero. August Walker is something different entirely. He towers over Hunt and is jacked from his mustache on down. Henry Cavill’s portrayal ensures that he’s already menacing even while pretending to be on Hunt’s side, but once the truth comes out, the gloves come off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walker is revealed to be working in cahoots with the brilliant Solomon Lane, and together they frame Hunt and once again pull the love of his life, Julia, into harm’s way. His motivation for it all is a bit over the top and dramatic – he wants the old world to implode and give rise to something better – but what else would you expect from a man who seems to cock his arms like guns during fist fights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> Walker and Lane are planning to detonate nuclear bombs, and while the latter stays behind to die in his greatest act of terror, Walker is on a chopper heading to safety. Hunt, of course, catches up to him in pursuit of the detonator that’s needed to stop the countdown. While Walker could have easily escaped by giving up the detonator, his desire to cause suffering – especially Hunt’s suffering if Julia were to die – leads him to a one-on-one fight to the death with the agent. It’s a decision built on rage and self-righteous justification, and it rightfully ends in his painful demise.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>6. Paris (Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/paris-1747682570825.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to villains in the Mission: Impossible universe, few can touch Pom Klementieff’s Paris on style and charisma points. A henchwoman to Gabriel, she lets her gleefully murderous skillset do most of her talking, and it’s a refreshing change of pace from baddies who seem compelled to share their life stories before pulling a trigger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Her costume and face makeup see her stand apart from the crowd, but don’t let her doll-like appearance fool you. Paris is a merciless fighter who refuses to quit despite the odds, as evidenced by a shootout and car chase in Rome that sees her literally plowing through obstacles both human and otherwise in her pursuit of Hunt. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> While Paris makes mincemeat out of numerous threats, she ultimately succumbs to Hunt during an alleyway brawl. He spares her life, though, and after being punished by Gabriel – he basically tries to kill her – she chooses to betray both him and her villainous tendencies by saving Hunt’s life. Maybe I’m stretching the definition here, but it takes a real badass to turn your back on villainy with the discovery of unexpected morals and a change of heart.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5. Gabriel (Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/gabriel1-1747693609929.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The mysterious Gabriel arrives in the penultimate entry of the franchise, and he’s a man with deadly skills and an alliance with the Entity. He also comes with a backstory suggesting an integral role in Ethan Hunt’s life. It seems Gabriel killed a woman named Marie thirty years ago, someone Hunt was apparently fond of, and it’s that murder that landed Hunt at the IMF – where he went on to save thousands of lives. Hundreds of thousands, even. So maybe Gabriel is a hero? I kid, I kid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He’s obviously a villain, and he may even be something of a seer (?), but while his late-to-the-party franchise arrival unavoidably undercuts his dramatic weight, the character’s casting lifts Gabriel right back up again. Esai Morales brings real charm and a calm menace to the character, and it’s immediately made clear that he’s not someone to be trifled with. You believe both his physical abilities and deadly intentions, and Morales’ added dramatic weight makes him a real threat to Hunt. He also earns a bump in the rankings by gifting viewers with the best, most unforgettable villain death in the entire franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> Gabriel’s killed a lot of people, and he even destroyed a rolling Agatha Christie landmark, so it’s clear he’s a bad guy. His most vicious act, though, comes as a bookend to having “fridged” Marie three decades earlier. Gabriel threatens to do it again by killing either Ilsa or Grace – Hunt’s current love interest or the woman who just landed in his lap mere hours ago – and while the film wants to trick viewers into thinking it’s going to be the latter, it’s Ilsa who dies by Gabriel’s blade instead. McQuarrie and Cruise are obviously the real villains here for introducing this tired trope of a woman’s death being responsible for a man’s life, but it’s ultimately Gabriel who thrusts the knife into Ilsa’s gut. It could have been Grace who died. Hell, it should have been Benji. Instead, Gabriel extinguishes the franchise’s brightest flame this side of Hunt himself. J’accuse!</p><div data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="article-subtitle">Not yet available for streaming.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. Jim Phelps (Mission: Impossible)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/jim-phelps-1747682606048.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Jim Phelps wasn’t the only friend/fellow agent to betray Hunt over the years, but he was the first – and arguably the most shocking. The character, as played by Peter Graves, was the IMF’s lead agent for the bulk of the television series’ seven-season run from 1966 to 1973. He was unquestionably a good guy, so there was no reason to suspect that his presence in the first Mission: Impossible film would be anything different – well, Jon Voight in the role was probably a clue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Audiences expected Phelps to essentially hand the reins over to Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt, but while he did just that, he did so with a major act of betrayal. As he tells Hunt once his ruse is discovered, the end of the Cold War threatens to end the need for the IMF – this is as naive a statement as ever uttered in the entirety of the franchise – and he was worried about becoming a relic barely scraping by on sixty-two thousand dollars a year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> The betrayal itself is already brutal as Phelps turns his back on friends and agents who’ve risked their lives together over the years, but it’s the specifics of his traitorous act that hits hardest. In his effort to frame someone else for his crime, Phelps kills off three members of his team during an operation and then fakes his own death. What could have been a simple theft, instead becomes an act of cruelty making his betrayal sting even more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. Sean Ambrose (Mission: Impossible II)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/sean-ambrose-1747682623040.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“That was always the hardest part of having to portray you,” says ex-IMF agent Sean Ambrose to a beaten and angered Ethan Hunt, “grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.” That line alone makes Ambrose a top villain as it’s a terrific zing at both Hunt and Cruise himself. He’s equally dismissive of women as evidenced by his comment that they’re like monkeys when it comes to the men in their lives, that they “won’t let go of one branch until they get a grip on the next.” Say what you will about his greedy desires, but Ambrose (Dougray Scott) understands the assignment when it comes to being a charismatic villain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That greed has led him to steal a deadly plague with plans to unleash it on whole populations if his demands aren’t met. While cash money is his primary motivator, though, Ambrose also seems fueled by a splash of jealousy towards Hunt. That makes their faceoffs all the more entertaining whether they’re jousting on motorcycles or sharing beatdowns in the sand as only the great John Woo can capture it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> The film opens with Ambrose masquerading as Hunt in order to acquire the Chimera plague, but rather than just kill one man, Ambrose and his team crash an entire passenger jet filled with innocent civilians. Acts of terror would claim higher body counts in later films, but this puts faces to the dead in a far more direct way making it more personal and affecting.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. Solomon Lane (Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/solomon-1747693631099.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether due to low pay or poor benefits, the world is seemingly overflowing with ex-government employees ready and willing to betray their nations and jump on the train to villain town. Solomon Lane is one such agent, but he goes a step or three further by helping create an organization called The Syndicate that’s built entirely on those bitter, trigger happy ex-agents. They want to sow chaos and reap financial rewards, and they’ve been doing it for years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lane is introduced killing a young, unarmed female agent right in front of Hunt, and it’s soon revealed that he’s responsible for thousands of deaths over the years through events made to look like accidents or the work of wholly unrelated perpetrators. Lane’s history of manipulating trust and the world’s various systems makes him one of the most dangerous villains in the franchise. He’s ahead of Hunt at every step, and his mantra – “The greater the suffering, the greater the peace.” – marks him as a man willing to do anything to accomplish his goals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While many actors go big playing villains, Sean Harris takes the opposite approach and makes Lane a weasel of a man who you just want to see get beaten senseless. It’s an unusually bold choice that leaves him without a darkly appealing persona or personality – he’s just a very bad man who couldn’t care less about you or your loved ones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> As the rare villain to be an active threat across more than one film, Lane inflicts plenty of pain, suffering, and stress on Hunt and his team. The bulk of his evil acts were committed before Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation even begins, but his cruelest and most personal action unfolds during the followup, Fallout. Along with August Walker, Lane manages to activate two nuclear bombs threatening not only the water supply for billions of people, but also the life of Hunt’s greatest love, Julia. Seeing her in harm’s way is the kind of gut punch that Hunt felt only once before, and it’s clear just how sorry he is that his choices have once again brought her so close to dying.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Owen Davian (Mission: Impossible III)</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/19/owen-1747682651428.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot of competition when it comes to selecting the best villain in the Mission: Impossible franchise, but there was never any doubt who’d land at the top of the heap. Davian doesn’t care about much beyond his own wants and needs, and the film reflects that by never revealing exactly what his end goal is – we know he wants the so-called rabbit’s foot, but what it is and what it does are never made clear. We just know that Davian will cut through anyone and anything to get it, and that makes him an exceptionally dangerous man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">J.J. Abrams’ Mission: Impossible III is unfairly maligned, but even those underwhelmed by the film itself can’t help but applaud Philip Seymour Hall’s frighteningly effective and highly entertaining portrayal of Davian. His blistering stares, his lightning quick shifts from dead silence to raging outbursts, and his deceptively calm way of threatening everything that Hunt holds dear all work to make him a villain who commands the screen and even steals every scene from Cruise himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There may not be a big, global threat at play here, but Davian is the man who arguably gets closer than any other villain to actually killing Hunt. He injects the agent’s head with an explosive device that gets within seconds of churning Hunt’s brain tissue into ground beef, and he even gets some serious licks in while brawling. You wouldn’t think a Cruise versus Hoffman fight would convince, but the latter’s pure ferocity paired with Hunt’s incapacitation due to the pain in his head makes for a viciously compelling bout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Most villainous act of villainy:</strong> Davian is a mean bastard who, while still in restraints, coldly threatens to murder Hunt’s fiance Julia. “I’m gonna make her bleed and cry and call out your name”, he says, and it’s one of the few times where Hunt’s legendary control tips into real fear and emotion. Davian later comes close to doing just that after abducting Julia, tying her up, and appearing to shoot her in the head. Hunt’s pain is palpable, and it’s enough to damage his heart to the point that he’d go on to never let someone that close again. Davian has literally halted Hunt’s ability to connect with someone on a deeply personal level, and it’s the kind of attack that bullets and bombs just can’t compete with.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

While you can still find ways to buy them online, it is nearly impossible to find them below their original retail price. So if you find yourself face to face with a LEGO set that really sparks joy, it's best to pick it up before it's gone forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, there are some rare cases when you can still find a set for below MSRP even after it gets retired. One such case is this current discount on the Green Hill Zone LEGO set at Amazon. It isn't much of a discount, but we don't expect it will still be at this price for much longer now that its <a href="https://www.brickeconomy.com/set/21331-1/lego-ideas-sonic-the-hedgehog-green-hill-zone" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">been over five months</a> since it was retired.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">LEGO Sonic The Hedgehog – Green Hill Zone Sale</h2><div catalogid="ca02472e-a4c8-49a8-af2b-9d58c3f5abfc" id="218304"><div id="218304" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Ideas Sonic The Hedgehog – Green Hill Zone</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The LEGO Ideas Green Hill Zone set originally came out back in January 2022, but it wasn't until January of this year that LEGO retired the set. IGN actually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-sonic-the-hedgehog-green-hill-zone-throwback-16-bit">had the chance to build back in 2022</a> when it first came out three years ago and we loved the build. It's a fun tribute to the iconic video game level from the series and one of our favorite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-sonic-lego-sets">Sonic the Hedgehog LEGO sets</a> and is great for any fan of the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as I can tell, Amazon currently has the lowest possible price on this set if you're looking to buy it new, but Walmart also has it available. Ebay has a few different options on used versions for almost half the price, but you may risk missing pieces if you take that route. Considering it is still discounted, Amazon likely has quite a bit of stock left for this set, but as soon as that starts to dwindle you can expect prices to go up fairly quickly. LEGO is no longer selling this set, so once it's gone you'll only be able to purchase it at a markup unless you get lucky.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Recently Retired LEGO Sets on Amazon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Once LEGO officially retires a set, they tend to hang around at other retailers for a bit longer. This makes Amazon one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-sets">best places to buy LEGO</a> thanks to their extended inventory of these products. There are a number of other recently retired sets you can currently still purchase right now.

However, there are several useful techniques and important mechanics that you need to know before you head into the fight with one of the strongest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-and-existing-minecraft-mobs-animals-and-monsters/1100-6531290/" data-ref-id="1100-6531290">Minecraft mobs</a>. Here's how to find the Ender Dragon, how to beat it, and the rewards you'll get for slaying it.</p><h2 id="Items_to_bring_to_the_fight">Items to bring to the fight</h2><p>Before we get into the mechanics of the Ender Dragon fight, there are several items you should seek out and bring with you on the journey. You'll want to read our dedicated Minecraft The End guide for information on how to find The End and how to get there, but in terms of items that will be useful, we've got you covered.</p><p>You'll need three full stacks of scaffolding in order to reach the tops of the towers. You can bring normal blocks, but scaffolding allows you to go up and down at will, instead of relying on water buckets to break your fall from the top of the tower. If you're anything like me, you've failed at the water bucket trick too many times to count, so scaffolding is the safer option. Having said that, do bring a water bucket to protect yourself from the many Endermen that spawn in the fight arena.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497174-minecraft-ender-dragon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497174" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497174-minecraft-ender-dragon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497174"></a><figcaption>Suggested items to bring to the Ender Dragon fight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497174-minecraft-ender-dragon.jpg"></figure><p>Bring a full stack of golden carrots to restore health if you do get hit quickly. Also, bring three stacks of empty glass bottles with you to collect the Dragon's Breath that pools on the floor. This is an important ingredient for several Minecraft potions, so it's well worth collecting while the fight progresses. To collect it, right-click with a glass bottle equipped when it pools on the floor, taking care not to step directly in it.</p><p>Bring your best weapons. For the Ender Dragon, this is a Netherite sword with your preferred enchantments, and a bow with the infinity enchantment at a minimum, as this gives you unlimited arrows. You'll also want full diamond or Netherite armor, with your preferred enchantments. If you'd prefer to avoid the Endermen completely at the sacrifice of limited vision, you can carve a pumpkin and wear it as a helmet. This way, the Endermen won't attack you no matter how much you look at them.</p><p>Bring a bed and a chest with spare armor and weapons. Place the bed and chest next to the End portal, and set your respawn on the bed before jumping into the portal.</p><p>Finally, bring some stacks of building blocks, preferably cobblestone or something else similar to obtain, as the spawn into The End is random and you may find yourself on one of the area's many standalone platforms with no way to reach the Ender Dragon. Should this happen after jumping through the portal, you can create a bridge across to the main area.</p><h2 id="How_to_destroy_the_tower_crystals_and_cages">How to destroy the tower crystals and cages</h2><p>When you spawn into the Ender Dragon fight, you'll notice several pillars with End Crystals on top of them. Two of these towers will also have cages around the crystals.

When you reach the top, use a pickaxe for the most efficient way to destroy the cage. Remember that there are two towers with cages. When the cage and crystal are destroyed, head down the scaffolding or use the water bucket to create a safe space to jump into.</p><p>If you destroy a crystal while the Dragon is tethered to it--signaled by a white beam between the Dragon and the crystal--it will cause the Ender Dragon to take more damage when the attack phase begins.</p><h2 id="How_to_avoid_being_killed_by_Endermen">How to avoid being killed by Endermen</h2><p>As mentioned above, you can carve a pumpkin and wear it as a helmet to avoid Endermen attacking you. However, the limited visibility this provides often isn't worth it. Instead, try to avoid looking at them directly.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497182-minecraft-ender-dragon%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497182" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497182-minecraft-ender-dragon%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497182"></a><figcaption>An Enderman can't attack if you're stood in water.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497182-minecraft-ender-dragon%283%29.jpg"></figure><p>If you accidentally do look at one for too long it will become hostile. Use your water bucket and stand in the middle of where the water was placed. If you stay in this safe area, the Endermen will not get closer and therefore cannot hit you with their melee attacks. However, the Ender Dragon can still use its Dragon's Breath attack, so keep an eye out for it as it will still do damage over time while you're standing in water.</p><h2 id="How_to_kill_the_Ender_Dragon">How to kill the Ender Dragon</h2><p>You can now begin to damage the Ender Dragon. Use your bow and aim for it as it circles in the air, keeping an eye out for its Dragon Breath attacks. Remember not to look at the Endermen during this time too, as if you anger one, they'll all become hostile and can actually prove more deadly than the Dragon itself at times.</p><p>The Ender Dragon has several hitboxes on its head, body, wings, and tail. Hitting it in the head causes the most damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497192-minecraft-ender-dragon%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497192" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497192-minecraft-ender-dragon%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497192"></a><figcaption>Shoot the Ender Dragon with arrows when it's in flight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497192-minecraft-ender-dragon%284%29.jpg"></figure><p>When the Ender Dragon lands on the perch made of Bedrock in the center of the arena, it's time for the next stage of the fight. Again, hitting it on the head will cause the most damage, but be careful of its flapping wings, as they'll cause damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4497193-defeatingtheenderdragoniseasyinminecraft0-33screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497193" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4497193-defeatingtheenderdragoniseasyinminecraft0-33screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497193"></a><figcaption>The Ender Dragon dying</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4497193-defeatingtheenderdragoniseasyinminecraft0-33screenshot.png"></figure><p>It will still be using its Dragon's Breath attack, so use the glass bottles in your inventory to quickly bottle it up, or move away from it. As the Dragon's health depletes, it will periodically return to the sky to fly around before landing again on its perch. Keep attacking it with arrows in the air, or melee attacks when it's on its perch, until it's killed.</p><h2 id="Ender_Dragon_Drops">Ender Dragon Drops</h2><p>For defeating the Ender Dragon, you will receive several items. Firstly, you will get 12,000XP in orbs, so run around and collect them all for a huge amount of level boosts. It's enough to raise your level to 68 from zero, to put that into context. If you resummon the Ender Dragon and defeat it again, it will only drop 500XP.</p><p>Secondly, the Dragon Egg will spawn. To safely get it without destroying it, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Hit the egg once so it falls from the portal.</li><li>Mine underneath the egg and place a torch underneath the block it is sitting on.</li><li>Break the block it is sitting on, and it'll fall on the torch.</li><li>You can now pick up the egg and have it in your inventory.</li></ul><p>This also grants The Next Generation achievement. There is only one Dragon Egg in each Minecraft world, and there is no way to get more than one without using <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-minecraft-mods/2900-5234/" data-ref-id="2900-5234">Minecraft mods</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497194-minecraft-ender-dragon%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497194" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497194-minecraft-ender-dragon%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497194"></a><figcaption>How to pick up the Ender Dragon Egg.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497194-minecraft-ender-dragon%285%29.jpg"></figure><p>Finally, defeating the Ender Dragon opens a portal to the End Islands, which gives access to things such as Elytra and Shulker boxes. The portals appear in random locations, and look like a cluster of blocks. There can be up to 20 portals around the main island, and teleport you large distances to the End Islands.</p><h2 id="How_to_resummon_the_Ender_Dragon">How to resummon the Ender Dragon</h2><p>You'll need four End Crystals to summon the Ender Dragon for a repeat of the fight. Place one End Crystal on each side of the perch where the Ender Dragon usually rests during the fight, on the central block. This will cause four beams to shoot up, one from each crystal, which will take it in turns to point to the top of each obsidian tower to create a new End Crystal, and the Ender Dragon will respawn when all of them have spawned.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497195-minecraft-ender-dragon%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497195" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497195-minecraft-ender-dragon%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497195"></a><figcaption>Resummoning the Ender Dragon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497195-minecraft-ender-dragon%286%29.jpg"></figure><p>Now that you know all about the Ender Dragon, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/" data-ref-id="1100-6526408">Minecraft guides hub</a> for more tips and tricks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fortnite-ai-darth-vader-star-wars-epic-games-sag-aftra<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, Epic continued its ongoing project of <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-donald-mustard-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forcing every existent</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-epic-metahuman-fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tech trend</a> into the metaversal melting pot known as <em>Fortnite </em>by adding an AI-powered version of Darth Vader to the game. "Ask him all your pressing questions about the Force, the Galactic Empire... or you know, a good strat for the last Storm circle,” the company wrote in <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a news post</a>, also noting that it received the blessing of deceased actor James Earl Jones’ family. “The Sith Lord has opinions." You can probably imagine how this has gone!</p><p>Mere moments after the cyborg Sith Lord imperial marched his way into the game on Friday, players began tricking him into <a href="https://x.com/ImCordial/status/1923354018375491805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swearing</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GasSpares/status/1923365764947431441" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying slurs</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/SomeRandomDyl/status/1923360651113611536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being low-key racist</a>. Epic <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-star-wars-ai-darth-vader-james-earl-jones-1851781018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued a statement to Kotaku</a> saying that it has patched out these less savory tendencies of a genocidal villain who nonetheless must function as the face of a family-friendly mega-corporation looking to extract as much shareholder value as possible from <a href="https://aftermath.site/disney-fortnite-d23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a $1.5 billion collaboration deal</a>. </p><p>“We pushed a hot fix within 30 minutes of this happening in-game, so this shouldn’t happen again,” an Epic spokesperson wrote, noting that players who repeatedly push Vader’s buttons will eventually be barred from recruiting him during a gameplay session and saying that the company has added a new parental control called "allow voice and written communication with AI Features."</p><p>Since then, some players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1kpwtex/did_the_patch_ruin_vader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complained that AI Vader is boring now</a>, while others have enjoyed poking and prodding at the sand-hating sad boi, but have ultimately seen this (and, by extension, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-npcs-nvidia-unity-ubisoft-convai-inworld" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty much every other variety of generative AI NPC</a>) for what it is: a gimmick, the novelty of which quickly wears off.</p><p>“It was fun for one night for me and my friends but we kinda aren't gonna use it for the rest of the season,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1kpyrib/comment/mt1lsbk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reads the top comment</a> in a <em>Fortnite </em>subreddit thread about how Epic should bring back this tech in future seasons.</p><p>But, as befits anything involving <em>Star Wars</em>, the saga did not – and indeed, could not – end there. Today, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) – currently <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-voice-actor-strike-genshin-impact-destiny-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">striking over AI-related protections for video game voice actors and performers</a> – filed an unfair labor practice against one of the companies involved in AI Vader’s creation. The union began by saying that it celebrates “the right of our members and their estates to control the use of their digital replicas and welcome the use of new technologies to allow new generations to share in the enjoyment of those legacies and renowned roles,” but “we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader's iconic rhythm and tone in video games.”</p><p>"Fortnite's signatory company, Llama Productions, chose to replace the work of human performers with A.I. technology,” SAG-AFTRA said in a statement received by Aftermath. “Unfortunately, they did so without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms. As such, we have filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB against Llama Productions."&nbsp;</p><p>The filing, <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Llama%20Productions%20ULP%20Charge.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which can be viewed here</a>, states that Llama, a subsidiary of Epic, “within the past six months… failed and refused to bargain in good faith with the union by making unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilizing AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work on the Interactive Program <em>Fortnite</em>."&nbsp;</p><p>Which is bad! But the larger context surrounding all of this is what really reeks. In Epic’s first post about AI Vader, it included a statement attributed to the family of James Earl Jones.&nbsp;</p><p>"James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of <em>Star Wars</em>, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it,” the statement read. “We hope that this collaboration with <em>Fortnite </em>will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character."</p><p>But this is not that character; instead, it’s a pliant puppet wearing his skin and parroting his voice. This is no legacy. It’s a farce, a cruel joke played on a dead man. Darth Vader, as depicted in <em>Star Wars</em>, was similarly resuscitated after what should have been his demise, but at least he maintained some semblance of free will and was ultimately able to choose his own grisly end. James Earl Jones, a real person, has not even been afforded that mercy.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/web3-nft-crypto-game-fail-close-scam-snake-oil"><h3>Oh No, Anyway</h3></a><p>'What went wrong?'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wind-breaker-shonen-anime-toxic-masculinity"><h3>This Shonen Anime Fights Toxic Masculinity</h3></a><p>Wind Breaker is a shonen anime where teenage boys talk about their feelings while punching toxic masculinity in the face.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-tv-series-show-impressions"><h3>The Last Of Us Season 2 Is Bad Television</h3></a><p>It's not great, whether you've played the game or not</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Warden is one of the deadliest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-and-existing-minecraft-mobs-animals-and-monsters/1100-6531290/" data-ref-id="1100-6531290">Minecraft mobs </a>in the game, but it's actually not supposed to be treated like a boss. The best way to deal with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft </a>Warden is to sneak around and avoid it, so that you can access valuable Ancient City loot. However, if you find yourself curious and wanting to look him in the eye, this guide will detail which Minecraft biomes to find him in, how to spawn him, and how to beat him if running away isn't as successful as you'd like it to be.</p><h2 id="How_to_find_the_Warden">How to find the Warden</h2><p>The Warden will spawn in Deep Dark caves, and you'll be able to tell if you're in an area where he can appear, as there'll be a lot of Sculk littering the ground and walls. Sculk is a deep midnight-blue block with flecks of electric blue. It starts off sparsely dotted around, but as the cave opens up, it becomes very dense and is joined by Sculk Sensors and Sculk Shriekers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497160-minecraft-warden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497160" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497160-minecraft-warden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497160"></a><figcaption>The Warden will rise out of the ground when triggered.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497160-minecraft-warden.jpg"></figure><p>The Warden doesn't automatically spawn in these areas, though. Instead, a player needs to trigger four Sculk Shriekers. You'll know the Shrieker has been activated as blue sonar waves will be emitted from it. To trigger one, you need to directly step on a Sculk Sensor or cause a vibration by moving or interacting with something close to it. The sensor will then send a signal to the Shrieker, which will make a loud noise. After triggering the Shrieker, or any Shrieker, four times, a Warden will rise from the ground, and the surrounding area will get darker.</p><h2 id="How_to_beat_the_Warden">How to beat the Warden</h2><p>As mentioned, the Warden isn't really intended to be fought. By sneaking around and trying to avoid it, Mojang introduced a horror-like suspense to Minecraft that'll have your heart racing. As the Warden is blind and relies on sound, vibration, and smell to seek out nearby threats, he can't detect you if you're sneaking past it. His audible heartbeat gives a good indicator of how close he is, even when the room is pitch black.</p><p>If you're going to try running from the Warden, you can distract it with throwable items like snowballs or arrows, as the noise and vibration from them landing elsewhere will entice the Warden in their direction. However, you must either sprint away as soon as it's at the distraction location or continue to sneak in the opposite direction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497162-minecraft-warden%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497162" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497162-minecraft-warden%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497162"></a><figcaption>The Warden's sonic boom is a powerful ranged attack.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497162-minecraft-warden%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>The Warden will react to you running, jumping, mining, building, or attacking anything and will turn and sprint towards you. If it reaches you, it has a ranged sonic boom attack which deals 6HP damage, and an even more painful melee attack dealing 16HP damage, meaning it'll make quick work of killing you unless you're out of its reach.</p><p>If you do choose to fight the Warden, one technique we've used is crafting a lot of anvils and building a tower out of its reach, dropping the Anvils on its head. It has 500 health points, so it's not easy to take down, but not impossible. Should you manage to kill it, it will drop five experience points and a Sculk Catalyst.</p><p>If you're looking for more tips and tricks, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/" data-ref-id="1100-6526408">Minecraft guides hub</a>, which covers<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-show-your-minecraft-coordinates/1100-6531264/" data-ref-id="1100-6531264"> how to show your coordinates</a> if you're lost seeking the Warden, and what the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-java-vs-bedrock-differences-and-which-to-play/1100-6531281/" data-ref-id="1100-6531281">Java vs Bedrock </a>differences are.</p>

The modules are available in 6-, 15-, and 32-key variants and are housed in an aluminum chassis that can be built into custom bases, machines, and furniture, making it possible to actually create <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640725/april-fools-2025-elgatos-stream-deck-desk">Elgato’s ridiculous 1,262-key April Fools’ desk</a>.</p><p>The Stream Deck Modules are available now starting at $49.99 for the six-key version, $129.99 for the 15-key, and $199.99 for the 32-key. Elgato technical marketing manager Philipp Eggebrecht told <em>The Verge</em> that discounts will be offered for bulk purchases.</p><p>A new variant of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22579144/elgato-stream-deck-mk-2-stand-faceplates-usb-c-valve">MK.2 Stream Deck</a> has been introduced that replaces the membrane keys with scissor-style switches that provide “enhanced speed and precision,” according to Elgato. Eggebrecht says the scissor keys variant costs $149.99 and will be available in “around two weeks.” </p><p>Stream Deck buttons that feel more like keyboard keys would make it easier for users to tell they’ve clicked something without having to look at the device. Elgato describes the scissor switch variant as something that “lends itself to typing-style interactions, paving the way for new use cases that benefit from rapid, multi-layered input and control,” which could be testing the waters for a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/features/24191410/elgato-stream-deck-art-lebedev-optimus-maximus-keyboard-retrospective">Stream Deck keyboard</a> or any other application requiring precise controls.</p><p>“The idea of a full LCD-key based keyboard is interesting. We’ve explored it in the past and so far, what we’ve found is that the experience hasn’t been great, and there’s the cost question,” Eggebrecht told <em>The Verge</em>. “We’re getting closer to a keyboard feeling with Stream Deck Scissor Keys, and always looking at the technology and what is becoming possible. Stream Deck and keyboards are a natural fit.”</p><p>Elgato is also rolling out a software-only Stream Deck for desktop devices, akin to the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://elgato.sjv.io/c/482924/2029077/13666?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fs%2Fstream-deck-mobile">existing Stream Deck mobile app</a>. The Virtual Stream Deck (VSD) can provide a permanent macro menu on computer screens or be summoned at will when users hit allocated hotkeys and mouse buttons. The VSD software will initially be available for people who own a Corsair Scimitar Elite Wireless SE mouse, Xenon Edge touchscreen, or any Stream Deck model, before later rolling out to “more devices.”</p><p>Custom layouts, virtual faceplates, and support for beyond six buttons require iPhone and Android Stream Deck users to pay for Pro access, which starts at $2.99 monthly or $49.99 as a one-time purchase. Eggebrecht says Elgato’s desktop VSD isn’t locked behind a subscription, but does require users to install the Stream Deck 7.0 beta.</p><p>A new $79.99 Stream Deck network dock accessory was also announced that includes support for power over Ethernet (PoE), which lets you place its buttons anywhere there’s a network jack, and with more flexibility than USB-C affords by itself. Eggebrecht says the Stream Deck network dock will start shipping in August.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>"That's the most likely outcome."</p>

            <p>
Craig Mazin, the showrunner behind HBO's acclaimed live-action TV adaptation of The Last of Us, has confirmed the team is working to a four season plan, insisting there's "no way" the narrative can be wrapped up in three seasons.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time the magic number four has been floated in regard to The Last of Us' TV adaptation, of course. Mazin started the chatter all the way back in 2023, suggesting the show could "end up being three or five [seasons]. But four seems like a good number. Some seasons, because of the story we're telling, will need fewer episodes and some will need more."
</p>
<p>
Then earlier this year, HBO exec Francesca Orsi mirrored those comments, saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbo-expects-the-last-of-us-to-run-for-four-seasons">it was "looking like four seasons" for the adaption</a>, but stressed HBO didn't have "a complete or final plan". Instead, she appeared to defer to Mazin, adding, "I wouldn't want to confirm that, but it's looking like this season and then two more seasons after this and we're done."
</p>
<p>
And now Mazin has seemingly <a href="https://collider.com/the-last-of-us-series-length-season-3-showrunner-craig-mazin/">made that official in an interview with Collider</a>. Discussing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/joel-dominates-headlines-but-its-tommy-who-shines-in-the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-two">big Joel moment that kicked off season two</a>, Mazin explained, "It's so impactful. It's such a narrative nuclear bomb that it's hard to wander away from it. We can't really take a break and move off to the side and do a Bill and Frank story. I'm not sure that will necessarily be true for Season 3. I think we'll have a little more room there."
</p>
<p>
"There's a decent chance that Season 3 will be longer than Season 2," he elaborated, "just because the manner of that narrative and the opportunities it affords us are a little different... but certainly, there's no way to complete this narrative in a third season. Hopefully, we'll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth. That's the most likely outcome."
</p>
<p>
As for season two, there's just one episode to go following this week's sixth instalment. Opinions on the second season have been a little more mixed compared to the widely acclaimed original, with Eurogamer's The Last of Us superfan Victoria Kennedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-six-recaptures-some-much-needed-levity-but-with-only-one-episode-left-have-the-showrunners-bitten-off-more-than-they-can-chew">recently pondering if Mazin and team might have bitten off more than they can chew</a>.

Anyone familiar with manga knows Viz is a primary publisher of official English translations, so the sale includes a wide range of individual tankōbon volumes, as well as deluxe editions, art books, and even coloring books. With more than 2,000 volumes of manga on sale, every type of manga reader should be able to find something. While there are plenty of options for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-free-manga-sites-and-apps">reading manga online</a>, there's always something special about flipping through the pages of your favorite series and getting to see it on your shelf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Crunchyroll usually struggles to match Amazon prices, many of the manga deals I've listed here have actually gone lower. Otherwise, you can shop the full sale <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnbgy?object_uuid=628f438d-4e87-4a6b-9338-2ae0e75a4276&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It ends tonight, so if you’re trying to stock up, now’s your chance. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">30% Off Viz Manga at Crunchyroll Store</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The sale is a great opportunity to try out a new manga or pick up new volumes of something you’ve already been reading (online or otherwise).

In general, the sale is a great opportunity to check out the manga that inspired recent anime hits like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sakamoto-days-premiere-review-netflix">Sakamoto Days</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frieren-beyond-journeys-end-premiere-review">Frieren</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, if we’re talking about iconic anime, you'll also find discounts on classics like Dragon Ball, One Piece, and JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. One series I personally recommend that hasn't gotten an anime adaptation (at least not yet) is Kagurabachi. Otherwise, your best bet is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnbgy?object_uuid=628f438d-4e87-4a6b-9338-2ae0e75a4276&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">scrolling through the full sale</a>, which you can sort by individual series. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Art Books Also Included</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Viz Media also publishes a substantial amount of art books and other physical merchandise. Aside from the standard slate of popular manga, these publications highlight authors like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-junji-ito-manga">Junji Ito</a> and animation giants like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-studio-ghibli-movies">Studio Ghibli</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Do You Need a Crunchyroll Account to Shop the Sale? </strong></h2><div catalogid="ca43b5d5-9f77-4193-8c44-062eab8a5174" id="215876"><div id="215876" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Crunchyroll Premium</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Choose from the Fan, Mega Fan, and Ultimate Fan tiers.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Nope!

Though we've known for some time that the studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">currently working on multiple projects</a>--and that's excluding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-went-wrong-with-the-last-of-us-online-according-to-an-ex-sony-exec/1100-6529585/#:~:text=The%20Last%20of%20Us%20Online%20was%20one%20of%20those%20games,who%20got%20to%20play%20it." data-ref-id="1100-6529585">recently canceled</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-online/" data-ref-id="5000-565972">The Last of Us Online</a>, to be clear--this is our first confirmation that Druckmann is involved in a game other than Intergalactic. Considering Druckmann has confirmed that he does have a concept for The Last of Us III and felt like there would probably be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">one more chapter to the story</a>," it seems entirely plausible that the second game could be a new entry in The Last of Us series.</p><p>Druckmann shared the big news on the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08x7kb5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Press X to Continue podcast</a> (later reported on by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/neil-druckmann-is-working-on-a-second-unannounced-game-at-naughty-dog/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), stating: "There's another game that's being worked on at Naughty Dog where I'm in more of a producer role and I get to mentor, watch this other team, and give feedback and be the executive in the room. I enjoy all those roles, and the fact that I jump from one to the next makes my job very exciting and always feeling fresh. I’m never bored."</p><p>The creative director also clarified that he is currently working on Intergalactic alongside two other Naughty Dog directors, Matthew Gallant and Kurt Margenau, and co-writer Clair Carré. VGC noted this means that Naughty Dog still has two other prominent game directors who are currently unattached to any of its announced projects: Shaun Escayg (Uncharted: The Lost Legacy) and Anthony Newman (The Last of Us: Part II).</p><p>Though it is possible that the studio could be hard at work on a new IP, all signs point to Druckmann's unannounced game being The Last of Us Part III. After all, Naughty Dog has stated it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uncharted-5-could-happen-with-another-developer-di/1100-6438426/" data-ref-id="1100-6438426">no plans to continue the Uncharted series</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/85465867?utm_campaign=postshare_creator" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">prominent video game leakers</a> have hinted that the game is in development for quite some time now.</p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-of-us-boss-says-a-fourth-season-is-essential/1100-6531653/" data-ref-id="1100-6531653">recent remarks</a> from HBO's The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin have only fueled these rumors. Following the show being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-announced-before-season-2-has-even-premiered/1100-6530734/" data-ref-id="1100-6530734">renewed for a third season</a>, Mazin stated that a fourth season will "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-of-us-boss-says-a-fourth-season-is-essential/1100-6531653/" data-ref-id="1100-6531653">be essential,</a>" which is curious considering the current pacing of the television series and how much source material remains. This paired with the fact that Mazin <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">previously said</a> he will not take the HBO show "past the game" make it seem like it's only a matter of time until The Last of Us Part III is announced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-spawns-unfair-labor-practice-charge-from-voice-union/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>For voice actors who previously portrayed Darth Vader in video games, the Fortnite feature starkly illustrates how AI voice synthesis could reshape their profession. While James Earl Jones created the iconic voice for films, <a href="https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Star-Wars/Darth-Vader/">at least 54 voice actors</a> have performed as Vader in various media games over the years when Jones wasn't available—work that could vanish if AI replicas become the industry standard.</p>
<h2>The union strikes back</h2>
<p>SAG-AFTRA's labor complaint (which can be read online <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Llama%20Productions%20ULP%20Charge.pdf">here</a>) doesn't focus on the AI feature's technical problems or on permission from the Jones estate, which <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite">explicitly authorized</a> the use of a synthesized version of his voice for the character in Fortnite. The late actor, who died in 2024, had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/james-earl-jones-signed-darth-vader-voice-rights-to-disney-for-ai-use/">signed over</a> his Darth Vader voice rights before his death.</p>
<p>Instead, the union's grievance centers on labor rights and collective bargaining. In the NLRB filing, SAG-AFTRA alleges that Llama Productions "failed and refused to bargain in good faith with the union by making unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilizing AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work on the Interactive Program Fortnite."</p>
<p>The action comes amid SAG-AFTRA's <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/interactive-media-video-game-strike">ongoing interactive media strike</a>, which began in July 2024 after negotiations with video game producers stalled primarily over AI protections. The strike continues, with more than 100 games signing interim agreements, while others, including those from major publishers like Epic, remain in dispute.</p>

            <p>
It feels like we've only just been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">introduced to Naughty Dog's sci-fi action-adventure Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, but studio boss Neil Druckmann has now reiterated there's a second game in development too.
</p>
<p>
Druckmann shared the news in <a href="https://audioboom.com/posts/8721579-the-last-of-us-neil-druckmann-talks-to-press-x">conversation with the Press X to Continue podcast</a>, explaining that alongside Intergalactic - where's he's serving as writer and creative director - "there's another game that's being worked on at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> where I am more of a producer role."
</p>
<p>
"And I get to mentor and watch this other team, and give feedback and be, like, the executive in the room," he continued. "I enjoy all those roles, and the fact that I jump between one to the next, it makes my job very exciting and always feeling fresh. I'm never bored."

<p>
This isn't the first time we've heard multiple games are in development at Naughty Dog; the studio said it had "more than one ambitious, brand-new single player game" in the works back in 2023, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">announced the cancellation of The Last of Us Online</a>, and Druckmann <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">used similar phrasing in an interview last summer</a>. His latest statement is, however, the first confirmation multiple projects are still underway since then.
</p>
<p>
As to what this second project might be, Druckmann offered no hints, but it's possible it's being helmed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted-the-lost-legacy">Uncharted: The Lost Legacy</a> director Shaun Escayg - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-avengers-creative-director-moves-back-to-naughty-dog">rejoined Naughty Dog back in 2021</a> after serving as creative director on Crystal Dynamics' Marvel Avengers.
</p>
<p>
Druckmann has, of course, been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">teasing a third The Last of Us game</a> in recent years, but he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-boss-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">seemingly backtracked on that in March</a>, telling fans, "Don't bet on there being more." For now, his main focus appears to be Intergalactic, which is currently expected to arrive in 2027. And while details on the game are currently limited, Druckmann recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-actor-lands-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-role-after-impressing-neil-druckmann-on-set">named another actor who's been cast in Intergalactic</a> after their appearance in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-six-recaptures-some-much-needed-levity-but-with-only-one-episode-left-have-the-showrunners-bitten-off-more-than-they-can-chew">The Last of Us' television show</a>.

These include a wrap, a pickaxe, a back bling, and the full outfit. However, these specific items are locked behind XP benchmarks, which players can earn in any Fortnite mode. To unlock the ability to buy all of the items, you'll need to amass 1,280,000 XP.
