			<p>When&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/21/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review/">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a> launched, Kazutaka Kodaka joked that his studio Tookyo Games might go bankrupt if the game didn’t do well. Thankfully, the massive visual novel experience ended up doing so well he later clarified that the team no longer felt that bankruptcy was a possibility. Despite that, it felt like it might take a miracle for the team to be able to put out another game if they were so close to shuttering after completing this one. As it turns out, Kazutaka Kodaka treated us like the victims in his own infamous twist-filled mystery thriller games. He quickly announced the development of a new game alongside DMM Games and Spike Chunsoft where the gimmick is that it is actually five different games in one – and that smorgasbord title is called Shuten Order.</p>
<p><iframe title="SHUTEN ORDER Gameplay Intro Trailer (Nintendo Switch, Steam)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JLlfmevjGAk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While I loved&nbsp;The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;a lot, it felt all too familiar as a fan of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/danganronpa">Danganronpa</a>&nbsp;series. Perhaps that’s because it shares so much of a visual and auditory identity with those games. Perhaps it’s because the game kicks off with all-too-familiar mysteries of locked classrooms and quirky teens that it drags it’s feet expanding into truly original ideas. None of it was bad, just familiar.&nbsp;Shuten Order,&nbsp;by comparison, is a revelation.</p>


<p>It finally feels like Kazutaka Kodaka is doing something fresh and new with this game, and there’s a lot of reasons for that. For one, the entire plot setup is refreshingly unique – our protagonist wakes up in a mysterious hotel room with no memory of their identity or their past. Two self-proclaimed angels tell her that she has been murdered, but they placed her in a new temporary body and have given her the alias of Rei with the goal of completing “God’s trial”. The task? Interrogate five key members from a mysterious organization known as Shuten Order, discover which of them is our killer, then get them to confess. Oh, and kill them too.</p>


<p>In the opening hours of&nbsp;Shuten Order,&nbsp;layers of dubious explanations and hauntingly under-explained world details are stacked on top of each other at a staggering rate. Before you can even question who these angels are if they’re real, you’re also grappling with learning that you live in a city-state founded by a religious cult – then, before the dubiousness of that can even sink in, it’s hinted that the world outside of this mini-country is a literal apocalypse. Despite the ominous circumstances of the game’s world, the streets are lined with confetti and festival banners celebrating the heroes of the Shuten Order. A cutscene shows you the celebrations playing out, but the cacophony quickly goes from just loud to overbearingly chaotic – voices and cheers and sounds overlap in an overwhelming, barely decipherable mess.</p>
<p>There’s a really hauntingly beautiful sort of cluttered chaos to the entire aesthetic of the game that is unlike anything else I’ve seen. Stylish title cards outlining the day and time explode onto the screen regularly, and when your protagonist uses the mysterious “power of God” to make unexpected miracles or coincidences occur, a terrifying animatic of inhuman language and shapes and sounds pops onto screen that seems to represent some kind of representation of whatever god is helping you. Most of the game is represented by talking character portraits and subtly stylised text boxes that look like a regular video game, but when these alarming animatics pop in, it really adds to this sense of urgency and strangeness that elevates the game so much.</p>

<p>Your guardian angels prompt you to pick one of the five leaders of the Shuten Order to identify as your killer – the implication is that your choice is guided by divine will, and whoever you pick&nbsp;is&nbsp;the killer. Whoever you pick also dictates an entirely different gameplay experience you’ll be going through as you investigate their secrets and hunt their confession. Kishiru Inugami makes you play an Ace Attorney-style investigation game. Yugen Ushitora has you playing an all-too-familiar death game escape adventure. Teko Ion’s route takes the form of a flowchart-exploring non-linear visual novel.&nbsp;Honoka Kokushikan’s route is a high-stress twist on a dating sim visual novel. Most striking of all, though is Manji Fushicho’s story – which isn’t a 2D visual novel genre-spin at all, but instead a fully 3D top-down stealth horror game.</p>
<p>I started off with Honoka Kokushikan’s route, intrigued by the idea of a romantic adventure, but I was initially disappointed by how it felt identical to the base game. Characters joke about how “different” the world looks once you step into her route, but all that’s really changed is that your text boxes are a slightly different shape. Thankfully, over the course of her 6-ish hour route, a lot of unique gameplay ideas start to crop up and you’re given a satisfying amount of freedom to explore the weirdness of the route. Each of the five routes clocks in at a similar length of time, and they all do a surprisingly good job of fully committing to their bits and giving you a full-games worth of mechanical depth and mix-ups. About half the routes feel whole enough in terms of narrative to come across as their own intriguing little mystery games, but the other half are so clearly part of a larger puzzle and don’t fully stand up on their own. Special shout-out to Yugen Ushitora’s escape-room route, because it’s inexplicably formatted like a vtuber livestream with a 3D anime girl reacting to everything in the corner while her chat pops off above her head.</p>

<p>As a complete experience, Shuten Order does unfortunately fall into a very similar trap as a lot of other works by Kazutaka Kodaka – there are really fascinating ideas and twists presented in the game, but character dialogue is so overbearing in repeatedly explaining and clarifying every interaction that it feels like this sometimes-exhausting 50 hour experience could have been a much swifter, snappier, and more satisfying 30-35 hour adventure. Like his other games though, the sheer creativity and one-of-a-kind aesthetic in this game ends up making the sometimes mind-numbing dialogue worth digging through. Shuten Order blends quiet tension with loud and anxiety-inducing frights perfectly without ever even acting like it’s a horror game. It isn’t, except for that one route where it is. It’s just an amalgamation of overwhelming sights and sounds that’s equal parts beautiful and confusing. It’s an uncompromising experience, and one I won’t forget for a long time.</p>

<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158306/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Leave it up to Kazutaka Kodaka to come up with one of the weirdest stories in gaming, huh?</p>
<p>Following on from the outrageously ambitious <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>, the creator has now joined forces with developer Neilo on the new visual novel <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shuten_order">Shuten Order</a>. I say ‘visual novel’, and that’s absolutely the overarching genre, but it also manages to feature five distinct sub-genres within its surprisingly lengthy story. Wild stuff.</p>
<p>Shuten Order itself is the titular cult obsessed with the idea that humanity itself is doomed. In fact, the cult not only believes that the end of times is at hand, but is actively <em>wishing</em> for it, rejecting any notion of an afterlife or an all-seeing deity. In what can only be described as divine intervention, however, its founder awakens following their brutal murder, seemingly resurrected to track down the culprit. If that’s not enough, two angels also accompany you throughout the game to provide advice and guidance. Could the cult be...wrong?</p>
<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158308/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>With just a few days on the clock before your resurrection ‘expires’, you’re tasked with completing ‘God’s Trial’: identify your murderer, get them to confess, and then, well… kill them. The potential suspects are limited to just five individuals: Shuten Order’s ministers, each of whom presides over a specific department. So you’ve got the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education, and so on.</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen which of the five ministers to accuse of your murder, you’ll have to pursue them and try to gain a confession, and it’s here where the gameplay diverges into one of five sub-genres.</p>
<p>I started with the Ministry of Security, which essentially sees you working to solve the mystery of a deadly entity called ‘Nephilim’, a grotesque creature that stalks its prey and gouges their eyes out. Lovely stuff. The Security path sees you navigate a series of labyrinths set in different locations as you progress through the story. It’s mostly a case of finding an item or activating a switch and then making it to a final destination without being caught by Nephilim, who constantly shuffles along the corridors. It’s shallow stuff with some pretty basic 3D visuals, and on its own doesn’t really hold up all that well.</p>
<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158313/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, the same could very well be said for every sub-genre: The Ministry of Education focuses on a romance story in which you need to woo three women within a typical school setting; The Ministry of Health is an escape adventure focused around a ‘death game’ that fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danganronpa_decadence">Danganronpa</a> will no doubt appreciate; The Ministry of Justice is a straightforward investigation in which you need to gather clues and deduce the correct course of action; and finally, The Ministry of Science is a multi-perspective visual novel that features several ‘protagonists’.</p>
<p>None of the gameplay tropes feel particularly new, and pretty much all of them can be seen in Kodaka’s previous work, but I guess you could say that this is the first time they’ve all been cobbled together in one single game. With that in mind, if you’re familiar with the likes of Dangaronpa or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/zero_escape_virtues_last_reward">Zero Escape</a>, then much of Shuten Order will be pretty familiar territory.</p>
<p>Despite the marketing push to highlight the different sub-genres, the overarching story is really the main draw here. As you start to unravel the mystery, you’ll meet some seriously entertaining characters along the way, and Kodaka’s writing alongside illustrator simadoriru’s visual design is consistently striking and unique.</p>
<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158317/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Where Shuten Order begins to falter is in its execution of those sub-genres. Kodaka <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/unsettling-yet-captivating-shuten-order-creators-talk-cult-religion-and-dismemberment">has stated</a> his ambition to present a “culmination of all the visual novels I've ever read”, and it’s certainly an ambitious attempt, but the approach here screams ‘Jack of all trades’.</p>
<p>The five different branches wind up feeling little more than a novelty, and not a particularly compelling one. I mentioned how the Security path features basic visuals, but this is nothing compared to how simple and mundane the actual gameplay is. The devs want you to feel nervous as you avoid the gaze of Nephilim, but there's zero challenge, and it ends up just being a nuisance.</p>
<p>Similarly, the romance path has you searching (stalking?) for your potential date, with the game presenting multiple locations to visit, but not giving much indication as to where you actually need to go. So you wind up just guessing until you reach the right goal, forced to engage in random NPC conversations if you happen to search in the wrong place. This isn't a game that respects your time.</p>
<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158309/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s not a short one, either. The length will vary depending on how much you’re willing to invest in the story and investigate every possible avenue, but each of the five narrative branches could easily take you 10 hours or so. At a total of 50, Shuten Order felt quite bloated and would have benefited from focusing on just one or two key gameplay hooks to tell its story. Coming off the back of The Hundred Line, which demonstrated an exceptionally strong combination of visual novel storytelling and tactical gameplay, the attempt to showcase several different genres here means that none of them are really able to shine.</p>
<p>What <em>does</em> shine, however, is the visual design. Shuten Order displays exceptional use of colour that really sets it apart from other visual novels, and the juxtaposition of the striking blues, yellows, and pinks against a story steeped in misery and despair is particularly notable.</p>
<p>Similarly, the music is consistently engaging, shifting in tone at all the right moments, while the Japanese voiceover work never falters. There’s no Western VO here, however, so you’re out of luck if you happen to prefer your Japanese visual novels dubbed.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it all runs well on the Switch, with reasonably short load times. If you happen to be playing on the Switch 2, then you won't find any issues with performance, but you should note that character illustrations at certain distances can look almost pixelated, slightly – a simple symptom of blowing up the Switch 1 game's handled resolution on the larger 1080p screen. If you can, play it on the Switch OLED; the colours look simply marvellous on that stunning display.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Shuten Order is an ambitious visual novel that tells an intriguing story with consistently engaging characters and more than a few twists and turns. Unfortunately, with the inclusion of five distinct forms of gameplay driving the story, it ultimately feels bloated and directionless, and not one of the sub-genre sections is polished enough to stand on its own two feet.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly commend the audacious, multi-genre effort, but Shuten Order would have benefited from a lot more focus.</p></section>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duskers">Duskers</a> developers Misfit Attic have revealed Below The Crown, a chess-flavoured fantasy roguelike with an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a>-style meta-layer and some sexy 80s CRT visuals. You are a wizard, tasked with Gathering A Party and braving an offbrand Tron dungeon to retrieve some gold. Your upgradeable party members are based on chess units, and each floor of the dungeon is a grid-based combat puzzle inspired by classic chess manouevres like Forks and Pins. Here's a trailer.

<p>
Misfits Attic founder Tim Keenan calls it a "gateway drug into chess", but the press release often seems more eager to dunk on chess than celebrate it, as it straddles the line of being "accessible for newcomers and compelling for experts". They want to sell people on the wonders of chess, a beautiful abstract strategy game that dates back hundreds of years, while also reassuring a younger generation of nerds that Below The Crown is absolutely nothing like chess, a stupid non-computer game played by losers that doesn't even have any magic spells in it. 
</p>
<p>
"Forget memorized openings, drawn-out endgames, and stalemates," it reads. "Start with one piece, a badass wizard, instead of 16 - and bid the tedium of analysis paralysis adieu." Sayonara, chess, you monstrous waste of perfectly good timber! I love you. You're an awful experience and I hope all of my friends get hooked on you. Let's kiss with tongues, you embarrassing plod.
</p><p>
Chess aside, Below The Crown is billed as a "thinking person's roguelike" in the style of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a>, which seems a bit mean to other roguelikes. I consider the roguelike a fairly cerebral genre by default. It's not like saying "thinking person's ballpit", is it. "Make smart plays to capture enemies and survive an ever-changing dungeon," the press release goes on. "Imbue the party with abilities like Vision for placement flexibility or Shadow Protection, granting a shield while on a dark tile. Acquire spell cards and skills to ramp up throughout a run, collecting gold to sate the Emperor, but also finding mysterious runes along the way..."
</p>
<p>
That dot-dot-dotting probably pertains to the aforesaid Inscryption-esque meta-layer, which sees you pulling back from a computer <em>within</em> the computer to answer enigmatic corporate queries. "From daily stress surveys to strange ranking rituals, the game isn't afraid to break the fourth wall and surprise the player with unexpected weirdness," the press release adds. I am making a note, "expect weirdness". Keenan also calls Below The Crown a "massively singleplayer experience", with a custom board editor and the ability to share your creations online.
</p>
<p>
I will forgive all this frenzied marketing footwork because Misfits Attic are the creators of Duskers - a lonely Lieutenant Gorman simulator, and solid candidate for the title of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">best space game</a>. According to me, anyway: whoever last edited that Best Of didn't include it, and they didn't put it on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">best horror games</a>, either. Philistines! 

</p><p>Misfits recently announced that they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/duskers-is-getting-a-ship-building-sequel-years-after-the-sci-fi-roguelike-scared-us-to-bits">making a "spiritual successor" to Duskers</a> featuring ship-building, under the working title "Humanity 2.0". They're also making a "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a> lite" in which you try to manipulate enemy factions into fighting each other. Certainly, they've got a lot going on these days.

</p><p>
Below The Crown will launch on PC via Steam Early Access in Q4 2025, and there's a demo coming in this October's Steam Next Fest. Read more on the aforesaid <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1883920/Below_the_Crown/">Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve’s extremely popular PC gaming store Steam is now requiring users in the United Kingdom to <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">verify their age</a> using a credit card. This is a direct result of the UK’s controversial Online Safety Act.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-steam-users-must-now-verify-age-to-access-store-pages-for-mature-games-thanks-to-online-safety-act">As of August 29, as spotted by <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, it looks like Valve is now requiring that all users in the United Kingdom verify how old they are before they will be able to access mature video games. <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">Valve has also updated its official Steam Support website</a> with new information about age verification, telling UK users that “in order to access Steam store pages for mature content games,” they’ll need to go through an “opt-in process” that requires age verification via credit card. Going through this process will “trigger a £0 authorization” on the card to check if it’s active and real.</p> <p>Valve says that as long as the credit card stored on the Steam account is valid, the account is considered “age verified.” So you should only have to do this once. Hopefully.</p> <p>According to the updated Steam Support website, Valve “reviewed” all age verification methods and determined that using a credit card preserved “the maximum degree of user privacy” compared to some other sites and services that use AI-powered facial scanning tech.</p> <p>“The data processed in the verification process is identical to that of the millions of other Steam users who make purchases or store their payment details for convenience,” explained Valve on the website. “The verification process therefore provides no information about a user’s content preferences to payment providers or other third parties.

<p>You can earn free Battlefield 6 goodies from Battlefield 2042. The problem is that the grind is slow, and players have complained. In keeping with EA’s recent acknowledgment of player feedback, Battlefield 2042 players can expect regular double—and triple XP—weekends every weekend moving forward.</p>



<p>The Battlefield Team has once again heard your cries. The community has lamented how long it takes to level up the Battlefield 2042 Free Battlepass to obtain <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> items. If you like your double XP weekends, your day is about to get much better.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-rewards-will-be-easier-to-get-with-battlefield-2042-double-xp">Battlefield 6 Rewards Will Be Easier To Get With Battlefield 2042 Double XP</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Still a grind, but less of one. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>An August 29 update from the Battlefield Team (through <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Comms</a>) has recognized the negative noise surrounding the Free Battlepass in Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>Here’s what the team has had to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’ve heard your concerns that you might have missed out on an XP weekend already, or might miss one of the upcoming ones, making it harder to catch up and get all the items from the Free Battlepass you’ve wanted. We therefore will have a double XP events every weekend until the Free Battlepass ends on October 7. Additionally, the last two weekends will feature triple XP gains, so keep those circled in your calendar!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s right: Double XP every weekend basically until Battlefield 6 launches, and the occasional triple XP weekend for good measure.</p>



<p>There are countless items for you to earn in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-road-to-battlefield-6-pass-all-exclusive-bf6-rewards-how-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Pass</a>. The more you earn now, the greater your haul of cosmetics and bonuses by the time Battlefield 6 finally makes its way around.</p>







<p>Is this going to make you complete the entire Free Battlepass for BF6 bonuses? Is this a smart move from EA, showing that it’s prepared to listen to players ahead of Battlefield 6’s launch?

"We showcased them in a series of hands on presentations attracting praise from the player community and gaming media. And although we clearly see that sales of the on the new console are currently dominated by Nintendo’s first party titles, we were very pleased with Cyberpunk being among the best selling third party games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Switch 2 might pack much better hardware than the original, but a game I’m still surprised to see running at all (much less pretty well) on a Nintendo system is Cyberpunk 2077," we wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-review-update"><u>Nintendo Switch 2 Cyberpunk 2007 review update</u></a>.

<p>A frame rate brawl</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>SEGA popped up in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">July Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> to reveal that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Kiwami 2</a> would be brawling their way onto Switch 2 on <strong>13th November</strong>. Of course, the former is already available on Switch 1, but this new release promised improved graphics and frame rates, alongside some bonus language options.</p>
<p>The announcement was all well and good, but we haven't seen anything from either game in the month since — and when it comes to titles that are already available on other platforms like these, we're particularly interested to see how they'll run on the fresh hardware. Well, SEGA has the answer.</p>
<p>The publisher recently dedicated roughly 40 minutes of a livestream to showcasing Kiwami and Kiwami 2 Switch 2 gameplay, and both look really rather strong. Now yes, the frame rate displayed in the first game is not quite as "improved" as we were led to believe in the Direct announcement, but perhaps it's just a capture issue? Who knows! Kiwami 2 appears that bit smoother (starting around the 25-minute mark), so let's roll with that example.</p>
<p>Let's not forget that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a> slotted itself into nicely into the Switch 2's launch line-up, providing some sweet 4K/60fps goodness to the series' oft-recommended starting place. If Kiwami 1 and 2 can offer more of the same on the console when we get to play the entire thing in November, then we'll be very happy indeed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><span>officially the most-streamed English movie in Netflix’s catalog</span></a><span>. It is one of the most surprising success stories of the year. A completely original animated musical has captured the hearts and minds of audiences, all while Sony and Netflix were woefully unprepared for it to blow up the way it has. It debunks conjecture that people aren’t interested in original animated features, and now that it has, we can examine why projects by Pixar, once the&nbsp; top dog in animation, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pixar-best-movies-toy-story-nemo-incredibles-inside-out-1851785148"><span>haven’t hit the same way they used to</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Elio</span></i><span>, Pixar’s sci-fi </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anime-manga-genre-isekai-enter-oxford-dictionary-1851375582"><span>pseudo-isekai</span></a><span> film about an orphaned boy looking for family among aliens, had the company’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/elio-worst-box-office-bad-pixar-disney-dragon-weekend-1851784926"><span>worst-ever box office debut</span></a><span> back in June, and as Pixar’s original movies continue to flounder and fail to gain an audience while a sequel like </span><i><span>Inside Out 2 </span></i><span>can be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ne-zha-2-inside-out-2-box-office-record-2-billion-china-1851765730"><span>one of the highest-grossing animated films of all time</span></a><span>, the narrative increasingly becomes “people don’t want original stories or ones too specific to a certain lived experience.” Well, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>is a brand new story based in Korean mythology and is topping the charts for both movies and music, so that’s obviously not true. What’s the difference? Well, one </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>artist has a theory.</span></p> <p><span>Radford Sechrist is a story artist on </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>, as well as the husband of director Maggie Kang. Sometimes he posts about art and animation on TikTok, and he had some insight as to why </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>has been so successful while movies like </span><i><span>Elio</span></i><span> and even </span><i><span>The Bad Guys 2</span></i><span>, which had a pretty significant drop in box office after its opening weekend, are struggling. Sechrist says that even though a lot of animated movies are marketed as “all-ages,” only so many of them are truly aiming for adults as well as kids. He then goes on to argue that, in order for an animated film to become a big pop culture phenomenon, it has to target people in their 20s and up, and it will then naturally trickle down to children through platforms like YouTube and TikTok.</span></p>

   <p><span>“I think the issue is that kids only watch shows where they’re seeing people talking about it on YouTube, and the people talking about it on YouTube are in their 20s,” Sechrist says. “So if you’re developing a movie, you kind of have to think about people in their 20s first before the kids will even hear of the movie. So things like anime, </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, you have to sort of shoot for that age of demographic and you have to get people in their 20s excited so they’re talking about it. Then the kids will see that, and as long as you don’t put anything in the movie that’s too much for a kid—but let’s be honest, there’s like 5-year-olds watching </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>.”</span></p> <p><span>Sechrist points out that some of the most notable exceptions to this are in animation targeting pre-school children, or in shows like </span><i><span>Bluey</span></i><span>, which are aimed at children but engage in enough adult themes that parents gladly watch the show alongside their kids. Anecdotally, when I went to see </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>its singalong screenings</span></a><span>, the kid to adult ratio in the crowds wasn’t exactly lopsided. I went with a group of adults, and we weren’t the only childless party at those screenings. My friend even joked that she forgot the movie was “for kids” until we arrived at the theater because its fandom has transcended age. That speaks to the truth of Sechrist’s theory that </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ adult appeal, which it establishes through adult themes, quality animation, and music you’d actually listen to outside of the movie, has helped it break past the “kids movie” bubble that movies like </span><i><span>Elio</span></i><span> may be stuck in. He says that he would encourage Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks, and anyone else working on an animated property to consider if something is reaching the 20s-and-up demographic, or if they want it to be so specific in its younger audience that it never escapes those trappings.</span></p> <p><span>Pixar’s box office trajectory has become a big topic in conversations about the state of animation writ large, but some nuance is lost when you ignore that several of Pixar’s movies have been released on Disney+ alongside a limited theatrical release in the years since the covid-19 pandemic. In any case, Pixar’s upcoming projects are pretty sequel heavy, with </span><i><span>Toy Story 5</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Incredibles 3</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Coco 2</span></i><span> all in the works. The studio’s next movie, an </span><i><span>Avatar</span></i><span>-like story called </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hoppers-trailer-pixar-animation-teaser-inside-out-2-1851786456"><i><span>Hoppers</span></i></a><span>, is coming to theaters on March 6.</span></p>

              <p>I’ve purchased few collector’s editions in my time. I never know where I’m gonna put the damn things, I often end up selling the stuff later on, and, well, sometimes you hear and see horror stories that dissuade you from shelling out two or three times the cost of a game to just get some ugly plastic junk. Sadly, it seems that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269">excellent <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta</i></a> has that very problem, with its special edition containing a diorama that sounds neat in practice, but is actually pretty ugly and disappointing according to fans.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269"><i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.konami.com/games/us/en/topics/2529/">Advertised as a pretty neat-looking diorama</a> of a memorable scene from early in <i>Snake Eater</i> when Snake has to recover his backpack from a hanging tree branch, fans on r/metalgearsolid are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n2na11/mgs_delta_collectors_edition_is_trash/">sharing their disappointment</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n2y9gf/that_200_is_feeling_way_worse/">with the actual product</a>. The foliage not only doesn’t match what was advertised, but in some cases it looks like it was just tossed in there, with some stuff laying on its side. Oh, and the model of Snake? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n2qr02/major_do_you_read_me_this_is_snek/">Yeesh</a>. I’ll also add that Snake is supposed to call Major Zero on the radio <i>after</i> he gets the backpack, so like omg this scene just totally disrespects the lore.</p>   <p>If you managed to get your hands on the Japanese or European versions of <i>Delta</i>’s collector’s edition, however, you likely have a much prettier piece of shelf decoration. In Japan it retails for 38,500 yen or around 260 bucks, a bit more than it did here, but the bust of Snake it comes with isn’t just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n3a9kd/the_collector_eu_is_beautiful/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">satisfyingly detailed</a>, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n2sipk/snake_finally_complete/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">the pale viper wrapped around him</a> <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-japan-collectors-edition-includes-snake-bust/">as matches the advertisements</a>; it also features a lovely reference to one of the game’s ending scenes in the white and red flowers blooming around its base.</p>   <p>So if you’re an <i>MGS</i> sicko like myself, and you do have shelf space to spare, definitely figure out how you can get your hands on the overseas version of this collector’s edition.</p>

<p>Albeit a port of an older game, Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the big third-party launch titles for the Nintendo Switch 2. And while the game was both available in both digital and physical form, players clearly had a preference for how they wanted the game.</p>



<p>In its latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/08/cd-projekt-group-presentation-h1-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings report</a>, CD Projekt Red revealed that of the game’s sales on the console, more than 75% of players bought the physical version of Cyberpunk 2077. </p>



<p>CD Projekt Red joint CEO Michał Novakovski believes that the game sold well physically on the system because they included the full game, including the Phantom Liberty expansion, on the 64GB game card. Novakovski said that they believe players find the “plug and play experience” attractive. He added that the Switch 2 enhancements for the game helped push it to a new audience, but he does think digital sales will pick up moving forward.</p>



<p><strong>“This dominance of physical sales continues into the current quarter with additional stock orders coming in,”</strong> he said. <strong>“In the long run, we expect the breakdown of sales between these channels to reflect our past experiences with the share of digital sales progressively increasing as time goes by. It’s worth noting that physical and digital sales channels have different economics. Digital sales naturally yield higher net revenue, while physical copies involve additional manufacturing and packaging costs as well as distributor fees.”</strong></p>

<p>Battlefield 6 brings back Battlefield 2042’s popular Portal game mode. If you can’t wait until BF6’s launch to see what it features, a Battlefield 6 Portal gameplay footage leak has given us all a sneak peek of what to expect—did someone say Battlefield 6 meets Only Up?</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> has returned. With the open beta now way behind us, it’s time for Labs participants to get back into testing and ensure the FPS sequel is primed and ready for its October launch. But, like with Labs before, you can expect leaked footage to appear from time to time. A new video has surfaced showing off Battlefield 6’s revamped Portal mode.</p>







<figure><figcaption>No limits to your imagination. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>EA and Battlefield Studios are promising some wild scenes with the new and improved Portal mode. Players can build their own maps, and as we’ve seen in a new leak from <a href="https://x.com/TheBFWire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Wire</a>—even homages to hit indie games.</p>



<p>A full 5-minute video shows off Battlefield 6’s Portal mode in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-testing-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returning Labs test</a>. It’s not the most compelling footage, admittedly, and will be a mere taste of the creations and chaos the community is bound to concoct. But in the video, the tester has assembled a mammoth-sized structure, intricately designed to be climbed.</p>



<p>Comments on the video compare the footage to that of Only Up—the viral 2023 game in which you have to climb an entire landscape until you reach the top, risking total failure if you fall. Once at the top, the Battlefield 6 player looks down, and a full-blown firefight is taking place atop the structure.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> is just days away from launching, and to kick off the next era of the looter-shooter, developer Gearbox has released a new live-action trailer urging people to "quit" Earth and head to Kairos. Sure, Kairos is a planet ruled by an all-powerful dictator who enforces his whims on the population with invasive behavior-altering technology that has a high likelihood of killing you if it's removed, but compared to everything else happening right now--*frantically waves arms*--that's not a dealbreaker.</p><p>The gap between Borderlands 4 being officially announced and its arrival on PC and console has been relatively short. Gearbox first showed off the game--after hinting at it for months--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-during-opening-night-live-coming-2025/1100-6525977/">during the 2024 edition of Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, teasing a new world for Vault Hunters to explore and even more loot to grab as they fight against the sinister forces in control of Kairos.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKjgWa7cpCI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dKjgWa7cpCI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The last few months have seen Gearbox reveal a substantial number of details about the game, including detailed looks at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/" data-ref-id="2900-6583">four Vault Hunters</a> players will have the option of playing as. There's the science-powered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-finally-introduces-harlowe-the-teams-own-mad-scientist/1100-6534213/">Harlowe</a>, walking Tediore weapons advert <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-character-short-introduces-rafas-violent-past/1100-6533568/">Rafa</a>, not-so-gentle giant <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-character-short-introduces-amon-and-his-vault-monster-killing-arsenal/1100-6533957/">Amon</a>, and the Siren <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-trailers-introduce-latest-siren-character-show-off-necromancer-abilities/1100-6533123/">Vex</a> for this new adventure.</p><p>Gearbox also recently spoke about the tone of the game, and how the studio strived to create a grounded sense of humor. Surprisingly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-developers-credit-borderlands-3-dlcs-for-inspiring-the-sequels-tone/1100-6534241/">the Borderlands 3 expansions served as a big source of inspiration</a>.

		<p>Valve has announced a new process for validating the age of users and comply with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/25/welcome-to-the-new-internet/">UK’s controversial Online Safety Act</a>. Thankfully, Valve’s path to confirm your age is much less intrusive than the one we’ve seen many social media companies and tech giants taking.</p>
<p>From now on, UK-based users looking to visit Steam store pages for mature rated games and their community hubs will require you to be logged into an active user account and opt-in for mature content. This does mean there’s no more blindly clicking through a quick date picker without logging in, which was useful for casually browsing.</p>


<p>Of course, this will now need a new process to verify a user’s age, and in the UK your age is considered verified so long as there is a valid credit or debit card stored on the account – while Valve stated “credit card”, banks issue different debit cards to customers who are above and below 18 years of age and perform age and identity checks for their accounts, so they should still provide the same age checks in this process.</p>
<p>This stands in stark contrast to AI-based age guesstimation using phone cameras – some of which were initially fooled by the photo mode in Death Stranding – or demands for passport and drivers licenses to validate. Steam is a storefront, so it’s reasonable to expect a payment method for validation. As excessive as the legislation is, both for the demands being imposed on companies, users and online communities and for the dampening effect this has on important kinds of speech and knowledge, this is a relatively low key approach from Valve.</p>
<p>It is, however, a shame that other options are not available. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/xbox-adds-age-verification-in-the-uk-for-the-online-safety-act/">Age verification on Xbox is to be fully enforced from early 2026</a>, and you can prove your age using government-issued ID, age estimation, mobile provider check, or credit card checks. I’d like to see Valve add mobile checks as well – you need to provide a phone number as part of adding a credit card anyway, and that’s also a decent datapoint.</p>

<p>Valve commits to processing this data in a manner that is identical to their rest of its data processing for purchases and payments, using an internal payment processing system that meets PCI-DSS standards. If, however, your given card fails the age check, you will need to contact your bank and go through a Steam support process.</p>
<p>Here’s the process for Steam users to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your Steam user account.</li>
<li>Visit the Account Details page and click the button labeled “Add a Payment method to this account”.</li>
<li>You will be redirected to a form where you are asked to enter your credit card details.<br>
Required inputs:
<ul>
<li>Credit Card type</li>
<li>Credit card number</li>
<li>CVV</li>
<li>Expiry date</li>
<li>Name and billing address</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click “Continue” to trigger a £0 authorization.</li>
<li>You will be presented with a challenge that is determined by your card issuing bank’s policies, e.g. via one-time-password (OTP) or via app.</li>
<li>If the process is successful, you can now choose to add previously unavailable mature content types on the Store Preferences page.</li>
</ol>

<figure><a title="Fear Effect" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/31abc5797e520/fear-effect.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Limited Run Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Almost out of the blue, Limited Run Games' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fear_effect">Fear Effect</a> port has arrived on the Switch eShop... right now! Yep, you can go and download the PS1 classic from the eShop for just <strong>$9.99 / £8.99</strong> (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/fear-effect-for-ps5-ps4-switch-and-pc-now-available">Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>The release comes with almost no fanfare, as neither Limited Run Games nor developer Implicit Conversions (who is working with Atari and Digital Eclipse on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>) have said anything about the game dropping today at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Still, we thought it was coming as the game arrived on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/08/cult-classic-ps1-adventure-fear-effect-is-suddenly-available-on-ps5-ps4">PS4 and PS5 earlier today</a> with the same lack of fanfare — some people thought it was even a mistake.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rluqjp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>We've actually known about this rerelease for a while, as Limited Run Games <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/acclaimed-ps1-hit-fear-effect-is-coming-to-switch-in-2025">announced it last year</a>, but it's been radio silence ever since. Now we've got the game on a Nintendo console for the first time ever.</p>
<p>In case you haven't heard of the game before, Fear Effect is a 2000 PS1 game that pioneered cel-shaded visuals and looping FMV backgrounds, which forced the game to be shipped on four discs. While the controls and gameplay received mild criticism at the time, the narrative, writing, and visuals were all lauded, and the game has become a bit of a classic for PlayStation fans.</p>

            <p>Are you sitting down, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>? It's alright. I've just got...some news I need to tell you. There's no easy way to say this. A modder's decided to put a bunch of Fortnitey emotes and dances inside you.</p>
<p>We can see the likes of dabs, the NaeNae, and even a stanky legg on the scans. They're cranking it, spanking that, and Snoop Dogging all over your internal organs too. There's nothing we could have done. That surgery which ported you from 2006 to 2025 increased the risk of this drastically, but how else were 12 year olds supposed to learn about the need to CLOSE SHUT THE JAWS OF OBLIVION?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We could rage against the cause of these symptoms, modder CosmicBoogaloo with their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/5039?tab=description">Dance and Emote Animation Pack</a>. We could curse them in the name of the divines, of the Aedra, or even the Daedra. We could subjugate ourselves before Dagon himself, calling on his lust for revolution to grant us the malign powers required to reverse this regrettable chain of events.</p>
<p>We could crusade with the fury of Pelinal Whitestrake against any and all who download the mod, and go on to press one of the keys it assigns a Fortnitey dance or emote to. We could cast their characters, mid-subtle dab or weird bottomless twerk, into the fiery pits of The Deadlands, where they'd inevitably float around going 'UGGGH', 'OOOOAGGHH', and 'NYYYYUUGGHHH'.</p>

<p>We could outlaw its 19 emotes and 20 dances, including the ability to make it rain despite the fact that this province lacks paper money and criss crosses you can dougie into a running man before movin' like Bernie. We could instruct every legion guard to stop violators of this anti-taunting legislation with deadly force. We could yell from the summit of the White-Gold Tower: 'You there in the Arena district, cease flexing those muscles and woohooing at once, or else incur the wrath of mighty Akatosh!'</p>
<p>We could do all of that, but it wouldn't matter. Those who wish to use this profane mod have likely already grabbed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/UE4SS%20for%20Oblivion%20Remastered">UE4SS</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1172">Simple BP Mod Loader</a>. </p>
<p>The dabbage is irreversible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Some of my favorite games of all time.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Labor Day weekend is a great time to get together with the family, sure, but it's also a nice little three-day window to get some serious gaming in. Assuming you don't already have a massive backlog of PC games to play, now is actually a pretty good time of year to find some video game deals. If you're looking to pick up a new game before the weekend arrives, you've got options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're in between major Steam sales at the moment, but another big PC games sale going on right now is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Dlm?object_uuid=57482acb-3f94-473a-b83a-8fac5977e551&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Humble Bundle Summer Sale</a>. There are a ton of discounted games here at prices that will last through the weekend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something great under $10, I've got some recommendations for you. Each of these games I've listed are wonderful for different reasons, but every single one of them are worth playing for hours at a time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PC Games Under $10</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">My first pick might not be for everyone, but it's one of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-of-my-favorite-pc-games-of-all-time-is-super-cheap-during-the-humble-bundle-summer-sale">my favorite gaming experiences</a> of all time. It's hard to really go too into detail without ruining some of it, but it's essentially a roguelike deck-building card game with a twist of psychological horror. If any of that sounds interesting to you, it's best to just start playing without learning more. Going in cold is the best way to play this game.</p><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227072"><div id="227072" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Inscryption</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Next on this list is what has become one of the best indie games of all time. I was genuinely surprised how much I liked Hollow Knight. I don't usually like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/genre/metroidvania">metroidvania games</a>, but it has a sort of sad, dark charm that really drew me in. The gameplay is fun and the battles can get difficult, but the atmosphere of this game keeps you engaged at every turn. With the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">Hollow Knight sequel releasing next week</a>, now is a great time to jump into the original.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227443"><div id="227443" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hollow Knight</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't really feel the need to say much about The Witcher 3, because of course it's worth playing. CD Projekt Red's masterpiece is one of those rare games that I've ended up playing through multiple times. While it's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-books-reading-order">Witcher books</a> that ultimately birthed this franchise, it's really this game that made it a household name. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher 4</a> somewhere on the horizon, its as good a time as any to start your Witcher 3 journey for the first time.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227445"><div id="227445" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a PC gamer who also happens to be a Nintendo gamer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bug-fables-the-everlasting-sapling">Bug Fables</a> is one of those games that hits a very specific sweet spot. It's a turn-based RPG that has an eerily similar look and feel as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/paper-mario">original Paper Mario game</a>. It's a storybook adventure with puzzles and battles that has a fun overarching story. If you love games like Paper Mario and Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, you'll love Bug Fables.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227446"><div id="227446" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My last recommendation is the cheapest and shortest game on this list. Gris is a beautiful platformer game with some fun puzzles and stunning artwork. This game tells a story of grief and loss, and these feelings unfold through an incredible use of color, music, and gameplay. You can <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/62257" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">play through the whole thing in a few hours</a>, and it's definitely worth paying $2.99 for what you'll get from it. This is one of those games that hit me surprisingly hard.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227447"><div id="227447" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gris</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">See all PC games on sale for under $10</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The games I've listed here are just some of my favorites, but there's actually a lot more in the sale that are worth a look.

<p>Today's video game consoles are hundreds of dollars more expensive than you'd expect based on historic pricing trends. That's according to an Ars Technica analysis of decades of pricing data and price-cut timing across dozens of major US console releases.</p>
<p>The overall direction of this trend has been apparent to industry watchers for a while now. Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft have failed to cut their console prices in recent years and have instead been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-raises-planned-switch-2-accessory-prices-amid-tariff-uncertainty/">increasing</a> the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/microsoft-raises-prices-on-xbox-hardware-says-some-holiday-games-will-be-80/">nominal MSRP</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/sony-joins-xbox-and-nintendo-in-hiking-playstation-5-prices-in-the-us/">many current consoles</a> in the past six months.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

<p>But when you crunch the numbers, it's pretty incredible just how much today's console prices defy historic expectations, even when you account for higher-than-normal inflation in recent years. If today's consoles were seeing anything like what used to be standard price cuts over time, we could be paying around $200 today for pricey systems like the Switch OLED, PS5 Digital Edition, and Xbox Series S.</p>
<h2>Crunching the numbers</h2>
<p>To determine the extent of today's relative console overpricing, we dug through old news reports, press releases, advertisements, and store catalogs for annual price data going back to the Atari 2600's launch in 1977. We used permanent MSRP announcements wherever possible so that temporary sales or store-specific closeouts wouldn't affect the data. If a console dropped in price multiple times in one year, we took the lowest price from that year. We then adjusted all the nominal prices for inflation to consistent July 2025 dollars using <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">BLM's CPI calculator</a>.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>Almost every classic console saw significant price drops by its second or third year on the market (and beyond).</span>
                    <span>

  </div>

<p>The resulting trendlines can be a bit noisy from console to console. Some classic consoles saw significant, drastic price drops after just a year on the market, often before disappearing from shelves altogether shortly afterward. Others stayed at their nominal launch price for a year or three, letting inflation slowly chip away at that value of those dollars before finally dropping the price as a way to bolster lagging sales for aging hardware.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Overall, though, you can see a clear and significant downward trend to the year-over-year pricing for game consoles released before 2016. After three years on the market, the median game console during this period cost less than half as much (on an inflation-adjusted basis) as it did at launch. Consoles that stuck around on the market long enough could expect further slow price erosion over time, until they were selling for roughly 43 percent of their launch price in year five and about 33 percent in year eight.</p>
<p>That kind of extreme price-cutting is a distant memory for today's game consoles. By year three, the median console currently on the market costs about 85 percent of its real launch price, thanks to the effects of inflation. By year five, that median launch price ratio for modern consoles actually <em>increases</em> to 92 percent, thanks to the nominal price increases that many consoles have seen in their fourth or fifth years on the market. And the eight-year-old Nintendo Switch is currently selling for about 86 percent of its inflation-adjusted launch price, or more than 50 percentage points higher than the median trend for earlier long-lived consoles.</p>

    <p><span>While the data is noisy, the overall trend in older console pricing over time is very clear.</span>

<p>To be fair, today's game consoles are not the most expensive the industry has ever seen. Systems like the Atari 2600, Intellivision, Neo Geo, and 3DO launched at prices that would be well over $1,000 in 2025 money. More recently, systems like the PS3 ($949.50 at launch in 2025 dollars) and Xbox One ($689.29 at launch in 2025 dollars) were significantly pricier than the $300 to $600 range that encompasses most of today's consoles.</p>

<p>But when classic consoles launched at such high prices, those prices never lasted very long. Even the most expensive console launches of the past dropped in price quickly enough that, by year three or so, they were down to inflation-adjusted prices comparable to today's consoles. And classic consoles that launched at more reasonable prices usually saw price cuts that took them well into the sub-$300 range (in 2025 dollars) within a few years, making them a relative bargain from today's perspective.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>What’s keeping prices high?</h2>
<p>So why are today's consoles staying so stubbornly resistant to historic price-drop trends? Higher-than-normal inflation in recent years explains some of the nominal price inflexibility, but nothing close to all of it. In fact, even when you adjust for inflation, some current consoles like the Xbox Series S and PS5 Pro are <em>more expensive</em> on a real basis today than they were on launch day.</p>
<p>The uncertainty and extra import costs of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/thanks-to-new-tariffs-many-more-physical-game-discs-may-simply-not-get-made/">Trump administration tariffs</a> definitely play some part in the change, as console makers obliquely reference by citing "market conditions" or a "challenging economic environment" in their price-raising announcements. But even before recent tariffs, modern console prices weren't dropping nearly as fast as history suggested they should. In fact, Sony first raised the nominal starting price of the PS5 Digital Edition <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/redesigned-ps5-models-slim-down-one-of-the-bulkiest-consoles-ever/">back in 2023</a>, way before Trump's current trade war was even on the horizon.</p>

      </figure>

<p>Some of that earlier price drop wariness could have been due to pandemic-related chip shortages, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/nintendo-warns-global-chip-shortage-to-hit-switch-production/">console makers</a> at the time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/sony-says-ps5-could-be-difficult-to-find-into-2022/">warned</a> were keeping hardware supplies well below demand. But all indications suggest those global supply chain effects were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/sony-expects-ps5-will-still-be-in-short-supply-until-2023/">more or less ameliorated by early 2023</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/low-semiconductor-supplies-may-not-be-the-main-reason-for-ps5-shortages/">may not have been as significant as they seemed</a> from the outside.</p>
<p>Amid all those macroeconomic factors, the slowdown in Moore's Law, specifically, seems like a likely candidate for today's stubborn console pricing. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/chips-arent-improving-like-they-used-to-and-its-killing-game-console-price-cuts/">we've discussed in depth recently</a>, the rate of advancement in microchip manufacturing <a href="https://cap.csail.mit.edu/death-moores-law-what-it-means-and-what-might-fill-gap-going-forward">has slowed in recent years</a>, making it harder than it was in the past to develop cheaper and/or smaller versions of console hardware.</p>

<p>That explains why costs for hardware makers have remained higher than usual. But in the past, console makers have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/08/nintendo-wii-u-still-being-sold-at-a-loss/">shown a willingness to sell hardware at a loss</a> when needed to make the money back on software sales. Systems like the PS3, Xbox One, Wii U, and 3DS saw extremely rapid price drops after less-than-stellar launch receptions, suggesting they were slashing or eliminating hardware profits well before any manufacturing savings could be passed on to consumers.</p>
<p>The fact that we're not seeing such price cutting today could be interpreted as a sign that current console prices aren't too high for the market to bear. Back in 2022, we noted how <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/will-the-nintendo-switch-ever-see-a-price-drop/">the ahistorical lack of a Switch price drop</a> didn't seem to be dampening that system's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/nintendo-switch-crosses-100-million-mark-outsells-wii-ps1/">historically strong sales</a>. The same seems to be true of the PS5 and PS5 Pro, which are <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/ps5-shipments-top-80-3-million">selling</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-700-price-tag-isnt-hurting-ps5-pros-early-sales/">briskly</a> despite a lack of price drops. And while the Xbox hardware line <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/xbox-console-sales-continue-to-crater-with-massive-42-revenue-drop/">may be struggling for customer attention these days</a>, Microsoft also seems <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/we-run-a-business-why-microsofts-indiana-jones-will-be-on-ps5/">less interested</a> in providing the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-confirms-which-xbox-games-are-going-to-switch-playstation/">exclusive games</a> that would usually help justify the purchase of an Xbox (and perhaps more interested in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/why-microsofts-next-xbox-should-just-run-windows-already/">pivoting to Windows-based gaming hardware</a> like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally</a>).</p>
<p>In other words, console prices aren't dropping in part because the market isn't forcing them to. As long as today's console makers are satisfied with sales at their current levels, the price drops customers came to expect historically will continue to be a thing of the past.</p>

                <p>HoYoverse will soon enough be adding yet another genre to its growing list of gacha games, this time in the form of a new game called Honkai: Nexus Anima. This one might interest Pokemon fans as it is a creator collector, though it looks like it'll differ from the Nintendo series in a few key ways. And, if it takes your fancy, you can even sign up to take part in its first Nexus Bond Test.</p><p dir="ltr">First up are some of the big differences. For starters, the combat system is completely different. Where Pokemon sees you pitting your pocket monsters generally 1v1, each of them with four moves to choose, Honkai: Nexus Anima's main combat system looks closer to an auto battler like Auto Chess or Teamfight Tactics.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGfTS72aEOs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dGfTS72aEOs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">You also seemingly get to play as Anima--this game's titular equivalent to Pokemon--in varying ways. That includes a racing minigame, a minigame where you shoot at beach balls, and another where you … destroy an office building! There appears to be a range of customization options for your player character, but you can also seemingly play as different characters too. And like in more recent Pokemon games, you can ride different Anima to get around the game's world.</p><p dir="ltr">To take part in the beta test for the game, all you need to do is head to its <a href="https://hna.hoyoverse.com/en-us?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=hna_GLB_PR" rel="nofollow ">official website</a>, click the Join Test button, and log in to your HoYoverse account. You'll then be asked to fill in a questionnaire, which will ask you about the kind of device you're playing on, other games you play, and how much you typically spend on games in general.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that the test is only on iOS and PC, and will have Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English, Japanese, and Korean as language options--more languages are planned to be added in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">The test is live now and is running until September 12. A release date for the full game hasn't been revealed just yet.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Konami has released the first update for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater on all platforms. The patch notes mainly detail fixes for crashing issues that occur in specific situations for the stealth game, though there is a silly bug addressed that sees Snake floating in midair.</p><p dir="ltr">Metal Gear Solid Delta players could previously see Snake hovering above the ground sometimes by "transitioning from a roll into a crawl." Overall, the update for the game brings it up to <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/news/us/en/update_112_2" rel="nofollow ">version 1.1.2</a>. The patch actually rolled out yesterday, August 28, on Steam, while it's going live today on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

		<p>Rebellion has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a>: The Red Strain, the next expansion for their hit 50s Northern England disaster survival game. The new story expansion pack is set to arrive on 16th September across all platforms – PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The base game is also still a part of Game Pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall The Red Strain Teaser Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ti8cwDNGxI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Details are very thin on the ground right now, but there’s a big new robot in town, seemingly taking a smidgeon of inspiration from RoboCop by shoving a brain up into the glass jar on top, and from Doctor Who Daleks for the voice box. Intriguingly, there’s a new acronym organisation involved here, as C.O.R.E. is stamped across the front of the robot’s chest and we see an ominous looking entrance hall to the institution, as well as some reddish mists to contrast with the main game’s blueish hues.</p>
<p>This is the second story expansion for Atomfall, following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/29/atomfalls-wicked-isle-story-dlc-launches-on-june-3rd/">the Wicked Isle which launched back in June</a>. This took players away from Wyndham Vilage and off to Midsummer Island for another adjacent story – in our review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/24/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-review/">we did complain</a> that it followed the themes of the main game a bit too closely, so hopefully a bit more time has allowed Rebellion to inject a bit more variety for this second expansion.</p>

<p>Of the main game, though, we rather enjoyed it. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall review</a>,&nbsp;Gareth said,<em> “Atomfall is an interesting game. It might not be wholly unique in anything it does, but it combines its core ideas in a way that feels fresh. A big part of that comes through the drip feed of the underlying story, whilst another is the glorious British countryside that makes up its maps. It likely isn’t going to blow your mind, but it’s an enjoyable journey and you would still be missing out if you didn’t give Atomfall a go.”</em></p>
