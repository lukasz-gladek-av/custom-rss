		<p>Nintendo revealed the return of two of their oddball game series, with Rhythm Heaven Groove and Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream both coming to Nintendo Switch in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rhythm Heaven Groove – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkgjFacpnLE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new entry in the Rhythm Heaven series is sticking to some very familiar ideas for the series. This is all about pressing buttons at just the right time, matching the specific beat that the game is giving you with some quirkily animated scenes as you get things right (or a little bit wrong).</p>
<p>The first new game since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/28/rhythm-paradise-megamix-review/">Rhythm Heaven Megamix</a> in 2015 (which was a bit of a best of collection for 3DS), Rhythm Heaven Groove will continue the series’ traditional partnerships with Nintendo and TNX co-developing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dvo1V7DWYsA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And then there’s Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, bringing your Mii out of semi-retirement and sending them off to an idyllic seaside town to go about their lives, hanging out with other Miis and completing certain tasks to earn rewards. There’s also some thoroughly weird moments, like the dream sequence with a giant Mii running along to interrupt a dream – it looks like we’ll still get to experience Mii dreams here, and it’s a neat tie in with the game’s subtitle.</p>

<p>After the original game on DS, Tomodachi Life was an off-beat hit for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013. There were other Mii-based spin-offs like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitomo">Miitomo</a> on mobile and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitopia">Miitopia</a>, but the main Tomodachi Life experience is now being revived after well over a decade.<sup id="cite_ref-65"></sup></p>
<p>I guess Miis are still going to be relevant for a few more years, as well…</p>

            <p>
A few months on from releasing into early access, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall-2">Greedfall 2: The Dying World</a> has received its first major update, and it certainly seems like a fairly big one. First up, there's a whole new region to explore called "Olima, City of Stars", and I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume that it has nothing to do with that guy from Pikmin. Its name actually comes from the fact there's a big ole observatory to be found there, though what that entails, you'll have to find out for yourself.
</p>

<p>
There's also a new companion arriving with this update, Safia, an "anti-imperialist… seasoned explorer". Not played any <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall">Greedfall</a> myself, but I'm always down for taking down empires. Rifles seem to be her whole shtick, assisting you in battle with them, and there's an implication that you can learn how to use them yourself from her.

<p>
This update also comes with a place called the Hub, located on your own ship ("not a boat" developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/spiders">Spiders</a> makes sure to point out, for some reason), once you've acquired one anyway. While on the Hub you can get ready for your next journey, have a natter with companions, and there's also plans to allow you to buy materials from merchants, view romance scenes (wink wink), and more further down the line.
</p>
<p>
Combat has supposedly seen some improvements now too, in a few different ways overall it's looking smoother, faster, and a bit cleaner too. Spiders offered a more detailed look at how combat has changed <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1997660/announcements/detail/543352686106378873?snr=1_5_9_">earlier this week</a>.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that there's a new disguise system, more regional quests, newly introduced companion quests, a higher level cap, a respec consumable, refreshed UI, and just a whole bunch of bug fixes. Happy Greedfalling!

The latest entry in the fighting game franchise that eventually spun off <em>King of Fighters</em> is out April 24 on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, and can count having the weirdest crossover fighter of all time among its distinctions. </p><p>But the funniest part about Ronaldo being in the next <em>Fatal Fury</em> is that it only vaguely looks like him and seems to be voiced by someone else entirely. At least it doesn’t look as bad as his bronze statue: </p><p>Ronaldo was previously <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-58528893&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-58528893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused of rape in 2009</a></span> but reached a settlement with the alleged victim and claimed he was innocent, even though she later came out publicly about the allegations following the 2019 #metoo movement. Why is he now in, of all things, a deep cut 2D fighter from Japanese arcade gaming’s past? It’s probably not just because the developers one day saw players in the <em>Fatal Fury </em>community having fun and decided to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PsychoSWeasel/status/1837901224298889454&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PsychoSWeasel/status/1837901224298889454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turn those meme dreams into reality</a></span>. </p><p>Ronaldo plays for Al Nassr FC  after agreeing to take leave of Europe and help sportswash Saudi Arabia’s bad human rights record in exchange for over $200 million. Al Nassr FC is 75 percent owned by the Saudi royal investment fund which also happens to have a 96 percent controlling stake in<em> Fatal Fury</em> makers SNK. <br></p><p>“We’re not a political company or anything like that, so it doesn’t affect us in any way,” SNK designer and producer  Yasuyuki Oda said of the Saudi investment when questioned&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/snk-lead-insists-saudi-arabia-sale-will-have-no-effect-on-the-games-we-make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/snk-lead-insists-saudi-arabia-sale-will-have-no-effect-on-the-games-we-make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by<em> VGC</em></a></span> back in 2022. “It has no–<em>no</em>–effect on our creative output.

I can’t say I’m looking forward to playing as Ronaldo, but him being in the game also means getting to beat up on anyone who main’s him. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The rhythm-loving armies of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/patapon">Patapon</a> are marching forth again, as Patapon 1+2 Replay will remaster the PSP classics for Nintendo Switch, PS5 and PC on 11th July.</p>
<p><iframe title="PATAPON 1+2 REPLAY – Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojtnxA61V6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is great news for fans of the cult classic rhythm-action games, but there’s a twist. This pair of PlayStation Portable classics are being published on Switch, not by Sony, but by Bandai Namco instead. The new remasters are being developed by SAS Co. Ltd, who I cannot find any details about.</p>
<p>Combining the first two Patapon games into one bundle (though sadly not Patapon 3), you’re cast as a god looking down on the silhouetted tribe of the Patapon. Having been driven from their home by the Zigoton, you will take control and help guide them back to their rightful place by beating a war drum in certain rhythms to command your troops, telling them to march forward, attack, defend and more. Combine that with unlocking and commanding different units, and you’ll have to overcome monsters in the wild, assault Zigoton fortresses and more. Sticking to the beat with your button presses consistently enough, and your army will enter a FEVER! and boost their fervent abilities.</p>
<p>New for this remastered collection are some difficulty settings – Normal, Easy and Hard – adjustments for button timing to help with input lag, and a constant command display, so you don’t have to remember the specific commands.</p>

<p>Originally developed by Japan Studio – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/25/report-playstations-japan-studio-is-being-wound-down-but-astros-playroom-developer-asobi-team-will-survive/">which Sony shut down in the last couple years</a> – the games were a pretty much essential part of the PSP library. Sony revisited the games with a remaster of the original in 2017 and the sequel in 2020, both for PS4, but the game’s natural home really is on a handheld, if you ask me.</p>
<p>“As special as it was ten years ago,” Dom said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/07/patapon-remastered-review/">our 2017 review</a>, “Patapon Remastered is a glorious example of when art, music and gameplay coalesce into something far more intoxicating than its sum parts would have you expect.”</p>
<p>Here’s hoping this Replay bundle gives <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/05/patapon-2-remastered-review/">the second game a little more love and attention</a>, though.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Patapon fans might like to revisit the early games, but if you want something actually new, the original creators are working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/16/patapons-legacy-will-continue-when-ratatan-arrives-in-2025/">Ratatan</a>, which is also due out later this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-go-live-on-april-2nd-according-to-best-buy.1146735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-april-2nd-best-buy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A hastily deleted <a href="https://blog.bestbuy.ca/video-games/nintendo-switch-2-announced-launching-in-2025">blog post</a> by Best Buy Canada has stated that pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 console will go live on April 2nd 2025, a date that was tipped by various punters a few days ago. Nintendo have not officially announced anything and as the post was removed rather quickly it does suggest that Best Buy announced things a little too early.&nbsp; However, the date is the same as next week’s Switch 2 Direct so put on your surprised face when they announce it during the show.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – First-look trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxLUf2kRQRE?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The teaser trailer is pretty abstract, showing lots of comparison bits and bobs for how the console has changed in comparison to the original Switch. It’s all black, for one thing, with just a pop of neon blue and neon red on the inner cap of the analogue sti cks, but all-black Joy-Con. It shows the added USB-C port on the top of the console alongside the bottom, the new kick stand design that runs the full width, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism, and with a mysterious new button on the right Joy-Con. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>The one game teased during this video was Mario Kart 9.</p>

<p>Nintendo reconfirmed that it will have backward compatibility to Nintendo Switch games, both digital and cartridge. Some games might not be fully compatible or supported on Switch 2 with more details coming at a later date.</p>
<div>
<p>There’s been leaks about the console’s hardware specs, revealing the Nvidia chipset that is set to replace the Tegra X1 within the original Switch to be a modified Tegra T239. There’s also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R1p1LjHME8">a big discussion over Nintendo’s upscaling patent</a>, suggestions about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">the use of MicroSD Express for SSD-like read speeds</a>, and just last week at CES, accessories manufacturer&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Numerama/status/1876817276143378586">Genki rocked up to the show with a full suite of bits and bobs for the new console</a>, even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">prompting Nintendo’s lawyers to visit, </a>though Genki state they’ve never signed an NDA or actually seen an official Switch 2.</p>
</div>
<p>Currently, the console does not have a release date but we would assume that if they are going to start taking pre-orders, the release date will be announced at the same time.</p>

		<p>Super Rare Originals and developer Pixel Reign have announced Moros Protocol, a retro-styled sci-fi FPS roguelite that will be coming to PC later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moros Protocol | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/As49-2YisCY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Waking up aboard a battleship heading to war, you quickly discover that the ship has been taken over by monsters that have killed pretty much all the crew. With your AI companion Ody-6, you have to try time and again to fight back those beasts and save the ship.</p>
<p>What immediately stands out about the game is the visual style. There’s some common ground with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/29/system-shock-remake-review/">the System Shock remake</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> in that the world is rendered in 3D, but a retro aesthetic is applied by having heavily pixellated textures. Combined with some hefty neon glow and bloom, and it’s an aesthetic that still stands out. It’s built on a custom renderer to really capture the desired look.</p>


<p>As a roguelite that’s inspired by the speed of classic shooters, there’s plenty of weapons in the game, from SMGs and pistols through to swords and flamethrowers, and you’ll often be rewarded by opening chests to get new weapons or find augments to boost your particular playstyle.</p>
<p>Each run will offer you the chance to choose your own path through a branching design, either playing it safe to progress, or risk it for a better upgrade or weapon. After each run ends – by death or otherwise – you can upgrade your abilities more permanently to help on future attempts.&nbsp;<b></b></p>
<p>Another nice tweak is that you can get a buddy to join you with support for drop-in co-op for two players.<b></b></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-delayed-may</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/post-apocalyptic-deckbuilder-as-we-descend-delayed-until-may.1146729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-delayed-may<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roguelike deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until May, but a concrete release date for the game has been revealed, so it won't be too much longer until you get to play it.</p>

<p>Back in February, it was announced that&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">arrive in Early Access in March</a>, but Kevin Chang, director of developer Box Dragon, says the game needs "a little more time in the oven" before it's ready.</p>

<p>As a sweetener, though, the game's demo, which is currently available on Steam, has been localized into 11 languages, including French, German, and Ukrainian, so more folks around the world can check it out before deciding to make a purchase.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/as-we-descend-delayed-early-access-combat.jpg?itok=kVMREYIL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/as-we-descend-delayed-early-access-combat.jpg?itok=v-FI3MAM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is landing a little later than anticipated.</figcaption></figure><p>Chang says Box Dragon has "big plans" for&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, and that now is the "perfect time" to try the game out if you haven't already done so. He goes on to say that the game's Early Access launch is "just the beginning".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, it's a roguelike deckbuilder set in a post-apocalyptic world "where resources are scarce and monsters threaten humanity’s very existence". Well, it wouldn't be much of a post-apocalyptic world without life-threatening danger.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is split between its card-battling combat and its diplomacy systems, which will see you building relationships with key figures in order to stave off crises and make critical alliances.</p>

<p>According to Box Dragon, you can expect&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>'s setting to offer a "desperate city that evolves and crumbles in unique ways based on the player’s decisions", so it sounds like you'll need to be careful what you choose during conversations.</p>




<p><em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769830/As_We_Descend/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on May 28th, and a demo is available to try out right now if you want to see whether the game is your cup of (presumably poisoned) tea or not.</p>

<p>The First Berserker: Khazan launches today (March 27), and the game’s developers have already nerfed two of the game’s hardest bosses.</p>



<p>In a post on the game’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstBerserker/comments/1jkz6qs/dev_note_on_khazans_official_launch_first_balance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a>, developer Neople revealed that it has made a number of changes in the form of a launch-day balance patch. Of the numerous changes, the biggest seems to be change in the difficulty of Viper and Maluca.</p>



<p>With the decision to change the difficulties of the bosses, the game’s creative director, Junho Lee, gave context surrounding the motives and what’s being done.</p>



<p>You can read the explanation, in full, below.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Viper has already earned nicknames like “newbie crusher” from many players. While there are several reasons for this balance adjustment, the primary factor was our intentional design choice to present a slightly higher challenge during the difficulty tuning process. However, we realized that this posed an excessive burden on players adapting to the game. Additionally, the extended duration required for immersive combat, although providing a definite sense of accomplishment, led us to question whether it offered an appropriate level of challenge for players reaching Mission 3 for the first time. The answer leaned towards “no.” Despite the possibility for many players to simply give up, you provided us with valuable feedback through various channels. Some mentioned that Viper felt like a “final boss-level challenge,” yet clearing it brought a thrilling satisfaction reminiscent of past experiences, sparking curiosity about “what comes next if the third boss is this challenging.” The required skill level to face Viper was significantly higher than the proficiency players had developed up to that point and the prolonged engagement and the punitive nature of mistakes could have led many to abandon the challenge, yet you chose to share your precious insights with us. Once again, we sincerely thank you for your invaluable feedback.</p>



<p>Regarding Maluca, we have structured Khazan’s storyline into two parts, with Maluca serving as the boss of the first part. While we understand that many of you found this encounter both challenging and enjoyable, we also recognized that it presented a relatively high level of difficulty. Although we cannot disclose exact data, we observed that players new to Khazan found Maluca to be more than twice as challenging as Rangkus, the previous boss and deputy leader of the bandits.</p>



<p>Taking these factors into account, we have slightly reduced the difficulty in the main game. Players can be now rewarded more quickly through stamina-based combat, and we’ve made adjustments to ensure that minor mistakes no longer necessarily lead to failure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite the changes to the difficulty of the two bosses, Lee says that the team has “ensured that the core values of challenge and accomplishment remain intact.” He added both Viper and Mulca will “still present a significant challenge compared to other monsters.”</p>



<p>Other changes in the launch patch include skill balance adjustments for various weapons, buffs to a few other bosses, as well as more benefits for those playing on easy mode.</p>



<p>Lastly, without going into much detail, Lee said that there will be more updates coming to the game “as early as next week” as some have taken more time to implement. He also said there are plans for a free DLC content update to be launched in May.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Switch players who buy their games on physical cards are used to being able to share those games with other players simply by handing them the card. Now, Nintendo is planning a process to allow players to share their digital Switch purchases in a similar way.</p>
<p>The new "virtual game card" system—which Nintendo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWwyh74MXXY">announced today</a> ahead of a planned late April rollout—will allow players to "load" and "eject" digital games via a dedicated management screen. An ejected digital game can't be played on the original console, but it can be digitally loaded onto a new console and played there without restriction by any user logged into that system.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWwyh74MXXY?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>While an Internet connection is required when loading and ejecting digital games in this way, the Internet will not be required to play the shared digital game after that initial process is complete. And while both Switch consoles will need to be synced up via a "local connection" the first time such sharing is done, subsequent shares won't require the consoles to be in physical proximity.</p>
<p>Nintendo's announcement says this virtual game card system allows players to "freely load and arrange which games you play on <em>up to two systems</em> [emphasis added]," suggesting you won't be able to share different games across more than one secondary console. For households with more than two Switch units, though, Nintendo says virtual game card lending will also be available across your Nintendo Switch "family group" accounts. But these "family" loans are limited to one game at a time (per group member) and only last for two weeks (after which the loan can be manually renewed).</p>

            <p>Witchbrook, the cosy life-sim set in a wizard school from Chucklefish, has finally received a release window eight years after its initial reveal.</p>
<p>Though Project Spellbound, as it was known, was first teased back in 2016, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-publisher-reveals-new-details-on-magic-school-rpg">Witchbrook proper was announced in 2017</a>. It immediately drew comparison with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, previously published by Chucklefish, and in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-inspired-magic-school-sim-witchbrook-gets-a-gorgeous-new-look">2020 switched to an isometric view</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chucklefishs-witchbrook-is-still-alive-pretty-new-screenshots-show">look at fresh screenshots in 2022</a>, little has been shown of the game. Until today! During the Nintendo Direct, we finally got a release window of winter 2025 across PC, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox - including a day one Game Pass release.</p>

<p>Witchbrook has players enrol in the titular magical college, able to explore the seaside city of Mossport, the surrounding woodlands, and the college grounds themselves. In fact, four players can explore together in online co-op multiplayer.</p>
<p>Players will be able to learn new magical abilities to support themselves, local businesses and the community, make friends and romance other characters, renovate a cute woodland cottage and its garden, and spend time between classes by foraging, selling crafts, and entering seasonal events.</p>
<p>"Witchbrook is the most exciting project I've ever worked on, and it's been a long time coming, but I'm very eager to get the game in the hands of the players soon," said Chucklefish CTO Rodrigo Braz Monteiro.</p>
<p>"I don't think that the level of simulation and fidelity we've aimed for in this game is expected of any games short of AAA, and to see it realised in a pixel art indie game has been very satisfying to us. For now, we're only sharing a small glimpse into a vast game, and I can't wait for the community to see what's coming over the next few months."</p>
<p>"Witchbrook is our love letter to thoughtful living, the quiet magic of slow moments, and the connections we share with each other and the world around us," added art director Steph Caskenette. "Whether players are exploring solo or sharing in the adventure, we hope Witchbrook becomes a space to relax and make lasting memories."</p>
<p>Witchbrook was shown at today's Nintendo Direct, alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-give-samus-psychic-powers">first look at Metroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-has-a-battle-royale-mode-that-finally-explains-what-its-name-means">new look at Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-still-a-switch-game-coming-out-in-2026">Tomodachi Life game due in 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>ustwo Games has announced that it will be released Monument Valley 3 on PC and consoles this summer, following on from its brief exclusivity on Netflix. The game was released back in December for the streaming service, and now the studio is looking to reach more players as it comes to PC via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. Additionally, the original Monument Valley and Monument Valley 2 will be released on April 15th for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monument Valley 3 | Launch Trailer |" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R0BGVxbWmHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/31/ustwo-games-confirms-monument-valley-3-is-now-in-development/">Monument Valley 3 was first announced</a> way back in 2019, so it did take five years to get to release. In this third game, players are Noor. Noor is on a mission to find a light source to push back the darkness that is enclosing her world. Like the previous games, players will have to manipulate the environment to find the solutions to the puzzles with each chapter adding a new spin to things. In a first for the series, Monument Valley 3 lets you set sail in open areas to further explore the world. Post launch, ustwo games has confirmed there will be new puzzles and chapters added to the game.</p>
<p>Anyone who purchases Monument Valley 3 will also be donating to charity, as ustwo games has stated the 3% of profits to Flood Relief.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/chucklefish">Chucklefish</a> and co-developer Robotality have revealed their first proper look at their magical life-sim Witchbrook, confirming that the game will be coming to PC, Nintendo Switch and Xbox this winter. It will be day one in<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass"> Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Witchbrook - First Look Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIKSGazNOqg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will let you enrol in Witchbrook College near the seaside city of Mossport, sinking into a world where you can simply pull out your magic wand and clean up messes and broken plumbing, or hop onto your broomstick and fly over the rooftops. The trailer also showing little snippets of home decoration and fishing. Truth be told, it doesn’t really show too much about what the game will actually play like, though it’s sure to lean on established genre tropes in some areas.</p>
<p>The game is playable with up to four players exploring the sandbox in co-op multipayer, and honestly, the pixelart visual style is stunning. Every scene in the trailer is packed with people and detail from an isometric view.</p>
<p>Technical Director Rodrigo Braz Monteiro said of his the game, “Witchbrook is the most exciting project I’ve ever worked on, and it’s been a long time coming, but I’m very eager to get the game in the hands of the players soon. I don’t think that the level of simulation and fidelity we’ve aimed for in this game is expected of any games short of AAA, and to see it realised in a pixel art indie game has been very satisfying to us. For now, we’re only sharing a small glimpse into a vast game, and I can’t wait for the community to see what’s coming over the next few months.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere, producer Rosie Ball explained that the team has embraced a 4-day work week and no-crunch approach to getting the game made, which is always great to hear.</p>
<p>This is the first meaningful look at Witchbrook, but you might remember the game from its original announcements. First teased as Project Spellbound in 2017, with Chucklefish looking to ride the wave of Stardew Valley interest (for which they provided porting support for the console versions), it was then named as Witchbrook a year later in 2018. At that time, the concept artwork and screenshots showed the game with that face-on view familiar to many pixel art life sims. In the intervening time, the game has clearly jumped 45º to give an isometric viewpoint, which feels much more distinct.</p>

<p>Invaders of Oakveil's first major addition to&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>is the eponymous Oakveil Woodlands, a new biome filled with "deadly enemies, new bosses, and dark magic techniques" for you to discover. As the name suggests, it's a forest biome.</p>

Update 1.1 will also bring the ability to build custom duel arenas within your castle, then challenge your friends (or anyone you like) to a duel. Don't worry, though; duels won't have any consequences, so you can fight to your heart's content.</p>

<p>Three new weapons will be added in the form of the Claws, the Twinblade, and the Throwing Daggers, each of which, Stunlock says, will unlock "fresh combat strategies and unique playstyles". They'll be accompanied by seven new spells for you to test out.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to&nbsp;<em>V Rising</em>'s "biggest combat overhaul yet", which the developer says will bring "a deep stat rework, rebalanced gear, completely overhauled blood types, and powerful new customization tools".</p>

<p>All of this and more will be introduced as part of Invaders of Oakveil, and you can watch the debut trailer for the update (which admittedly doesn't give a whole lot away) right here.</p>




<p><em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>is an open-world survival game in which you play the vampiric lord of a castle. You must sally forth into the mortal world to collect resources, do battle with powerful rivals, and establish your dominion as a lord.</p>

<p>The game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/v-rising/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its Invaders of Oakveil update lands on April 28th.</p>

This had me looking at prices for its predecessor, the still-very-fast 990 Pro, and I was happy to see that its 4TB model is currently selling for $279.99 at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-990-PRO-M-2-2280-4TB-PCI-Express-Gen-4-0-x4-NVMe-2-0-V7-V-NAND-3bit-MLC-Internal-Solid-State-Drive-SSD-MZ-V9P4T0B-AM-Non-Heatsink%2F5075942372" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> and at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHGT1KFJ/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/634880/amazon-big-spring-sale-march-2025-prime-day-deals-shop">Big Spring Sale</a> — more or less half off the price of the 9100 Pro’s 4 TB version (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Computing-Workstations-VAP1T0B-AM/dp/B0DX2GJ1YR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$549.99</a>).</p><p>Why buy the 990 Pro over the 9100 Pro? Well, the 9100 Pro requires PCIe Gen 5-ready hardware to take advantage of its speeds, and that tech is far from being affordable or mainstream at the moment.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/24/23319258/samsung-990-pro-ssd-speeds-heatsink-ps5">we wrote</a> when the 990 Pro launched in 2022, that SSD came close to PCIe Gen 4’s theoretical speed limit, making it among the quicker options out there for PC (its faster speed is wasted on the PS5, though it’ll work fine in one). It’s still a great value today, especially as prices for all storage configurations have dropped considerably. Considering that a 2TB version of the 990 Pro is $170 and doubling the storage costs just about $100 more, we think that the 4TB is the one to get right now. As game install sizes continue to increase, it’ll be a great addition to any PS5, or in any desktop or laptop that supports PCIe Gen 4 speeds.</p><p>Given that the 990 Pro we’re recommending doesn’t have a heatsink (one’s suggested for use in the PS5, and it’s never a bad idea on PC), it’s <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=m2+ssd+heatsink&amp;i=electronics&amp;crid=2C532BVY97UYG&amp;sprefix=m2+ssd+heatsink%2Celectronics%2C107&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2&amp;tag=theverge02-20">cheaper to buy and install your own instead</a> of paying Samsung a $20 premium for the heatsink edition of the 990 Pro.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Coming in an April system update, Nintendo is introducing a new game management system called “virtual game cards.” Virtual game cards are meant to function similarly to physical ones. When the feature goes live, purchases of digital games on the Nintendo eShop will automatically create a virtual game card that you’ll be able to manage from a dedicated screen.</p><p>Virtual game cards also make sharing games between consoles simpler. Using a local wi-fi connection, you can use virtual game cards to transfer digital games between Switch 1 and Switch 2 consoles. But perhaps the most interesting aspect of this feature is that now, you’ll be able to lend games to members of your Nintendo Switch Family account. You can only lend out one game per person and only for two weeks, but its still very neat that Nintendo has replicated the spirit of renting video games from Blockbuster.</p><p>Since Nintendo already told us the Switch 2 is backwards compatible, it seems like this new virtual game card system was created to ease the transition for players upgrading their consoles. We’ll learn more about the Swtich 2 and all its new features during the Switch 2 direct on April 2nd.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
