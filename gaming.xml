		<p>Ahead of its release in February, Nacon and Cyanide Studio have dropped <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">a demo for Styx: Blades of Greed onto Steam</a>, letting players check out the first hour of the game. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> is launching across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 19th February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Styx: Blades of Greed - Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OwliU5XsytQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is a time-limited demo, which will be pulled from availability at some point, but if you do slink in to check it out on PC and buy the game on that platform, then your save will carry across to the full game.</p>
<p>The demo kicks off from the very start of the game, where you’ll get to experience Styx infiltrating a golem and destroying it from the inside out, and then take on his first real mission to steal a zeppelin right out from under the Inquisition and break through their blockade of The Wall.</p>
<p>This is just a taster of what the full game has to offer, with Styx and his crew visiting three open environments to sneak through, and picking up new tricks, powers and tools to let him explore further and further. There’s things like a grappling hook and glider, there’s new Quartz powers for mind control and time shifting, and a story that weaves together the human Inquisitors, Orcs and Elves in variously nefarious ways.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-may-the-quartz-be-with-you/">I previewed Styx: Blades of Greed back at Gamescom</a>, and it was this opening section of the game that I had the chance to play back then. After a lenghty hiatus between games, I said,&nbsp;“It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.”</p>

            <guid>1405069</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Daedalic Entertainment and developer gameXcite have announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/20/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-lets-you-rewrite-the-worst-90s-star-trek/">Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown</a> will let you re-experience and retell the tale of Star Trek: Voyager on 18th February 2026. Additionally, the game will launch on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> alongside PC, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Now, try as I might, I couldn’t get a sensible Stardate calculation for that headline – Stardates all started in reference to the 24th century, so trying to figure one out for the 21st century just gives some ludicrous negative number like -296868.49 – but 18th February will line up with Stardate 48315.6, when Voyager is whipped across the Galaxy by the Caretaker.</p>


<p>That’s your starting point in the game, after which you need to navigate the perilous path back to the Alpha Quadrant, encountering the Kazon, the Borg and much more.</p>
<p>You can check this out for yourself with the free demo now available across PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. This is an updated demo compared to last year, which will also come to Switch 2 and PC soon. This updated demo brings an improved UI, better ship controls, refined combat and notifications for when you reach key decision moments.</p>

<p>Somewhat disappointing is the reveal of a Deluxe Edition of the game. This features more missions, more heroes and more technologies that you can tap into from aliens across the Delta content. I don’t know how I feel about gatekeeping that kind of content in this instance.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Infamous Peter Molyneux Parody Account Calls It Quits After 16 Years]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/peter-molyneux-molydeux-parody-masters-albion-trailer-release-date-2000659410</link>
            <guid>1405057</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Peter Molyneux is a veteran game designer who’s been pushing the boundaries of what players expect from the medium for over 30 years. Peter Molydeux is a Twitter account created back in 2009 to parody the <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-man-who-promised-too-much-1537352493">famous developer’s often absurd sounding promises</a>. With the real Molyneux’s seemingly final game, <em>Masters of Albion</em>, releasing later this year, the creator of Molydeux says it’s time to hang up the fake persona.</p> <p dir="auto">“Games evolved to the point where the ideas I was parodying were no longer outside the box,” wrote the account’s author, 3D environment artist Adam Capone, in a retirement announcement <a href="https://telegra.ph/The-last-message-01-13">posted on January 13</a>. “I never thought I’d cut ties with this account. But after reading Peter Molyneux recently saying his upcoming game would be his last, it does feel like the right moment. It’s still surreal to remember being invited to a photoshoot with the very person I was spoofing.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You play a hole, you must move around an environment making certain elements fall into correct targets at the right time.</p> <p>— petermolydeux (@PeterMolydeux) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMolydeux/status/154802887241908224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2012</a></p></blockquote>  <p dir="auto">In the early 2010s, back when Twitter still felt (mostly) new and fun and wasn’t a factory for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grok-ai-deepfakes-undressed-images-2000658486">AI-powered bots removing women’s clothing</a>, Peter Molydeux was one of the many spoof accounts cropping up in the gaming space. Other well known ones included <a href="https://x.com/kazhiraiceo">CEO Kaz Hirai</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/porygonnews">Porygon News</a>. The Molydeux account would tweet outrageous video game concepts like, “Online side scrolling co-op 8 player game where each person controls a leg of an octopus. Each leg can attach guns which the player can fire.”</p>

 <p dir="auto">They were funny because of how they played off Molyneux’s own penchant for grandiose ideas that never quite come together the way they sounded in interviews, but also very clever. Each concept had the kernel of something that did actually sound very cool in it, just like the Lionhead Studios cofounder’s ideas. Here’s a great 2012<em> Wired</em> article about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130208085301/https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/10/ff-peter-molyneux/all/">symbiotic relationship between the two</a>.</p>

  <p dir="auto">For anyone unfamiliar with the <em>Fable</em> designer’s reputation, <i>Project Milo</i><em>&nbsp;</em>is a good example. It was supposed to be a Kinect game for Xbox 360 where players interacted with a child. Molyneux demonstrated the game at a 2010 TEDGlobal talk where he boasted that his team had managed to “create a real, living being in a computer.” Microsoft, more than a decade away from going all in on AI, was unimpressed and canceled the game. In some ways, <i>Project Milo</i> became the platonic ideal of a Molyneux game: one that lived in the imagination of what might be rather than the disappointment of what actually shipped.</p>

 <p dir="auto">Now back to the fake Twitter account:</p> <blockquote> <p dir="auto">I remember pulling up in a taxi to see him casually smoking outside the studio. He welcomed me in, excitedly showing <em>Curiosity</em> but also sharing excitement about another random small indie game he was playing and giving me his ipad to play it. Then later in a pub he was hinting at his ambition for Curiosity. That enthusiasm for the player experience, regardless if they land or not is at the heart of this industry.</p> <p dir="auto">I think the industry lost something when Molyneux vowed never to speak on stage again. Over time, that kind of unfiltered excitement has been replaced by carefully rehearsed pitches and bullet points. Fewer people go off-cue. Fewer let passion drive the conversation rather than marketing.</p> <p dir="auto">I hope every generation creates its own Molyneuxs. Joseph Fares at Hazelight reminds me an early Molyneux, i.e developers who get carried away talking about their “baby” instead of selling a product. I’ll always be grateful for Molyneux and what he gave to the industry.</p> <p dir="auto">I promise this is 100% not actually Peter Molyneux writing this.</p> </blockquote> <p dir="auto">Capone, who was just laid off as part of Ubisoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752">shuttering its recently unionized Halifax studio</a>, used Molydeux’s final sign-off to call for game developers to prioritize creative risk taking over chasing metrics. “As the industry inevitably rebuilds, I’m convinced it’ll be the small, weird games from over-excited enthusiastic designers in control of their games as they continue creating new experiences and nudging us forward, step by (baby?) step,” he wrote.</p>

 <h2 dir="auto"><em>Masters of Albion</em> offers a last shot at redemption</h2> <p dir="auto">Will one of those be Molyneux’s own <em>Masters of Albion</em>? The pitch is an open-world God game that borrows elements from across his past work. A new trailer dropped this week and a release date of April 22 was revealed. “Masters of Albion is the culmination of my life’s work, a game that owes so much to titles like <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>, <em>Black &amp; White</em>, and<em> Fable</em>,” the veteran director said in a statement. “It’s a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map.”</p>

 <p dir="auto">While some take inspiration from Molyneux’s romanticism, others have called him out for what sometimes seem essentially like lies. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peter-molyneux-interview-godus-reputation-kickstarter">In 2015 he rejected those accusations</a>. The last year he told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/its-about-redemption-peter-molyneux-says-masters-of-albion-will-make-up-for-decades-of-overpromising-on-things/"><em>Edge</em> magazine</a>, “I admit now that I did overpromise on things, and said things that I shouldn’t have said about <em>Curiosity</em>. But I only ever did that because I thought it was the right thing to do at the time.”</p> <p dir="auto">He called <em>Masters of Albion</em> a” redemption title.” One thing helping it to give players more confidence than his last project, <a href="https://kotaku.com/peter-molyneuxs-next-game-is-a-blockchain-business-sim-1848201920">a blockchain business sim that went nowhere</a>, is who else is on board. <em>LittleBigPlanet</em> director Mark Healey, Black &amp; White 2 designer Iain Wright, and other game development veterans are all involved, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/media-molecule-co-founder-and-bullfrog-veterans-on-board-for-peter-molyneuxs-final-god-game-masters-of-albion/">according to <em>VGC</em></a>. Hopefully it’s a good game, or at least a fitting send off for PEter Molydeux.</p>

<p>If you’re here because you haven’t gotten a verification email for Hytale, you’re not alone in this regard. This is a widespread problem preventing many users from buying the sandbox title.</p>



<p>It’s one problem after another, isn’t it? If it’s not servers, it’s something else. In this case, it’s a pesky verification email not sending as intended. Many aspiring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-controller-support-playstation-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytalers</a> have found themselves unable to even buy the game and start it up, so let’s go through what we know so far.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-am-i-not-getting-hytale-verification-email">Why Am I Not Getting Hytale Verification Email?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Could be a long wait. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The accepted reason for Hytale email verification not working as intended is due to the Hytale servers being overloaded, causing a huge backlog of emails and applications.</strong></p>



<p>If you check the official Hytale Discord Server, Reddit, or search for “Hytale email” on X, you will find you’re most definitely not the only one suffering from this issue.</p>



<p>Quite simply, Hytale is proving to be EXTREMELY popular. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-expects-one-million-players-at-early-access-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was expecting one million players for the early access launch</a>, and one would suspect that it’s comfortably surpassed this. A wall is being hit, though, as thousands of potential buyers aren’t getting the email verification notice.</p>



<p>It was recommended that all interested parties buy the game and install the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/download-hytale-launcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale Launcher</a> before the official early access release day on January 13. If you have left it until its debut, you are likely one of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of players, all trying to verify purchases and access the game simultaneously, which is presumably more than the current server capacity can handle.</p>



<p>To be clear, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-server-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale servers</a> are working on launch day, and the email verification is a separate issue.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-i-get-my-hytale-email-verification">When Will I Get My Hytale Email Verification?</h2>



<p><strong>The fact is, you will receive the email verification notice for Hytale, but it will take time to come through. If it does, and it’s past the time limit cutoff, try again.</strong></p>



<p>The system will catch up, and the developer is likely working on increasing capacity or manually addressing the problem. The team hasn’t officially acknowledged the issue (as of writing), but rest assured that the issue won’t fall on deaf ears. Keep checking for emails, request a new one if you have to, and be patient as it all works itself out.</p>



<p>Conversely, if you’ve found a workaround that guarantees you get the email verification and proceed, let other players and those in the community know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, so the message can be shared far and wide.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[What’s The Deal With Rumiko Takahashi’s Signature Hand Pose]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/whats-the-deal-with-rumiko-takahashis-signature-hand-pose/</link>
            <guid>1405045</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Anime, like wrestling, harbors a treasure trove of tropes with hidden meaning and references that can be traced back to a point of origin beyond the show you’re watching, should you be savvy and old-head enough to spot them. I’ve been able to spot and identify a few common ones: the crying mole/freckle beauty marks under a character’s left eye (illustrative shorthand for a character harboring a tragic past); closing one eye (the character doubts something they’re saying or is being said to them); and the most common and annoying trope, getting nosebleeds when seeing a pretty girl, as visual shorthand for being incredulously aroused. But one specific trope has eluded me until today.&nbsp;</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><i><em>Ranma 1/2</em></i><span> (Image: Netflix/Mappa)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>That visual trope is famed author and illustrator of <em>Urusei Yatsura </em>Rumiko Takahashi’s signature rock-out hand sign pose. Pinky, index, and thumb extended. Ring and middle fingers curled. After years of wondering what the hell this hand sign means, I finally decided to roll up my sleeves and do the legwork to find out.</p><p>First, let’s run down what Takahashi’s hand sign doesn’t mean. Upon first blush, Takahashi’s hand sign looks an awful lot like a cross between the “<a href="https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2021/05/corna.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>corna</u></a>” (devil horns) or “<a href="https://www.colum.edu/news-and-events/announcements/2024/learn-5-asl-signs-to-spread-the-love-at-columbia-college-chicago?ref=aftermath.site"><u>I Love You</u></a>” in American Sign Language. However, the context for the gesture is neither one that screams shonen protagonist defiantly yelling “rock on!” nor is it something an idol would flash to her adoring fans on stage, so the jury is out on that one. Takahashi’s hand sign is used in reaction to something stunning or comedic happening to a character. Things like falling out of a window or walking in on someone in their pajamas.</p><figure><figcaption><p><i><em>Macross Frontier</em></i><span> and </span><i><em>Fire Force</em></i><span> (Image: Studio Nue/David Production)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Another educated guess is that the hand sign could be the <a href="https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2021/05/fox-sign.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>kitsune</u></a> (fox) gesture. This symbol, which has too many meanings to the point of being rendered meaningless, from kissing to a sock-puppet gag, is also off the mark because the thumbs aren't extended.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><i><em>Chainsaw Man</em></i><span> (Image: Mappa)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now that the wrong answers are out of the way, let’s get to the rabbit hole this educational endeavour has led me from, obvious, overthinking, and the hilarious true meaning behind Takahashi’s signature pose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who has read or seen a Takahashi work, with a functioning, wrinkled brain and the power of context clues, can readily deduce the meaning of the hand pose. The hand sign is a pantomime for a character being shocked. Usually, a character will throw out this pose if their person is harmed, be it by a falling object like an anvil, Looney Tunes style, or if someone says something shocking to them. Takahashi has used this particular visual trope in practically every series she has created. Key among them are her star-crossed rom-com <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urusei_Yatsura?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Urusei Yatsura</u></em></a>, her gender-bender martial arts romance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranma_%C2%BD?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Ranma ½</u></em></a>, and her demon-slaying isekai romance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuyasha?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Inuyasha</u></em></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><p><i><em>Nichijou</em></i><span> and </span><i><em>Tojima Wants To Be A Kamen Rider</em></i><span> (Images: Kyoto Animation/Liden Films/Toei)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>This particular visual gag serves as a full-body exclamation point for the shock a character experiences in a funny or surprising moment in a comedy series. In fact, it’s a bit that fellow throwback feeling comedy series like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichijou?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Nichijou </u></em></a>have implemented as a kind of visual punchline to a wisecrack. While knowing its context is half the battle to dissecting the hand sign, that still doesn’t explain why Takahashi opted to specifically use a hand sign that can otherwise be misconstrued for the gesture to “rock on, my dude?” Here’s where the otaku ancestors got too deep into overthinking territory to explain the articulation of the pose and its “spiritual meaning.”&nbsp;</p><p>Like <a href="https://evangelion.fandom.com/wiki/SEELE?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Seele </u></a>from <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, the otaku ancestors (who dubbed Takahashi’s hand sign the “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uruseiyatsura/comments/10xyicm/what_is_that_hand_gesture_everyone_makes/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Rumic Sign</u></a>,” referencing her collection of short stories, <em>Rumic World</em>) went full armchair anthropologist, hypothesizing that the gesture had Buddhist roots. More specifically, they posited that the hand sign’s origins lie in the <a href="https://www.originalbuddhas.com/about-buddha-statues/hand-positions/karana-mudra?srsltid=AfmBOooylYbsB2dWbR702rOMPLN_-VXq7zoK9L9rP2NPqWy-BySSE9jU&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Karana Mudra</u></a>—a gesture intended to ward off obstacles and negativity and to counter the pose with positive energy.&nbsp;</p><p>When I first came across this widely accepted double meaning, I was a second away from nodding along, eyes shut, with a grunt like, “Shit, I’d believe it.” After all, <em>Ranma ½</em> is all about spirituality, and most of Takahashi’s works feature her heroes warding off demons and the like. Appropriating the pose as a comedic bit would be a smart way to address its mystery. But if my years of coming up with concise questions to ask creators why they do the things they do when they make art have taught me anything, more often than not, anime fans put creators on a pedestal, treating them with the same reverence as <a href="https://aftermath.site/kendrick-lamar-drake-anime-naruto-bleach-one-piece/"><u>Kendrick Lamar</u></a> or <a href="https://aftermath.site/taylor-swift-britney-spears-poptimism/"><u>Taylor Swift</u></a>, assuming layers of double meaning behind their art, when, in reality, that couldn’t be further from the truth. This doubt finally led me to the real meaning of the pose.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The first instance of Takahashi using the pose in </span><i><em>Ranma 1/2</em></i><span> chapter 22. (Image: Viz Media)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While everyone in the states has been debating the hand sign’s meaning in forum posts and blogs, an interviewer from the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-worked-on-this-story-for-a-year?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Japanese publication <em>Natalie </em>just flat-out asked Takahashi about it</u></a>. In a <a href="https://natalie.mu/comic/pp/rumic35?ref=aftermath.site"><u>2013 interview celebrating Takashi’s 35th anniversary as a mangaka</u></a>, interviewer Kozue Awo asked her about the pose. After all this deliberating, Takashi’s nonchalant answer, is so fucking funny I damn near did the pose myself reading it. I’ll just leave their exchange here:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><strong>Awo: </strong>Speaking of comedy scenes, there's something I really wanted to ask you about today... There's a pose that often appears in comical scenes, where the middle and ring fingers on both hands are bent. I think that's an expression that only Takahashi-sensei would draw, but does it have any special meaning?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Takahashi:</strong> This one (she says, actually striking a pose). I drew it without thinking too much about it, but... how about, for example, if you get punched in a slapstick scene, right? If you get blown away like that, you might get the impression that it hurts or is cruel, but with this hand, strangely, it doesn't seem serious at all (laughs). I drew it thinking that it would be clear that he has the composure and that it's okay</blockquote><blockquote><br><strong>Awo: What was the first thing you drew?<p>Takahashi: </p></strong>In <em>Urusei Yatsura</em>" I think. By the way, I later received a letter from a reader telling me that this hand position means "I love you." I had no idea about that. I didn't think it was such a good pose.</blockquote><figure><figcaption><span>Photo: Gen Karaki </span></figcaption></figure><p>Incredible. Now the only mystery I’m left with from this whole ordeal is why Takahashi was fitted out in a Def Jam recordings T-shirt. Should I ever get the chance to speak with her myself, I’ll be sure to ask.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Reports are emerging about a wave of layoffs hitting Meta’s VR-centric divisions, hitting their gaming studios hard by shutting down Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games.</p>
<p>The news comes a day after the New York Times reported that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html">Meta would be cutting around 10% of the staff from the Reality Labs</a> portion of the company, which includes the Oculus Studios division. A day later and those affects are speaking on social medial.</p>


<p>Via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meta-closes-multiple-studios-lays-off-staff/">Insider Gaming</a>, Twisted Pixel designer <a href="https://xcancel.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519">Andy Gentile said</a> “I’ve just been laid off. It appears the entire [Twisted Pixel Games studio has been shut down. [Sanzaru Games] too.” This was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ray-west-b5b62b9_opentowork-activity-7416874375792082944-eXVs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4">corroborated by Sanzaru senior level designer Ray West</a>, who suggests that there could be more casualties of Meta and the tech industry’s asinine over-expenditure in pursuit of generative AI.</p>
<p>Twisted Pixel was founded 20 years ago, cutting their teeth in the early Xbox Live Arcade era of gaming with ‘Splosion Man, leading to a four year stay as part of Microsoft Games. They went independent again in 2015, latching onto the nascent virtual reality gaming scene with Wilson’s Heart in 2017, and a clutch of other titles of Oculus Rift. This led to Meta acquiring the studio in 2021, and the development of Deadpool VR for Meta Quest 3 last summer.</p>
<p>Sanzaru Games, meanwhile, got their big break in partnership with Sony and PlayStation. Their second game was Secret Agent Clank, and they went on to remaster the Sly Cooper trilogy for PS3 and develop a fourth game in the series a few years later. Work with PlayStation petered out after this – they ported the God of War Collection and Sly Collection to Vita – and they too were early to the VR party with Ripcoil and VR Sports Challenge in 2016. They were acquired by Meta in 2020 off the back of the popular action RPG Asgard’s Wrath for Oculus Rift, and had released a sequel, Asgard’s Wrath 2 for Quest 2 and 3 in 2023.</p>

<p>This sucks, and we hope those affected at Twisted Pixel, Sanzaru and across the rest of Meta’s business are able to land on their feet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In early 2009, shortly before the launch of <a href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-gotham-knights-suicide-squad-assassins-cr-1848911270"><em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em></a> and a year after Christopher Nolan’s <em>The Dark Knight,</em> developers at Monolith were working on a <em>Batman</em> game that would be connected to Nolan’s films. Gameplay footage of the game, titled Project Apollo, leaked in 2024. But now, even more footage has been uncovered showing off what could have been.</p> <p>On January 12, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrtalida.bsky.social/post/3mcba4da5xk2x">retro game archivist MrTalida uploaded</a> once-deleted-but-now-recovered Project Apollo files that were found on an old hard drive. Included in the files, which were created between April 2009 and January 2010, are video clips of early gameplay and in-engine tests of Project Apollo, with many focused on how sound and music would work in the third-person <em>Batman</em> action game. It’s interesting to see how much progress the team at Monolith made on the game over those 10 months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/project-apollo-documents-and-videos">You can find all of them on the Internet Archive.</a></p>

 <p>Perhaps the biggest and coolest new information gleaned from these leaked files is gameplay footage of the Tumbler, aka Batman’s tank-like Batmobile from the <em>Dark Knight</em> trilogy. In the leaked footage, you can see the Tumbler driving through what appears to be a large train yard while escaping police and destroying various objects and explosive barrels. In other words, a pretty standard-looking 2010-era vehicle section, the kind that would often appear in single-player AAA games around that time.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf/app.bsky.feed.post/3mcbatx32gk2v" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidyqklm2io4hbu6dko46a2ktvnrmmlkewy32vzgkfrg6ndcpx2yxa"> <p lang="en">Lastly, here's a series of videos showing the progress Monolith had made on the tumbler batmobile sections.  AFAIK, the previous leak didn't show any tumbler footage, so this may be our first peek.</p> <p>You can see how the feature progressed from Oct 2009, to Nov 2009, to Jan 2010.</p> <p>Enjoy the files!<br> 9/9</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf?ref_src=embed">MrTalida (@mrtalida.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf/post/3mcbatx32gk2v?ref_src=embed">2026-01-13T00:02:07.387Z</a></p></blockquote></div>   <h2>Why the Nolan <em>Batman</em> game was canned</h2> <p>As mentioned, <a href="https://kotaku.com/canceled-nolan-batman-game-leak-1851387503">we saw footage from a later build of this canned <em>Batman</em> game in 2024,</a> showing off combat, traversal, and more. But even before that, in 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0lRkQd9skU&amp;list=PLO9mxFELVbbHM1dR6VumpP60zBENfQr0b">Liam Robertson extensively covered this canceled project</a>, reporting various details about the title, including the fact that the game had been in development for approximately 18 months before it was killed.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The open world of Gotham could be traversed by either gliding and utilizing the grappling hook (as established in the Arkham games) or by operating the Tumbler/Batmobile. <a href="https://t.co/VZKXJBFsgP">pic.twitter.com/VZKXJBFsgP</a></p> <p>— SpideyRanger 🇬🇭 (@Dageekydude) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dageekydude/status/1775572473330672034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It was also planned to be an open-world game and would have featured a system by which randomly generated Gotham City thugs would appear to fight Batman and return, stronger and angrier, later. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Monolith would take this idea and build it into the famous Nemesis System found in 2014’s <em>Shadow of Mordor</em> and its 2017 sequel, <em>Shadow of War</em>.</p>

 <p>As for why it was canceled, Robertson reported that publisher WB Games made it clear to Monolith that the only way the project could move forward was if the studio could get Nolan to approve it. The game was to be set in his version of the <em>Batman</em> universe, after all, and the studio wanted to make sure he was involved. Sadly, Nolan seemed uninterested in the game, and Monolith eventually gave up and pivoted to making <em>Lord of the Rings</em> games. More recently, the studio was working on a <em>Wonder Woman</em> project that would have utilized the Nemesis System, <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">but sadly Monolith was shuttered by WB in February 2025.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov fans have been left bewildered by the latest string of social media posts from Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games. He recently unveiled a social profile created in 2024 linked to a website for a fictional entity named ‘CORE Corp’, and heading to that website uncovers a wealth of information.</p>



<p>At first blush, it appears to be an entirely new game, rooted in a sci-fi, interplanetary universe where Earth has been left partially destroyed by some unseen cataclysm and rendered <strong>radioactive</strong>. There are daily challenges to resolve, modules to unlock, AI characters to talk to, and stacks of mysteries to unravel.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-cor3-gg">What is COR3.GG?</h2>



<p><a href="https://os.cor3.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">COR3.gg</a> is the webpage that Escape from Tarkov lead, Nikita Buyanov, linked his followers to earlier today. It’s mocked up to look like a retro-futuristic computer interface, like something you’d find in Fallout or ARC Raiders.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Once you’ve completed the very basic login puzzle (by entering your email and getting an OTP), you’ll be given a unique identifier that you’ll need to hold on to. This will get you into the system if you happen to log out inadvertently.</p>



<p>The ‘CORIE’ operating system you’re exposed to will now present you with a string of options. You can check messages, interact with a virtual (but locked-down) browser, see that the weather is apocalyptic, and listen to a gravelly radio. There’s a notepad, an updater module, and a series of daily challenges that involve probing strings of files and attempting to figure out what the errors in them are.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>CORIE appears to be set in 2251, or thereabouts. There are ‘logs’ from the player character that serve as a little backstory to CORIE, or COR3, whatever it’s called:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today is my first day as a private investigator for “History Unfolded”.</p>



<p>The contract has been signed and all the terms agreed for. But I am still shocked about how smooth that went. Those people … the “handler” – they didn’t even ask that many questions. It seemed like they knew me for quite some time. And that Aurana chick … stunning but dangerous. She gives me chills.</p>



<p>How did I even get here … have been asking that myself for several days now. Guess wanting something new and mysterious can sometimes lead to such adventures.</p>



<p>The main goal of that “contract” is to uncover some old mysteries it seems. But I wonder if those are truly a secret for the people who hired me, because they seem to be very well informed. Like having deep knowledge on most events.</p>



<p>Maybe they are looking for an alternative opinion, or maybe they found something interesting in my personality and skill set … Honestly, I am not sure I would even like to know.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>An on-site ’employment contract’ reveals that you’ve been hired by Aurana Strogova, and that you’re tasked with ‘uncovering the files related to experiments that took place on -redacted- from 2170 to present time.’</p>



<p>The entire thing is quite bizarre.</p>



<p>The top screen for CORIE looks to be set in some kind of underground bunker. You can interact with the environment, studying various items that are described from a first-person perspective. There’s a junk box full of scrap, a ventilation system, and various pieces of armor, including a mining helmet.</p>



<p>One of the item descriptions reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Darkhound ‘Oppressor’ Modular Plate Carrier</p>



<p>A universal plate carrier from a legendary company known throughout the solar system. I’ve taken it everywhere, wherever it’s weapon-based environment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It smacks of ARC Raiders crossed with Fallout, as I mentioned before, but it’s interplanetary. There’s talk of space elevators, cargo ships adrift in the great beyond around nearby planets like Venus, and talk of immense death-ray-sounding weapons built to intimidate and deter <strong>space pirates</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s a full-fledged space council, a navy equipped with battle cruisers, and the back stories of several characters are explored at length.</p>



<p>In one section, a faction called Alternative Future can be uncovered, but it’s said that to find out more information, you’ll need to ‘visit any one of (their) outposts.’</p>



<p>This is all very confusing, and fans of Escape from Tarkov and Battlestate Games have been left bewildered. While more information is dug up, it’s worth heading over to COR3.gg and seeing what you can uncover.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's no surprise that Deadpool is coming to Marvel Rivals. Even before his <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/deadpool-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e812bb87-8a14-4388-8593-2fab410b2edf" data-entity-substitution="canonical">official reveal at the Game Awards this year</a>, it was only a matter of time before one of Marvel's most popular characters made his way to massive hero shooter. The question lied in how the developers at NetEase would adapt the character's signature swords, pistols, and meta humor into a game setting. And once that's done, which of the game's three roles the developers they assign him? According to today's reveal trailer, it'll actually be all of them.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y1sQPyhz5s?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y1sQPyhz5s?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>That's right – Deadpool can be a Duelist, Strategist, or Vanguard depending on the player's choice. His appearance remains unchanged, but his max health and moveset will fit the role. Duelist Deadpool can throw his sword to rotate like a razor blade, Vanguard Deadpool gets a deployable, spherical shield, and Strategist Deadpool heals allies by shooting them or slashing them with his katanas. It wouldn't make sense for any other character, but for Deadpool, it just feels right.</p><p>Even outside of the role-swapping, the merc with a mouth's abilities are unique, to say the least. As he fights his foes, he'll be able to level up his skills, opening up an in-game book-like menu to select what to unlock. He also has a move that deal damage to enemy players when they miss shots, as well as the ability to take photos with people he defeats. In the reveal trailer, we even see Deadpool using that photo mode to become invincible, absorbing Magneto's Ultimate Ability with his butt.</p>

      <p>Deadpool's level up screen in Marvel Rivals</p>
  
</article>

<p>As per usual, season six also brings other improvements to Marvel Rivals. A new map, Museum of Contemplation, frops January 29. Times Square, the combat-free lobby, is adding a photo mode and The Clobberin' Club, where players can duel and broadcast their match on one of the street's giant screens. Hero proficiency is also getting an overhaul. The small handful of tiers has been fully revamped to include more hero-specific rewards, including in-game currency and animated character avatars.</p><p>Finally, more team-ups are coming, while others are phased out. Peni will lose her team-up with Rocket, and Spider-Man will lose his team-up with Human Torch. However, Peni and Spider-Man are getting a new team-up (which grants Spider-Man a web bomb), and Jeff is getting a team-up with Deadpool, which creates a spinning toy that heals allies and covers enemies' screens with animated Deadpools. You can see the full list of updates in the video below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmU6RtypJ3w?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmU6RtypJ3w?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>For more Marvel Rivals, check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/30/gender-swapped-lady-loki-skin-comes-to-marvel-rivals-for-the-month-of-january">the limited-time Lady Loki skin</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/marvel-rivals/a-super-shooter">our review from last year</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/13/deadpool-officially-joins-marvel-rivals-season-6-as-a-duelist-and-a-strategist-and-a]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Oh My God, Am I A Genius At Irish Language Wordle]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/irish-wordle-foclach/</link>
            <guid>1404997</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>Wordle</em> fever has largely come and gone, as has the frantic explosion of spinoff games. But the game itself lives on under the <a href="https://aftermath.site/new-york-times-wordle-connections-puzzmo-games/" rel="noreferrer">ownership of The New York Times</a>, and many of the games inspired by it are still thriving. So I wasn't exactly surprised to come across an Irish language version this morning, but I <em>was </em>surprised to see that it was still updating with daily puzzles. And I was even more surprised to win today's game, a clear sign that I am an Irish language genius.</p><p><a href="https://www.foclach.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><em>Foclach</em></a> is <em>Wordle</em>, but in Irish. ("<a href="https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/foclach?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Foclach</a>" means "wordy" or "verbose," and is a word I didn't know before; thanks, game!) It was created in 2022 by Linda Keating, who told the <a href="https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/its-filling-people-with-joy-irish-woman-creates-foclach-the-irish-version-of-wordle/41309366.html?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Irish Independent</a> that "part of the pure joy [of it] is pulling together this community of Irish language speakers" around the game, which had over 10,000 players in 2022. A fan of word games, Keating built the game using a <em>Wordle</em> clone and drew from several lists of five-letter Irish words. Unlike <em>Wordle</em>, <em>Foclach</em> has a practice mode, and Keating told the Irish Independent that adding the mode was when the game "really took off." She said she has no plans to monetize it--"I’ll never put it behind a paywall or I’ll never put ads on the website"--and that its simplicity is part of its charm, saying "it’s the kind of thing you would have seen on the web going back to the 1990s."</p><p>I've been <a href="https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking/" rel="noreferrer">learning Irish</a> since the spring from a combination of books, in-person and online classes, and the <a href="https://aftermath.site/duolingo-ai/" rel="noreferrer">horrors</a> of Duolingo. It's been tough--it's a complicated language, and there also aren't as many opportunities to encounter it in daily life as there are with other languages that are more widespread. (On Friday I went to a play at New York's <a href="https://irishartscenter.org/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Irish Arts Center</a>, and I was so smitten with the fact that the building has signage in Irish <em>and</em> that I could read that signage that I trespassed up several floors before I realized it.) All of this is to say that <em>Foclach</em> presented me with a unique challenge: unlike <em>Wordle</em>, I just don't know that many Irish words to guess.</p><p>So I was shocked when I got Tuesday's daily puzzle on my fifth of six tries, relying solely on my own knowledge of Irish. <strong>(Spoilers ahead if you're going to play it yourself.)</strong> I feel like it's key to start off with a good first guess in games like this, so I decided to go with "rudaí" ("things") because it contains a variety of vowels, including a fada, or accent mark. (Fada add another complication to <em>Foclach</em>; there are some words that are spelled the same but mean <a href="https://www.bitesize.irish/blog/our-fada/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">different things</a> depending on the fada.) I definitely wasn't as economical with my guesses as I am in English, using letters I knew weren't in the answer because they were in words I knew. But I managed to get close enough to make an educated guess at the last letter, and was pumped when I got it right.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Scrín means "shrine." Another new word!</span></figcaption></figure><p>Things didn't go as well when I picked a practice puzzle at random. "Rudaí" only got me an "a," and from there I floundered for appropriate words. My vocabulary was lacking, but there were a few guideposts to help me: vowels in Irish are divided into "broad" (a, o, u) and "slender" (e, i) and have to stick together in certain ways, which helped me pin down the order of a bunch of vowels. But then I was stuck with one missing letter. I went to the dictionary, but without the first letter, it was hard to search. I even looked up some of the word lists <em>Foclach</em> is based on, but they didn't help much either. Eventually, much like in <em>Wordle</em>, I just went through each remaining letter to see if they'd form a word--but unlike in <em>Wordle</em>, I didn't really <em>know</em> if my results were actually words at all. I managed to get the practice puzzle's answer of "mnaoi" (an unusual form of "bean," or "woman") by being familiar with the cluster of "mna" as a plausible run of letters  ("mná" is "women," the plural of "bean.").</p><figure><figcaption><span>My guess of "gnaoi" is also a word, meaning "beauty" or "comeliness," but I didn't know that when I guessed it; I only guessed it because I knew "g" could come before "n" based on a phrase I already know, "de gnáth" for something like "typically"</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's really fun for me about <em>Foclach</em> is how it asks me to use my language skills in a totally different way than <em>Wordle</em>. In the English game, I'm guessing <em>words</em>, drawing on my vocabulary knowledge in a way that makes the game's primary pleasure being proficient with English. I felt <em>smart</em> when I used to get the <em>Wordle</em> in a few tries (I <a href="https://writersagainstthewarongaza.com/boycott-nyt?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">don't play it</a> anymore). But with <em>Foclach</em>, my key strategy can't really be vocabulary, because my Irish vocabulary is so small. So I have to pull on the related skills I employed above, like spelling rules and other words I know. It feels like a totally different way to think about both word games and Irish, and instead of feeling clever when I got the answers, I felt like I'd climbed a mountain. It's a really cool way to engage with a language I'm learning, and I love how it forces me to explore the dictionary and learn new words.</p><p>Thanks to the practice mode, I have years of <em>Foclach</em> to go through, and I'm so excited to play more of it. It's definitely going into my daily rotation alongside my other Irish game, <a href="https://www.teanglann.ie/en/spelling-game/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">dictionary website Teanglann's spelling game</a>, which I'll say I'm pretty good at as long as I limit the dialects it draws from. Obviously I won't be able to maintain my 100% win rate forever, but I'll relish in it while I can.</p>

              <p><span>Gaming executive Larry Hyrb, aka Major Nelson, has revealed this week that he’s out at the game engine maker Unity. The Xbox veteran joined as Director of Community and Advocacy only a couple of years ago.</span></p> <p><span>“After nearly three decades of making an impact at Microsoft, I joined Unity in 2024. During my time there, I rebuilt their Community and Advocacy Team with a deliberate strategy that created a clearer, more connected experience for creators, developers, and gamers,” Hyrb </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hryb_ive-always-been-transparent-with-this-community-activity-7416864352840085504-MDJc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACLzsjMBiEcKGm66u9szH_XVpdQ1NU1SZcQ"><span>explained on LinkedIn</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Hyrb continued: “We brought energy back to channels that had gone quiet, restored trust, and showed up consistently where it mattered. I elevated Unity’s visibility at PAX and key industry events, strengthened relationships, and ensured Unity had a clear voice in the broader conversation.”</span></p>   <p><span>It’s not exactly clear when Hyrb was laid off or if the departure is part of a bigger wave of fresh cuts at the software company. “I’ve had invigorating conversations over the past weeks with companies in tech and non-tech spaces to discuss partnerships,” he said on </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hryb.me/post/3mccuyabbv22d"><span>BlueSky</span></a><span>. “I love what I do but I also believe change is necessary. I’ll let you know where I go from here.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Major Nelson was previously an important public figure within the Xbox community. He spent almost 23 years at Microsoft, fostering the Xbox Live community and promoting the Xbox 360’s user-facing features, including the Achievement system, cloud saves, in-game messaging, and party chat.</span></p>

  <p><span>He left </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-major-nelson-larry-hryb-official-podcast-microsoft-1850642324"><span>Microsoft back in 2023</span></a><span>, a move that preceded Xbox’s pivot to being multiplatform and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ps5-exclusives-streaming-1851722886"><span>broader marketing strategy</span></a><span> that didn’t have a single piece of hardware at its center. The brand hasn’t been as public facing, let alone as community-first, since Hyrb’s departure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Unity has had a rough several years. In 2023, the company announced that it would install a new Runtime Fee, but was eventually </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-install-runtime-fees-canceled-ceo-blog-post-price-1851647405"><span>reversed due to immense backlash from developers</span></a><span>. A few months later, then CEO </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-john-riccitiello-ea-intall-fee-resign-fifa-madden-1850914295"><span>John Riccitiello stepped down</span></a><span>. In 2024, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-layoffs-1800-people-jobs-25-percent-january-2024-1851150254"><span>Unity laid off a massive chunk of its workforce</span></a><span>, eliminating around 1,800, or 25%, of its employees. Last year, Unity then </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-unity-continues-layoffs-with-abrupt-communications-and-5am-emails"><span>laid off its Behavior team</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals Deadpool can play 3 roles: Duelist, Vanguard, and Strategist, and you can choose which role you want to play. </p>



<p>Season 6 of Marvel Rivals, Night at the Museum, is all set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-6-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kick off</a> on January 16, 2026, and it will finally bring the most anticipated character to the game, Deadpool. The developers have now released their Dev Vision Vol. 13, which goes over the new characters along with all the new content and changes coming to Marvel Rivals Season 6. </p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-deadpool-features-3-roles-in-one">Marvel Rivals Deadpool Features 3 Roles in One </h2>



<p>The latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmU6RtypJ3w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dev Vision Vol. 13</a> started very differently from the previous Marvel Rivals dev diary. In the most Deadpool fashion, the Merc with the Mouth stepped into Guangguang’s role and walked us through his character details himself. Deadpool first addressed the complaints about the game not having enough Vanguard and Strategists, revealing that he is the solution, as Deadpool can play as a Duelist, Vanguard, and Strategist in Marvel Rivals. </p>



<p>Deadpool features Dual Pistols and Dual Katanas, allowing him to battle the enemies at range and up close and take up the Duelist role. As a Vanguard, the character has a unicorn plushie that can give out shields. Lastly, the Dual Pistols and Dual Katanas can not only damage enemies but also heal allies when shooting at them as a Strategist. </p>



<p>Additionally, Deadpool in Marvel Rivals can level up while the battle goes on until he becomes a “true server admin”, no matter which role you pick. The character’s ultimate ability charges faster depending on “how fancy” the player fights, which leads to a challenge to other players. Depending on how the players answer Deadpool’s questions, the character will receive a huge buff according to the role he is playing.  </p>

            <guid>1404970</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War has been in hibernation since 2017, and its most recent installment was far from universally well-received. So when King Art Games was handed the task of bringing it back, there were a lot of tricky decisions to navigate and an eager but picky fanbase to face. We recently got to chat with Creative Director Jan Theysen and Senior Game Designer Elliott Verbiest about how the team is calling the shots. (Read on or watch the video interview below.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was King Art's previous game, Iron Harvest, that seemed to catch the attention of someone at Games Workshop. And it's not too difficult to see why, if you look at its big, stompy robots.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So we were working on Iron Harvest, our previous game, an RTS game as well," Theysen recalled. "And that was a Kickstarter game. So we were very open about the development and we showed a lot of stuff we can do with the engine and what we do in terms of art and so on. And as someone at Games Workshop must have seen that and they basically contacted us and asked, 'If we were doing Dawn of War 4, what would you do, basically?' And so we made a little pitch and we sent them over our ideas and the presentation and we didn't really hear back from them a lot. And so we basically thought, okay, that's it, right? It's like, cool that they asked us, basically. And then when Iron Harvest came out and was successful, they basically came back and said, 'Okay, let's talk about it for real.' But you can't really believe it, right? Yeah, well, okay, now they're asking us, but in reality, we're not going to make Dawn of War 4. And then slowly but surely it becomes more realistic and you don't really dare to believe it, right? And then at some point you sign the contract and it's like, holy… it's there. We're doing it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For many, myself included, Dawn of War was the gateway to the whole Warhammer 40K universe. And King Art hopes this next installment might be as well. It's a sprawling and… sometimes convoluted setting, so that's not exactly a straightforward task.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's funny because we hear that a lot, right?" Theysen agreed. "And that was also one of the big things for Dawn of War 4, that a lot of people say, 'Okay, Dawn of War, yes, that was like the first time I really interacted with Warhammer.' And so for us, it was very important to basically make a Dawn of War 4 that is of course for fans, but also a potential entry point for someone who's new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah. I think I remember basically how I felt when I played Dawn of War for the first time and it was like, okay, super cool, but also I don't understand a lot, right? But I understood enough so the game was fun. It was not like I had to know what all the different weapons do or something like that. It was more like, okay, I can figure it out.  And I think that is also the approach we take for Dawn of War 4, which is basically without any prior knowledge of Warhammer, you still need to understand what the factions are about, what the units are about. You won't understand all the different weapons and equipment and all of that, but it's fine, you can figure it out."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking the brutal, aggressive Orks as an example, the goal with the design of the whole faction is that you should naturally be able to figure out how to play without knowing a ton about their lore or having to have it spelled out for you. But those of us who have been living part of our lives in this universe for years should still have stuff to get excited about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We don't really tell the players, if you play Orks, you should have a lot of units and a lot of buildings and just have this explosive expansion," Theysen explained. "It just kind of feels natural to play that way, right? Because buildings are cheap, units are cheap, you lose a lot, so you build a lot ... We make sure that even if the people don't know what Orks are about, they can still play them correctly, basically."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think that's actually one of the main appeals for the Warhammer 40K universe is that enormous breadth and depth of things that you can potentially learn," Verbiest added. "It's definitely one of the things that attracted me to it was that, okay, sure, of course there is a surface level understanding of it that you can introduce to the games, for example, through a story or a campaign that kind of gets you into that world essentially. But there's so much more to it. And I think that that promise of, hey, there's much more going on beneath the surface, I think is what attracts so many fans to it. And I think that's also how you can serve both fans old and new is that you introduce a story, something to help onboard players into this world, but you have enough detail and other things within that, that signal to more established, more veteran fans of the universe, hey, we are aware of this and we speak the same language. We have the same understanding here."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Deciding what Dawn of War 4 was going to be in context of the previous entries was a judgment call all its own.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But even within the Dawn of War envelope, there are different players bringing different expectations to the table. Dawn of War 1 was more of a traditional basecraft RTS. Dawn of War 2 put the focus more on upgrading a few elite squads, almost like an RPG. And Dawn of War 3 was… well, I try not to think about it too much. But even it had its fans, apparently. So deciding what Dawn of War 4 was going to be in context of the previous entries was a judgment call all its own.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I mean, that was definitely one of the big questions at the beginning, right?" Theysen said. "What is a Dawn of War game, right? Because Dawn of War 1 and 2, at least everybody here at the company really loves, but they're very different games. And you can say, okay, maybe we can make a kind of best off of both of those. But we're not sure that that actually works. And so in the end we said, okay, we have to go with one of them. And we said ultimately, okay, let's go a little bit back to the roots, right? Let's do Dawn of War 1, or our version or our interpretation of Dawn of War 1. Let's see if something from Dawn of War 2 or even 3 works with that. And if it does, sure, then let's put it in. But Dawn of War 1 was clearly our guiding star."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And it's really interesting because that also informed a lot of the gameplay and design decisions that we made as well," Verbiest elaborated. "The real time strategy genre is also something that has very different market segments or different audiences that have very different, sometimes conflicting needs. And I think that having that clarity of vision of, we want to go for Dawn of War 1 and how people felt about that definitely also informed a lot of the choices that we made as to what kind of parts of the game are we focusing on. So that's why we have this emphasis on the campaigns as kind of like our flagship feature, as well as having all these fantastic cinematics and CGIs that we then have then to inform that story. Because that's something that I think a lot of people were missing from the genre for quite a while."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And storytelling is poised to be front-and-center for Dawn of War 4. While many RTSes have led with a competitive multiplayer mindset, King Art is putting a lot of emphasis on their dynamic campaigns and the single-player experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Because that is like the first big decision we made was basically, okay, if we do a Dawn of War 4, we want four factions back and not only three," Theysen continued. "And if we have four factions, we really would like to tell a story for each of the factions, right? And then all of the four campaigns have this overarching story, basically. And for us, that just felt like a natural thing we wanted to do because we like campaigns, we know that a lot of RTS players like campaigns, and so let's really focus on that. And then we made our lives even harder because we decided, okay, let's maybe also have the campaigns be a little bit non-linear. So there are things like, you can pick which of the Ork bosses you want to play, for example. Or there are missions that are mutually exclusive or things that you can optionally do and so on. And so for us, it's like this: the campaign is like the heart of the whole thing and that has to work. But of course, then also we have multiplayer and we have Last Stand and so on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're interested to hear more about the nonlinear aspects of the Ork campaign, keep an eye out for our hands-on preview later this month. Then be sure to check out all of our other Dawn of War 4 coverage as part of IGN First, including the Ork cinematic trailer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The God of War TV Series is still a ways off, but one of the key players of both the God of War (2018) and God of War Ragnarök video games says he’d be open to continuing his work on that and other God of War projects. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking exclusively with IGN during an interview about his work on the Disney+ series Percy Jackson and the Olympians, composer Bear McCreary said he isn’t completely done with the God of War franchise. I asked McCreary if he'd be interested in expanding his work into other media or if his time on God of War was done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I still feel that I am very proud of the work that I've done (with God of War),” McCreary replied. “And if there were an opportunity to expand upon it, I would be open to that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McCreary previously said that he felt his work on God of War was “complete,” but now seems open to revisiting the popular video game series in television form. The show is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/upcoming-new-video-game-movies-2026-tv-shows-release-dates"><u>being developed</u></a> by Sony Pictures Television and PlayStation Productions to stream on Prime Video. The series, which is being helmed by Battlestar Galactica showrunner <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ronald-d-moore-discusses-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-the-tone-of-the-show-is-trying-to-emulate-the-tone-of-the-game-sdcc-2025"><u>Ronald D. Moore</u></a>, will follow Kratos and Atreus as they travel to the highest peak in the nine realms of Norse mythology to spread the ashes of their late wife and mother.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For his part, McCreary said that his experience working on God of War was unique to the many other franchises he’s scored, which include Lord of the Rings, Halo, Star Wars, Marvel, Terminator, and the aforementioned Percy Jackson.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The great thing about working on these God of War games (is) they are so expansive,” McCreary explained. “I don't think I have written anything musically in the two games and DLC that hasn't been discovered. If anything, I think the more you dig into it, what I hope is evident is how much the team and I (were) always working to just make it better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At the end of every one of these massive games, after I've played through it and all I want to do is sleep, I'm like, ‘Here's what we should do next time.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McCreary added that working on video games is inherently different from producing music for TV or movies given the interactive nature of the storytelling. “We (were) always pushing the boundaries on God of War,” he said. “For example, in God War Ragnarök we decided to implement a ‘do no harm to melody’ rule. What that means is if (a player is) really doing well in a skirmish or an encounter, you start getting these character themes and it changes depending on who your partner is in the game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Biggest TV Shows Coming to Every Streaming Service in 2026</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“But let's say it's Kratos's theme. If you win, normally there'd just be a big splash and it would stop. But in Ragnarök, there's the big splash, everything else stops, but that melody completes itself. It sounds simple, but it took thousands of man hours from a half dozen people to be able to do that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond God of War, McCreary’s love of gaming runs deep. So much so that he’s itching to write music for a rhythm game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would love to do something like that,” McCreary said. “I'm always looking for interesting projects, interesting people to collaborate with. One of my favorite games from the last generation is Stray. I think I've played it through seven or eight times. And I'm very interested in (indie) and AA gaming. I think there's a lot of experimentation that happens there. And I love the medium. I'm putting it out there.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stay tuned later this week for more from our interview with Bear McCreary. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Peyton is the Senior Editorial Director of Events &amp; Entertainment at IGN, leading entertainment content and coverage of tentpole events including IGN Live, San Diego Comic Con, gamescom, and IGN Fan Fest.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A Season 1 extension update arrives January 20.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have announced the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> Season 2 release date has been delayed as it works to address community feedback with an extended Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind last year’s new Battlefield game announced a delay for the long-awaited new season with an enigmatic Season 2 trailer and <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-and-redsec-season-1-january-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. The trailer itself is only seven seconds long, showing a gas mask emerge from green smoke before promising a Battlefield 6 and REDSEC Season 2 release date of February 17.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Battlefield (@Battlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/2011106206014685329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 13, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"This revised launch has been implemented to allow extra time to further develop and refine Season 2 as a result of community feedback," a message from the developers says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a nearly one-month late start for the next wave of content for the troubled shooter, which had previously been scheduled to deliver new maps, modes, updates, and more January 20. With Battlefield 6 Season 2 now set to launch mid-February, players have been told to expect a Season 1 extension update to arrive January 20 in its place. EA and BF Studios say the decision was made to “further polish and refine Season 2” in order to “keep our promise” of providing worthwhile content updates for all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are also reinforcing Battlefield Labs as the public preview for future game updates in the late stages of development,” the message says. “Both the Season 1 extension and the use of Battlefield Labs will set the foundation for new and exciting content throughout our live seasons, including what will come in Season 2.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More details on Battlefield 6 Season 2 will arrive in February, with a “greater 2026 roadmap” for both it and REDSEC set to follow “in the near future.” In the meantime, the Battlefield 6 Season 1 extension is still said to give players some of the balance tweaks and new content they’ve been begging for in recent weeks. BF Studios tells players to expect detailed patch notes prior to the extension's release date next week, teasing the update will include a showcase of Portal community experiences, severeal double XP periods, and free daily login rewards to help with the wait.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most substantial addition coming with the Battlefield 6 Season 1 extension is the Frostfitre Bonus Path, which is launching January 27. Free rewards include a Hardware XP boost, a vehicle skin, and other customization items, with battle pass owners also able to earn a new weapon package, a career XP boost, and more. Progress on the Frostfire Bonus Path is made conurrently with with the Season 1 battle pass and is said to require 110 Bonus Path points to fully complete. Frostfire Bonus Path points will also be earned via weekly challenges, not Bonus Challenges like what was seen in previous Bonus Paths.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Valentine's Day event is also set to arrive in Battlefield 6 during the extended Season 1. Details about what it includes outside of the promise of double XP weekends and daily login rewards are under wraps for now, with EA only telling players to keep an eye on its social media pages for any and all updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Moving forward together, we look forward to continuing our conversations with you, the Battlefield community, both in-game and across our official channels," the message signs off. "Again, thank you for being a part of our community and joining us for the future of this franchise, starting with our next update on January 20, 2026."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/losing-steam-3-months-after-launch-its-time-for-a-check-in-with-battlefield-6-and-its-community">checked in on Battlefield 6 earlier this month</a> and found that a lack of content updates, communication from BF Studios, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-lay-out-game-plan-after-winter-offensive-update-introduces-widespread-issues-across-pc-and-consoles">a disappointing end with Season 1: Winter Offensive</a> seemed to have caused its recent drop off in player interest. Contributing to an increase in negative user reviews was controversy involving <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-fans-accuse-ea-of-selling-ai-generated-image-after-spotting-what-looks-like-an-m4a1-with-two-barrels">EA's alleged use of generative AI material</a>. Now, it seems players are simply waiting with bated breath to see if Battlefield 6 will be able to regain the momentum it had following its October 10 launch for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its late 2025 troubles, Battlefield 6 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-off-to-huge-start-on-steam-with-over-740000-concurrent-players-just-hours-after-launch">came out swinging at launch</a>.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Collaborative challenges aren't a brand-new concept for Games Done Quick--the twice-yearly speedrunning charity event--but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsdhHhCdi3VljAB_8cVnjPg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KingJO444</a> took things just a little bit further for Awesome Games Done Quick 2026. On January 10 in Pittsburgh, he gathered a group of 70 players together to attempt an absurdly chaotic challenge: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-this-ridiculous-70-person-super-mario-64-relay/1100-6537329/">Collect 70 stars in Super Mario 64</a> with 70 different players. Somehow, he and the community were successful, completing the challenge in under two hours.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn't an easy feat to come up with an estimated time for the run, at all, because of the 70 people who participated--each getting exactly one star before passing off the controller--only between 15-20 had any serious experience running the game. Of the remaining players, some had not played Super Mario 64 since childhood, and others had never played the game at all.</p><p dir="ltr">"You never know how much someone's going to practice, or what's going to happen on stage," KingJ told us in a post-run interview. He set the estimated time to complete the run at an hour and 40 minutes, but this was only slightly longer than the current world record. </p><p dir="ltr">"I thought that gave enough of a buffer, but also, I kind of underestimated how many people were going to go in for their first time ever playing the game," KingJ added. "And not only that, but we also had blindfolded runners, which added on top of that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-VFPEh59k4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r-VFPEh59k4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That meant a whole lot of training throughout the week leading up to the run. Several of the more experienced runners worked with the newcomers, ensuring they could get the star they were assigned. One was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ad129/videos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ad129</a>, who was also very familiar with the game and supported KingJ since early in the planning phase.</p><p dir="ltr">"We spent most of the time in the practice room just having a [game] setup, if not multiple setups, and people would come on by and just do their star--either practicing or just verifying that they could do it. It was very awesome to see someone coming in with no experience in the game and we teach them the star," they added.</p><p dir="ltr">And for the most part, things went off without much of a hitch during the run. Some stars were easier than others (a few literally just talked to Toad to get a few freebies) but the pace at which the speedrunners swapped in and out of their positions and kept things moving was extremely impressive. At one point, too many failures on a certain challenge would have meant game over, but KingJ brought several Nintendo 64 consoles as redundancy options in case of an emergency, swapping to another nearly identical save file on another system in order to keep the run moving.</p><p dir="ltr">It'll be at least 18 months before GDQ is ready for a run of this magnitude again, KingJ said, but his next collaborative speedrunning attempt will likely be a bit smaller.</p><p dir="ltr">"Maybe not 70 people," he said with a laugh. "But something like Mario Kart would be a very fun one. Or something along those lines.

                <p>Electronic Arts has never been a particularly popular company in the eyes of consumers, but Hazelight Studios founder Josef Fares, who collaborated on three titles with the publisher, was willing to go up to bat for it during a recent interview.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, the Split Fiction director said that there are "a lot of great people at EA" who "respect" Hazelight's work and "leave [them] be." Then, in classic Josef Fares fashion, he argued that "there’s not a publisher in the world that hasn’t f****d up now and then."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How Can EA Save Its Reputation?</p>
      </div>
<p>While EA has an infamous reputation, "earning" the title<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-exec-responds-to-worst-company-in-america-contr/1100-6443178/" data-ref-id="1100-6443178"> of "Worst Company in America"</a> from the website Consumerist in 2012 and 2013, Fares still believed that "EA is getting more sh*t than they deserve."</p><p>The list of reasons for video game players to roast EA is long enough to warrant its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Electronic_Arts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">own Wikipedia page</a>. Fans of studios like BioWare and franchises like Titanfall and Battlefield have raised grievances over EA's management of them. In the past year, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-studio-cancels-two-incubation-projects-lays-off-staff-amid-big-ea-shakeup/1100-6531200/" data-ref-id="1100-6531200">reportedly cancelled anticipated titles</a> and underwent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-its-developer-and-lays-off-additional-staff/1100-6531883/" data-ref-id="1100-6531883">mass layoffs</a>. EA is far from the only big gaming company that engages in such business practices, though.</p><p>"I mean, come on, Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony, everybody’s done something that’s not good," Fares continued. "But for some reason, EA has become this bad guy."</p><p>Fares emphasized Hazelight's "great relationship" with EA, while acknowledging that the company has made "mistakes like every other publisher." And it's been a lucrative relationship for Hazelight as well, with Split Fiction <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-sales-are-nearly-double-what-ea-expected-so-far/1100-6531353/" data-ref-id="1100-6531353">vastly exceeding EA's sales projections</a> when it launched last year.</p><p>As valid as Fares's points may be, EA's reputation will certainly be tested going forward, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-acknowledges-risk-of-selling-to-saudi-arabia-claims-it-will-retain-creative-control/1100-6535894/" data-ref-id="1100-6535894">company's proposed sale</a> to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund sparking concerns that new ownership will lead to shifts in the company's culture and content.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> and developer <strong>Cyanide Studio</strong> announced that there is a limited-time free <strong>Styx: Blades of Greed demo</strong> available for download on PC via <strong>Steam</strong>. The demo is approximately <strong>17GB</strong> in size and includes <strong>the full first hour</strong> of the game from its beginning. </p>



<p>Players will <strong>infiltrate a massive golem</strong> attacking Styx to destroy it from the inside and also experience Styx's first real mission, <strong>a high-risk zeppelin theft</strong> under the ever-watchful eye of the Inquisition in the first open environment of the game, The Wall. According to the developers, it's a 'focused taste' of the tone, systems, and level of freedom that will be in the full game. There's an extra bit of good news: the demo's save data will carry over to the full game, so you won't have to replay the first hour if you don't want to.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Nacon has also <strong>kicked off pre-orders on all platforms</strong> (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X). The <strong>Standard Edition</strong> with Pre-order Bonus includes the base game and the Master of Shadows Skin from the first installment and is available for purchase at a price of <strong>€49.99</strong>, <strong>$49.99</strong>, and <strong>£44.99</strong> <strong>on consoles</strong>, and <strong>€39.99</strong>, <strong>$39.99</strong>, and <strong>£34.99</strong> <strong>on PC</strong> via Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>The pricier <strong>Quartz Edition</strong>, on the other hand, includes the base game, two days of early access, the Greedy and Legacy skin packs for Styx and his weapons, a Starter Pack with two talent points and some crafting resources, and 5 additional taunts to lure enemies. The Master of Shadows Skin pre-order bonus is also included. If you want the Quartz Edition for Styx: Blades of Greed, it'll set you back <strong>€59.99</strong>, <strong>$59.99</strong>, and <strong>£54.99</strong> on consoles and <strong>€49.99</strong>, <strong>$49.99</strong>, and <strong>£44.99</strong> on PC via Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>Finally, there's a new <strong>Styx: Master of Stealth Collection bundle</strong> that brings together the whole stealth series: 2014's <strong>Styx: Master of Shadows</strong>, 2017's <strong>Styx: Shards of Darkness</strong>, and the new Styx: Blades of Greed in its Quartz Edition. This is available for <strong>€69.99</strong>, <strong>$69.99</strong>, and <strong>£64.99</strong> on consoles, and is also available on PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/65163/Styx_Master_of_Stealth_Collection__Prepurchase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>, albeit at a higher price of <strong>€85.50</strong>.</p>



<p>Our own Francesco De Meo played the demo in advance as part of a press event and <a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed cautious optimism</a>:</p>



<p><em>While I don't expect Styx: Blades of Greed to set the market on fire, as its hardcore stealth approach is still going to leave anyone who isn't a stealth game fanatic frustrated, the new entry in the series by Cyanide seems to evolve the series' formula considerably, providing a sandbox stealth experience that works incredibly well with its wealth of options.</em></p>



<p>Styx: Blades of Greed launches on <strong>February 19, 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>Twisted Pixel and Sanzaru's shutdown are likely part of plans Meta apparently has to cut roughly 10% of the employees in its Reality Labs business, which works primarily on VR and AR content, as reported by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">New York Times</a>.</p><p>That would include both studios; Twisted Pixel's last game was <em>Marvel's Deadpool VR</em>, released last year, while Sanzaru's most recent titles are both in the <em>Asgard's Wrath </em>series, which was created for VR headsets.</p><p>According to the New York Times' report, these cuts are part of a general shift in terms of Meta's direction, with the company now planning to focus more of its resources into the development of AI systems.</p><p>Generative AI has proven to be a controversial subject in the gaming industry, with some major companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="746600ea-ef36-4d95-b141-ab37281d9e3e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">embracing the technology</a> while others <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooded-horse-no-gen-ai-contracts" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf049e2-a4f8-41a0-b834-8030bfbcc977" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">excoriate it</a> for its environmental impact and the (perceived) poor quality of the assets it generates.</p><figure role="group">

They join the likes of Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c381dd9-8d80-4d19-ac2f-5c64bbb6ef55" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Halifax division</a>, <em>Squid Game: Unleashed </em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/boss-fight-entertainment-netflix-shutdown" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9711bede-314c-4ee1-8135-fe8d85504170" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Boss Fight</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shut-down-funcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7586356a-08b1-450a-a88c-9b10c217225a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Metal: Hellsinger </em>studio The Outsiders</a>, to name but a few.</p><p>Neither Sanzaru nor Twisted Pixel's shutdown have been officially confirmed by studio management, and Meta hasn't provided an official comment either.

              <p><span>In a move that will surprise absolutely no one who has paid attention to </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>in the past five years, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895"><span>very expensive Lego sets</span></a><span> featuring </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/comparing-legos-new-200-pikachu-set-to-mega-bloks-50-version-2000658904"><span>Pikachu, Eevee</span></a><span>, and the Kanto starters are selling out pretty fast. When Pokémon merchandise sells out, it inevitably ends up on reseller sites like </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=charizard+lego&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2332490.m570.l1313"><span>Ebay</span></a><span> for astronomical prices. What do you get when you scalp already expensive toy blocks? Prices that’ll cost you enough to buy multiple game consoles and video games.</span></p> <p><span>The set featuring Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur is supposed to run for $649.99, but now that pre-orders are selling out, resellers are listing the 6800+ pieces of Lego blocks for anywhere from </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Lego+pokemon+badges&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1313"><span>$800 to over a grand</span></a><span>. Some of the listings include the Kanto Badges set that is being offered to those who bought the starters, while there are others that have only one of the three monsters for sale, despite them not being sold separately by Lego itself. I guess despite the reseller markup, if you really only wanted one of them, this would be cheaper than buying all three at retail price. Live your truth.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though that’s the most expensive of the sets, it’s not the only one that scalpers got a hold of to flip and turn a profit. The </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/257306955329?_skw=pokemon+lego&amp;itmmeta=01KEW627JW5AGPJKXJZ60CN4GG&amp;hash=item3be8b08e41:g:lnkAAeSwn0VpZm0T&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQALAAAA8O7PUuNWmJ%2B%2BUShgI9tQz%2FpNjcghLv%2BTt%2FEVUa7n%2BFKBL3oQ%2BSztckicHbIHKISlddEAhuGmBnxMjo0MNMFFWsHQKGE3fQ6%2Bk94YIwi28ayFOVrzfonRqCks5ykLmQY8zsw60phy2xhRnY%2BCeqasoyUR3ZK%2B9hT3pqDCx%2B3Lly7uxDfgI93mX%2B4NkWiiVl6caiC8OqhC8sPU22%2FjDgWq3vrU2ZBGcrGj82jQVPb96lsqdRQ2bJdcIZcW%2BGd1nQ5VA8yrjS2KHllSMOwrbcr%2FAnsNGqlG4eG1MEBrXvydhlFpwXrepxxc5K%2BrcjjwNUMkqA%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR9r5iIb3Zg"><span>Pikachu</span></a><span> model is also popping up, though it is much, much cheaper than the Kanto trio. Before you hop on that one, though, do keep in mind that pre-orders for the Pikachu and Eevee models haven’t sold out in the U.S. yet, so you can still get those (very expensive) blocky boys for their original price.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>Lego sets will be available in stores on February 27, which marks the series’ 30th anniversary. We’ll also be expecting some major announcements from the company’s annual “Pokémon Day” stream, which usually covers games, toys, and pretty much every other facet of the franchise. </span></p>
