            <p>
Monster hit Palworld is yet to receive any formal legal threat from Nintendo or The Pokémon Company, the game's developer has confirmed, despite continuing close comparisons between its creature designs.
</p>
<p>
Palworld's breakout success at the beginning of this year - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-says-it-will-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-following-claims-palworld-copied-designs">and its obvious similarities to Pokémon</a> - prompted a rare public statement from The Pokémon Company, which pledged to "investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon".
</p>
<p>
But, speaking to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">GameFile</a>, Palworld creator Takuro Mizobe said that threat was never followed up behind the scenes.

<p>
"[We heard] nothing at all," Mizobe said. "Nintendo and the Pokémon Company didn't say anything to us."
</p>
<p>
In the same interview, Mizobe discussed how his career as a game developer got started via a year-long training programme backed by Nintendo. As a student in the programme, Mizobe ultimately helped launch a free downloadable game for the Nintendo DSi (a simple shooter named The Tentai Show launched only in Japan, it tasked players with defending Earth from impending meteoroids).
</p>
<p>
"I always think: To make new things is very hard," Mizobe said when asked what he'd learned from working with Nintendo.

<p>
"In game development, of course, sometimes we have to do it, but, as much as possible, I try to avoid creating new things."
</p>
<p>
Next up for Mizobe is continuing work on Palworld, which will this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-gets-new-island-and-more-in-sakurajima-update">get a new island to explore and a PVP arena</a>, and the ongoing addition of more "Pals". A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-community-manager-teases-ps5-version">PlayStation 5 version of Palworld</a> has also been teased as on the way.
</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company's former chief legal officer Don McGowan, who worked at the company for 12 years, said earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemons-former-chief-legal-officer-surprised-palworld-managed-to-get-this-far">he was "surprised" Palworld had "got this far"</a>.</p>

            <p>A corn dog is something I’ve never eaten, because they’re not really a thing in UK. I am morbidly curious about them, although I cannot ascertain their texture just by looking, which worries me. A Khorne dog, however, is a texturally simpler proposition. You can tell just by looking at today’s new legendary hero for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War Warhammer 3</a> that he’d be quite difficult to chew, should you get to that point. Either way, the price is definitely easy to swallow - he’s completely free as part of today’s patch 5.1.0, which also brings substantial changes to multiplayer.</p>

<p>The headline items for the patch - which precedes a promised deep dive into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greenskins-ogres-and-khorne-are-all-coming-in-the-next-dlc-for-total-war-warhammer-3">the next DLC </a>tomorrow - are mostly centered around multiplayer. First up, there’s the new competitive multiplayer Conquest Mode. They’re effectively land battles but with a single capture point in the middle of the map. “With the addition of a capture point that serves as an alternate win condition, we incentivise players to fight in the centre of the map,”  <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/23-total-war-warhammer-iii-patch-5-1-0?page=1">reads the blog</a>, with the aim of disincentivising cheese strats like corner camping.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a series of new community and developer maps are being added to Domination mode, and the mode itself can now be played against AI, alongside some other tweaks and changes. Lords, for example, can no longer be summoned and unsummoned. I have a passing interest in domination mode, which is to say I like watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@turinRTS">Turin</a> cast games, so I’ll wait to hear his opinions so I can pass them off as my own.</p>
<p>Other changes include the Daemons of Chaos now being playable in quick battles, free-for-all battles now being playable against the AI, and the usual round of nerfs, buffs, UI updates, and general rebalances. Of note here is a change to Collision attacks so they apply full weapon strength damage, making chariots more useful. Also, they nerfed the Thunderbarge, praise the lord/that’s a grudging, depending on your allegiance. Make sure to pop back tomorrow when we should have some more details about the DLC. Ogres, Orcs, and Khorne are currently slated to be getting some new toys.</p>
<p>Creative Assembly themselves have<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-total-war-dev-accuses-creative-assembly-of-mismanagement-and-says-strategy-series-ai-is-limited-by-design"> come under fire recently</a> from a former developer who took to Medium to allege a culture of mismanagement during his time there. As he takes time to say though, it’s clear the folks in the trenches are still dedicated to make their games as good as possible.</p>

            <p>The Northern Ireland Assembly All Party Group on Reducing Harm Related to Gambling has called for stronger loot boxes regulation in the country.</p>
<p>While it didn't call for a ban, it's recommended that "gambling within video games be severely limited to the greatest possible extent in the second phase of gambling legislation in [Northern Ireland]."</p>
<p>This is part of a report put together following an inquiry that ran between December 2022 and January 2024, gathering evidence on the impact of gambling on public health. The APG believes that Northern Ireland is "in an advantageous position to lead the way on the regulation of loot boxes."</p>
<p>As part of recommendations made to the NI Executive and the UK government, it called for legislation to "regulate the structural characteristics, availability and accessibility of gambling mechanics within video games, including loot boxes."</p>
<p>It also recommended that companies take a more nuanced approach to loot boxes, for example offering direct purchasing options, or the guarantee to get the content of a loot box after a certain amount has been spent.</p>
<p>Regulation shouldn't be relying solely on games companies changing their approach though, the APG warned, but should be "based on stringent, legally mandated regulations, with attention paid to the structural characteristics and overall availability of loot boxes."</p>
<p>The report also called attention to free-to-play social casino titles, supporting their restriction so they can't be easily accessed by minors.</p>
<p>Researcher Leon Y. Xiao, who regularly <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/authors/leon-y-xiao">contributes to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> on the topic of loot boxes regulation</a>, was part of the NI inquiry and held a special evidence session.</p>
<p>He commented: "Players in Northern Ireland would benefit from the industry self-regulation coming into force in the UK regardless of Stormont's [the Northern Ireland Assembly] approach, but Stormont can seek to provide a higher degree of consumer protection (than that which will be enjoyed by other UK players), if it deems doing so to be necessary and appropriate."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-miniclip-jagex-loot-box-ads-broke-uk-advertising-rules">UK's Advertising Standards Authority warned EA, Miniclip, and Jagex</a> after they failed to disclose presence of loot boxes in some of their titles, violating the country's advertising rules.</p>

            <p>
An Elden Ring dataminer has unmasked the NPCs of Shadow of the Erdtree, revealing what their faces look like beneath the armour.
</p>
<p>
The DLC includes a number of new characters, from the followers of Miquella seen in the game's trailers to other quest givers in the Land of Shadow.
</p>
<p>
Dataminer Zullie the Witch has released a new video that reveals the unique faces of these NPCs, to give a proper look at who they really are.

<p>

Take Hornsent, for instance. As his name suggests, he has small horns protruding from the wraps around his face, yet underneath he's just a regular, grubby looking bloke. As Zullie suggests, he should probably have horns on his character model but this would require a unique model outside the capabilities of the character creator.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, we see beneath the hefty armour of characters like Moore, Sir Ansbach, Redmane Freyja, and Needle Knight Leda, who are all met in the early hours of the DLC.
</p>
<p>
While seeing their faces doesn't reveal anything major about their characters, it does show their diverse characteristics. What's more, it indicates FromSoftware's creation process: using its own character creator to develop the models before slapping some armour on top.

<p>
Zullie the Witch is well known for revealing the grotesque details of enemies and characters across the Soulsborne games. 
</p>
<p>
A similar video was done for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-npcs-unmasked">NPCs in the base game of Elden Ring</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-gargoyle-enemies-are-actually-made-of-human-flesh">closer examination of the gargoyle enemies</a>.


</p>
<p>
Another Shadow of the Erdtree character has also been unmasked: the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modder-de-robes-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-lion-boss-and-yes-two-little-guys-really-are-hanging-out-under-there">Divine Beast Dancing Lion boss</a>.

            <p>The Steam Summer Sale is kicking off this week, say Valve, purveyors of fine games and thousands of crap ones too (don't worry, we help you tell the difference). The sale begins on Thursday June 27th and runs until July 11th. That's a full two weeks of sun and soulslikes, beach balls and beat 'em ups, paddling pools and puzzle games. I don't know any other objects associated with this mythological "summer" people talk about, I'm from Ireland. But I can tell you at least some of the games that'll be in the sale, according to some bargain-teasing by Valve.</p>

<p>They <a href="https://x.com/Steam/status/1805299921853333557">advertised the upcoming sale on Xitter</a>, a handy reminder. In that video they point out a few headliners, like Pokénot sweatshop simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a>, princess-befriending farm 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, and managerial peasantry botherer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a>. But don't say how much of a saving there'll be. They also mention a category of sales items they're calling "deep discounts". Which I'm guessing might simply be a list of all games on sale for more than 50% or 75% off, or something like that? Who knows.</p>
<p>Valve schedule these sales far in advance. They once used kept upcoming sale dates to themselves but not anymore. You can see the planned dates for all future sales in 2024 in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3970553774441642998">a post on their Steamworks blog for developers</a>, for instance. After this year's summery sale comes smaller sales like Tower Defense Fest and Fighting Games Fest, both in August. But the next big seasonal blow-out will be the Steam Autumn Sale, which is planned to run from November 27th to December 4th. </p>
<p>The sales are easier to resist when you already own a catalogue of unplayed platformers gathering cobwebs and moaning like forgotten skeletons at the bottom of your game library. But yes, it's worth keeping an eye out in Steam's sometimes bargainous bucket for that thing-wot-you-always-kinda-wanted-but-not-THAT-much. Here's hoping you find it for pennies.</p>

            <p>Aside from its naturally satisfying rhythm and the cool audio dings of success that usually accompany it, I find something innately hilarious about parrying. Yes, yes, it’s a deeply skilled expression of martial prowess that turns your enemy’s aggression back at them. But it’s also a pleasingly low-effort method to make your opponent look very silly - the combat equivalent of waving your outstretched hand and shaking your head in unison. I assume so from videogames, anyway. In reality, I could not parry a nerf dart with a metal bin lid.</p>

<blockquote>Damage negation and guard poise will be heightened in the moment immediately after assuming a guarding stance. Successfully executing a spontaneous guard will also strengthen guard counters.</blockquote>
<p>To see this - surprisingly massive expansion of the combat to be hidden behind an optional item - in action, here’s someone using it to parry Melania’s infamous Waterfowl Dance i.e the boss move in the game voted most likely to have been ported over from an unreleased Sekiro DLC.</p>


<p>The effects last for five minutes, which should be more than enough to embarrass Melania's first phase at least. This isn’t the only crystal tear in the DLC of course, and you might want to have a peek at Ollie’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-locations">guide to boss locations</a> if you want to track down the rest. You could just play Sekiro, of course. It's got massive chickens in it.</p>

        <p>Developer says its in response to allegations related to the streamer's Twitch ban</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Game studio Midnight Society has parted ways with co-founder and streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm.</p>
<p>In a statement issued to <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355">social media</a>, the developer said it had become aware of allegations last Friday related to Beahm's Twitch ban in 2020.</p>
<p>"We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved," the company said. "In order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act. For this reason, we are immediately terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm.</p>
<p>"While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the 55 developers and families we have employed along with our community of players."</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">The Verge</a>, a former Twitch employee who worked on the platform's trust and safety team alleged that Beahm was banned due to messaging a minor on the platform, and reportedly tried to organise a meet up with them at TwitchCon.</p>
<p>Beahm has since denied these allegations on <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">social media</a>.</p>
<p>"This has been settled, no wrongdoing was acknowledged, and [Twitch] paid out the whole contract," he wrote.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/drdisrespect-banned-from-twitch-again">Beahm was permanently banned from Twitch in 2020</a>, a year into a two-year contract with the platform.</p>
<p>A reason for the ban was not given at the time. Twitch simply said it had taken action in response to a violation of its Community Guidelines and Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Beahm sued Twitch in response to the ban, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/drdisrespect-banned-from-twitch-again">the case was settled in 2022</a> after a resolution found that "no party admits any wrongdoing."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-over-one-million-units-since-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Korean game developer Shift Up held an IPO press conference today, <a href="https://www.khgames.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=229298" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealing</a> that its latest game, Stellar Blade, has sold over a million units since its late April launch. That's not very surprising, considering that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-helldivers-2-npd-circana-april-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">topped the US sales charts&nbsp;that month</a>.</p>
<p>Once codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-eve-looks-stunning-in-first-playstation-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Eve</a> and announced for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, the game was later confirmed to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Its results are, therefore, all the more impressive for the availability on a single platform, not to mention that it's a brand-new intellectual property, which is inherently riskier than any established franchise.</p>
<p>The developers from Shift Up also shared some additional equally impressive figures. The Stellar Blade demo has been played more than twice compared to the demo of the highly anticipated Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Moreover, the studio believes significant sales are still possible, and they will continue updating the game to keep players' interest high.</p>
<p>The long-awaited Photo Mode will be added with an update slated for August. New character skins for protagonist Eve will be released after October, and a 'large collaboration' is being prepared for late 2024. Moreover, Shift Up CEO Kim Hyeong-tae confirmed that the team is working on DLCs and the PC version, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> (alongside a sequel, which is obviously further off in the future).</p>
<p><em>In the case of Stellar Blade, we created it to deliver a complete experience as a game created without considering purchasing additional content. As time goes by, we are identifying new needs and developing Stellar Blade. There is a possibility of developing paid DLC for elements such as external collaboration.</em></p>
<p>The game received a 9 out of 10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> written by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/jet-set-radio-remake-footage-leaks-on-the-web/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-craxy-taxi-jet-set-radio-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first rumors</a> from April 2022 that Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi were being brought back by SEGA, the Japanese publisher appeared during the last edition of The Game Awards to <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-revives-5-of-its-classic-ips-golden-axe-crazy-taxi-jet-set-radio-shinobi-and-streets-of-rage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirm</a> that those two franchises (in addition to Golden Axe, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage) would return as part of a big plan to revive SEGA's dormant IPs.</p>
<p>Today, some work-in-progress pictures and a brief video of a Jet Set Radio remake have leaked only. You can watch the footage in the embed below, although be quick—chances are SEGA may take it down sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>There are reportedly two Jet Set Radio games in production: a full remake of the first installment and a free-to-play live service reboot. Best manage the hype, though, as the current expected release window is 2026. Crazy Taxi is reportedly <a href="https://imgur.com/Kmb6xgr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following a similar schedule</a>, with a remake of the first game due in Q1 2026 and a free-to-play online multiplayer live service reboot slated by the end of 2027.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jet Set Radio in Dev Footage" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QTSGtZYjcQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As for the Jet Set Radio remake, we know it will be an open world game. SEGA management previously said that players will be able to make friends, increase their fans, and create a movement. The game will once again be set in Shibuya, Tokyo, and characters like Beat, DJ Professor K, Gum, and Combo are returning.</p>
<p>With the last mainline installment now being 21 years old and still another couple of years left before the launch of this remake, fans might want to check out spiritual successors like <a href="http://wccftech.com/hover-revolt-gamers-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hover</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-the-funk-is-with-ya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a> in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/logitech-g-has-a-new-gaming-keyboard-and-its-impressive/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Logitech G has <a href="http://logitechg.com/g515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced its latest</a> gaming keyboard, the Logitech&nbsp;G515 Lightspeed TKL. It’s a low-profile and lightweight keyboard that Logitech is hoping sees as a jack of all trades kind of device.</p>



<p>Retailing for $139.99 wireless and $99 wired, the Logitech G515 TKL sits at just 22mm high with low-profile keys featuring switches with a 1.3mm actuation distance. The switches come in the form of tactile or linear.</p>



<p>“With the iconic G915 gaming keyboard, Logitech G delivered a first-of-its-kind low-profile<br>keyboard renowned for its exceptional quality, top-tier performance, and premium design<br>features. With the G515 low-profile design, we have pushed the boundaries even further,” Arnaud Perret-Gentil, Head of PC Gaming at Logitech G said.</p>



<p>“With the G515, we’ve maintained the sleek design while also including our latest technology innovations, such as LIGHTSPEED, LIGHTSYNC, and KEYCONTROL, to give gamers an advanced and high-performance gaming keyboard experience.”</p>



<p>Other features of Logitech’s newest gaming keyboard include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lightspeed connection allows multiple peripherals on a single dongle</li>



<li>Tri-mode connection — Lightspeed, Bluetooth, wired</li>



<li>Layers for mapping allow for more custom key mapping up to 15 custom functions</li>



<li>Custom shortcuts, modifiers, and RGB lighting using the Logitech G Hub software</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-this-logitech-gaming-keyboard-is-a-comfortable-use">This Logitech Gaming Keyboard Is A Comfortable Use</h2>



<p>For the better part of the last week I’ve been using the Logitech G515 TKL keyboard, and to say it meets all of the marks you may be looking for in a keyboard would be an understatement. </p>



<p>Its low profile reduces the angle your wrists need to be at when typing, gaming, or anything really. It limits the stress you put them under, helping you enjoy longer playtimes. It’s not perfectly ergonomic, but that’s not something it claims to be. For what it does on that front, it does it really well.</p>



<p>The keys are responsive and feel great when I’m playing any time of game or writing this article. For what it’s worth, I was sent the G515 TKL with tactile switches. But I’m sure the linear feel just as good if that’s what you prefer. What makes them feel so nice are the pre-lubed switches and slightly concaved keys that make your fingers just fit and slide between presses seamlessly all over the board. It’s hard to describe just how smooth it feels without you using it yourself, but picture a hot knife going through butter, only better.</p>



<h6>READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/msi-raider-ge78-hx-review/">MSI Raider GE78 HX Review – As Powerful As It Is Big</a></h6>



<p>The battery life is advertised as up to 36 hours on a full charge. Like I said, I’ve used the keyboard for the last week as my main keyboard and I’ve only had to charge it once during that time. </p>



<p>The only real issue I have with the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL is the lack of dedicated media controls and volume wheel. Most keyboards, even other TKL boards I’ve used over the last few years, have had a volume wheel and media controls. It’s not the end of the world to not include them, and it’s clear the decision was made to not have them in order to keep the low profile universal, but it still feels like a weird omission. You can still control media and volume through the function key, but it’s an extra step that’s I didn’t find necessary. </p>



<p>Overall, the Logitech G515 TKL is a solid gaming keyboard across the aisle, especially for the price.  </p>

<p><em>NOTE: Logitech provided a G515 TKL for the purpose of review/impressions.</em></p>

<p id="7e50o5">Neither of these mushroom Pokémon see any use in raids, gyms, or PvP content. Their shinies are great, since they go from a spring coloring to a nice autumn red-yellow-brown.</p>
<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Morelull in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Morelull is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck maintains <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pokémon</a>. It’s a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pokémon look like.</p>

            <p>

High-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has been ousted from Midnight Society, the game development studio he co-founded in 2021, after new allegations relating to his much-publicised Twitch ban surfaced late last week.
</p>
<p>
Beahm was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-banned-by-twitch">permanently banned from Twitch</a> in the summer of 2020 - a year into a two-year exclusivity contract with the company - but neither party has ever revealed why. The closest Twitch came to an explanation was a statement shared at the time of the ban, saying it takes "appropriate action when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service... regardless of status or prominence in the community." In August 2021, Beahm announced he was suing Twitch over the ban - but the legal dispute was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drdisrespect-settles-legal-dispute-with-twitch-over-2020-permanent-ban">later settled</a>, with neither party admitting to any wrongdoing.
</p>
<p>
And that appeared to be the end of the matter, until last week. On Friday, Twitch's former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, made a <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">post on social media</a> alleging an unnamed person "got banned because [he] got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch Whispers product. He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon. The powers that be could read in plain text. Case closed, gang."

<p>
While Conners did not name Beahm directly, the connection was quickly made - and his claims were corroborated by two former Twitch employees in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">subsequent report by The Verge</a>, this time explicitly linking the allegations to Beahm.
</p>
<p>
And it's in the wake of these allegations that game developer Midnight Society - which is currently working on free-to-play first-person extraction shooter Deadrop - has now officially parted ways with Beahm, who co-founded the studio with former Call of Duty community manager Robert Bowling in 2021.

"On Friday evening we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founders Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect", the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355">statement shared on social media</a>. "We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act."
</p>
<p>
"For this reason," the statement continued, "we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately. While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the fifty-five developers and families we have employed along with our community of players."
</p>
<p>
While Beahm hasn't yet formally commented on his split with Midnight Society, the streamer did share a statement on social media after the new allegations began circulating last week. "Listen, I'm obviously tied to legal obligations from the settlement with Twitch but I just need to say what I can say since this is the fucking internet," he <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">wrote</a>. "I didn’t do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid."
</p>
<p>
During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E73nGJocgAA">a stream</a> almost immediately prior to Midnight Society's announcement, Beahm told viewers he "definitely [needed] to take a break from everything" and take a "step back", adding, "I mean I'm gonna have to relay this to the Midnight Society, but, you know, maybe I step away from there too. Just completely remove myself from the scene. It's what I need to do."

Amazon currently has a <a href="https://zdcs.link/Oy5Yn" target="_blank">TEAMGROUP GO 1TB Micro SDXC card</a> for only $63.99. For most people, this will be enough space for the entire lifespan of your Switch and at a great price. There's only one Micro SD card slot in the Switch console so you want to make sure you get the biggest card you can afford.</p><h2>1TB Micro SDXC Card (Switch Compatible) for $63.99</h2><div id="195360"><p><h3>TEAMGROUP Go 1TB U3 A1 Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><p>The Nintendo Switch is an outstanding console, but it doesn't give you much space to install many games out of the box, especially if you purchase digital games off eShop. The Switch and Switch OLED have 32GB and 64GB of internal storage, respectively, with some of it reserved for the OS. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom uses up 16GB and Breath of the Wild about 13.5GB. If bought digitally, those two games alone would take up all of your internal storage on the OG Switch console. Fortunately, the Switch features a single memory card expansion slot. It supports up to 2TB Micro SDXC cards, but since 2TB Micro SDXC cards don't exist in the mainsteam market, a 1TB or 1.5TB card is the maximum you can get.</p><p>The 1TB TEAMGROUP Micro SDXC card is compatible with virtually any device that accepts the Micro SDXC card standard. That includes the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>, Steam Deck, ASUS ROG Ally, any recently released smartphone that supports expandable memory, GoPros, cameras and much more. Despite its low price, the TEAMGROUP is faster than your average Micro SDXC card. It has a U3 A1 rating and boasts transfer speeds of up to 100MB/s read and 50MB/s write. Although TEAMGROUP isn't as well known of a brand as SanDisk or Samsung, this brand has been around for a while and is a legitimate manufacturer of flash-based storage. This particular model has plenty of good reviews on Amazon.</p><h2>Need a faster speed? Choose this one instead.</h2><div id="195361"><p><h3>TEAMGROUP Pro Plus 1TB U3 A2 Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><p>The TEAMGROUP PRO PLUS 1TB Micro SDXC card is U3 A2 rated with transfer speeds up to 160MB/s read and 110MB/s write. This extra speed can't be exploited in a Nintendo Switch, but this is a better Micro SDXC card for mobile electronics that often handle bitrate heavy files like GoPros, smartphones with 4K video recording, DSLR cameras, and PCs with an available Micro SD or SD card slot (an adapter is included).</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 24, 2024 11:25 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>If you're looking for an affordable PC controller, the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D73398R9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate 2C</a> needs to be on your radar. Arriving on July 15, the wireless controller costs just $30 yet offers one of the key perks of pricier 8BitDo models and pro-style controllers from other companies: anti-drift analog sticks. Preorders are now open for the Ultimate 2C at Amazon, with four different colorful styles up for grabs: green, mint, peach, and purple.</p><h3>8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller for PC -- $30</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D739FJLG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Green</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D736BCNM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mint</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D73398R9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Peach</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D72TNXSC?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Purple</a></li></ul><p>Built with Hall Effect sensors, the 8BitDo Ultimate 2C is far less likely to experience the dreaded stick drift that effectively breaks controllers--unless you're comfortable with opening it up and trying numerous possible solutions to fix it.</p><p>In addition to anti-drift sticks, the Ultimate 2C has another feature you'd normally find on pricier controllers: a pair of remappable buttons. Unlike other controllers in the Ultimate series that have rear buttons, the 2C's remappable buttons (R4/L4) are shoulder buttons nestled next to the triggers and regular R/L shoulder buttons. These buttons can be remapped on the fly on the controller itself.</p><p>Other notable features include a turbo function, rumble, clicky buttons and D-pad, and a tactile grip that appears to match the texture of 8BitDo's higher-end Ultimate controllers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324290-8bitdoultimate2c.png" data-ref-id="1300-4324290" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324290-8bitdoultimate2c.png" data-ref-id="1300-4324290"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324290-8bitdoultimate2c.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324291-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324292-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324293-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324294-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324295-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324296-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324297-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4324291,1300-4324292,1300-4324293,1300-4324294,1300-4324295,1300-4324296,1300-4324297" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324291-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324292-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324293-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324294-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324295-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324296-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324297-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_7.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324291-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324292-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324293-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324294-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324295-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324296-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324297-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_7.jpg"></figure><hr><p>The Ultimate 2C supports 2.4GHz wireless with Windows 10/11, Android 9.0 and above (with a USB-A adapter), Steam Deck (with a dock), and other handheld PCs with a USB-C hub or dock, including the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1820028544647762629%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2F8bitdos-new-30-wireless-pc-controller-has-anti-drift-sticks-and-remappable-buttons%2F1100-6524462%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Ally</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM74YFSP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lenovo Legion Go</a>. Though it's not confirmed, we'd expect it to work with the Analogue Pocket, just as the other Ultimate controllers do. It has an impressive 1,000Hz polling rate, so input lag shouldn't be an issue. However, you can also establish a wired connection with the detachable USB-C cable.</p><p>While the Ultimate 2C retains the same form factor as the other Ultimate controllers, its low cost means some notable features aren't present. Most importantly, you can't use 8BitDo's Ultimate software to create profiles, adjust trigger and rumble sensitivity, set up analog stick dead zones, and more.</p><p>If you'd like to have those features in your PC controller, you should opt for the standard <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX5BCWHS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate 2.4GHz model</a>, which boasts all of the customization features and comes with a matching charging dock.</p><p>Alternatively, if you have a Nintendo Switch or simply like the flexibility of Bluetooth, you should pick up the priciest model, which is arguably still a "budget" controller considering the features. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9BDMWWN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluetooth model</a> has the Nintendo Switch button labels, while the 2.4GHz mirrors <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Arctic-Camo%2F2186264517%3Fathbdg%3DL1102%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2F8bitdos-new-30-wireless-pc-controller-has-anti-drift-sticks-and-remappable-buttons%2F1100-6524462%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft's Xbox controller</a>. 8BitDo also recently released a 3-mode model for Xbox, PC, and Android, though it only works wirelessly with PC and mobile, whereas the Xbox connection is wired.</p><p>Beyond the Ultimate lineup, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Switch-Raspberry-Nintendo/dp/B0D4D2TT95?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Pro 2 Bluetooth Controller</a> gets you a great retro design and works with iOS, Switch, PC, and Android.

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2NW7K42?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo SN30 Pro</a> is another retro-styled gamepad, though it's a bit more compact than the Pro 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24185172/dr-disrespect-midnight-society-termination<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Midnight Society, the game studio co-founded by Dr Disrespect, has terminated its relationship with the streamer.  In a post on X, <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355">the studio wrote</a>, “On Friday evening, we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founder’s Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect.” </p><p>That is the day and time that former Twitch employee Cody Conners <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">posted a tweet about</a> the alleged reason for Beahm’s permanent ban, saying it was for “sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch whispers product.” Robert Bowling, a former Infinity Ward developer and fellow Midnight Society co-founder, posted shortly after, <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1804390727541305548">saying</a>, “I’m now aware and I’m dealing with it... I landed from Stockholm, reconnected, saw the tweet and immediately began an investigation to learn everything I need to know so I can ensure a full follow through.” </p><div><p>On Sunday, <em>The Verge</em> reported a second Twitch employee who worked on the platform’s trust and safety team at the time of the incident <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">had come forward to corroborate Conner’s post</a>.</p></div><p>“We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act,” reads the post from Midnight Society. “For this reason, we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately.”</p><p>The announcement came barely an hour after Beahm <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Flive%2FE73nGJocgAA%3Fsi%3DWPtWVjG5lcitonh5%26t%3D11574">ended his first stream</a> since the allegations surfaced.

<p>Following this weekend’s controversy that saw allegations levelled against Dr Disrespect, the super-sized streamer announced on stream that he’s taking an indefinite break from creating content. This announcement came around the same time that Midnight Society, Dr Disrespect’s game studio working on his extraction shooter, DEADROP, revealed that it would be cutting ties with the creator.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-don-t-know-how-long">‘I Don’t Know How Long’</h2>



<p>This weekend, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-ban/">allegations rose against Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm</a>, with an accusation being made that in 2020, he was banned from Twitch permanently for soliciting a minor via the platform’s whisper feature and attempting to meet up with them at TwitchCon. The original allegation came from a former Twitch employee, and while many labelled the claim a grab for attention, other information has come to light that doesn’t look good – such as Midnight Society cutting connections with the creator.</p>



<p>Here’s what Midnight Society said:</p>



<p><em>‘On Friday evening we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founders Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect. </em></p>



<p><em>We assumed his innocence and began speaking with the parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act. </em></p>



<p><em>For this reason, we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately. </em></p>



<p><em>While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the fifty-five developers and families we have employed along with our community of players.’</em></p>



<p>Around the same time, Dr Disrespect was live on stream, and before he wrapped up, he started talking about how he was tired ‘of all this’ and referenced hating being on social media. He then started rambling slightly, talking about an upcoming vacation and suggesting he’d extend that indefinitely:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I did have a planned vacation coming up. I think I might just extend that starting today, starting now. One of these… Let’s take a step back. I mean, it is what it is, people get fatigued, right champs? To be honest, I don’t know how long my vacation is, but you know, maybe I extend that. We’ll see. We’ll see.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He requested that his ‘Champions Club’ keep an eye on the socials for signs of his inevitable return, but we’ll have to see how the current situation plays out before that comes around. In his last stream, Doc referenced being tired of being on the camera and stressed that the industry has ‘changed so much’ since he started streaming in 2009, but this claim of being fatigued is believed to just be a front for the potentially devastating circumstances he’s found himself in. </p>



<p>Coincidentally, he suggested he’d ‘step away’ from Midnight Society too in an effort to remove himself from the scene, so he either knew this separation was coming or he was trying to save face. </p>

  <p id="9IPyZq">Fanatical has returned with another exceptional Diamond Collection, giving you the opportunity to put together your own bundle of discounted games from a selection of over a dozen titles. <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836599-13797872?sid=Polygon062424&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fdiamond-collection-build-your-own-bundle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836599-13797872?sid=___pl__p_23947417__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/diamond-collection-build-your-own-bundle&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:64,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;sid&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;sid&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23947417__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/diamond-collection-build-your-own-bundle&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">The Diamond Collection bundle</a> starts at $15, allowing you to choose from three games, but you can also opt for a bundle of five games for $27.59, or a seven-game bundle for $35.99.</p>

<p id="sYf2Qt">While any of these bundles are a great value, if we had to choose just three titles to drop in our cart, we’d pick up the Dishonored Complete Collection, <em>Prey</em>, and <em>Fallout 76</em>. The <em>Dishonored Complete Collection</em> brings together both titles in the Dishonored franchise in addition to all of their DLC and the <em>Death of the Outsider</em> expansion. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24151555/prey-arkane-studios-austin-games-microsoft-xbox"><em>Prey</em></a> is a scary, sci-fi immersive sim that pays tribute to games like <em>Deus Ex</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23739112/system-shock-remake-review-release-date"><em>System Shock</em></a><em>. </em>Finally, for fans of Bethesda’s post-nuclear roleplaying game, we can finally recommend trying out <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177745/fallout-76-skyline-valley-development-update-journey"><em>Fallout 76</em></a>. </p>
<p id="Vu5tbu">If you’d like to pick up one of the larger bundles, some other titles we can recommend include the turn-based fantasy strategy game, <em>Symphony of War</em>, which will resonate with <em>Fire Emblem</em> fans. Or, you could check out the lo-fi roguelike <em>Shotgun King: The Final Checkmate</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/zelda/24183247/zelda-echoes-wisdom-theories-trailer-analysis<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="kETPO1">For some fans of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda/24182328/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-design-change">The Legend of Zelda</a>, there’s just as much fun in theorizing and analyzing the world as there is in playing the games. So, when Nintendo released the first trailer for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180883/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-release-date"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a><em>, </em>YouTubers and other fans didn’t waste time getting to work analyzing the trailer and dissecting its every detail. </p>
<p id="ampQ4h">There’s a lot to dive into this time around. Princess Zelda will be the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181064/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch-princess-peach">playable hero of the story</a> for the first time and wields an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181059/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-why-no-sword-gameplay-nintendo-link">entirely new weapon</a>, the Tri Rod — and the fact that <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> could have connections to previous versions of Hyrule and the series at large has already introduced ample opportunities for people to theorize. There are loads of posts on Reddit with observations, and YouTube is filled with videos analyzing the trailer. It can all be a lot, so Polygon rounded up some of the best theories we’ve seen about <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</p>
<h2 id="AJWIAT"><strong>It takes place in the same world as The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past </strong></h2>

<p id="yHEBvC">A Reddit post that sparked a conversation on a Zelda subreddit made a convincing argument that the world in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> could be connected to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda/23915877/link-to-the-past-legend-of-zelda-loz-tears-kingdom-totk"><em>A Link to the Past</em></a>. The post includes a screenshot from the trailer, which shows a panoramic vista of Hyrule in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. In it, you can see environments like a forest in the northwestern corner of the map, mountains in the north, and Hyrule Castle in the center. The user argues these locations and the arrangement look similar to those in <em>A Link to the Past</em>, so it could mean it takes place in the same or a similar version of Hyrule. </p>
<h2 id="m2j141"><strong>The Sheikah will be back in the game </strong></h2>
<div id="9hzAmM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bBffi3zP9g?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="PVheg3">Zeltik, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bBffi3zP9g">a popular theory crafter within the Zelda community</a>, highlighted a moment where the Sheikah appear to return in <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>in two separate instances. The first shows a clip where a character resembling Impa, Zelda’s Sheikah nursemaid in other games, like <em>Ocarina of Time </em>and <em>Oracle of Seasons</em>, attacks soldiers in Hyrule Castle. The appearance of Impa wouldn’t be all that remarkable given she’s in so many games, but then there’s another fun treat: The trailer shows a house that appears to be a workshop or place for research. The room contains glowing orange signs that could be Sheikah symbols, and the character <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23717547/breath-of-the-wild-impa-purah-robbie-paya-master-kohga">looks a lot like Robbie</a> from <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. </p>

<p id="ot8Wdb">This is a small detail, but a fun one: There have always been different designs for the Zora in various Zelda games. The Zora in the original <em>A Link to the Past</em> had a colorful, almost dragonlike look, whereas the Zora we see in more recent games like <em>Ocarina of Time</em> have a sleeker and silvery fishlike look. In another section from Zeltik’s trailer analysis, he shows a clip from the trailer where we can see Zelda standing between both kinds of Zora. He hypothesized that there could be a conflict between the two and that the princess might play a role in mediating tensions between the two groups. </p>
<p id="CJpZgQ">Those are some of the fun theories we’ve found so far, but we will update the article as we get more information about the game. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> will be released on Nintendo Switch on Sept. 26. </p>

It's not the most creative name for a sale, but at least it'll be easy to remember. This year's Walmart Deals event will take place from Monday, July 8, through Thursday, July 11. Though Amazon hasn't revealed this year's dates for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a>, we know it'll take place in July. Walmart is the first major retailer to announce a Prime Day 2024 competing sale, but it certainly won't be the last.</p><p dir="ltr">While the sale will be accessible to all customers, Walmart+ members can access the discounts starting at 9 am PT/Noon ET. All non-members will gain access to the deals five hours later at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET. Normally, Walmart+ costs $13/month or $98/year, but new members can <strong><a href="https://plus.walmart.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for a 30-day free trial of Walmart+</a></strong> and get early access to the Walmart Deals event without having to pay for a subscription. Members get free online shipping, free local delivery on orders of $35 or more, the ability to have your returned items picked up from your home, a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fparamountplus.qflm.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F175360%2F3065%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.paramountplus.com%252F%26subid1%3Dsubid_value%26sharedid%3Dgamespot&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Paramount+</a> streaming subscription, and other exclusive discounts.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Walmart Deals Preview (July 8-11)</h2><p>Walmart is calling its upcoming sale "its largest deals event ever." This likely alludes to the sheer number of planned deals, which is in the thousands, but the bold phrasing also suggests the retailer is making a big push to seriously compete with Amazon Prime Day, which has become the best-known sales event in the US outside of Black Friday.</p><p dir="ltr">The full list of limited-time discounts won't be unveiled until Walmart Deals officially starts, but the retailer has already announced a few deals that will be available from July 8 through July 11. The list includes everything from apparel and home appliances to video games, electronics, toys, and more. We picked out a few preview deals from Walmart's list that we think are worth keeping in mind. Note that the prices listed don't go into effect until the sale starts on July 8.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Mario-Party-Red-Blue-Joy-Con-Bundle%2F5216937998%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Party + Joy-Con Bundle</a> -- $69 (<del>$100</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-Star-Wars-Hoth-AT-ST-75322-Building-Kit-Construction-Toy-Kids-Aged-9-Up-Buildable-Battle-Walker-4-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back-Characters-586-Pi%2F677686565%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Star Wars: Battle of Hoth AT-ST Kit</a> -- $35 ($<del>50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHP-Victus-15-6-inch-FHD-144Hz-Gaming-Laptop-AMD-Ryzen-5-8645HS-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-4050-8GB-DDR4-512GB-SSD-Mica-Silver-2024%2F5395277312%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HP Victus 15.6 inch Gaming Laptop</a> -- $599 ($<del>979</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTCL-65-Class-Q-Class-4K-QLED-HDR-Smart-TV-with-Google-TV-65Q650G%2F3733507013%3FadsRedirect%3Dtrue%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TCL 65-inch 4K QLED HDR Smart TV</a> -- $398 ($<del>498</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSamsung-Galaxy-Watch4-Classic-46mm-Smart-Watch-w-Bluetooth-Stainless-Steel-Black%2F503218134%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Galaxy Watch6 Classic 46mm (Bluetooth model)</a> -- $99 ($<del>179</del>)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can check out more of the upcoming deals at the retailer's dedicated <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals%3FathAsset%3DeyJhdGhjcGlkIjoiNTRhNTExMWYtMGEzZi00ODUzLTk3MDMtMDA1NjRhYzg5YWJjIn0%3D%26athena%3Dtrue%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwalmart-deals-event-amazon-prime-day-2024%2F1100-6524475%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart Deals store page</a>.

And as an added treat, Valve’s entry-level <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Steam Decks</a> are already on sale for an all-time low in the run-up to the event.</p><p>Valve is discounting the base Steam Decks sold through Steam’s online storefront <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dwhile%2520supplies%2520last.-%2C15%2525%2520OFF%2C-UNTIL%2520JULY%252011TH">by 15 percent</a> through 10AM PT / 1PM ET on July 11th, dropping the price of the LCD-equipped handheld to $296.95 (about $52 off) in the 64GB configuration and $381.65 (about $67 off) in its 512GB variant. In addition to the storage upgrade, the 512GB model features an antiglare etched glass cover on its seven-inch display.</p><div><p>The Steam Deck is a portable handheld console you can use to play PC games.</p></div><p>While the fancier Steam Deck OLED, with its slightly larger 90Hz display and bigger battery, is sadly not discounted, the standard Decks with LCD screens remain very capable machines. The original Deck offers the same performance and resolution (1280 x 800) as the OLED model, albeit at a maximum refresh rate of 60Hz, and it easily plays most compatible games on Steam save for the most graphically demanding titles.</p><p>The OG Deck can even play some big open-world games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> and its new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> expansion. However, FromSoftware’s excellently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty">punishing</a> RPG is currently in need of a hotfix to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24182545/elden-ring-has-an-issue-on-steam-deck-right-now">resolve an ongoing issue</a> when the game is left inactive on the Steam Deck for five minutes. Also, if you’re opting for the 64GB model, be sure to have a microSD card to expand it. That base storage may be fine when downloading tiny indies, but it fills up fast with bigger games. (Don’t even dream of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/3/23944733/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-storage"><em>Call of Duty</em></a>.) Thankfully, you don’t really take any notable performance hits by playing games off <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-microSDXC-Smartphones-LMS1066512G-BNANU/dp/B08T8LHL38?tag=theverge02-20">a quality microSD</a>.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While maintenance is underway, the version 7.0 patch will be made available to download at around 4 a.m. PDT on consoles, and on June 27 around 8 a.m. PDT for PC and Mac players. As always, maintenance may be longer or shorter than Square Enix’s estimate but you should expect the 7.0 patch to go live around Friday, June 28 at 2 a.m. PDT.

Make sure to travel to your home world if you’re visiting another world or data center, as those travel systems may experience issues when <em>Dawntrail </em>launches. </p><p>Other things to check off ahead of maintenance include logging into your house (if you own one) to refresh the housing timer before the congestion of a new expansion.

Finally, log out in a sanctuary to get the rested EXP buff to help you level quickly once starting <em>Dawntrail</em>’s story quests. All you have to do now is find something to do while the game is down. Read a good book, try out knitting, or play another game on your backlog. Once <em>Dawntrail </em>releases, you won’t have free time for a while.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bison. This was famously Julia’s final film role before he died in October of that year, shortly before the film’s release. While it is sometimes referred to today as a cult classic, it should be noted that the adaption of Capcom’s popular fighting game franchise was a box office hit in 1994, making nearly $100 million on a reported budget of $35 million.
