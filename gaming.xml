			<p>BioWare continues to share media and information about the upcoming action RPG Dragon Age The Veilguard. Yesterday, the renowned developer <a href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1829565257670709297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a few gorgeous new screenshots showcasing the companions' rooms.</p>

<p>BioWare also held a Discord Q&amp;A (available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lGYb3hljfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> on YouTube thanks to a fan), revealing new details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Characters created in the creator can be saved to avoid starting from scratch every time</li>
<li>Transmogrification (the ability to select a different armor to display than the one actually equipped) also applies to the regular clothes used in the Lighthouse, allowing players to wear armor when they're roaming in the hub</li>
<li>There will be a setting to toggle on or off nudity and sex scenes</li>
<li>Players interested in the most immersive experience possible can turn off the minimap, damage numbers, health bars, indicators, and more</li>
<li>The companions range in age from the 20s to the 50s, the youngest being the Qunari Taash, while the oldest is the Necromancer Emmrich</li>
<li>Only companions are romanceable in Dragon Age The Veilguard</li>
<li>Gifts for companions are returning and will be on display in their rooms</li>
<li>Some of the larger areas offering exploration opportunities include The Crossroads, Arlathan Forest, and The Hossberg Wetlands</li>
<li>Every companion has their own story arc and challenges to go through</li>
<li>Companions may occasionally appear in the world even if they're not in your party</li>
<li>Certain quests may expire depending on the progression of the main story and player choices, but the player will be warned in advance</li>
<li>There is no mechanic behind companions getting together, as BioWare wanted to avoid making it feel mechanical. Instead, companions develop relationships based on player choices, such as committing to another relationship or not engaging in a romance with them. Companions may also develop friendships and even rivalries with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>The wait for Dragon Age The Veilguard is not long enough. The game will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-to-launch-on-october-31/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> in exactly two months, and a lot more information is sure to drop next month. Stay tuned.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/31/24232540/summer-2024-best-indie-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-been-a-great-summer-for-indie-games-%E2%80%94-here-are-some-of-the-best.969078/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/31/24232540/summer-2024-best-indie-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Outside of some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">notable</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24230628/star-wars-outlaws-review-ps5-xbox-pc">exceptions</a>, there haven’t been many blockbuster games this summer — but that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been much to play. In fact, at times, it has felt like a never-ending flood of fascinating indie releases, thanks to games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24206836/arranger-puzzle-game-review-netflix-summer-game-fest"><em>Arranger</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey"><em>Animal Well</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox"><em>Crow Country</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24157530/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-switch-steam"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a>.</p><p>It’s been nearly impossible to keep up, but we’ve been playing through most of these games and settled on a handful of recommendations that offer a range of experiences. There’s everything from shadow-hopping puzzles to comedic platformers to a game that might help fill the <em>Silksong</em>-shaped hole in your heart.</p><p>Here are some of our favorites.</p><p><h4><em>The Crush House</em></h4></p><p><h5>PC</h5></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121113/introducing-the-worlds-first-thirst-person-shooter"><em>The Crush House</em></a> is one of the rare games that capitalize on the tomfoolery potential of running a reality TV show. Part of the game is a kind of resource management sim. Ads make my bosses happy but make my audience tune out. The other part is like a first-person shooter requiring me to sprint around the house with a camera trying to capture the juiciest moments. But I’ve always hated the manufactured drama of reality TV, so I’m having the most fun making the most boring show possible. I haven’t been fired yet, but I feel it’s coming. —AP</p><p><h4><em>Flock</em></h4></p><p><h5>PlayStation, PC, Xbox</h5></p><p>It’s the creature-collecting of <em>Pokémon</em> but without all of the battles. Also, you can fly. <em>Flock</em> is all about, well, gathering a flock of cute little creatures. You do that by soaring around an idyllic landscape on the back of a giant bird and searching out every animal you can (all of which can similarly fly). Each time you find something new, you’ll have to help figure out exactly what it is, and while the game gives you some light goals, you’re mostly free to explore on your own. Even better: while it’s very serene to fly solo, you can also go exploring with friends. —AW</p><p><h4><em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em></h4></p><p><h5>PC</h5></p><p><em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> mixes a twin-stick bullet hell shooter with top-down <em>Legend of Zelda</em>-style adventuring. Seriously: as a cute spaceship, you’ll explore dungeons and collect small keys and pieces of heart. It sounds strange, but it’s a genre mashup that totally works. —JP</p><p><h4><em>Nine Sols</em></h4></p><p><h5>PC</h5></p><p><em>Nine Sols</em> will feel familiar to <em>Hollow Knight</em> fans: it’s a beautifully styled Metroidvania with tough combat. <em>Nine Sols’</em> action rewards patience and parrying, which is a fun challenge; it’s incredibly satisfying to expertly parry an attack and follow up with a finishing move. The game’s copious amount of text, while interesting, can get in the way of the excellent action, but if you’ve still got your clown makeup on for <em>Silksong</em>, <em>Nine Sols</em> will probably scratch the itch. —JP</p><p><h4><em>Schim</em></h4></p><p><h5>PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch</h5></p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1519710%2FSCHiM%2F"><em>Schim</em></a> is essentially “The Floor is Lava” translated into a video game. But instead of your mother’s loveseat, you hop between the shadows of people and objects to navigate the world. It’s a clever game that makes use of simple things like perspective to create complicated platforming puzzles that are satisfying to solve. Once while stuck, I had a great “aha!” moment when I realized I could create the shadows I needed by possessing a traffic light and changing the signal to free up a gaggle of patient bikers. <em>Schim</em> has the kind of strategic thinking I live for. —AP</p><p><h4><em>SteamWorld Heist 2</em></h4></p><p><h5>PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch</h5></p><p>It’s been a decade since the original <em>SteamWorld Heist</em> expanded the robotic franchise with some delicious turn-based pirate action. In the original, you’d recruit a team of robots and go on missions gathering loot and battling all kinds of enemies. Whereas the first game took place in space, the sequel goes nautical, with a huge sea to explore and lots of machines to battle and shipwrecks to plunder. The action is similar — which means you’ll be carefully plotting every move and attack as you strategically explore levels — but feels more polished this time around, buoyed by beautiful 2D visuals and a surprisingly deep storyline.—AW</p><p><h4><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here!</em></h4></p><p><h5>PC, PlayStation, and Switch</h5></p><p>This might be the strangest game I have ever played. You play as a little fella with a big head who only has two actions: jump and slap. It’s a little like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20868532/untitled-goose-game-review-nintendo-switch-pc-house-panic"><em>Untitled Goose Game</em></a>, but also <em>much</em> weirder. You’re tasked with helping folks in a quaint English village (who all exclaim “Thank goodness you’re here!” when you arrive), but things almost always devolve into some odd mess. You’ll be collecting bird soldiers, exploring a tiny grocery store for rats, and navigating everything from underground pipes to a premium cut of ham. Along the way, you’ll slap a lot of bums and be charmed by the dulcet tones of Matt Berry. —AW</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Thank you for your long-term support of the games and characters I have been responsible for. I hope you will continue to support Capcom's games and characters.</p>
<p>"From September, I will start developing a new game in a new environment. I hope to create fun, beautiful games that are as memorable as, or even more memorable than, the ones I have created so far.</p>
<p>"Please stay tuned for my next creation!"</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 secured a lofty five out of five stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Dogma 2</a> review.</p>
<p>"I do think a lot of what Dragon's Dogma 2 does scratches an itch for me, and that some of the things I love about it are specific to me," wrote contributor Lewis Parker.</p>
<p>"But the longer I've played it the less I've worried about my own bias towards it. Even if I hadn't have played the first Dragon's Dogma, I can tell you with complete certainty that I'd have come to same conclusion I have now, and I'd have given Dragon's Dogma 2 the same score I have now, simply because no other game in recent memory has inspired the same feeling of captivation and wonder in me.</p>
<p>"The joy of discovery lies within all of us, and Dragon's Dogma 2 succeeds in evoking that magical feeling in a way no other game has before it."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I leave you now with Netflix’s groan-inducing, hard-to-read description of this live event:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> It’s a dog-eat-dog world out there — and on Sept. 2, it will be a man- eat–(hot) dog world, too. Streaming live on Netflix, 16-time hot dog– eating champion Joey Chestnut will face off against rival and six-time hot dog–eating champion Takeru Kobayashi in<em> Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef </em>in the ultimate wiener-takes-all competition. Will Chestnut maintain his title as the world’s greatest, or will Kobayashi come in with a vengeance and regain his throne?</p></blockquote><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81743617&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81743617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef</em></a></span><em> </em>will be streamed live on Netflix on September 2.

            <p>Concord is estimated to have sold just 25,000 copies.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">IGN</a>, analyst Simon Carless <a href="https://gamediscover.co/">estimates</a> that Concord’s sales equate to around 10,000 units on Steam and around 15,000 on PlayStation.</p>
<p>Whilst we can't track the real-time player numbers on PlayStation, right now there are just 71 players online on Steam. Its highest concurrent player count in the last 24 hours is 151.</p>

</span></p><p>Most analysts approached by IGN for comment suggest Concord's beleaguered launch follows "poor marketing, a high price point, and most critically, a lack of differentiation in an oversaturated genre".</p>
<p>"A tight-knit group of players might be willing to take a chance on a new game for free, but paying $40 is a big ask in today's macroeconomic climate," said Midia Research analyst, Rhys Elliott.</p>
<p>"Launching Concord as a premium game limited its audience numbers and user acquisition. The more people who play a game, the more appealing it is. Network effects are crucial for building a healthy, engaged ecosystem.</p>
<p>"Concord should have launched free-to-play - or at least as part of the PlayStation Plus subscription - to have a fighting chance in its overcrowded genre. It is not too late for this to happen, of course, but the damage might have already been done. First impressions matter."</p>
<p>We gave the hero shooter three out of five stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-review">Eurogamer's Concord review</a>, saying: "The question now, given Concord's allegedly poor uptake among players, is whether we'll get to see that. I for one hope we do. Concord may be a flawed game, but it is far from a hopeless one. </p>
<p>"And while the game currently misses the brief on the 'hero' part of its genre, it is worth remembering that heroes are ultimately defined by their actions, rather than their costumes."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>As this weekend ticks us on over into September, we’re coming out of silly hype season and jumping straight into silly game release season. Arguably it’s already started, with this week’s launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> headlining a busy week of game releases, but September is going to be getting off to a fast start with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/astro-bots-next-big-adventure-is-coming-out-in-september/">Astro Bot</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">Test Drive Unlimited</a>, Age of Mythology, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/01/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-preview-not-lost-its-edge-yet/">Ace Attorney</a> and so much more in the first fortnight.</p>
<p>So much choice is a good problem to have for gamers, but worrying at the same time as some games and developers are going to lose out in the crush.</p>

<p>Of course, even with a bumped crop of reviews, a big part of this week was about Gamescom previews and hands on. I went hands on with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/hands-on-civilization-vii-preview-one-for-the-ages/"><strong>Civilization VII</strong></a> and explored its new Ages system, before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/interview-ed-beach-on-civilization-vii-ages-diplomacy-security-blankets/"><strong>speaking to Firaxis’ Ed Beach</strong></a> about the changes. I also had a glimpse of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/27/starfield-shattered-space-preview-getting-back-to-what-bethesda-does-best/"><strong>Starfield: Shattered Space</strong></a>, plunged into the gorgeous JRPG homage of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></a>, and went hands on with the “Sonic had a baby with Super Meat Boy” racing of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/deathsprint-66-is-a-buzzsaw-of-dystopian-future-racing/"><strong>DeathSprint 66</strong></a>.</p>
<p>On Dom’s side of things, he explored <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/dying-light-the-beast-preview-the-long-awaited-return-of-kyle-crane/"><strong>Dying Light: The Beast</strong></a> and the return of Kyle Crane, gave us one final preview for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/27/one-final-space-marine-2-preview-those-tyranids-want-to-f-you-up/"><strong>Space Marine 2</strong></a>, sampled the new stages in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/27/sonic-x-shadows-generations-preview-what-no-guns/"><strong>Sonic X Shadow Generations</strong></a> and the gorgeous <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/metaphor-refantazio-preview-the-years-most-beautiful-rpg/"><strong>Metaphor: ReFantazio</strong></a>,&nbsp;and checked out the 90s inspired time-travelling jaunt of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/why-warframe-1999-might-be-the-games-most-important-update-in-13-years/"><strong>Warframe 1999</strong></a>.</p>

<p>And then it was the battle of the hero shooters. Nick P previewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/marvel-rivals-preview-a-new-better-overwatch/"><strong>Marvel Rivals</strong></a> for us and, before handing in our review, Jim also pondered why there seems to be almost <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/24/why-do-gamers-want-concord-to-fail/">a desire to see Concord fail amongst gamers</a></strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Devil May Cry, and Dragon's Dogma series director Hideaki Itsuno is leaving CAPCOM, the game designer himself confirmed today.</p>
<p>In a new message shared on <a href="https://x.com/tomqe/status/1829814090942070886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1829814090942070886%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=">X</a> earlier today, Itsuno-san confirmed that at the end of August 2024, he is leaving CAPCOM after 30 years and 5 months with the company. This, however, isn't the end of his involvement in the gaming industry, as from next month, he will start developing a new game in a new environment, hoping to create fun and beautiful games that are as memorable as the ones he created so far, if not even more.</p>
<p>While it is nice to hear that Hideaki Itsuno will continue making games, it is impossible not to wonder what is going to happen to the two franchises he directed while at CAPCOM. Devil May Cry, for example, thrived under his guidance, culminating with the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition/">fifth entry in the series</a> a few years back that is, in my opinion, one of the best entries in the series, if not the very best. Dragon's Dogma, on the other hand, hasn't thrived as much, although the second entry in the series, which was released only a few months back, did manage to sell decently well, although the game feels, in many ways, more than a reboot of the original rather than an actual sequel, as Alessio rightly highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">review.</a></p>
<p>No matter what the Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma director will do in the future, we wish him well in his endeavors. Hopefully, it won't take long to learn more about his next project.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-more-dialogue-than-baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-half-of-all-wheel-of-time-books-combined.969018/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-more-dialogue-than-baldurs-gate-3-half-of-all-wheel-of-time-books-combined/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is going to be a massive game, much larger than the original. Czech developer Warhorse Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-out-this-year-and-its-looking-great-not-to-mention-twice-as-large/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> as much ever since it admitted the game not only existed but would launch soon, stating it is roughly twice as big as the first installment.</p>
<p>Now, Game Director Daniel Vávra has <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1829121370845773942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> actual figures on how long it is, at least when it comes to the written script. According to the developer, the final script of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is 2.2 million words long, which is more than the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/764696-longest-script-for-a-videogame#:~:text=The%20longest%20videogame%20script%20is,the%20Game%20of%20Thrones%20series" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current Guinness World Record holder for the category</a>, Larian's Baldur's Gate 3, also an absolutely <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-17000-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive</a> RPG in its own right.</p>
<p>To put it in perspective, that's half as many words as there are in all of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series of fantasy books, which consists of fifteen notoriously lengthy tomes that combined amount to 4.4 million words.</p>
<p>This doesn't necessarily mean Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be as long in terms of playthrough as Baldur's Gate 3. After playing the upcoming first-person action RPG by Warhorse at Gamescom, it is clear that the developers have massively increased the amount of ambient dialogue in the game, as well as brief exchanges that happen during the Red Dead Redemption 2-like interactions outside of regular dialogues. Still, it should be a solid guarantee that you won't hear the same sentence ten times by the third hour or so, as we're used to in most games.</p>
<p>The sequel has been recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to February 13, 2025, when the game launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. By the way, Chris also tried the game at a recent preview event, so you can check his early impressions <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Stay tuned for our in-depth Gamescom interview with Warhorse.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/deadlock-player-count-changes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deadlock-soars-past-120-000-peak-players-as-valve-introduces-%E2%80%98wall-jumping%E2%80%99.969003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/deadlock-player-count-changes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was a few days ago that Valve acknowledged the existence of Deadlock, an all-new third-person hero shooter that’s turning heads worldwide. Before the announcement, Deadlock had pulled in tens of thousands of players on Steam during a closed testing period, and despite the rules not having changed, that number has continued to swell.</p>



<p>People can gain access to the Deadlock test by being invited by someone already in it. Last night, the peak player count skyrocketed to 127,000 players, which is huge considering it’s still being kept behind closed doors for the most part.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-moves">Making Moves</h2>



<p>Valve has already deployed a major update to Deadlock, introducing a wall-jumping mechanic and more than 100 balancing changes. Players diving into the game yesterday would have noticed a patch being installed, and it seems that Valve is already leaning on community feedback to shape the future of Deadlock.</p>



<p>Everyone from top-tier streamers to competitive gamers is enjoying Deadlock and feeding back a positive sentiment about the shooter. Given that it comes from Valve, the creator of Counter-Strike, it seems that there’s a strong esports future in store for the game.</p>



<p>In the most recent patch, Valve addressed issues with pause abuse, menu interactions, reporting functions, and matchmaking mechanics. As the issues and suggestions surface, the team seems to be implementing them at a breakneck pace, which is refreshing for players worldwide.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed how many people at Valve are working on Deadlock, but the recent patch had so many changes wrapped up in it that it’d make your head spin to see the full list. If the team is starting as it means to go on, we could have a seriously disruptive shooter on our hands.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/james-gunn-the-batman-game-not-happening/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/james-gunn-says-%E2%80%98the-batman%E2%80%99-game-isn%E2%80%99t-happening.968997/</guid>

<p>Recently, a rumour surfaced claiming that a game set in ‘The Batman’ universe and focusing on Penguin was in development at WBD. It was said that the Matt Reeves-directed movie starring Robert Pattinson as the titular character would evolve into a game, but the rumours weren’t properly corroborated.</p>



<p>Now, James Gunn has emerged on social media to stress that there ‘is no truth whatsoever’ behind these rumours.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unreal-claims">Unreal Claims</h2>



<p>There are plans to expand on the success of The Batman but in the form of a television series at HBO. In the recent claims that surfaced regarding the potential Penguin game, it was said that ‘nothing is concrete’, but James Gunn quickly came out on social media and confirmed that it absolutely isn’t happening.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jamesgunn/replies?xmt=AQGzbNHC-YWsmn8C7mpOqIayJI-xwOG7tPs9vt9c0_w2kg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Threads</a>, the superstar director, writer, and co-chief of DC Studios wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Sadly there is no truth to this whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The line indicates that he’d <strong>like </strong>for it to be real, but it simply isn’t. With James Gunn being perfectly placed to know what’s going on regarding the franchise, it’s definitive enough for this rumour to be completely discredited.</p>



<p>If you’re heartbroken about this revelation, you can make sure you pick up Batman: Arkham Shadow, coming to Meta Quest 3 later this year. It’ll patch the gap a little until the next Batman game is inevitably released, but <strong>this one </strong>won’t ever materialise.</p>

Today, MSI is offering its PS5-compatible <a href="https://msi.pxf.io/jrPym0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MSI Spatium M482</a> 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 Solid State Drive (SSD) for only $99.99 wtih free shipping. This is the best price currently for a 2TB SSD that fulfills all of the mandatory and recommended requirements for the PS5 console. You'll need to supply a heatsink, but you can easily get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/OGrjj?object_uuid=26cba1be-b601-4434-805b-c228114bdc33&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5 heatsink for under $10</a>. </p><h2>MSI Spatium 2TB M.2 SSD (PS5-Compatible) for $99.99</h2><div id="206826" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>MSI Spatium M482 2TB M.2 SSD</h3></p></div><p>The PS5 is an outstanding gaming console, but the 1TB SSD is a real bottleneck. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, for example, can <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-explains-huge-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-file-sizes">exceed 200GB alone</a>. NBA 2K23 weighs in at 150GB and even older games like God of War: Ragnarok and Horizon Forbidden West require 90GB of space. Future games like Grand Theft Auto VI will undoubtedly demand even more space. The advantage of a PS5 console over the Xbox Series X is that the SSD slot is not proprietary; you can install most third-party PCIe Gen4 x4 SSDs as long as they are fast enough. Slower drives will still work, but they may bottleneck the original SSD so they aren't recommended if you want a seamless experience.</p><p>The MSI Spatium M482 meets all the requirements for your PS5 upgrade. This is a PCIe Gen4 x4 SSD with an M.2 2280 form factor and transfer speeds of up to 7,300MB/s read and 6,400MB/s write which is well above the 5,500MB/s minimum threshold. It also makes an excellent boot drive for your gaming PC, especially with its 2TB storage capacity. For 2024, we've rarely come across a PS5-compatible 2TB SSD priced under $100, so you should jump on this deal. We may see deals of this caliber during Black Friday, but that's still a few months away, and there's no guarantee that SSD prices won't rise again.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><em>Willing to pay more for another brand?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>For the last week, there’s been a lot of online discussion on Sony’s newly-launched multiplayer shooter, Concord. But it’s not because everyone’s playing it – it’s because seemingly no one is.</p><p>Plenty of games don’t sell well at launch, but observers have latched onto Concord’s dramatic failure due to its high-profile nature as a Sony first-party game, and its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-shooter-concord-debuts-to-a-tragic-697-concurrent-players-on-steam"><u>shockingly low Steam concurrent player numbers</u></a> at launch. Upon its August 23 debut, Concord only had 697 Steam concurrent players, and it hasn’t risen any higher since. At the time I’m writing this, 130 entire people are playing Sony’s brand new, first-party game on Steam. That’s real, real low, even for a game with <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/concord/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>middling critical reviews</u></a> (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-review"><u>we gave it a 7/10</u></a>, which at IGN means it’s “good”).</p><p>So, what happened? Why did a big Sony first-party game get sent out to die immediately? Is it <em>actually</em> selling badly, or are we just reading the numbers wrong? As usual when questions of this nature crop up, I asked a bunch of professional industry analysts to explain it to me.</p><h2>Is Concord actually selling that badly?</h2><p>Unfortunately for Sony…yeah.</p><p>While historically low numbers like the ones being experienced by Concord have a tendency to be used to drive narratives that don’t always paint a full picture, that’s not what’s happening here. Liam Deane, principal analyst at Omdia, said, “The Steam numbers are so bad that even without the exact data on the PS5 side we can be pretty certain that the game is doing very badly.”</p><p>Other analysts were able to share a bit of insight on the PlayStation side with me. Per Circana analyst Mat Piscatella citing Circana’s Player Engagement Tracker, on Monday August 26, “Concord ranked 147th in US PS5 daily active players across all titles, with fewer than 0.2% of Monday's active PS5 players playing the game.” And analyst Simon Carless, who authors the <a href="https://gamediscover.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GameDiscover.co newsletter</u></a>, estimated that Concord’s total sales are sitting around 10,000 units on Steam, and around 15,000 on PlayStation (he responded to my email Wednesday, August 28, 2024).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sadly, making a fun, high-quality shooter is not enough in the oversaturated live-service space these days.</p></div><p>Many of the analysts I spoke to lamented the reality. As they pointed out, Concord <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonys-live-service-hero-shooter-concord-has-been-in-development-for-around-8-years"><u>has been in development for years now</u></a>, a substantial financial and time investment for Sony. And incredibly talented people worked on it: it’s well-produced, and as Midia Research analyst Rhys Elliott specifically notes, it’s fun to play. But, Elliott continued, “sadly, making a fun, high-quality shooter is not enough in the oversaturated live-service space these days.”</p><h2>Why Isn’t Concord Selling?</h2><p>Usually, when I reach out to analysts for comment on a piece like this, they largely have similar assessments of the big picture but can offer differing perspectives on certain details. In the case of Concord, everyone I spoke to agreed on the reasons it had failed. Concord suffered from poor marketing, a high price point, and most critically, a lack of differentiation in an oversaturated genre.</p><p>Start with the marketing. According to Piscatella, Sony dropped the ball on this front, badly damaging its ability to build momentum ahead of release. He said it suffered from “low awareness and purchase intent among video game players” and indicated that Circana’s PlayerPulse was showing that as of July, only a very small percentage of players were even aware Concord existed to begin with. Retail promotion was limited, “with just a handful of web placements across GameStop, Best Buy, Target, Walmart and the PlayStation Store.” Joost van Dreunen, NYU Stern professor and <a href="https://superjoost.net/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>author of the SuperJoost newsletter</u></a>, agreed, saying that “while there has been trailers and some gameplay reveals for Concord, pre-launch promotion for the game appears to have been relatively limited.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>At $40, Concord also suffered from what was considered to be an overly high price point given that its main competitors are free-to-play. As Carless pointed out, high-skill multiplayer shooters can struggle to gain traction, because players will only “shift” their preferred game if all their friends also agree to do so. Even then, players may be reluctant due to sunk cost fallacy around the various cosmetics and other perks they’ve picked up on their preferred game over time. This is also a problem, he says, for content creators, who won’t know in advance if their audiences will be interested in a new game they’re considering switching to.</p><p>For free-to-play games, players can at least jump in, try something out, and see if it sticks without a high commitment cost. But with Concord, the $40 price makes players unlikely to give it a shot in the first place, and van Dreunen adds that this is even less likely near the end of a console cycle when players are more reluctant than usual to take a chance on new games.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Overall the hero shooter market is already well served.</p></div><p>“A tight-knit group of players might be willing to take a chance on a new game for free, but paying $40 is a big ask in today’s macroeconomic climate,” Elliott observed. “Launching Concord as a premium game limited its audience numbers and user acquisition. The more people who play a game, the more appealing it is. Network effects are crucial for building a healthy, engaged ecosystem. </p><p>“Concord should have launched free-to-play – or at least as part of the PlayStation Plus subscription – to have a fighting chance in its overcrowded genre. It is not too late for this to happen, of course, but the damage might have already been done. First impressions matter.”</p><p>Every analyst I spoke to also hammered home what may be Concord’s biggest problem: lack of differentiation. Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis noted that when Concord started development, Sony was banking on the then-hot trend of multiplayer shooters such as Overwatch. But in the years since, other studios made the same bet, many to great success.</p><p>“Since then, we’ve had a few more big budget hero shooters come to market – Apex Legends, Valorant and Overwatch 2 – each with their unique gameplay attributes,” said Harding-Rolls. “All three of these games are played by millions of gamers every month and dominate this category. Concord’s gunplay compares most closely to Overwatch 2 and overall the hero shooter market is already well served with a collection of very strong free-to-play titles.”</p><p>It also doesn’t help that Concord released on August 23, 2024, just three days after Black Myth: Wukong. Though the two games are significantly different, it’s hard to deny that the launch of the former overshadowed the latter in terms of marketing, hype, and sales. For what it’s worth, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-gets-new-cinematic-and-gameplay-trailer-and-a-release-date-state-of-play-2024"><u>Concord’s release date</u></a> was announced five months after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-has-a-release-date-but-still-no-reply-to-reports-of-sexism-the-game-awards-2023"><u>Black Myth: Wukong’s</u></a>. For one reason or another, Sony did not opt to nudge the game out of its wake.</p><h2>What does this mean for Sony and live service games?</h2><p>I asked all the analysts I spoke to if this means live service is over, especially for Sony. Hardly, they all say – but this should serve as a reality check.</p><p>“Live service games have a high failure rate,” Deane said. “There are many reasons for that but the main one is because they rely on network effects. Sometimes a single-player game can have a slow launch but eventually find its way to success. But the clock is now ticking on Concord in a big way because unless the player counts pick up soon there’ll be nobody to play against. So even if you personally would like to give it a try, there’ll be nothing to play. But while the risks are big, so are the rewards. It’s no secret that many of the highest-earning games in the market today are live service games. According to our data, only about 16% of the total revenue of the games market now comes from traditional full-game sales. Publishers are going to keep chasing that 84%.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>As for Sony itself, Deane expects it will continue chasing live service. Helldivers 2, after all, was a huge hit earlier this year. “Though clearly they won’t want any more Concord-level disasters, if half of their forthcoming slate of live service games over the next few years succeed, that won’t be a bad result.”</p><p>Elliott agreed. “It only takes one big live-service win to generate billions upon billions in revenue and unlock new audiences – two things PlayStation very much wants right now, as the console business is facing growth challenges and reaching saturation. That said, I also expect some resources to be redirected to strategies that are working better for the company: PC launches and cross-media/transmedia, for example.”</p><p>Nevertheless, analysts suggested that Concord is a perfect example of the dangers of AAA companies chasing trends, especially with how long game development cycles have become. Elliott pointed out a growing list of failures in the space, even from major companies: BioWare’s Anthem, Crystal Dynamics’ Marvel’s Avengers, PlatinumGames’ Babylon’s fall. Some developers, he notes, have even canceled projects in advance, such as Sega with Hyenas or PlayStation’s The Last of Us Online.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sometimes everything that can go wrong does go wrong.</p></div><p>“Pivoting to live services is high-risk, high-reward venture, and the risk is heightening to levels that might not be worth it for many AAA console/PC publishers that aren’t already active in the space,” he said.</p><p>Concord’s failure has attracted attention due to the contrast between its status as a Sony first-party title in a popular genre with high production value, and the overwhelming cricket sounds that accompanied its launch. But the story of its failure is mundane. Sony, for whatever reason, chose not to market the game heavily enough to ensure players were aware of it. It chose to sell it at a premium price point despite all its serious competition going free-to-play. Had these factors been different, Concord might have stood a chance despite its relative lack of standout characteristics in an oversaturated genre. But even then, Concord was always fighting a difficult battle – a battle that will only get more fierce the more multiplayer shooters go to market in future years.</p><p>As Mat Piscatella summed up, “Sometimes everything that can go wrong does go wrong. Although it's quite rare to see everything go this wrong.”</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-concept-art-revealed-at-pax-west-202/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PAX West is currently underway, and the convention will end on September 3, 2024. Many developers and publishers gather at PAX West, including Gearbox Software, the developers responsible for the Borderlands franchise. At PAX West, Borderlands 4 details were revealed, albeit very vague. Those excited about the new Borderlands game got a glimpse at the concept art for <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/">Borderlands 4</a>, showcasing some of the new worlds players can expect to explore.</p>
<p>Four images were showcased at PAX West, all of which contrast with each other in some way. While most shared the same futuristic vibe in previous Borderlands games, one screenshot stood out in particular as quite different from the rest. In the screenshot below, while the area still looks relatively futuristic in places, it has a somewhat dated and industrial feel.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Borderlands fans have commented on the artwork <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-borderlands-4-concept-art-revealed-at-pax-west-showing-off-a-glimpse-of-its-new-worlds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first posted on IGN</a>, saying that the art style reminds them of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. From what is seen in the art work, the mood overall seems a lot darker just by the color palette alone, suggesting that players are in for a dark and twisted tale.</p>
<p>At PAX West, Gearbox Studios spoke out a little bit more about Borderlands 4, saying that the small teaser trailer that fans saw at Gamescom was set to happen just seconds before the conclusion of Borderlands 3. It now seems possible that we might see some returning characters from Borderlands 3 with this new revelation.</p>
<p>Adam May, the Art Director behind Borderlands 4 described the concept art to the audience, "The Borderlands universe is super interesting and there is so much to get to play with. It is a post-apocalyptic world but in the distant future, so it's like high tech but lo-fi. It creates all kinds of interesting opportunities with what we can do with our tech, our weapons, our characters, and world in general."</p>
<p>With that statement being put out to the audience, it now begs whether it's some sort of alternate timeline to Borderlands 3, since the trailer was said to be seconds before the conclusion of the third game. It's a bit confusing to wrap your head around, and a lot of it is just down to pinpoint where this game could be in the timeline.</p>
<p>"I can't say much, but this has a lot to do with it here. A lot of the things we haven't had much chance to play with in the past is some of that high technology stuff," which is evidently seen through the concept art screenshots.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 doesn't have an official release date at the moment, but it is slated for release sometime in 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/september%E2%80%99s-unmissable-game-releases.968841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/septembers-biggest-game-releases/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>We hope your wallet is ready because September’s biggest game releases are on the horizon, and there are a lot of them to sift through. Let’s look at the most exciting upcoming games of September, along with a handful of honorable mentions we think are also worth your time!</p>



<h2 id="h-upcoming-games-in-september-2024">Upcoming Games in September 2024</h2>



<p>At first glance, September looks like a fantastic month for the gaming community. We have countless indie projects finally launching after months or years of hype, alongside numerous high-profile releases. From space-based simulation games to previously console-exclusive titles, there’s a lot to play this month!</p>



<h3 id="h-star-trucker">Star Trucker</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Trucker  - Date Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ue68N_CpVlM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: September 3</li>



<li><strong>Platforms</strong>: PC, Xbox Series X|S</li>
</ul>



<p>In what felt like one of the most unique and surprising titles during Steam Next Fest, Star Trucker won us over with its science-fiction take on the truck simulator genre. Instead of hauling cargo from a small town in California to a hub in Texas, we’re roaming the stars in style, using a jet-powered truck cab that occasionally requires repairs. Oh, and it’s customizable. Star Trucker looks like it’ll shake up the transportation and hauling simulation community!</p>



<h3 id="h-the-casting-of-frank-stone">The Casting of Frank Stone</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Casting of Frank Stone | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1xixINNd6I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: September 3</li>



<li><strong>Platforms</strong>: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S</li>
</ul>



<p>I genuinely didn’t expect the Dead by Daylight franchise to spawn multiple spin-offs, yet here we are, eagerly awaiting the first one from developer Supermassive Games. The studio, known for its choice-driven horror stories, such as The Quarry, is creating a vibrant and enthralling story-driven experience in The Casting of Frank Stone. It’s a horror game in which friends uncover the mystery surrounding an infamous serial killer.</p>



<h3 id="h-astro-bot">Astro Bot</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Astro Bot - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unYFdcEjV9k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: September 6</li>



<li><strong>Platforms</strong>: PlayStation 5</li>
</ul>



<p>Utilizing the full power of the PlayStation 5 and its branding, Astro Bot launches us on an adventure spanning multiple levels and biomes, from jungles to volcanoes, as we unlock unique abilities and rescue lost crewmates. The PS5 exclusive features new powers and all-new enemies but retains its platforming mechanics that so many fell in love with. </p>



<h3 id="h-warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 - The Angels Of Death Cinematic Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-vnbKeOFPrI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: September 9</li>



<li><strong>Platforms</strong>: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S</li>
</ul>



<p>How much fan service can you fit into one game? All of it is the answer. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 lets us finally step into the up-armored boots of an Ultramarine, wielding various melee and ranged weapons, including the iconic Chainsword, Thunder Hammer, and Heavy Bolters, as we stomp, slash, and slay Tyranids across multiple planets. With a full single-player campaign, cooperative missions, and a PvP mode, there’s a lot to love about Space Marine 2!</p>



<h3 id="h-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIAiUWhxmrs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: September 18</li>



<li><strong>Platforms</strong>: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S</li>
</ul>



<p>Frank returns, albeit with a new voice actor, in the upcoming Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. This remaster is more like a remake, with enhanced graphics, modern controls, quality-of-life features, and full voice acting across the board. But despite its monumental changes on the technical side of the spectrum, DRDR retains its core gameplay loop of infiltrating the Willamette Mall, rescuing civilians, and fighting psychopaths amid a zombie apocalypse!</p>



<h3 id="h-god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War: Ragnarok</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="God of War: Ragnarok - PC Announcement Trailer | State of Play 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wSHZIckO8kw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: September 19</li>



<li><strong>Platforms</strong>: PC</li>
</ul>



<p>God of War launching on PC was a most welcome surprise, but it left us eager for more. Thankfully, Sony enjoys money, so it wishes to capitalize on the PC gaming community by releasing more of its console-exclusive titles. In September, we’ll see God of War: Ragnarok, the continuation of Kratos and Atreus’ story. The PC port features unlocked frame rates, high-fidelity graphics, enhanced lightning, upscaling, and ultrawide support on day one!</p>



<h3 id="h-frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Frostpunk 2 | Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWlLOpqIYjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Release Date</strong>: September 20</li>



<li><strong>Platforms</strong>: PC</li>
</ul>



<p>To many, the survival city-building genre set itself apart with Frostpunk. The tough-as-nails strategy game tasked players with building a society following a worldwide calamity that froze the planet to its core. Now, the sequel aims to expand and enhance the formula that won over so many—us included—by introducing new mechanics and new settings and pushing the story forward by 30 years. It all goes down in September!</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions-for-september">Honorable Mentions for September</h2>



<p>Of course, the few we’ve listed here are just a snippet of what’s launching in September. There’s also:</p>

In <em>Control</em>, you face off against these forces inside of The Oldest House, a brutalist office building in the heart of New York whose unwieldy innards are constantly shifting.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,195922,196345" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That is just the tippy top of the bizarre iceberg that is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/control-the-kotaku-review-1837569523&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/control-the-kotaku-review-1837569523"><em>Control</em></a></span><em>, </em>which is not only celebrating a fifth anniversary this week but is also coincidentally on sale on PlayStation.<strong> If you care (and I do believe you should), you can nab yourself the ultimate edition of </strong><em><strong>Control </strong></em><strong>(including its very necessary DLCs) for $10.</strong><br></p><p>I say that these are necessary because <em>Control </em>isn’t just tangentially connected to <em>Alan Wake </em>and the universe that Remedy is building. It and its supplementary material (as well as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/surprise-two-more-control-games-are-in-the-works-1847196296&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/surprise-two-more-control-games-are-in-the-works-1847196296">the sequel and multiplayer spinoff</a></span> that are on the way) are quintessential to understanding the connectedness of it all. You get a much fuller picture of the scope of things by first playing <em>Control</em>, which outlines a lot of the concepts, like Altered World Events and Objects of Power, that factor into <em>Alan Wake 2</em> quite heavily. It’s like a kind of side-sequel to the first <em>Alan Wake</em>, providing a wider window into the larger world that it only teased and connecting countless dots in the interim.</p><p>Beyond its role as connective tissue, <em>Control </em>is also its own loving ode to all things weird. The FBC is basically just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SCP Foundation</a></span>, which has its own basis in the history of internet creepypasta and urban myths. It is a world where the weirdo monsters we created as children are real and where cursed objects do exist. Some, like the floppy disk, grant blessings like the ability of telekinesis. Others, like a rubber duck, might dart around and prove to be a simple nuisance. And then there are fridges that might contain powerful beings beyond comprehension unless someone maintains eye contact with it at all times.</p><p>Much like the things it attempts to contain, the FBC’s headquarters is impossible to pin down. Unless you know to look for it, or are a particularly powerful parautilitarian, you can’t actually find and enter the Oldest House. Once you’re there, there’s no guarantee you won’t get lost within its walls either. That, or die in one of its “shifts” that drastically changes the layout of whole floors and departments. </p><p>All the while, the Oldest House is simultaneously the most aggressively mundane office building. Everywhere you look, concrete walls are blanketed by the glow of sterile white office lights. Typical desks and office chairs dot cubicles and offices that you explore. Little boxes all the same as far as the eye can see. But despite that, the environment is still suffused with an uneasy, sometimes menacing, feeling. One office will have <em>way</em> <em>too many</em> post-it notes adorning its surfaces, while a hallway in another wing of the building will seemingly spiral into nothingness. Bodies of office employees hang suspended in the air. And for all of the bland office space, there are jaw-dropping and impossible vistas to be seen in places like the Black Rock Quarry, or the very bottom of the Oldest House.<br></p><p>The environment does a lot of talking in <em>Control</em>. Whole stories can be gleaned from the layout of things, but <em>Control </em>also<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/fiddlecub/status/1828741627365429748&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/fiddlecub/status/1828741627365429748" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">features <em>a lot </em>of notes</a></span>, often shared between workers in departments that expertly build out and add further mystique to the game’s fiction. And then <em>Control </em>does one of my favorite things that only a game can do, and allows you to occasionally explore and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mysteries-are-the-heart-of-control-1844900378&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mysteries-are-the-heart-of-control-1844900378">uncover the mysteries</a></span> it builds up in the background of the central thrust of the story. Reader, it rarely, if ever disappoints on this front.<br></p><p><em>Control</em>, down to its central weapon, is just endlessly intriguing and teeming with possibility. The Service Weapon, itself an Object of Power, can morph into all manner of firearms, including a pistol, a shotgun, and eventually even a kind of grenade launcher. In tandem with Jesse’s increasing range of abilities, such as levitation and a shield, it’s very easy to become this all-encompassing powerhouse. Maybe that’s what I really love about <em>Control. </em>Not the power fantasy of it all, but how impossible it feels to fence in or nail down, how consistently and expertly it adapts different modes and forms that feel they can all breathe within <em>Control</em>’s seemingly limitless possibilities.</p><p><em>Control</em> is, simply put, one of the most special games of the last generation. Despite struggling a bit out the door, it eventually found its audience and has already grown into a title worthy of reverence. If you don’t already know what’s up, do yourself a favor and block off some time to pick up <em>Control </em>and just sink beneath its surface. You will not regret the time you’ll spend uncovering what the Oldest House has to hide.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/squirrel-with-a-gun-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/squirrel-with-a-gun-review.968808/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/squirrel-with-a-gun-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This amusing sandbox game has a lot of heart, but is every bit as shallow and short-lived as its goofy premise seems.</h2></div><div><section><p>Few premises are more immediately appealing than Squirrel with a Gun’s. A sandbox game where you control a gun-toting rodent and wreak havoc on the local population? Yes, please! And that premise certainly delivers to some extent, with quite a few laugh-out-loud funny moments right out the gate and a lot of enjoyment to be found in the goofy adventure’s opening hours. But this wacky Sciuridae simulator isn’t sitting on a stockpile of comedic acorns, instead stuffing its cheeks with silly gags all in one go, before finding its stores empty as the winter season fast approaches. Compounding that short-lived mirth are fairly serious performance issues, including regular crashes that made me repeat long stretches, which really took the wind out of my furry wings. Squirrel with a Gun still offers a couple hours of amusing sandbox goofiness, and I eagerly await a more fleshed out sequel in the same vein as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/goat-simulator-3-review">Goat Simulator 3</a>, but this first shot misses the target once the joke has run its course.</p><p>Like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/20/untitled-goose-game-review">Untitled Goose Game</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/24/octodad-dadliest-catch-ps4-review">Octodad: Dadliest Catch</a> before it, Squirrel with a Gun is a zany sandbox game where you play a troublemaking animal who becomes a real problem for the humans around them. After obtaining a pistol from a clumsy government spook, you’re let loose on a suburban community to rob people at gunpoint, wantonly destroy personal property, and exercise your Second Amendment right to blast fools in the face like the bloodthirsty little varmint you are. It’s a good time! But that dopey bit is exactly as shallow as it sounds, and though it only took me four hours to roll credits, it took even less time for the laughs to peter out.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Squirrel with a Gun Gallery</h3></div></output><p>Fighting as a squirrel packing heat proves pretty hollow. You’ll use pistols, rifles, and even grenade launchers to send <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/franchise/the-matrix"><u>Agent Smith</u></a>-looking sons of a gun to their doom – and they mostly stand around and let you do so while putting up very little resistance. They’re the only enemies to be found here, and they all go down in a couple of shots. One highlight is when you stun enemies and are then able to kill them off with a special finishing move, like peppering an enemy with lead from an uzi or swatting their grasping hands away while you perform gunjitsu like a furry <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/franchise/john-wick"><u>John Wick</u></a>. Unfortunately, there’s only one of these animations for each weapon, so the novelty runs out fairly quickly. There isn’t much to combat beyond these basics, and each weapon feels like just another indistinctive piece in the arsenal in a matter of seconds.</p><p>There are two boss fights to shake things up, however, where you take on giant military vehicles, like a tank. These encounters are quick sequences where you shoot at glowing spots and whittle down a health bar, which doesn’t provide much of a challenge, but they are at least a nice change of pace and have a few gags that made me smile. If more stuff like this made it into the story, it might have gone a long way to extend my enjoyment, but like everything else in this brief adventure, these antics are fleeting.</p><p>The puzzle-platforming, on the other hand, is much more satisfying. Firing your weapons as a means of double-jumping or otherwise propelling yourself into the air to overcome platforming challenges is far more interesting than any of the combat in Squirrel with a Gun. The submachine gun is a great way to keep yourself airborne for extended periods of time while crossing gaps, but nothing beats the rocket launcher in terms of pure height – it sends you sailing into the air to land (mostly) safely on faraway platforms. None of the platforming is particularly tricky, but making your fluffy avatar sail from place to place doesn’t get old nearly as quickly as the rest of the gameplay.</p><p>Unfortunately, Squirrel with a Gun’s good times are prone to interruption by technical issues that proved quite problematic, even during its brief runtime. I found myself staring at a frozen screen more than five times in as many hours, losing a good chunk of progress in the process, and was forced to repeat entire sections. By the end, I got into the fear-driven habit of rushing over to the static save points that can be found in each area – and a good thing too, because crashes seemed to happen more frequently in the back half of the adventure. And that’s not the only issue I ran into, either: One cutscene triggered and forgot to add the squirrel where he’s supposed to go, which broke everything and forced me to reset, and there were several times where my tiny buddy passed through geometry when moving at high speeds and sent me tumbling to the ground, which forced me to repeat certain platforming sections. Thankfully, Squirrel with a Gun already embraces a certain kind of chaotic energy, so the occasional goofy glitch isn’t the end of the world. But it did make some of the otherwise entertaining sections lose some of their luster once I had to replay them a third time in the wake of a crash.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Squirrel with a Gun is an awesome, immediately charming idea with legs as short as its fluffy protagonist. While platforming around by firing off weapons and causing mayhem in the small sandbox areas yields plenty of enjoyable moments, shallow combat, numerous technical issues, and short runtime left me wanting more. Even the over-the-top boss fights, which are definitely a high point in the zany adventure, come to an end all too quickly and are in short supply. I still adore this violent rodent and have high hopes for a sequel that’s bigger, more fleshed out, and less prone to crashing, but this first shot leaves a fair bit to be desired.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Squirrel with a Gun Review</h3><div><p>okay</p><p>Squirrel with a Gun is a uniquely amusing sandbox game, but it’s as shallow and short-lived as its goofy premise seems.</p><a href="https://www.ign.com/person/Tieguytravis" title="Travis Northup"><span></span><figcaption><p>Travis Northup</p></figcaption></a></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In our review, he stated, "It’s ironic that Kay’s ship is called the Trailblazer, since there’s actually not a whole lot of ideas in Star Wars Outlaws that haven’t been done before in other action and open-world adventures. Instead, it’s quite like the Millenium Falcon: a bucket of bolts held together with repurposed parts and prone to breaking down, but at its best it’s more than capable of jolting your pleasure centres into Star Wars fan hyperspace."</p><h3>More Star Wars: Outlaws Content on IGN</h3><p>Beyond game help, Map Genie, and our review, IGN has even more Star Wars Outlaws coverage available now and on the way!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-feels-just-as-vibrant-as-ever-in-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Warren Spector’s love letter to Disney was already great, but this faithful remake looks to fix its biggest flaws.</h2></div><section><p>There’s something… well… magical about 2010’s Wii-exclusive Epic Mickey getting a remake in 2024. As those who played the original know, the game itself is a quest through a realm of forgotten Disney characters and attractions called the Wasteland and, after playing a demo of Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed at D23, I’m more confident than ever that this adventure with an impressive new coat of paint will thankfully not be lost to the unforgiving hands of time, like some that sadly came before it.</p><p>What impressed me the most about Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is how much it looks and, perhaps most importantly, feels like a 2024 game. In our original Epic Mickey review, we gave it an 8/10 and said that this ‘Great’ game was held back by a camera and control system that were “flawed to a point where the larger experience becomes damaged.” None of those issues were present in what I played of the remake and it felt like an absolute joy to play. Oh, and it running at a smooth 60FPS didn’t hurt its case either.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Mickey himself has also improved in the 14 years since he first entered the Wasteland, as he can now sprint, dash, and ground pound around the gorgeous-yet-dark world that is very much like a twisted version of Disneyland. These new traversal additions are the Minnie to Mickey’s paint brush abilities, and they dance in a way that is just as beautiful as Disney Parks’ best nighttime spectaculars. </p><p>I just had the biggest smile on my face as I jumped around the opening level of Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed and didn’t have to deal with the frustrating motion and camera controls of the Wii version, leaving me to paint and thin with ease while feeling so much more agile. The best remakes implement changes that seem almost preposterous to think they were never there, and these fit that bill. </p><h3>A Remake in Every Sense of the Word</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As for the visuals of Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, they are another highlight in large part to remake developer Purple Lamp’s decision to not only rebuild the whole game with the original assets so it was playable from start to finish, but to then remake every asset from scratch and do it all over again. This dedication appears to have been worth it, as the Wasteland is now a place I wish I could explore forever.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fans will be able to look forward to three times as many collectibles to find, from pins to film reels to artwork and so much more. </p></div><p>From the inky black paint-like blot floating off Mickey as he runs and jumps to the colors and sharpness of the alternate flying elephant  and tea cup attractions, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed takes place in a world that I can just watch and listen to a subtle and haunting version of ‘Once Upon a Dream’ and still feel like I had a worthy play session. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The side-scrolling, 2D projector stages that take Mickey from one level to another also look so much better and, in one of the new additions to Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, you can go back and play through them again as you wish in the game’s Main Street Cinema. This means you can replay levels based on such classic Mickey cartoons as Steamboat Willie, Mickey and the Beanstalk, and more as you please. </p><p>Now, there isn’t a ton new in Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed as it is a very faithful remake, but fans will be able to look forward to three times as many collectibles to find, from pins to film reels to artwork and so much more. The team also told me there will be some new puzzles to solve, but that’s really about it.</p><p>So, if you didn’t love the story or painting gameplay or the first interaction between Mickey Mouse and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, these modern upgrades may not be enough to sway you. However, like me, if you saw in the original something that was held back from greatness on the Wii - or you never had a Wii and just love Disney and Mickey - this is one adventure you should keep an eye on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I’ll be very curious to see how the rest of the game holds up, as I was only able to play that opening level, but what I experienced left such an impression on me that it’s making September 24 a whole lot harder to wait for. </p><p>To end, I just wanted to share a few words from my chat with game design legend Warren Spector, the creative director on the original who also consulted on Rebrushed, as he sums up why Epic Mickey is one the games he is “most proud of.” High praise from the creator of Deus Ex and System Shock.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“I wanted to make a game for families that parents and children could play together, that kids could teach their parents how to play because that's the way it would work, not the other way around.”</p></div><p>“The thing that I love the most about this game is that it touched people emotionally,” Spector said. “I wanted to make a game for families that parents and children could play together, that kids could teach their parents how to play because that's the way it would work, not the other way around.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“Additionally, one of the things that characterizes Disney is that things last. They have lasting value. How many 1937 films are people still watching today that weren't made by Walt Disney? So, the idea that a game had that kind of impact and longevity is really special. But the biggest thing, really the biggest thing, is when people come up to me as they have at D23 and say, ‘I played this game as a child and now I get to play it with my child.’ That brings tears to my eyes. It just shows the real power and potential of games to do more than I think most of us realize.”</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
