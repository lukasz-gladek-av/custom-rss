            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/magic-gathering-final-fantasy-leak-tells-us-plenty-about-set<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em> may just be releasing now (along with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/tarkir-dragonstorm-commander-deck-reviews" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Tarkir: Dragonstorm Commander Deck Reviews - Roaring Fun!"><em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm </em>commander decks</a>), shipping errors from Wizards of the Coast are pulling eyes to June’s release: <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Magic: The Gathering">Magic: The Gathering </a>- Final Fantasy</em>.</p>

<p>First reports came in that some prerelease kits were sent to Brazil by mistake instead of <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm </em>ones, but those have managed to remain underwraps. Over the weekend a second leak emerged: the <em>Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy </em>Starter Kit was leaked in Spanish and it can tell us a number of things about the upcoming Universes Beyond set.</p>

<h3>A New Land Subtype</h3>

<p>In the beginner friendly starter decks, we see new dual lands for both Sephiroth and Cloud, producing mana in their colors. These lands follow what we often see in these types of products: they come into play tapped and produce one mana of either type. What’s special is that there is a new land subtype here: City.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-city-lands-spanish.jpg?itok=2SqKAT2X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-city-lands-spanish.jpg?itok=Rc1991sT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Neither of the lands do anything with the type, but in the past this has been used with types like <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=type%3Agate+game%3Apaper&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gates in MTG">Gates</a>(in <em>Battle For Baldur’s Gate </em>and <em>Foundations</em>), <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=type%3Adesert+game%3Apaper&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Deserts in MTG">Deserts</a> (most recently in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/outlaws-of-thunder-junction-most-wanted-review-and-upgrade-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Outlaws of Thunder Junction Most Wanted Review and Upgrade Guide"><em>Outlaws of Thunder Junction</em></a>), and several other times. These lands are not among those unique to the starter sets based on their collector numbers (those over 500 like the rares), so they can be expected to be seen in the main set, along with some payoffs for having them.</p>

<h3>Choose A Job: A New Living Weapon Variant</h3>

<p>For the second time we’re seeing a variant on the mechanic <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3A%22living+weapon%22+game%3Apaper&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Living Weapon cards">Living Weapon</a>, as Choose a Job follows the ground it and <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3A%22For+Mirrodin%22+game%3Apaper&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="For Mirrodin! cards">For Mirrodin!</a> previously explored, for the first time without any mirrans or phyrexians around. Honoring the job system that has a long legacy in Final Fantasy, each of these equipment represent one job that might be chosen and taught to one of your troops, or in this case a nameless and colorless 1/1 Hero brought with it.</p>

<p>That Hero token is equipped with the equipment which also gives it a creature type, a buff, and maybe an ability. We see what is Warrior’s Blade for example costing 3R, and giving equipped creature +3/+2 and turning it into a Warrior. Meanwhile Samurai Katana is only 2R giving +2/+2, trample, haste and the Samurai creature type. It’s not only red as the White Mage’s Rod shows a non-sword type weapon at 1W, giving equipped creature +1/+1, cleric, and whenever the creature attacks, you gain 1 life.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-equipment_0.jpg?itok=5fgPn1fc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-equipment_0.jpg?itok=XMJecO9X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The equip costs on these are pretty expensive, 5 for Warrior’s Blade, and Samurai Katana, and 3 for White Mage’s Rod. That fits what we’ve seen in the past, as what you are paying for on the front generally is the creature, and then the equip is the cost to move around, rather than a split with most equipment you see. Warrior’s Blade gives you a 4/3 Hero Warrior, Samurai Katana a 3/3 Trample, Haste, Hero Samurai, and White Mage’s Rod a 2/2 Hero Cleric who gains life.</p>

<p>Not all equipment in the set will be Choose A Job either if that concerns you. Ultima Weapon fills the role of a very big equipment without any of that, and is a rare unique to the starter decks. It costs 7, and also equips for 7 but gives +7/+7 to the creature barring it, who when it attacks can destroy target creature an opponent controls.</p>

<h3>Dragoons Represent</h3>

<p>Dragoons have a long history in Final Fantasy, being a common job in it, and the jumping lancer is an iconic part of the series. With Dragoon’s Lance (another Choose A Job equipment) we see that they are reasonably being typed as Knights, as that equipment gives +1/+0, and makes them a Knight. The biggest part here is how they are capturing the Dragoon flavor though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragoons-lance.jpg?itok=gMWitMgx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragoons-lance.jpg?itok=b8lCDoO5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It jumped in at the last chance!</figcaption></figure><p>For this, they are using a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/plst/M10-59/jump" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jump">Jump</a> type effect. During your turn, the creature has flying, meaning it can attack from above, but it can’t defend there. It’s a great flavor fit, and one imagines that we’ll see multiple cards with it in the set.</p>

<h3>More 9999 Representation</h3>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/343/jumbo-cactuar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jumbo Cactuar">Jumbo Cactuar</a> got everyone’s attention with it’s ability to get +9999/+0 on attack when it was revealed in the early <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Crossover Brings Classic Art and New Mechanics"><em>Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy </em></a>showing, but it isn’t the only card that’s going to represent it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/overkill.jpg?itok=GYoxsS3t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/overkill.jpg?itok=vcnS2tWd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sure, it might translate more to Exterminate, but Overkill fits the English FF localizations.</figcaption></figure><p>With what I believe is ‘Overkill’ (translations are divided on this as it’s not just strict translation, but considering also <em>Final Fantasy </em>translations), we see a removal spell that channels this energy. A 2B costed Instant, it gets target creature -0/-9999 until end of turn, killing almost any creature you can find in <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>that has been the beneficiary of an infinite, or near-infinite combo. Like the rest of the non-rares, it is also from the main set, so you can expect to see it running around as an uncommon in Play Boosters too.</p>

<p>There’s even more to be found throughout the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MTGRumors/comments/1jt1xyj/ff_starterkit/?share_id=YeMj8UkrS2dqmlOVPeuDV" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="MTG Rumors Subreddit thread with leaked images and translations">leaked images</a>, including the fact that we’re seeing a fair number of Japanese artists on these, the starter kits will have beautiful full art lands, and there’s rich representation of games across the series.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-4-roadmap-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4-roadmap-for-2025-promises-plenty-of-new-stuff-through-the-year.1159314/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-4-roadmap-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has revealed the roadmap for&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>throughout 2025, and it's got plenty of new stuff to tide you over until 2026, although it's apparently proven controversial among the game's player base.</p>

<p>In a post on the official&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em><a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189529/the-age-of-hatred-persists-diablo-iv-2025-roadmap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Blizzard says the&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>roadmap will allow you to "experience the spread of Mephisto's influence through new seasonal themes and questlines", continuing the game's overarching "Age of Hatred" theme, which began with its launch back in 2023.</p>

<p>New sets of Powers will come in each quarter of the year, but here's the catch: they won't be permanent additions. Instead, they'll work on Blizzard's so-called "borrowed power" philosophy, whereby you'll be able to unlock certain upgrades but they won't persist between seasons.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-roadmap-2025-full.jpg?itok=IbhZaV7V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-roadmap-2025-full.jpg?itok=RVJoC8CH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Diablo 4</em>'s roadmap has plenty of stuff for you, but a lot of it is temporary.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'll know if you've been playing&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>for the past few months, witchcraft is the major theme of January through April, which brought new Witchcraft Powers, Occult Gems, and more.</p>

<p>Between April and July, Belial's Return will bring Boss Powers, a new activity, and, perhaps most important of all, an earnable feline pet to keep you company through those long dungeon treks.</p>

<p>Sins of the Horadrim brings Horadric Powers (as you might expect) and Dungeon Escalation, which will allow you to ratchet up the intensity of&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>'s dungeons. Finally, at the end of the year, Infernal Chaos brings changes to the Infernal Hordes mode, as well as new Powers and more.</p>

<p>As you can probably imagine, fans <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/news/year-of-borrowed-powers-for-diablo-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">don't seem to be happy</a> about&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>'s continuation of the "borrowed powers" system, and there also seems to be some consternation about Blizzard's failure to communicate exactly what the aforementioned Powers will actually add to players' arsenals.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-roadmap-2025-gameplay.jpg?itok=69eR5sGD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-roadmap-2025-gameplay.jpg?itok=NpsXD0uO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players have reacted with consternation to&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>'s borrowed powers updates.</figcaption></figure><p>Permanent changes are, however, on their way to&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4</em>. They include new quality-of-life improvements, new Lair Bosses, and keyboard and mouse support for console, plus more.</p>

<p><em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/diablo-iv/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/diablo-iv-standard-edition/9n8117tm8jl3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

They’d love to get an update on how the long-awaited <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em> is coming along too, but a new expansion for <em>Starfield </em>feels more likely. Blizzcon isn’t returning until 2026 either, so we’ll probably get some updates on<em> Diablo IV</em> and other projects from that set of teams as well. </p><p>The<em> Outer Worlds 2</em> Direct, meanwhile, will feature “new gameplay, details, and developer insights” about the sequel to the 2019 sci-fi RPG shooter about futuristic space colonies dominated by rogue pirate gangs and corporate profiteers.

Microsoft also notes that this year’s show will be “digital-only,” suggesting it’s fully committed to the trail first blazed by Nintendo and won’t be holding an in-person component for the showcase (in past years the company had filled auditoriums with media, content creators, and fans to watch the streamed event in person).</p><p>The <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> is taking center stage this year presumably because <em>Fable</em> was delayed until 2026. Microsoft’s supplementary showcase Directs began in 2023 with <em>Starfield</em> and continued the following year with <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>. But Xbox still has a bunch of other rumored projects it could still reveal for 2025, including a<em> Gears of War</em> collection, as well as a new raft of ports for PS5 as well as Switch 1 and 2 as it continues its multiplatform pivot. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-comparable-to-the-ps4-in-third-party-games-report-claims/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-comparable-to-the-ps4-in-third-party-games-report-claims/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report about the Nintendo Switch 2 reveals how it compares to the other consoles in terms of third-party games, and the upcoming console seems comparable to the PS4.</p>



<h2 id="h-ps4-is-a-very-natural-point-of-comparison-for-the-switch-2">PS4 is a ‘Very Natural Point of Comparison for the Switch 2’</h2>



<p>During the latest Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZAr1c0Wqg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DF Direct Weekly</a> episode, the hosts took a deep dive into the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct Stream. One segment of this episode focused on comparing cross-console games for the Nintendo Switch 2, including Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Hogwarts Legacy, and Elden Ring. After going through Final Fantasy 7 Remake, it was stated that the game on the Switch 2 looks “quite comparable to the PS4, if not a bit of a favourable experience relative to the PS4.”</p>



<p>After going through Hogwarts Legacy, it was stated that the upcoming Nintendo console provided much better image quality than the PS4. For Elden Ring, it was hard to compare as they didn’t receive any press assets, and the quality would drop down in a YouTube upload. However, they said the resolution is comparable to the PS4, and other settings look similar “if not better” than the PS4.</p>



<p>Overall, the “Switch 2 is doing a pretty great job of turning in PS4-level visuals,” possibly with other upgrades such as better loading times and advanced rendering technologies that modern titles have. They add, “It’s a pretty good showing for the Switch 2 so far,” and for these “PS4 class titles,” players can probably expect a “PS4 level” of experience.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest talking points following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Direct</a> was how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> is priced at $80 USD. That's $10-$20 higher than most major AAA games, prompting people to voice their opinions about the price hike. Nintendo isn't charging $80 for all Switch 2 games, but why is it doing so for Mario Kart World?</p><p>Serkan Toto of Kantan Games told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-are-so-high-according-to-analysts-1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Nintendo is doing this simply because they can, and any online "uproar" will blow over in time.</p><p>"I think they raised software prices across all these regions because they think they can," Toto said. "Nintendo already priced in the protest and uproar by part of the fan base, betting this will all blow off and gamers will come to accept a new normal eventually. And I think they will be correct about this."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="87831021" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <p>
Microsoft has locked in the date and time for its annual June announcement extravaganza, the Xbox Games Showcase, and revealed that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 will be getting a dedicated deep dive directly after. 
</p>
<p>
The Xbox Games Showcase 2025 will air on Sunday, 8th June at 6pm UK time - that's 1pm Eastern or 10am Pacific if you live over the pond. 
</p>
<p>
As soon as that finishes, Microsoft will roll straight into The Outer Worlds 2 Direct, a longer look at Obsidian's upcoming sci-fi role-playing game sequel. In previous years, this slot has been saved for looks at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> (in 2023) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> (in 2024).
</p>
<p>While certainly an important game in Microsoft's line-up, The Outer Worlds 2 does not quite feel like it has the same oomph as those games. Perhaps this was a slot previously pencilled in for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-fable-reboot-delayed-into-next-year">Fable, before its delay to 2026</a>?</p>
<p>
Microsoft is the first of the big three console makers to detail its event plans for June, during the week previously taken up by E3. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-dates-confirmed">Summer Game Fest</a>, the online livestream fronted by The Game Awards' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, will air a couple of days beforehand, on Friday 6th June. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Switch 2, lest you forget, is due to launch on Thursday 5th June</a>. Will there be another Nintendo Direct around then too?
</p>
<p>
The coming weeks will likely see additional showcases announced by other publishers - in the past, EA, Capcom, Ubisoft and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> have held dedicated events during this time period. And what will PlayStation have to offer? We'll let you know as soon as we do.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/09/xbox-games-showcase-and-outer-worlds-direct-scheduled-for-june-8th/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We are quickly approaching what used to be<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/12/e3-is-officially-dead-esa-confirms-the-trade-show-is-no-more/"> E3 week</a> but nowadays that means showcase events from the major players. Microsoft has launched early and claimed the most cosy spot, Sunday evening on the 8th June, thus allowing both Europe and the US to be fully awake and paying attention to the show.</p>
<p>“It all begins with our annual Xbox Games Showcase, bringing you a look at upcoming titles from across our first-party studios, in addition to incredible new titles from our third-party partners across the globe. This year, the show will be digital-only – our livestream will bring you everything you’ll need to know about what’s next for Xbox, no matter where in the world you’re watching,” explains <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/09/xbox-games-showcase-2025-outer-worlds-2-direct/">a blog post.</a></p>


<p>But wait, there’s more. straight after that show, there will be another which will focus solely on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-outer-worlds-2-is-coming-to-ps5-as-well-as-pc-and-xbox-in-2025/">The Outer Worlds 2,,</a> a game that is confirmed to be also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-outer-worlds-2-is-coming-to-ps5-as-well-as-pc-and-xbox-in-2025/">launching on PlayStation,</a></p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will very much follow in the tone and style of the original, but promises to go bigger and broader on pretty much every level. There’s the new colony to explore in Arcadia, which is the home of skip drive technology, and which you explore as a new Earth Directorate agent trying to figure out if it’s responsible for all the big and scary rifts that are threatening the whole galaxy.</p>
<p>There’s various factions vying for power which you’ll have to navigate, balancing what amounts to the church, state and capitalism, and just as in the original, you’ll have a huge amount of sway over events. Well, depending on your chosen skills and how you do with skill checks and conversations, anyway.</p>

<p>“You’ll be able to enjoy our June 8 double feature through a variety of outlets, in over 40 languages, as well as American Sign Language, British Sign Language and English Audio Descriptions,” said Microsoft.</p>
<p>Here are the start times across the globe:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PDT</strong>: June 8, 10am</li>
<li><strong>EDT</strong>: June 8, 1pm</li>
<li><strong>BST</strong>: June 8, 6pm</li>
<li><strong>CEST</strong>: June 8, 7pm</li>
<li><strong>JST</strong>: June 9, 2am</li>
<li><strong>AEST</strong>: June 9, 3am</li>
</ul>
<p>And you can watch the Xbox Showcase via these – or other – feeds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-2-billion-year-revenue/">Xbox</a> and Microsoft have put a date on its summertime showcase, with the announcement that the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 will be livestreamed on <strong>Sunday, June 8, 2025 at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BT.</strong></p>
<p>Similarly to how previous Xbox showcases have featured a Direct-like show on <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-starfield-direct-breaks-viewership-records-for-xbox/">Starfield</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/">Call of Duty</a> immediately after the general showcase, it's The Outer Worlds 2's turn to get its own featured Direct following the rest of the showcase.</p>
<p>Beyond The Outer Worlds 2, Xbox isn't giving any hints yet as to what will be shown at this direct.&nbsp;<span>The June 8 date is, however, right towards the tail-end of<a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-comes-to-los-angeles-again-from-june-6-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Summer Game Fest 2025,</a> which takes place from June 6-9.</span> With how many bits of news and leaks happen around that time, we'll surely have a better idea of what this showcase will look like closer to the actual date.</p>
<p>Whether Microsoft tells us about what'll be shown or not, Xbox does mention that this Xbox Games Showcase will be just a digital live stream, meaning there won't be a physical show component to it as they've done in the past.</p>
<p>Xbox also clarifies that the games shown will be both from Xbox's "<em>first-party studios, in addition to incredible new titles from our third-party partners across the globe</em>," an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/09/xbox-games-showcase-2025-outer-worlds-2-direct/">Xbox Wire</a> blog post reads.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is the sequel to the fairly successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 sci-fi roleplaying game</a> published by Private Division. This one, though, will be published by Xbox Game Studios, which means Obsidian will have enjoyed a higher budget during development. The expectations are certainly higher, especially after Obsidian CEO Feargus Urquhart <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-is-looking-incredible-says-obsidian-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyped it up as something 'incredible'</a>.</p>
<p>Fans of the first game may be disappointed to learn that it will feature a new cast of characters. The journey will also take them to a new solar system.</p>

<p>We’re set for our first meaty look at The Outer Worlds 2 on June 8—courtesy of a Direct Showcase. We don’t know how long it will last, but it’s confirmed that the presentation will lift the lid on much of Obsidian’s sci-fi sequel.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/outer-worlds-spacers-choice-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds</a> was one of my favorite games of 2019. It included a lot of what I love about Fallout, but added its own shine and humor in a refreshing way! The Outer Worlds 2 being announced at The Game Awards 2024 was a pleasant surprise, and it had to come with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funny trailer</a> reminding us all what it’s about.</p>



<p>Obsidian has been quiet about The Outer Worlds 2 ever since. Its development, release, and support of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a> likely had a lot to do with this. The Outer Worlds 2 Direct signals full-steam ahead for the successor.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase 2025</a> takes place on June 8. Soon after it finishes, we jump straight into The Outer Worlds 2 Direct.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/09/xbox-games-showcase-2025-outer-worlds-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a> newsletter said this on April 9: “Immediately following [Xbox Games] Showcase,&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;Direct will bring you inside the walls of Obsidian Entertainment, revealing new gameplay, details, and developer insights, straight from the people making the sequel to the award-winning, first-person sci-fi RPG.</p>



<p>You can catch all the action through Xbox’s many channels, including YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, and much more.</p>



<hr>



<p>With a distinct absence of new Fallout video games, The Outer Worlds 2 has a chance to plug a space-sized hole. Share your favorite memories and stories of The Outer Worlds below.</p>

                <p>Nintendo's official unveiling of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2</a> coincided with President Trump unleashing higher tariffs on all imports, including consoles and games. In response, Nintendo took the extraordinary step of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">delaying Switch 2 preorders</a> amidst market uncertainty. However, one analyst believes that Nintendo won't increase Switch 2's $450 price before launching on June 5.</p><p>David Cole, the founder of the research firm DFC Intelligence, told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-likely-to-stick-with-switch-2s-450-launch-price-despite-trump-tariffs-says-analyst" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> that he expects Nintendo to maintain the $450 price initially, and added "we believe that price point was reached with the threat of tariffs already looming." Cole also said that if the 24% tariffs on goods from Japan remain in place, Switch 2's price could rise 20% within the next two years. He went on to suggest that Nintendo may limit the amount of Switch 2 consoles available at launch in response to the tariffs. Tariffs are even higher on goods coming from China and Vietnam, where Nintendo is manufacturing the system.</p><p>"There may be a supply issue if Nintendo chooses to limit production initially," noted Cole. "Nintendo is very conservative and they don't like to take big risks on having surplus inventory. So they may take a bit of a wait-and-see approach given some of the current unknowns."</p><p>DFC's projection for Switch 2's launch numbers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-sell-fewer-systems-than-previously-thought-analyst-says/1100-6530681/" data-ref-id="1100-6530681">were also revised downward</a> from 17 million to 15 million in 2025. Regardless, Cole remains bullish on Switch 2's potential to grab "an even larger [market] share than the original Switch."</p><p>The Entertainment Software Association has already warned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/esa-says-tariffs-will-have-a-detrimental-impact-on-entire-gaming-industry-not-just-nintendo/1100-6530636/" data-ref-id="1100-6530636">the tariffs may severely harm the video game industry</a> beyond Nintendo. Other analysts have said that video game publishers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-tariffs-may-lead-publishers-to-abandon-physical-games-says-analyst/1100-6529858/" data-ref-id="1100-6529858">may abandon physical releases altogether</a> in order to avoid the tariffs.</p>

            <p>The Witcher spin-off studio The Molasses Flood has been absorbed into parent company CD Projekt Red.</p>
<p>The news was shared with a <a href="https://www.themolassesflood.com/">brief statement on the studio's website</a>. "We want to let you know that on April 1, 2025, The Molasses Flood LLC ('TMF') merged with CD Projekt Red Inc. ('CDPR Inc.'), a company being a part of the CD Projekt Group," the notice reads.</p>
<p>"As a result of the merger TMF, in its former legal state (of a separate legal entity) ceased its operations, while CDPR Inc. assumed the rights and obligations of TMF."</p>

<p>The studio assured that this merger "will not affect the availability or distribution of The Flame in The Flood and Drake Hollow video games", and these titles will continue to be published by CD Projekt Group.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damian-isla-815a46_well-its-the-end-of-an-era-tucked-away-activity-7315404560620044288-Qazy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAoO_OkB-VfPR7dhiZ-PZ-9sf_EfWliEy1k">post on LinkedIn</a>, The Molasses Flood co-founder Damian Isla called this merger a "GOOD AND HEALTHY thing for the studio", and something that had been expected for some time now.</p>
<p>"It breaks down some organisational barriers, and better integrates the TMF team with the rest of the amazing CDPR org," Isla wrote, before announcing he had departed the studio.</p>
<p>"Last Monday - the last day of TMF's legal existence! - was also my last day at the studio," the developer shared. "Obviously this is a big change. TMF has been a huge part of my life for the past decade plus, and I'm proud [to] have been a part of building something that lasted as long as TMF did, in a market environment often quite hostile to tiny teams like ours."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-buys-the-flame-in-the-flood-developer-the-molasses-flood">CD Projekt acquired The Molasses Flood</a> for an undisclosed fee back in 2021. The studio was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-future-witcher-projects-outlined">tasked with bringing a part-solo, part-multiplayer experience set in The Witcher series to life</a>. However, this project - known as  Project Sirius - has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-sounds-like-its-being-rebooted-from-scratch">hit a number of stumbling blocks since its conception</a>.</p>
<p>CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekts-stalled-the-witcher-spin-off-now-has-a-new-framework">shared an update on Project Sirius</a> in 2023, announcing its "work on defining a new framework" was now complete, but that news was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-spin-off-studio-the-molasses-flood-hit-by-layoffs-following-project-reboot">layoffs at the Boston-based studio</a>.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this week's news, Isla said Project Sirius has a "bright future" and is "going to be an amazing game" on its release. </p>
<p>"I cannot wait until the rest of the world learns about what we've been working on," Isla wrote.</p>

<p>Elsewhere at CDPR, in December last year the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">studio lifted the lid on The Witcher 4</a>. This new saga will shift its focus away from Geralt of Rivia and toward a new protagonist in Ciri (pictured above).</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the developer confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">it doesn't plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/09/turtle-beach-stealth-700-gen-3-gaming-headset-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>In the search for gaming audio perfection, you’ve got to put a lot of different headsets on a lot of different heads. Turtle Beach know this better than anyone, with an ever-evolving and ever-growing collection of gaming headsets, that show the true nature of a well-oiled research and development cycle. The Stealth 700 has been a staple of that lineup, and with the Gen 3 version, they’ve taken things to the next level, creating a headset that you might not want to take off. Thanks to their various innovations, you won’t have to.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Stealth 700 (Gen 3): Rank up to Crossplay Audio" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xaKURDqnkxI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Priced at £179.99, the Stealth 700 Gen 3 is a wireless and Bluetooth-equipped gaming headset. One of its key selling points is the inclusion of two 2.4GHz USB-A dongles, so you can plug one into your PS5 and the other into your PC, and then seamlessly switch between them via the crossplay button on the right earcup. It’s a great solution for the multi-system gamer.</p>


<p>Turtle Beach have got comfort don’t pat these days. From the Stealth 100 at the lower end of the spectrum, which is now available in a very cool artic camo flavour, through to the Stealth 900, they know how to make a gentle ear cushion or two. The Stealth 700 Gen 3 is super soft and super gentle – this sounds like a child’s shampoo advert, but bear with me – and I couldn’t get over just how plush the headband was every single time I picked it up.</p>
<p>I haven’t been all that kind to the Stealth 700 either, stretching out, and leaving it hanging off monitors, TVs and headphone stands, all of which hasn’t damaged the metal-reinforced headband or ear cushions in any way. Frankly, the Stealth 700 feels bombproof – not something we’re going to be testing.</p>

<p>That build quality is probably why the Stealth 700 is a little chonky. They have all the stealth qualities of a bag of spanners bouncing around on an airport baggage retrieval belt, as they’re amongst the most noticeable headsets you could wear. They still look smart, especially in our review unit’s black and anodised metal review trim, and it’s clear that the design team have taken time improving the visuals over previous iterations, but this is a big pair of headphones, and there’s no getting away from that fact.</p>

<p>The advantage of all that size is that Turtle Beach have been able to pack it with tech, and they’ve made the ear cushions and headband thick and pliant. It’s also a true over-ear headset, fully covering each ear, and ensuring decent passive noise cancellation. You’ll need that too, as their’s no Active Noise Cancellation included, which is something of a shame in a headset at this price. That said, the ANC in competing headsets is never really mind-blowing, so perhaps Turtle Beach have made the pragmatic choice to exclude it.</p>
<p>The Stealth 700 Gen 3 houses an array of on-board controls, from the power button with its surrounding LED, to three dials for volume, chat and WHAT?.<br>
They’ve also packed in two massive 60mm Eclipse dual drivers, each set separating the high and low frequencies, and thanks to their expansive size they’re very capable of pushing a whole heap of audio around. The Stealth 700 Gen 3, as with most of Turtle Beach’s modern headsets, sound excellent. The Signature Sound EQ setting gives you bags of bottom end while maintaining plenty of detail at the top end, so dialogue and sound effects ring through clearly.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing a lot of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/monster-hunter-wilds-review/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, and the Stealth 700 has done an amazing job translating monster roars and the epic soundtrack into an enveloping atmosphere. You can absolutely blast your ears off too, as the Stealth 700 Gen 3s go all the way to what feels like 11. There’s some serious output available for the hard-of-hearing, or those seeking hard-of-hearing status later in their lives.</p>

<p>They do a great job with music too. I may be mildly obsessed with the new Linkin Park song – you’ve listened to it non-stop for three days too, right? – and the band’s trademark guitar sound is both powerful and aggressive here, with Emily Armstrong’s vocals careening across the top of it all. If you’re into the heavier side of things, or dance music with thumping drums and grinding bass lines, this is the perfect headset for you.</p>
<p>The microphone boom arm folds back into the left earpiece, so when you’re not using it you wouldn’t even know that it’s there. When you fold it down for use, you can angle it slightly towards your mouth, but it sits in a very rigid position, a very fixed distance from your mouth. While that means it’s should be reliable and offer similar performance every time, there’s no option really for customisation beyond being off or on. Performance is solid though, with a decent representation of your voice flying off into the void.</p>
<p>The Swarm II software is available for iOS, Android and PC, and from here you can make a batch of changes to your headset, including updating it and both transmitters. I was impressed how easy this was to do – many apps need a couple of goes for updating things, or something fails, but here, despite the additional connection points, it all worked impressively well.</p>

<p>Once you’ve updated everything, the app itself gives you extensive access to the workings of the Stealth 700, from a choice of EQs, including a series of custom slots, to tweaking the performance of your microphone, adding and setting a noise gate to prevent unwanted sounds from getting through, to altering the EQ of your voice.</p>
<p>One of the sole issues I found with the Stealth 700 Gen 3 was the blinking LED light that surrounds the power button. In the middle of the night, it was distractingly bright, shining back off the screen of my Nintendo Switch at me, while also annoying my partner as she attempted to go to sleep. There doesn’t seem to be any way of turning this off if you’re solely using the Bluetooth connection, only stopping if the headset hooks up to one of the dongles. It’s a clear issue that can hopefully be remedied by an update, especially if you’re a Nintendo Switch player who’s using the Bluetooth connection as your primary setup. Worst comes to the worst, I guess you can always apply a bit of black tape.</p>

			<p>Atlus has announced that an extensive Persona 3 Reload demo is now available on all platforms. The demo allows would-be players to play through the story’s opening, leading up to the first major boss battle against a Shadow. It's a section of several hours, making it a rather meaty demo compared to the usual half-hour slice. Moreover, as usual with demos nowadays, you can play through the whole thing and then continue where you left off after you purchase the game.</p>
<p>Persona 3 Reload launched in early 2024 to critical and commercial acclaim. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was rated 9 out of 10</a> by reviewer Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>Persona 3 Reload is gorgeous; it looks like one of the more modern Persona titles, and it manages to bring this new visual overhaul without sacrificing what is one of the darker atmospheres you'll find in a game like this. It adds a fresh feel to the game while still keeping it familiar, which is something all remakes/reloads could remember to do. From brand-new models and portraits to new menus, ATLUS hasn't skimped.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, I want to say it plays immaculately on the Steam Deck. There are no hiccups; it is smooth, responsive, and looks fantastic. Overall, Persona 3 Reload is precisely as my title says: "a remake as it should be". Yes, aspects are missing from previous versions, so you couldn't arguably call this a definitive edition of Persona 3. Still, in my opinion, it's undoubtedly the best version of Persona 3 you'll find.</em></p>
<p>Shortly after the game's debut, Atlus <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-3-reload-is-the-fastest-selling-game-in-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boasted</a> that it was the fastest-selling game in the whole Persona franchise. We know it has sold one million copies in its first week, though there haven't been any updated sales figures since.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/you-might-want-to-check-nintendo-switch-2-camera-resolutions-before-you-regret-your-decision/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If something’s too good to be true, it usually is. The new Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera is the clear choice on paper. Having the prickly piranha next to your TV and Switch 2 is a dream, but its low-resolution image might taint the purchase.</p>



<p>Engagement with friends and family and social interconnectivity is huge in the Switch 2’s marketing. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> opened with a glorious package for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, and segued nicely into Switch 2 features such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-is-for-gamechat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C-Button</a> and using cameras to broadcast you in real-time to playing partners.</p>



<p>A line of official cameras can send an image of you to anyone you’re playing Switch 2 games with. The official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera looks professional, but the Piranha Plant Camera looks fun. However, there’s a drastic reduction in the latter’s camera resolution and quality.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-camera-offers-big-differences-in-resolution">Nintendo Switch 2 Camera Offers Big Differences in Resolution</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Which will you go for? Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera outputs a solid <strong>1080p</strong>; on the other hand, the Piranha Plant Camera barely pushes out <strong>640×480</strong>.</p>



<p>It certainly explains the price difference between <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo</a>‘s two devices. You’re looking at <strong>$49.99/£49.99</strong> for the official camera and <strong>$43.99/£33.99</strong> for the Piranha Plant. Given that almost anything licensed costs more, there had to be a catch somewhere, making the Piranha Plant cheaper.</p>



<p>Now you have the answer. If you were planning on picking up a Switch 2 camera, think carefully about whether you choose quality or an unquestionably amazing design for a camera.</p>

It appears it will indeed once again return, as an image that leaked from Nintendo Korea's website appears to tease Rainbow Road.</p><p>As spotted by<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-leak-confirms-iconic-tracks-return" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Eurogamer</a>, the Nintendo Korea website for Mario Kart World posted--and swiftly removed--the image below. It seems to suggest Rainbow Road is coming back, and might be featured on the Mario Kart World map near Princes Peach's Castle.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, Mario Kart World features a sprawling, interconnected world where players can drive from one course to another.

It’s just won two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bafta-games-awards-2025-the-full-list-of-winners">BAFTA Game Awards</a>: one for Best Multiplayer, another for Best Music. That’s from five nominations. The BAFTA wins bring to an end a fruitful video game awards season, drawing a line under what has been a remarkable year for Swedish developer Arrowhead.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Helldivers 2 accepts the win for Multiplayer at the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BAFTAGamesAwards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BAFTAGamesAwards</a> ✨ <a href="https://t.co/rYWwyc1KGR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rYWwyc1KGR</a></p>— BAFTA Games (@BAFTAGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/BAFTAGames/status/1909690279919071465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s remember, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time</a>, with an astonishing 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks. It is a record no first-party Sony-developed game will likely ever beat. But so much has happened since that initial explosive release: a dramatic U-turn on PSN account requirements on Steam, review-bomb campaigns, and a community often at war with Helldivers 2 itself as nerfs and buffs either went too far or not far enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through it all, Arrowhead has struggled to cope with a bigger, more mainstream playerbase than it’s ever had to contend with. But now, 14 months after Helldivers 2 hit PC and PlayStation 5, how does Arrowhead reflect on what’s gone before? Has it finally started to get to grips with the brutal, unforgiving world of live-service? And after that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-gives-all-players-next-weeks-killzone-items-for-free-following-pricing-backlash-and-theyre-available-now">Killzone collaboration</a>, could Warhammer 40,000 be next?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN sat down with Alex Bolle, production director on Helldivers 2, to find out more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Congratulations on all the awards! When you were in the thick of development and things weren't perhaps going as well as they might have otherwise been, did you ever imagine that a year after the game came out it would be considered one of the best games of 2024 and win all these awards?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> No, no, definitely not. It's a very humbling experience. I would say a year ago exactly, we had a hint that it would be a sweet year for us, but we were also in the thick of it. We were still fixing a lot of things, preparing our next big release for the content. So no, definitely not realizing we would get there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last time we spoke, we were preparing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-adds-new-faction-illuminate-in-omens-of-tyranny-update-and-its-out-now-the-game-awards-2024">Omens of Tyranny</a>. Even then we are like, okay, we have The Game Awards. We were preparing the whole shadow drop and everything. We were ready to make that shadow drop and be like, okay, this one is going to be fun. The awards part, maybe not that much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was next to my release manager trying to monitor the progress of Omens of Tyranny and the whole major order with the Illuminate. And I turned my head towards the TV at the office, it was like 2am. And I see Mikael Eriksson, the game director, just shaking hands with Snoop Dogg. And I'm like, what is going on here? Which reality are we?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yeah, it's been good. The Golden Joysticks, DICE, all those awards, it's a good way to take a step back and look at the impact of the game. We’re nearing the end of the awards season and this one feels really good, because the credibility and the fame of it is just amazing. So yeah, it's great. It's going to be a good addition for the team, I hope.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> It's been over a year since the game came out, so people have had time now to reflect upon its release and its impact. Have you come to understand why it's won so many awards, why it's done so well? Why it's resonated so much with gamers? Have you worked out why Helldivers 2 has ended up being the success it has been?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> I wish the interview was two hours! It's a whole soup recipe, or maybe more like a very sophisticated French dish. I don't think we figured it out. One thing we keep at heart is just the interaction with the community. All the players, taking the time to really talk to them, understand what they want. We have so many devs that are continuously looking at Discord, at Reddit. We have a lot of things that come from there and we want to keep that interaction level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That has been the thing that we thought, okay, when we prepare the fantasy for the next updates and so on, this is the part that we want to keep. We were talking about the future of the game with Mikael and it was all about that. What is it that the player wants? What is it that we are not achieving yet? What's next? And this is always like, players in mind. It's what works well. It's the ability to talk to them, ability to make that kind of fantasy in the game around the Galactic War.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-throwing-everything-but-the-kitchen-sink-at-one-planet-and-players-are-still-holding-out">Last week with Pöpli IX</a>, it's been a year and we still manage to get those moments in-game. I think it's important. These are needed. I was talking to our Game Master this morning, it feels good to have that. It's one of the things we'll cherish until we don't make the game, but so far it's working well.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2 Escalation of Freedom Update Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> You've spoken as a team before about the impact Helldivers 2 had on you as a studio, and it was a big shock to the system. Do you feel like now you're starting to get a handle on what Helldivers 2 is, what the audience is, and settling into a sustainable, healthy way of keeping it going as a live service? Especially after having that influx of players that you weren't perhaps expecting and the type of players that were different than what you were expecting? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> We're still trying to figure out the good recipe for a healthy cadence for the developers, for the players as well. Who do we cater to as well? It's been super interesting. I've been at Arrowhead for a bit more than three years now, coming from bigger studios and yeah, there's a lot of things that we had to go back to square one, on how it works at Arrowhead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johan Pilestedt, as one of our founders and the lead of the studio for so long, has been key in setting a development culture that we try to keep at heart while maintaining that live service aspect. This has been catching lightning in a bottle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I feel like every week is taking learnings again from the different wins and failures that we had along the way. Also from other developers. I think it's been one of the good advantages that we had, is that success also allows us to talk way more openly with all the devs. It's been very good on that side. It's sharing ways to do it, better ways, more sustainable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On who do we make the game for? That's a tricky one. Arrowhead’s motto has always been ‘a game for everyone is a game for no one.’ When you add this amount of players, no one and everyone is a bit muddy. So it's always a bit of a puzzle of like, okay, this content is for these type of players, this content is for this type of player. And this is where we are still working very hard with PlayStation, with the team internally to understand, hey, when you want to make this enemy, who do you have in mind?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think it's a very fingertip sensitivity that we are getting slowly. I think there's a lot of work within direction as well to remind us who we were making the game for at the very, very, very beginning, because we have a lot of the old guard of Arrowhead still around to help us figure this out. We have one of the features upcoming that we've been developing with one of our old-time founders for example, and it's been so good because he brings that magical angle on the co-op.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> The internet loves to talk about Steam concurrents, but I would like to get your take as someone who knows the data. Do you think Steam concurrents are misleading? Do they give some insight into the success or otherwise of a live service game? Obviously you had a huge peak, but it is unreasonable to expect that to maintain itself forever, and Helldivers 2 seems to have settled on Steam. From your perspective, how do you view that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> I am far from being the expert of the studio on this. I do see sometimes a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more you talk about it, the more you show it, the more people are like, wow, interesting, it's going up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a metric among many others. There's many reasons for a game's success or failure. I think we've been doing good numbers, like breaking some trends and everything. On our side, the only thing I can say is that, yeah, we want to keep that steady floor of players and bringing people again for new memorable moments for the game and for the community. So I would say that's pretty much where we want to go. Do we have screens all around the studio with CCU [concurrent users] and all those metrics? Of course, because it's always good to keep them in mind. But we're not obsessed by it. I think we are in a position we don't have to be, but we want to make sure, hey, when we make something, it's meaningful. That's the thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Whatever happens, you'll probably forever now be the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time. I can't see a game ever really topping that. As a studio, does that mean you can be a bit more relaxed about what you're doing with Helldivers 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> Yes and no. Yes, in a way, especially in these days for the industry, it feels like such a privileged situation. That is amazing. I think we are cherishing that a lot. At the same time, we don't want to take this for granted. There's a studio, we have developers to pay. We have a studio life to keep on for years and years and years. So that's the thing where we're like, yeah, it's been good. We need to make sure it keeps going great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also an accountability for, again, the people we make the game for. We're not going to just start to be like, okay, it's fine. It's going to be fine. We can take a bit more time. We want to take more time to make things better, especially now that the players are asking for it. But yeah, there's definitely an ambition to keep things going, keep our standards of development, keep finding creativity and innovation. If we just became complacent, I don't think Arrowhead would be Arrowhead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Do you think it's reasonable for a game like Helldivers 2 to have a multi-year plan that envisages the game being around for a decade? For me, Helldivers 2’s gameplay feels almost timeless, so it could become a forever game. Or will there come a point where you have to think about what’s next when it comes to Helldivers itself?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> Thank you for acknowledging that the game might not age at all! I love when you boot a game after 15, 20 years and it still plays the same.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Helldivers 2 has that about it doesn’t it? It‘s about the things that happen in the game and the physics at play and the feel of it, as opposed to it being future-proofed in terms of visuals, for example.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> Absolutely. When I talk with the team, when I talk to the directors, when I talk to Mikael about the future, it’s exciting because we want it to be around for years and years and years to come. And it's almost like, how do we stay true to the Helldivers 2 fantasy, challenging enough that we keep making amazing new features and new systems and all that while we stay true to who we are? And I think it's something that is so motivating for the years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The more we figure out how to thrive in a live environment, and we still have a way to go to figure out a lot of things around that, the more we can let creativity loose on new systems that we would've never thought about a year ago when we released. I've worked on live games before and it's where you feel like you have something you can figure out: what if I would do this cool thing I've seen in other games and adapt it to our sauce, that still makes it true to ourselves? I'm looking forward to this moment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> You’ve done a Killzone collab. I'm a massive Warhammer 40,000 fan, and as soon as I started playing Helldivers 2 I thought, oh my God, if I was an Imperial Guard soldier dropping down, facing off against waves of Tyranids or Necrons… can you give me any hope as a fan of both Helldivers 2 and Warhammer 40,000 that this is even possible?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex Bolle:</strong> What I can say is that we had a blast working on the collaboration with Guerrilla on Killzone. One thing that everyone agreed internally is that making something from a different game IP in our universe, this is quite fun. It has challenges because again, we are very, very cautious about our fantasy. So we want to be able to explore those possibilities. We got super excited with Killzone. We want to do more for sure. I can't tell you more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our devs are players, they play so many games. Obviously Warhammer 40,000 is something that a lot of guys internally love to death. So the devs are discussing, the devs are proposing stuff, and the hype is building. So these are discussions internally that we are having. Warhammer 40,000, I can't really tell you. Maybe. Who knows? We'll see!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-gamecube-controller-not-compatible-with-switch-2-games-just-gamecube-classics/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s come to the Nintendo community’s attention that the new Nintendo GameCube Controller—set to launch with the Switch 2—can is only usable with the limited collection of classic GameCube titles via Nintendo Switch Online.</p>



<p>A cool bonus during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> was the announcement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-online-adds-gamecube-games-to-nintendo-switch-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameCube integration for Switch Online</a>. Nintendo’s library of retro games is growing even more, thanks to GameCube additions. Legendary properties, including Pokémon Stadium and Super Mario Sunshine, will make up the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack.</p>



<p>A line of official Nintendo GameCube Controllers are coming too—featuring the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-is-for-gamechat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C-Button</a>. But if you’re looking to grab this super-special controller, take heed of its limited capabilities.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It’s very restrictive. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The “Classic Nintendo GameCube games are coming to Nintendo Switch 2!” video on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoUK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo UK YouTube channel</a> features an explainer of the new GameCube Expansion features. We also get treated to a look at the new GameCube controller, but a small-print message toward the end is easily missed. </p>



<p>At <strong>2:13</strong>, a message at the top of the screen reads: “<strong>The controller is only compatible with Nintendo GameCube—Nintendo Classics.</strong>“</p>



<p>The controller isn’t expected to be cheap, and it’s also quite exclusive. It’s only: “Available for Nintendo Switch Online members” on the My Nintendo Store. Unless you’re a die-hard Nintendo or GameCube fan or collector, this is another big cost for a piece of hardware only usable with a small handful of games.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Between the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price of the Switch 2</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-nintendo-switch-2-games-cost-physical-digital-game-prices-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of the games</a>, and even a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2s-paid-tutorial-welcome-tour-almost-made-a-player-fall-asleep-at-nintendo-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid tutorial</a>, the Switch 2 costs soon adds up. Are you desperate for a new GameCube controller? Or is this one step too far, and you’re looking to use the new Pro Controller or Joy Con 2?</p>

While the game at its core is a turn-based game about logic and chance, I really wanted it to be set in a ‘proper’ fantasy world that has a backstory, an underlying logic, and a consistency. Yes, you’re rolling dice and collecting items, but the visuals are hand-drawn and would also work in a <a title="Genres > Visual Novel [549 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a> or roleplaying game.”</p><p>Resolution Gmaes CEO Tommy Palm added, “Innovation is at the core of what we do here at Resolution Games, and we’re very proud of the work we’ve done for immersive games. But there’s plenty of fun to be had outside of headsets too. When Henrik and David put the first prototype of GrimKeep in my hands, I simply couldn’t put it down. Good games should be shared with the world – whether they’re pioneering new ways to play like our recently released Spatial Ops, or they’re putting exciting new twists on familiar formulas such as <a title="Genres > Roguelike [313 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> deck builders.”</p><p>Watch the announcement teaser trailer below.

                <p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-ref-id="5000-671287">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> promotional image posted by Nintendo Korea may have accidentally revealed one of the game's major characters--a young girl who looks suspiciously similar to Pauline.</p><p>As picked up by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/nintendo-accidentally-leaks-an-unrevealed-donkey-kong-bananza-character-that-might-unironically-have-huge-lore-implications-for-the-mario-universe/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, the character's appearance in the Nintendo Korea box art has led to a flurry of speculation as fans try to decipher what role Pauline might play in the game, and whether her young appearance means Bananza is in fact a prequel.</p><p>For those less familiar with the extended Mario/Donkey Kong universe, Pauline is a side character who first appeared as the iconic damsel in distress in the 1981 Donkey Kong arcade game. While she disappeared from the games for some time after that, she reappeared as the mayor of New Donk City in Super Mario Odyssey, and has since become a regular character in Mario spin-off titles.</p><p>Now, it appears that she may be returning to the Donkey Kong series, according to a piece of cover art that was posted to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/kr/switch2/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Korea</a> website. The art shows what looks like a younger Pauline holding onto Donkey Kong's tie as he smashes his way through the ground.</p><p>The art has now been replaced on the Korean site with an image that swaps Pauline for the crystalline purple sidekick known as Odd Rock. This has only led to further speculation after eagle-eyed fans noted that Pauline, in the original image, was wearing a purple crystal bracelet that seems to resemble Odd Rock.</p><p>The appearance of Pauline as a young girl has led fans to question the game's place in the Donkey Kong timeline, with some suggesting that Bananza could be a prequel game starring the original Donkey Kong--the character we've known as Donkey Kong from Nintendo's recent games is the grandson of the original, though The Super Mario Bros. Movie refers to him as his son. </p><p>Other theories speculate that the mystery character is actually Pauline's daughter, that Odd Rock is taking on her appearance, or that she has been aged down by some kind of magic or device.</p><p>Donkey Kong Bananza will launch on July 17, when we'll find out for sure if the mystery girl is Pauline, and what role she'll be playing in the world of Donkey Kong.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-red-faction-gorilla/1100-6530581/" data-ref-id="1100-6530581">Donkey Kong Bananza Hands-On: Red Faction Gorilla</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">Switch 2 Hands-On: More Of The Same, But It Can Still Surprise You</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World Hands-On: The Conservative Switch 2 Gets A Bold Sequel</a></li></ul>

			<p>New Monster Hunter Wilds mods released online this week introduce some custom quests that allow hunters to fight against a monster that has yet to be officially available in the game.</p>
<p>The first of these new mods is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/1678?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Custom Event Quests</a>, which introduces four challenging custom quests against an Alpha Doshaguma and its pack, Zoh Shia, Arkveld, and Arch-tempered Rey Dau, a new powerful variant of the apex predator of the base game, which is already included in the game files, and will only be made available officially later this month. Some of these quests feature some illegal values that could create issues down the line if CAPCOM decides to crack down on this type of mod, so beware.</p>
<p>The second Monster Hunter Wilds custom quests mod that's now available online is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/1686?tab=description">Arena All Monsters Permanent Quest</a>, which adds custom Event Quests for all monsters currently available in the game, including the aforementioned Arch-tempered Rey Dau, except for Jin Dahaad and Zoh Shia, which do not work properly in the Wounded Hollow arena due to their unique mechanics. As for the Custom Event Quests mod, using this mod could lead to issues down the line.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> review.</a></p>
