		<p>34BigThings has announced that Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is going to be released on February 6th, with the game coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2. The release date has been revealed as part of a new gameplay trailer for Carmageddon: Rogue Shift which shows some of the different vehicles and weapons that can be used in the carnage of the races.</p>
<p><iframe title="Carmageddon: Rogue Shift - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uW2iH9gNDxY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Last month, 34BigThings gave details five <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/carmageddon-rogue-shift-first-five-vehicles-have-been-detailed/">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift’s vehicles,</a> which are shown in the above trailer. The Eagle GT is considered a good allrounder muscle car, while the Clunker is a tankier option. &nbsp;The Firecracker Turbo will be for players who value speed over everything else, and the SQR-NE55 is one that balances all the vehicle stats. Finally, the Hawk GT has high offensive capabilities and acceleration, but sacrifices handling as a result.</p>
<p>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift is set in the year 2050, where the streets are overrun by the Wasted at night, meaning humanity has to shelter in their homes during the dark. That is unless they are a street racer looking for money, prestige, and a chance to get off of the planet to safety. Carmageddon: Rogue Shift will feature 15 vehicles, a mix of FWD, RWD, and AWD, with each having their own unique stats. There are also 13 weapon classes from shotguns to rocket launchers, and these are upgradeable too. Players will also have access to over 80 perks to further customise vehicle loadouts as they race across tracks that have a dynamic weather and day and night cycle. All campaigns will be unique as the events are randomly generated, with players taking part in races to boss battles as progress is made. In each event players will sustain damage so it planning routes to the shops dotted around will also be key, to make repairs and buy upgrades.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rockstar chalked up the first win in their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/rockstar-responds-to-union-busting-accusations-says-fired-employees-were-leakers/">dispute with fired employees</a>, as a UK tribunal rejected the former developers their request for interim pay while pursuing allegations of union busting by the studio.</p>
<p>Denying this request, Judge Frances Eccles said that the staff would have had to demonstrate a “pretty good chance of success” in proving they were fired for unionisation efforts, and that they had not managed to do so at this early juncture. Of course, the case will still go ahead and it’s possible for further arguments and evidence to come to light.</p>


<p>A Rockstar spokesperson issued a statement saying:</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">“The Glasgow Employment Tribunal has rejected the union’s application for interim relief. We welcome the decision, which is consistent with Rockstar’s position throughout.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">“We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing.”</span></p>

<p>The IWGB shared a statement with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-employees-at-gta-6-studio-rockstar-denied-interim-pay-by-uk-tribunal-union-highlights-firms-flimsy-grounds-for-defence">Eurogamer</a>:</p>
<p>“We are emerging from this hearing, having now had a glimpse of Rockstar’s flimsy grounds for defence, feeling bolstered in our claims that these firings were not just deeply unjust but also plainly unlawful.</p>
<p>“[…] the judge stated in her ruling that: ‘There was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings'”. The IWGB additionally said Rockstar had broken multiple procedural guidelines with its firing of the affected employees. This included the lack of disciplinary meetings, employees being unable to appeal “until six weeks later”, and zero evidence of an investigation.”</p>
<p>However, further background from the ruling includes that the judge noted the volume of non-employees featured within the IWGB Discord ground, including someone who had written press articles about video games, that some fired employees were based in Canada and thus could not have been union members, and that there were those expressing support for unionisation that were not dismissed.</p>
<p>People Makes Games were in court and shared details of the evidence that was demonstrated.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rockstar vs. Union: We Went to Court and Saw the Evidence" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dnuipPQDd_w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Per Chris Bratt’s account of viewing the hard copies of submitted evidence, it seems that one employee was fired for expressing that they were not working ‘crunch’ hours yet, about generative AI being approved for use by legal, and further stuff that was branded as so top secret by Rockstar’s barrister that they didn’t want it read out loud in court. Except it could easily be read and is valid to be reported on by PMG. This included complaints over difficulty to book time off, including mention of a team’s staffing size, mentioning 32-player online sessions (which would be an increase in lobby size from 30 players in the current GTA Online).</p>
<p>These details were claimed to be “highly confidential and commercially sensitive” in Rockstar’s arguments, whose stance is that any kind of leaked detail, even seemingly innocuous like if you were in crunch or not, can have a dramatic impact, such as with the billions of dollars wiped off Take Two’s valuation after announcing GTA 6’s delay to November 2026. For that reason, Rockstar fired employees immediately.</p>
<p>So, Rockstar has won this day in court, but there’s a long way to go and a variety of different outcomes. The judge will have to decide, once further arguments and evidence has been presented, whether these dismissals were fair and meet the threshold of “gross misconduct”, and from that point, whether this was Rockstar engaging in union busting.</p>
<p>It’s entirely possible that we end up in a middle ground where Rockstar is able to dodge the union busting charge, but still get dinged for unfair dismissal. In the meantime, unionisation efforts at Rockstar can continue with all those employees that Rockstar couldn’t find cause to dismiss, and certainly will be much wiser about keeping their conversations within a clearly closed group.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> is starting 2026 in a similar fashion to how it started 2025. The Assassin's Creed company shut down its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">Leamington-based studio in January 2025, laying off <strong>185 people</strong></a>. To start 2026, between the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/">shuttering of <strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong></a> and yesterday's layoffs at <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/"><strong>Massive Entertainment</strong> and <strong>Ubisoft Stockholm</strong></a>, Ubisoft has already laid off an estimated <strong>126 developers</strong>. Now, that number is definitely a little higher, as a new report from <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-ubisoft-laying-off-staff-at-abu-dhabi-studio">Game Developer</a> reveals layoffs have continued at <strong>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the report, cuts at the Abu Dhabi studio began back in December 2025 and have continued into the new year, with some staff, like former art director <strong>Daniel Kovacs</strong>, sharing on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniel-kovacs-206b2316a_i-took-some-time-to-reflect-after-being-impacted-activity-7401147823175639040-t3WE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">his personal LinkedIn page last month that he had been laid off</a>. "<em>I took some time to reflect after being impacted by the recent layoffs at Ubisoft Abu Dhabi, and at the risk of sounding a bit sentimental, I just want to say how grateful I am for these three and a half years</em>," wrote Kovacs.</p>



<p>"<em>Signing off as Ubisoft Abu Dhabi's social media manager as I've been affected by the recent layoffs</em>," added <strong>Raiza</strong> <strong>Veridiano</strong>, who also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7400125428398485507-ZyjH?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared the news that they had been laid off last month</a>. "<em>I’m incredibly grateful for the 4 years and 9 months I’ve spent here.</em>"</p>



<p>Other former staff, like game support specialist <strong>Zohaib Shafiq</strong>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zshafiq_opentowork-opentowork-ubisoft-activity-7416772579723665409-Xgp6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared the news only yesterday,</a> indicating that the cuts have continued into 2026. "<em>Due to recent restructuring, my journey at</em> <em>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi is coming to an end after an amazing 4.5 years. It’s been a chapter full of learning, collaboration, and growth; I am incredibly grateful for the experiences, challenges, and people that made this chapter so meaningful.</em>"</p>



<p>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi has a team of 60 people, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/locations/abu-dhabi">according to its website</a>, which also calls the studio "<em>Ubisoft’s Regional Hub for games development</em>" in the area. The Abu Dhabi team is responsible for titles like Growtopia and CSI: Hidden Crimes.</p>



<p>According to Ubisoft, these cuts are part of  "<em></em><em>company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs</em>." Last year, the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">established a new branch with <strong>Tencent</strong> called <strong>Vantage Studios</strong></a>, which is now the home to the company's most significant IPs, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>

Doing so nets you a number of goodies, including extra cars and access to two "premium expansions".</p><p>Perhaps more interestingly for our purposes, however, a pre-order also advertises the possibility of playing <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>"four days early starting May 15th", which would seem to point to an official release date of May 19th.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Whoopsy-daisy, eh, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>?</figcaption>

<p>As a reminder, <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>was officially unveiled by Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-6-revealed-ps5" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ede297d-3bdf-4de5-b00a-3479b4a33aab" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">during the Tokyo Game Show last year</a>. It'll be coming to PS5, just like its predecessor, although that release will be happening later than the game's PC and Xbox Series X|S arrival.</p><p>We don't know a great deal about <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>yet, although we do know the game will be taking place in Japan, and that it'll feature a number of real-world locations, including Tokyo, Hokkaido, and the imposing Mt. Fuji.</p><p>We also know that <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>is one of the reasons that Turn 10 Studios decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-motorsport-updates-ending" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="28526b82-2c26-415e-b595-273f31c08d2e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">can further content updates</a> for the more hardcore <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, since the studio is assisting Playground Games with development on the simcade racer.</p><p>It's likely the release date for <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>will be revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-22nd-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2c8e5f78-4ad9-43f4-bd6b-54b81360f376" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">next week's Xbox Developer Direct</a>, where we'll also get more information about the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="48a951d3-c822-4051-88a7-e27a8ee10808" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">long-delayed <em>Fable </em>reboot</a> and Game Freak's <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>.</p>
<p>Assuming this info is correct, then <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>will be launching on May 19th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2483190/Forza_Horizon_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/forza-horizon-6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, with a PS5 launch to follow later in 2026.

            <p>I’m going to keep this one as succinct as possible, because every word is causing me psychic damage. Former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick has alleged that an ongoing lawsuit accusing him of rushing Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-buying-activision-blizzard-for-69-billion">$69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> to avoid the fallout from company-wide sexual misconduct allegations was, in fact, secretly orchestrated by noted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-have-laid-off-8-of-their-global-workforce-since-their-restructuring-began">layoff manufacturer</a> Embracer Group to boost sales of Embracer’s own games.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bobby-kotick-activision-microsoft-ap7-lawsuit-embracer-group">Game File</a>, a Swedish pension fund called Sjunde AP-Fonden, aka AP7, filed the lawsuit in Delaware’s Court of Chancery in 2022. The suit names Microsoft, Activision Blizzard and the company’s former board of directors, including Kotick, as defendants. It claims that Kotick
"hastily negotiated a merger to protect himself, agreeing to sell Activision to Microsoft for $95 per share", after being faced "with increasing pressures to leave Activision."</p>
<p>Back in 2022, Activision Blizzard were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-lawsuit-alleges-harassment-and-retaliation-at-activision-blizzard">weathering fresh allegations of sexual harassment in the workplace</a>, having already been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-alleged-culture-of-sexual-harassment-and-discrimination">taken to court the previous year</a> by the State of California on the charge of cultivating "a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women". Activision-Blizzard ultimately <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-will-pay-55m-to-settle-sex-discrimination-lawsuit">settled the latter court case for $55 million</a> in December 2023, shortly after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">the finalisation of the Microsoft Activision Blizzard buyout</a>, with the State commenting that "no court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations [of] systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard".</p>
<p>Kotick himself has been accused of being aware of the harassment allegations, and failing to take appropriate action. In November 2021, Activision-Blizzard employees launched a petition <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-blizzard-employees-demand-ceo-bobby-koticks-removal-amid-several-new-abuse-allegations">calling for his removal</a>. A group of shareholders also subsequently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-activision-blizzard-shareholder-group-want-bobby-kotick-removed">demanded his resignation</a>. Kotick has denied any wrongdoing. In February last year, he also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-blasts-fake-lawsuits-against-us-and-riot-games-claiming-union-workers-used-harassment-claims-to-drum-up-members">blasted the lawsuits as “fake”</a>, arguing that they were orchestrated to drum up support for unions.</p><p>Which brings us back to this Swedish pension fund business. In October 2025, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Chancery Court <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/activision-officials-must-face-claims-over-microsoft-takeover-judge-rules-2025-10-03/">said</a> that shareholders in AP7’s proposed class action could pursue their "core" claim that Kotick and other Activision directors breached their fiduciary duties, while dismissing other claims against Microsoft. If you want to get into the weeds of it, here’s McCormick's <a href="https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=385520">83 page memorandum opinion</a> submitted in January 2025.</p><p>

In a recently filed ‘answer’ to the AP7 lawsuit, Kotick and his lawyers are claiming that the ulterior motive here is “to exert collateral harm on Activision” and to help Embracer, who are also headquartered in Sweden.
</p><p>Kotick and his legal team claim that the suit “was apparently aimed to help pave the way for Embracer to increase its foothold in the California market at the expense of Activision, making it more difficult for Activision to recruit talent and expand through [merges and acquisitions] activity of the sort that Activision relied on to grow historically.”</p>
<p>Among Kotick’s justifications for this argument is that AP7’s view chairman Emma Ihre was an executive at Embracer at the time of the lawsuit’s filing. As such, he thinks the lawsuit was filed to mount a “collateral attack on Activision [that] also appears to be tied to Embracer’s desire to boost sales of its games while leaving Activision hamstrung in the development of its own games that competed against Embracer’s titles”.</p>
<p>Game File has obtained a response from Embracer, who are playing the whole thing for giggles. “We are humbled of Mr Kotick’s remark that we were competing with Activision on this level [sic],” an Embracer Group representative told the publication. “Nevertheless, perhaps difficult to accept for Mr Kotick, but we did not and do not need any help from a Swedish pension fund in competing with Activision.</p>
<p>“Thus, in short, there were no coordination or collaboration between Embracer and AP7 relating to any of Mr. Kotick’s statements,” the statement concludes. “No agenda or instructions were directed from Embracer via Emma Ihre or directly to AP7.”</p>
<p>At the time of the AP7 lawsuit's filing, Embracer were <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/24/embracer-group-deal-collapse">attempting to cobble together a $2 billion funding deal with Savvy Games</a>, a company funded by the Saudi Arabian government. The collapse of that deal would precipitate an enormous round of cuts, job losses, cancellations and closures over the following few years. I wouldn't put it past Embracer to 'do a Peter Thiel' on Kotick and Activision, but it seems like they had plenty other fish to fry.</p>

            <guid>1405735</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> gets a seasonal delay just when fans have started souring on the game. The makers of Warhammer have tried gen AI and they’re “just not excited about it.” Eidos Montreal is making an AAAA blockbuster. Hopefully, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skull-bones-review-xbox-1851281255">it’s better than <em>Skull and Bones</em></a>.</p> <p>Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. It’s 2026 and all my kids want to do is play <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>. And not even the 2025 remaster but the original 2009 game on Xbox (thank you backwards compatibility). They have not touched any of the games I bought them for Christmas. This is why the console gaming industry is struggling.</p>

 <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s next update gets a one month delay</h2> <p>The best-selling new shooter has been slipping. Community sentiment has been less than great. REDSEC in particular has Some Problems. It sounds like EA wants to take some extra time to recalibrate things before launching season 2. “During our ongoing development, we’ve continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2,” it wrote in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-and-redsec-season-1-january-update">a new blog post this week</a>.</p>

 <p>Season 2 will launch on February 17 instead of January 20. That will be four months with only two new maps. And if the new maps aren’t <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/ea-delays-battlefield-6s-next-season-a-month-to-further-polish-and-refine-season-2-and-the-only-words-i-want-to-hear-next-are-bigger-maps/">Big Maps</a>, then none of it will probably matter anyway. <em>Call of Duty</em> is no longer an annual release, it’s an ongoing platform. <em>Battlefield 6</em> is trying to do that on the fly at launch and it’s clearly being stretched thin. Instead of a one-month delay to make good on its current content promises, it probably needs to dig in and focus on servicing the one part of <em>Battlefield 6</em> that matters most. At least for now. And that’s probably Big Maps.</p>

 <h2>Eidos Montreal’s next game will be “AAAA” and made in Unreal Engine 5</h2> <p>That’s according to a recent developer resume discovered by <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2011272772551614666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a>. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/edios-montreal-aaaa-game/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a> that this project has been in development as far back as 2019 and has cost the studio a lot of money. It’s definitely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-deus-ex-game-pitched-by-eidos-montreal/">not</a> a new <em>Deus Ex</em> game either, sadly. The Embracer-owned Canadian studio shipped<em> Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</em> in 2021 and hasn’t launched a solo project since. It has done co-development on several Microsoft projects in the years since, including <em>Grounded 2</em> and<em> Fable</em>, while also facing multiple rounds of layoffs.</p>

 <h2>The makers of <em>Warhammer</em> promise absolutely no GenAI</h2> <p>Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree addressed the controversial tech in a recent earnings meeting following a very lucrative quarter. “We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet,” he said, as reported <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech">by<em> IGN</em></a>. “We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI-generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorized use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.”</p>

 <h2>Steam Machine verification will be easier than for Steam Decks</h2> <p>“One easy rule of thumb is that if your title is Verified on Steam Deck, it will be Verified on Steam Machine,” Valve designer Lawrence Yang told <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/steam-machine-verified-requirements-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-says-valve"><em>Game Developer</em></a>. He says creators hoping for a “Steam Machine Verified” badge can expect “fewer constraints” than on the current handhelds. Hopefully that means a smoother process but also badges that are actually <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-verified-valve-ff7r-avowed-ninja-gaiden-2000637741">more useful than some of the current Steam Deck ones</a>.</p>

 <h2>The <em>Blood of Dawnwalker</em> will let you sex vampires, probably</h2> <p>I missed this detail from the dark fantasy RPG’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa0S8c_gp7M">New Game+</a> showcase interview (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3s-former-lead-quest-designer-says-of-course-there-is-romance-in-upcoming-vampire-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-you-can-expect-to-build-relationships-with-characters/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>), but romance will be a part of the upcoming game from <em>Witcher 3 </em>devs.</p> <p>. “There are romance options, yes,” director Mateusz Tomaskiewicz said. “We didn’t delve deep into with <em>whom</em> yet, and I’ll leave that for the future to talk about. However, yes, you can expect to build relationships with characters.” I think folks are sleeping on this one a bit. It’s one of my <a href="https://kotaku.com/2026-game-releases-most-anticipated-batman-gta-6-wolverine-2000656197">most anticipated releases of 2026</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-layoffs-division-3-massive-tencent-2000659368">Ubisoft devs who were politely asked to lay themselves off last year now forced to do it in latest round of cuts</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-game-quest-vr-facebook-deadpool-sanzaru-twisted-pixel-layoffs-2000659376">The teams behind<em> Deadpool</em> and other VR games were laid off by Meta as it chases AI</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><em>Anthem</em> is dead and fans are still grieving what might have been</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

<p>Cygames has announced in a new statement that it will not implement GenAI in its products without prior notice and has apologised to the community. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Cygames announced that it will establish an AI studio, which is a subsidiary to develop and provide AI-based services and tools. The AI studio would participate in the research and development of its own models to offer services and tools for production sites. The studio has now backtracked on this, stating that GenAI will not be used to produce art for their products. </p>







<h2 id="h-cygames-releases-new-statement-on-ai-studio">Cygames Releases New Statement on AI Studio</h2>



<p>In a new statement on their official <a href="https://x.com/Cygames_PR/status/2011423096465682934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), Cygames has addressed the blowback they have received from the community since announcing their AI studio. The statement confirms that the “art produced from generative AI isn’t used in their products and will not be implemented “without prior notice.” The company added that it holds people who love games and the “dignity, passion, and heart of creators and artists” in the highest regard. </p>



<p>The company also stated that the art for all the current Cyfames and other products has been created by the “technical know-how and manual work” of their staff members. Cygames has apologized for the grief and anxiety it caused to the community and has pledged to “honor creators, as well as champion the free expression of people.”</p>







<p>In other news, NVIDIA’s CEO has stated that the constant negativity surrounding the AI industry is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-ceo-says-ai-doomer-narrative-is-hurtful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extremely hurtful</a>”. Additionally, Nintendo has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/my-mario-marketing-did-not-use-ai-images-nintendo-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied claims</a> that generative AI was used in promotional images for its new “My Mario” toy line.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Publisher Microids and developer Fishing Cactus have confirmed that Corsairs Battle of the Caribbean remake will be releasing on May 18th for PC. The previously announced console versions are nowhere in sight however. Corsairs Battle of the Caribbean was originally released in 1999, tasking players with controlling the Caribbean sea using might and trade as a privateer. A new gameplay trailer has been released so you can see the game in action.</p>
<p><iframe title="Corsairs – Battle of the Caribbean – Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bg7sZr-phRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Corsairs Battle of the Caribbean will have a campaign mode in which you can play as five factions, each with their own ambitions. There is also online multiplayer for up to four players, and a brand new Skirmish mode so players can jump right into the action. The multiplayer has an Elo-based ranking system so players are matched with people similar to their own skill and rank. Players can build fleets made up of 12 different ship, including unique faction ships, and use three different types of ammo in naval battles. There is also boarding between ships with player’s soldiers consisting of three classes, with those being Gunner, Agile, and Tank.</p>
<p>In Corsairs Battle of the Caribbean players will also need to manage trade across the territory, and keep sailing to find new resources and islands to claim. Cities will provide additional bonuses for players as trade grows, and new upgrades for the fleet can be discovered through sailing around the map and completing quests. A price for the game is yet to be confirmed.</p>

			<p>It appears that a leak in <strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong> may have inadvertently revealed the launch date of <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong> well ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-playground-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next week's <strong>Xbox Developer Direct show</strong></a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011429719800180925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to X user XBOXF10</a>, a pop-up ad revealed that the game will launch on May 19, although early access will start four days early for those who pre-purchase the Premium Edition or get the Premium Upgrade. </p>



<ul>
<li><em>Pre-order now and get a pre-tuned and exclusive Ferrari J50 in Forza Horizon 6!</em> <em>Discover the breathtaking landscapes of Japan in over 550 real-world cars and become a racing Legend in Forza Horizon's biggest open world driving adventure yet.</em></li>
</ul>

<li><em>Car Pass</em></li>



<li><em>Time Attack Car Pack</em></li>



<li><em>Italian Passion Car Pack (coming post-launch)</em></li>



<li><em>2 Premium Expansions (coming post-launch)</em></li>
</ul>



<p>This date follows <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-targeting-h1-2026-launch-window-says-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an earlier rumor from insider Nate the Hate</a>, who claimed that the British developer was targeting the <strong>first half of 2026</strong> for Forza Horizon 6. The studio's other big game slated to appear at the Xbox Developer Direct, <strong>Fable</strong>, might then target a Fall 2026 window.</p>



<p>The sixth entry in the Forza Horizon franchise comes on the heels of the incredible success and acclaim of the fifth installment, which registered <strong>over 50 million players</strong> to date and performed very well even on PlayStation 5. Forza Horizon may have started as an open world arcade spin-off of Forza Motorsport, but over time, it far surpassed Turn 10's more regular race-based simcade series. Now, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Turn 10 layoffs</a>, it is believed that the developer based in Redmond, Washington, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-dev-turn-10-support-forza-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has essentially become a support team for FH</a>, at least for the time being.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and will feature <strong>a fantastic open world experience for fans</strong>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased a while ago by the developers</a>. It will be released for PC and Xbox Series S and X consoles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as per the original announcement</a>, with a PlayStation 5 version coming at a later date.</p>

<p>Kotick's reasoning regarding Embracer's desire to hurt Activision involves the two companies releasing what he considers to be similar games at similar times, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-island-2-release-date-moved-to-april" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d3ec9c2d-facf-442a-974a-8f5fa5d1240e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead Island 2</em></a>, <em>Insurgency</em>, and <em>Remnant 2 </em>(which Kotick says have similarities to <em>Call of Duty </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-blizzard-deep-dive-breaks-down-diablo-iv-release-date-trailer" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8a9c064f-770c-42b5-a1a7-d8ea93c11706" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Diablo IV</em></a>, respectively).</p><p>The lawsuit in question was brought against Kotick and his former companies in 2022 by AP7. It alleges that Kotick rushed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-staying-as-ceo" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ca03cb11-0e22-42e4-bb57-2d2f082d977b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sale of Activision Blizzard to Microsoft</a> in 2021 in order to dodge the consequences of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-employee-speaks-out-about-sexual-harassment" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="377898d2-bd83-41f5-9293-7f03ef9de06f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">numerous</a> sexual harassment <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-after-new-explosive-allegations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="37853141-4a88-4074-b619-4cc60e7ad075" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">allegations</a>.</p><p>Indeed, Kotick goes one step further and suggests that the "narrative" of those allegations was "false", and that AP7 was aided in its lawsuit by "activists" who "brought false and wholly unsubstantiated claims against Activision and Mr. Kotick".</p><p>Embracer, for its own part, was quick to respond to The Game File and Totilo. The company told Totilo that it was "humbled" by Kotick's claims, but that it "did not and [does] not need any help from a Swedish pension fund in competing with Activision". Claws out, eh?</p><figure role="group">

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anthem-single-player-offline-mode-bioware-ea-mark-darrah-2000659773</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><span>been officially wiped off the face of the Earth</span></a><span> for two days now, and Mark Darrah, an ex-BioWare producer who worked on both the ill-fated looter shooter and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569"><span>the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>series</span></a><span>, has released a nearly four-hour postmortem on the game and how it all went wrong. If you care at all about the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136"><span>RPG developer’s odd live-service detour</span></a><span>, it’s a pretty interesting watch, but there’s one thing of note we’re going to focus on: </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>could have had local servers that would have allowed it to live on even after EA had abandoned it.</span></p>  <p><span>At the end of Darrah’s video, he starts to give a soft pitch for how </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>could live on and maybe even see a bit of that fabled </span><i><span>No Man’s Sky </span></i><span>redemption arc that BioWare was hoping for when it announced it was revamping the game in 2019.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>He says that his idea would “conservatively” run EA about $10 million, and if that should sell more than 400,000 copies, it could actually work out for everyone involved. To start, he suggests moving </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> to current-gen consoles, rather than leaving it on PS4 and Xbox One, and using locally-hosted servers. Apparently, BioWare had local servers running in a development environment “up until a few months before launch,” and while he doesn’t know if they still work, the code is there and can be recovered.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The reason you do this, it pulls away the cost of maintaining this game,” Darrah says. “So rather than having dedicated servers that are required for the game to run, you let the server run on one of the machines that’s playing the game.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Hearing that BioWare, at some point in development, had the tools in place to save </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> from its fate actually gives me a mix of sadness and anger for the devs and fans who wanted the game to go on existing, even if it wasn’t going to be supported with future updates. BioWare’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-servers-still-up-shut-down-bioware-ea-1851785618"><span>reasoning for shutting the game down without an offline mode</span></a><span> was that it was “designed to be an online-only title,” but now we know that there were, at one time, tools in place to remove all the server costs from EA’s shoulders, and that it just chose not to use them. Killing the game off is certainly the more straightforward approach, but it’s also far more destructive.</span></p>

 <p><span>Darrah goes on to suggest that most of the hypothetical $10 million budget would go into making </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> a single-player game, which would require creating AI party members to accommodate the game’s combat encounters which are balanced for multiple players. He suggests either promoting some of the NPCs to companions, or just making three to five new characters that could go through the existing story alongside you with their own stories. He even says that if EA really wanted to do it for cheap, go with the bare minimum amount of new party members by capping it at three so they just fill out your four-player party.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“If you can do those two things and turn the local servers on and give them a little bit of their own storytelling, that what you have essentially reverse-engineered is a BioWare game without romances with a decent BioWare-style story with companions that can be played as a single-player game,” Darrah says. “And I think there are a significant number of people who enjoy BioWare stories who did not play </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> because they didn’t want to play a multiplayer looter shooter who would be interested enough in seeing that story to pick that game up and give it a try.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As nice as it sounds, Darrah says he has no faith that EA would do something like this, even if it were a relatively cheap lift compared to running the servers forever. It’s annoying to know that </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>could still have lived on in some form, but at least we know definitively that EA and BioWare pissed in our ears and told us it was raining.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ImperialHal Faces Controller Ban 12 Hours Before ALGS Championship]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/imperialhal-controller-ban-algs-championship/</link>
            <guid>1405708</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Apex Legends Global Series 2026 Championship is set to take place tomorrow in Sapporo, Japan. Today, one of the game’s most prolific pro players, ImperialHal, revealed that his first-choice controller was <strong>banned </strong>and won’t be usable in the event. For a pro player, that’s one of the most critical changes to make at the last minute.</p>



<p>ImperialHal, who flies the Team Falcons banner, posted on social media that it has ‘got to be a joke, surely.’</p>







<h2 id="h-imperialhal-s-zd-ultimate-controller-is-banned">ImperialHal’s ZD Ultimate Controller is Banned</h2>



<p>The ALGS regulators have decided to <strong>ban </strong>ImperialHal’s chief controller, the ZD Ultimate, just one day before the ALGS Championship tournament takes place in Japan.</p>



<p>The ZD Ultimate is a lesser-known controller that boasts stacks of bonus features, including tri-connectivity, ultra-low latency, trigger switches, back paddles, extra buttons, and an RGB light strip. It currently costs $99.99 from the manufacturer.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, ImperialHal explained why it’s banned:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Because it has wireless capabilities that can be changed at any point via mobile and macro stuff that can’t be disabled.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also pointed out that during the Esports World Cup, ‘multiple players’ used controllers with similar functions, and they weren’t banned.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>My controller gets banned the day before 2 million Dollar tournament 😂😂😂</p><p>Gotta be a joke surely</p></div>— Falcons ImperialHal (@ImperialHal) <a href="https://twitter.com/ImperialHal/status/2011411052261699976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>ImperialHal has been competing in the Apex Legends space since 2019, making a name for himself while flying the TSM flag, but in 2024, he picked up a spot on Team Falcons’ developing roster. In 2023, he secured the top spot at the ALGS Championship, and a year later, hit a second-place finish at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>Last year produced a third-place finish at the ALGS Championship, so this is something of a redemption opportunity for the 26-year-old esports pro.</p>







<p>Do you think it’s right that the organizers banned ImperialHal’s controller so close to the start of the tournament? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>Actor Ron Perlman is known in Fallout fandom for delivering the now-iconic voice line, "War. War never changes."

It wasn't until some time later that Perlman became aware of the phenomenon that became Fallout.</p><p>"A year and a half later, I get a call, 'Hey, you remember Fallout?' No. 'Well, there's a second one.' I go, 'Why?' ‘Because the first one went through the f**king roof,'" he remembered thinking. "I go, 'Really? Cool.' Do the second one, then the third, fourth, and now it's a whole brand."</p><p>Also in the interview, Perlman said he's never played the Fallout games or spent any time with the development teams. "No. I did a couple of lines, got my $40 and my sandwich, and went home," he said.</p><p>Crucially, Perlman did not disclose what kind of sandwich he got for his work on Fallout.</p><p>Fallout 2 was developed by Black Isle Studios, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-developing-and-publishing-fallout-3/1100-6102349/" data-ref-id="1100-6102349">Bethesda swooped in and bought the rights to the series in 2007</a> and made Fallout 3, released in 2008, as its first entry in the series.

		<p>Season 2 of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> has been delayed until February, Battlefield Studios has announced, with an extension to Season 1 coming to fill the extra month wait.</p>
<p>Season 2 will now start on 17th February, with Season 1’s battle pass extended up until that point, and with new weekly challenges and a Frostfire Bonus Path of content being added on 27th January.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Season 2 Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylKfsTB3uKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The team writes, “During our ongoing development, we’ve continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2.”</p>
<p>So what’s coming to fill out Season 1? Well, an update is set to land on 20th January with fixes and stability improvements, and this will be followed on 27th January by the Frostfire Bonus Path of battle pass. This includes a weapon package, soldier skin XP Boosts and more for those with the premium Battle Pass, while a free track will include Hardware XP Boost, vehicle skin, player card customisation, and the like.</p>

<p>The Bonus Path will work alongside and not instead of the Season 1 Battle Pass, so you still have more time to round off any more unlock tiers you need or want. However, all Bonus Path Points are earned through Weekly Challenges, and not all Weekly Challenges reward those points. Expect people to get annoyed by this.</p>
<p>A little further away, a Valentine’s Day event is coming with duos, there’s more daily login rewards and double XP weekends to flesh everything out.</p>
<p>This has all been rather disappointing for the community on Reddit, with a fairly doom-laden outlook on how much content has been added to the game so far. There’s been comparisons to the map output of Battlefield 4’s paid DLC, memes about map design, critiques of cosmetics and general concern for the future of the game. EA struck a huge and symbolic victory over Call of Duty with Battlefield 6, but they need to keep up the game’s support in order to cement their status as a true rival and counterpart.</p>

			<p>There’s a game for the original DS called Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime. In it, you play as a slime and have to load up your cool tower with all sorts of powerful ammunition to beat other towers. It’s one of those games that stands out in my memory as not only being a lot of fun, but also a concept I don’t feel like has been revisited since. DuneCrawl has a couple of mechanics that feel in the same spirit, and while the whole package is a bit uneven, that did put a smile on my face.</p>
<p><iframe title="DuneCrawl - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Im0Hx3iLVE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>DuneCrawl is an open-world adventure game where you get to sit on top of a big old crab and fight other big crabs using cannons, yourself, and anything else you find. That’s only part of it though; it’s really more of a game where you explore dungeon-like areas to rescue people, find treasures, and progress the story. I wish the game was more weighted towards the cool crab fights, but alas, here we are.</p>



<p>Combat on the crab is loading up the cannons, firing, and using a shield to bounce things back. You can load yourself or another player in the cannon for cool boarding shenanigans though, and that’s wonderfully silly in a Sea of Thieves kind of way.</p>

<p>Non-crab combat is fairly standard hack and slash stuff. You get a bunch of weapons you can cycle through for different effects, which weirdly includes health potions, and have to try and hit stuff before stuff hits you. It’s fine, really, and some of the weapons are pretty cool, but it’s not a standout example of this genre.</p>
<p>The world is nice though. I enjoyed exploring things both on and off-crab, and there’s a solid sense of humour running through a lot of the quests that’ll help keep you entertained. The idea of this world that has issues with pottery and worships crabs is just kind of fun, and it helps make it feel genuinely unique very early on. I just wish the gameplay felt a little bit more special as well. It all just feels okay for the most part, and I want more than that from my games.</p>

<p>DuneCrawl is at its best with friends, which is really the saving grace here. As is so often the case, running around all of this stuff with a friend or two really elevates everything and ends up being a genuinely entertaining time. After all, where else can you load a friend into a cannon and then fire them off into the distance just for fun? That’s the kind of experience that we’re all after, and sure, it can be used to actually play the game as intended, but it’s nice to mess around with too.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		DuneCrawl is an interesting game that blends together giant crab combat, dungeoneering and multiplayer shenanigans. It's fun enough, but I really wish it did a little bit more with the more unusual aspects of its game design.&nbsp;	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Former <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> CEO <strong>Robert Kotick</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-stepping-down-end-of-year-matt-booty-taking-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down from his role</a> on <strong>January 1, 2024</strong>, following the company's merger with <strong>Microsoft</strong>. During his last few years in the gaming industry, Kotick's figure became quite controversial, especially when a report from the Wall Street Journal alleged that <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-aware-harassment-verbal-abuse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the executive had long been aware of the harassment issues within the company</a> and even <strong>faced personal accusations of wrongdoing against employees</strong>. In one incident, he was reportedly verbally abusive towards an assistant, even threatening to have her killed in a voicemail message, though an Activision Blizzard rep claimed the message was just hyperbolic. In another instance, Kotick reportedly threatened and then fired a flight attendant on his private jet after she accused the pilot of sexual harassment.</p>



<p>That's exactly where the lawsuit filed four years ago by the Swedish pension fund <strong>Sjunde AP-Fonden (AP7)</strong> takes off against Kotick, alleging that the executive (and the Activision Blizzard Board with him) <strong>rushed the sale to leave behind the scandals and the subsequent liability</strong>. AP7 additionally claims that the Board breached its duty of loyalty by choosing a quick exit over the company's long-term value, arguing that the sale price of $95 per share was too low because it was negotiated while the stock was artificially depressed by the ongoing scandals. Furthermore, Kotick himself was entitled to a golden parachute worth hundreds of millions of dollars as part of the deal.</p>



<p>The former Activision CEO begs to differ, as you would expect. To begin with, Kotick <strong>emphasized that Microsoft's offer of $95 per share represented a 45% premium over the stock price at the time of the announcement</strong>. In recent filings, the former executive noted that Activision's actual performance after 2022 fell short of nearly all long-term targets, indicating that the sale was a timely and beneficial exit for investors.</p>



<p>But the latest twist came in the most recent filing (available for reading <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/980767428/Sjunde-AP-Fonden-v-Activision-Blizzard-Inc-Et-Al-2022-1001-No-100949828-Del-Ch-Jan-12-2026?language_settings_changed=English" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Scribd</a>), in which Kotick accused another game publisher, the <strong>Embracer Group</strong>, of somehow colluding with AP7. Here are a few quotes:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Plaintiff’s Board also has ties to a rival video game company, Embracer Group AB (“Embracer”), a Swedish gaming company that directly competes against Activision. The Vice Chair of Plaintiff’s board, Emma Ihre, served as an Embracer executive at the time that this lawsuit was filed in November 2022. As far as Mr. Kotick is aware, Plaintiff made no effort to address this clear conflict of interest, and neither did Embracer.</em></li>



<li><em>Embracer was facing extreme economic turmoil in Fall 2022, and was grasping at ways to reverse the decrease in its stock price that occurred throughout 2022. The lawsuit did just that: Embracer’s stock price spiked immediately after AP7’s complaint was released to the public on November 9, 2022—by 15% from November 9 to 11, 2022. Indeed, the increase from November 9 to 10 was the largest one-day increase in Embracer’s stock price for the entire 2022 year. This benefitted not only Embracer, but also AP7 and Ms. Ihre (who owned significant shares in Embracer).</em></li>



<li><em>Notably, this lawsuit was timed to occur just days before Embracer would be announcing disappointing financial results and the delay of its most highly anticipated game, Dead Island 2. Embracer announced these results and the delay of Dead Island 2 on November 17, 2022, which Embracer knew would exert downward. </em></li>



<li><em>[...]this Delaware lawsuit was apparently aimed to help pave the way for Embracer to increase its foothold in the California market at the expense of Activision, making it more difficult for Activision to recruit talent and expand through M&amp;A activity of the sort that Activision relied on to grow historically. </em></li>



<li><em>Just two days before AP7 initiated this action, on November 1, 2022, Embracer announced that it was kicking off a “new PR and Communications team” based out of Livermore, California.</em></li>



<li><em>The fact that this PR team was kicked off just two days before this suit was filed does not appear to be a coincidence—bad press for Activision would have made it easier for Embracer in its new “PR and Communications” campaign. By contrast, through its false claims in this suit, AP7 painted Activision as a company with poor corporate citizenship.</em></li>



<li><em>This collateral attack on Activision also appears to be tied to Embracer’s desire to boost sales of its games while leaving Activision hamstrung in the development of its own games that competed against Embracer’s titles. Not only were multiple Activision games delayed or cancelled after this lawsuit was brought (including Odyssey, Overwatch 2 Hero Mode, and Call of Duty Warzone Mobile), but Embracer had a number of contemporaneous releases that it knew would compete against Activision’s titles.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>According to Kotick and his lawyers, the contemporaneous releases were <strong>Dead Island 2</strong> and <strong>Call of Duty Zombies</strong>, <strong>Insurgency</strong> and <strong>Call of Duty</strong>, <strong>Remnant 2</strong> and <strong>Diablo IV</strong>, and <strong>Warlander</strong> and <strong>Overwatch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>Embracer has since refuted Kotick's allegations. In a statement <a href="http://substack.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.TAzxpN3N72uz4fiy4KCyTdWBaHxkiRkE6tTsAwmhXlA?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to Game File</a>, they said:</p>



<p><em>Embracer did not and does not need any help from a Swedish pension fund in competing with Activision. There was no coordination or collaboration between Embracer and AP7 relating to any of Mr. Kotick's statements. No agenda or instructions were directed from Embracer via Emma Ihre or directly to AP7.</em></p>



<p>We'll keep an eye on the developments of this lawsuit, which is far from over. Stay tuned.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-youre-prime-and-a-gamer-asus-rtx-5070-plunges-to-near-record-low-on-amazon-2000659476</link>
            <guid>1405675</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re preparing to put some of your holiday cash to work by building yourself a gaming PC, stop. Before you lock yourself into a mediocre graphics card that will mess up your whole rig, check out this Amazon deal on <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/">the ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5070 card, which is just $540 for a limited time</a> (down from $609). That goes double if your dream DIY rig is going to be on the smaller side — we’ll explain why.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Anyone who’s ever built a gaming rig from scratch or performed a massive overhaul to upgrade an older machine knows — or should know — the two things they absolutely cannot compromise on: the processor and the graphics card. The latter can be a real challenge if you’re looking to build a compact yet seriously potent rig, because graphics cards that are small in size also tend to be small in performance. But the ASUS RTX 5070 is a 2.5-slot model that’s small form factor-friendly, which means it can fit in a smaller chassis while packing enough power to blow away virtually all the other SFF-ready cards.</p>
<h2>Secret Weapon</h2>
<p>The RTX 5070 is basically a unicorn: powerful enough for modern gaming, cool and quiet enough for daily use, and trim enough to slide into smaller chassis without fuss. That’s a sweet spot for any DIY gamer, especially when you consider the&nbsp;12 GB of GDDR7 memory, you’re looking at a card that beats up mid/high-tier textures and takes their lunch money.</p>
<p>That extra memory isn’t just a numbers flex that looks good on a spec sheet — it actually matters when modern games start leaning hard into photoreal lighting and other next-gen features that lesser cards won’t be able to keep up with. Coupled with PCIe 5.0 support, you’re set up for a smooth ride across a wide swath of titles and workloads for years to come.</p>



<h2>Keep It Cool</h2>
<p data-start="4446" data-end="4979">A compact rig chassis runs the risk of heat issues — smaller container, less area for heat dissipation. Or smaller components running super-fast — and super-loud — cooling units. The RTX 5070 has ASUS’s Axial-tech cooling design, with a tighter fan hub and longer blades that push air more effectively while keeping noise in check — perfect for a living-room PC that doesn’t sound like a hurricane.</p>
<p data-start="4981" data-end="5403">Thermals and noise aside, performance is where this card quietly flexes. For 1440p and even 4K gaming with some settings toggled just right, the RTX 5070 handles itself admirably. Games look great with DLSS tricks up your sleeve, and the triple display outputs (DP 2.1 + HDMI 2.1b) mean you can drive multiple panels without the headache of wrestling with adapters and dongles.</p>
<p data-start="4981" data-end="5403">With ASUS packing the RTX5070 with advanced features and Amazon knocking the price down for a limited time to just $540, the SFF-ready ASUS PRIME GeForce RTX 5070 is the deal you can’t afford to ignore if you’re planning on building your own rig or upgrading an old one.</p>

<p>The Creator Codes scheme is a way for communities to give back to their favorite streamers while simultaneously supporting a new release. Hytale also has a Creator Codes program, and this guide lists various creators and their codes.</p>



<p>Certain individuals are recognized as a creator for a game. This associates that personality with said title, and fans of the game and creator can support both. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-pvp-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale</a> features the Creator Code, and you can scroll down for information on creators, codes, and how to redeem them.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot Games Congratulates Hytale Launch Six Months After Canceling It]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/riot-congratulates-hytale-six-months-after-canceling/</link>
            <guid>1405666</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In June 2025, Riot Games canceled Hytale and <strong>closed down </strong>Hypixel Studios, marking the end of the dreams of Minecraft fans worldwide. Hytale, the chief Hypixel project, had been in development for <strong>ten years</strong>, but it was cited as being ‘overly ambitious’ and failed to hit quality expectations, and was wiped from the slate by Riot Games.</p>



<p>Four months later, in November, Simon Collins-Laflamme, the founder of Hypixel, acquired the Hytale IP from Riot Games and brought back to the grind to make the game a reality.</p>



<p>Hytale entered early access <strong>yesterday</strong>, and Riot Games was quick to praise the game’s launch in a move that some have dubbed ‘ironic at best.’</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-skyrockets-despite-earlier-cancelation">Hytale Skyrockets Despite Earlier Cancelation</h2>



<p>Hytale was never supposed to see the light of day after it was <strong>canceled </strong>by Riot Games a little over six months ago. The game was deemed past the point of saving, and Riot shut the project down after suggesting it was unsustainable and too costly to push on with.</p>



<p>Yesterday, that all changed as Hytale hit the early access launch window many believed would never come.</p>



<p>Hytale skyrocketed up the charts, hitting a peak viewer count on Twitch of 440,000 users, numbers comparable to the launch of an AAA game. It’s not without its flaws, but it’s already being appreciated by those who spent years following the game’s development.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Riot Games, which decimated Hytale mere months ago, congratulated the early access launch:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Congrats on early access 👊</span></p></article></div>







<p>In response, the Hytale team commented: ‘Thank you for helping bring Hytale home.’</p>



<p>But fans were quick to criticize the situation:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘This is like thanking your captor for beating you up.’</li>



<li>‘Hytale exists in spite of Riot, not because of them.’</li>



<li>‘Genuinely, how did they help lmao’</li>
</ul>



<p>Perhaps Riot Games is kicking itself for canceling what is now being regarded as one of the biggest indie releases of the last few years.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re playing (and enjoying) Hytale.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Shoot A Plane monthly redeem codes to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash and much more.</p>



<p>Shoot A Plane is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-forge-codes/">Roblox</a> survival experience that assigns players to either hit flying targets or miss their chance at victory. The player must eliminate the planes to win, while the planes must escape your missile launcher to survive. The game also features multiple upgrades for your missile and launcher, however, to use them, you must purchase them with Cash.</p>



<p>The Roblox game is all about growing your missile to increase your Power, improving your targeting accuracy, getting Upgrades, and boosting your score. Generally, to become the best, you’ll not only need the finest missile launcher but also a way to progress without spending hours. That’s when you should redeem the active Shoot A Plane codes, as they can be redeemed for Cash, which is essential for upgrading your equipment and taking down bigger planes.</p>







<h2 id="h-active-shoot-a-plane-codes">Active Shoot A Plane Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li>WEARESORRY: 7k Cash</li>



<li>NEWYEAR: 7k Cash</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-shoot-a-plane-codes">Expired Shoot A Plane Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes, so players can redeem the active codes safely.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-shoot-a-plane-codes">How To Redeem Shoot A Plane Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shoot A Plane Codes Codes Redemption Menu | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Follow these steps to redeem all the active codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Shoot A Plane in Roblox</li>



<li>Find the button labelled ‘Codes’ on the far left side of the screen and click on it</li>



<li>Type or paste an active code in the text-box</li>



<li>Click on the button labelled ‘Redeem’ to claim the freebie</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-shoot-a-plane-codes">Where To Get More Shoot A Plane Codes</h2>



<p>Shoot A Plane codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Shoot A Plane Discord server, which has a dedicated channel where new codes are posted first, and the Crazy Launchers Roblox Group where developers announce updates and milestones for this popular missile-launching game.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

The LAPD said the victim was not injured in the incident, which is now under investigation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 59-year-old former star of hit TV series 24 was released after paying a $50,000 bond, and is now due at Los Angeles Superior Court on February 2.

In film, he starred in The Lost Boys (1987), Stand By Me (1986), and The Three Musketeers (1993).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sutherland voiced and provided motion capture for Big Boss/Venom Snake in Metal Gear Solid 5, replacing David Hayter in a decision that proved controversial with fans. Explaining the decision, Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima said "I wanted Snake to have a more subdued performance, expressed through subtle facial movements and tone of voice rather than words.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sutherland has a history of arrests. In 2007 he was sentenced to 48 days in jail for driving under the influence and violating probation. Two years later, Sutherland was arrested for head-butting Proenza Schouler founder Jack McCollough at the Mercer Hotel in Manhattan. The charges were dropped after Sutherland and McCollough issued a joint statement in which he apologized.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sutherland appeared in last year's Stone Cold Fox alongside Jessica Jones star Krysten Ritter.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> is getting a very short update in the middle of January, but it's one that was needed to nerf the power of two weapons: the Trigger 'Nade and Kettle. Embark Studios acknowledged the issues with both when laying out the details for Arc Raiders' 1.11.0 update.</p><p>According to <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-11-0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Embark</a>, the Kettle's maximum fire rate of 600 was "only realistically reachable by players using macros." In other words, it played right into the hands of cheaters who were using outside software for an unfair advantage in the game. After the update, the Kettle can only reach a maximum fire rate of 450.</p><p>Similarly, Embark noted that the Trigger 'Nade was dominating PvP battles and players used it more than any other grenade in the game. The nerf for this weapon is limiting the radius of damage to the center of the explosion and increasing the time it takes to detonate to 1.5 seconds to give opposing players a chance to react when it's deployed. This was also meant to make it harder for players to use it as a "trigger-in-air" grenade.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4635190-arcraidersabyssset2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635190" data-ratio="0.51384615384615" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4635190-arcraidersabyssset2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635190"></a><figcaption>The Abyss set cosmetics from Arc Raiders.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4635190-arcraidersabyssset2.jpg"></figure><p>The Abyss cosmetic set is also coming to the game with this update. The description notes that "the scyring techno-eye stapled to the front of its helm might not be operational, but it's certainly intimidating."</p><p>Embark acknowledged previous reports about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">Arc Rangers selling 12 million copies</a> and celebrated by giving all players who joined before January 13 the "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-players-get-this-free-pickaxe-as-game-passes-12-million-copies-sold/1100-6537346/" data-ref-id="1100-6537346">Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool</a>." Additionally, Embark has promised to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-new-anti-cheating-measures-are-coming-soon/1100-6537291/" data-ref-id="1100-6537291">introduce more anti-cheat measures</a> to Arc Raiders in the near future.</p><p>The complete notes for Arc Raiders' January Update 1.11.0 are included below.</p><h2>Arc Raiders January Update 1.11.0 Notes</h2><h3>Kettle</h3><ul><li>Dev note: Reduced fire rate from 600 to 450. The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favors using 3rd party software.</li></ul><h3>Trigger 'Nade</h3><ul><li>Dev note: Trigger 'Nade currently dominates PVP encounters, and players favor picking it over all our other grenades. This nerf aims to make it less usable as a "trigger-in-air" grenade, whilst keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb. Damage falloff has been rebalanced to concentrate the damage closer to the center of the explosion, and deal less damage further away. The delay between triggering the grenade and it detonating, has been increased from 0.7s to 1.5s, giving players more time to react, and making it harder to time the detonation in air.</li></ul><h2>Bugs</h2><ul><li>Fixed a key card exploit that allowed players to keep room keys after using them.</li><li>Lighting has been lowered in some areas on Stella Montis Night Raid making flashlights and listening more relevant.</li></ul>

As part of the preliminary hearing, Rockstar's legal representative mentioned a "top-secret element of GTA 6," which he said was so confidential he didn't feel confident speaking about it out loud, instead asking the judge to read it in private.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Despite the supposedly top secret nature of this evidence, People Make Games was able to make an appointment to view the documents, as Rockstar had not applied for reporting restrictions to be placed upon the evidence. He has now reproduced those messages in full, showing an apparent conversation by a fired employee who was frustrated at not being able to book time off after Rockstar started cracking down on the number of employees being granted leave at one time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuipPQDd_w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dnuipPQDd_w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"They mentioned the large session we did today 'being difficult to do,' but that was 32 players, not sure how that was difficult," the former employee wrote in the Discord, after mentioning they worked in a team of 56 people. "Sounds like 'you have multiple studios of QA testers, surely someone can manage to organize a 32-player session and let people have their time off' ..." added another employee who was also fired in the wake of the messages.</p><p>Rockstar's argument refers to these messages as "highly confidential and commercially sensitive information relating to the content and features of an unannounced online service," saying that the information constitutes a leak because it "discussed the specific number of online players planned for this new service."</p><p>Presuming the 32-player number is the planned cap for GTA 6's online play, the revelation isn't exactly a bombshell, as the current iteration of GTA Online already allows 32 players to a server. The new information seems to contradict <a href="https://fravilys.medium.com/que-pr%C3%A9pare-rockstar-games-pour-la-prochaine-version-de-gta-online-b1d1c91ec329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rumors</a> that circulated last year, suggesting that an upgraded edition of GTA Online would allow 64 players at a time, with the intention of eventually supporting 96-player servers.</p><p>Some of the other messages that were submitted by Rockstar as grounds for the firing are also interesting, not because they contain important information on GTA 6, but for what the studio is classifying as "gross misconduct." In some cases, it's employees discussing crunch, concerns about generative AI, or changes to certain perks provided by Rockstar.</p><p>In one case highlighted by People Make Games, it's a single, 15-word message: "Nothing that I've heard in North QA! Will keep you updated if that changes ofc." Rockstar's grounds for dismissing this employee was that he "included information about working patterns in his team," which could be used by those familiar with the industry to guess what stage of development GTA 6 was at.</p><p>The preliminary hearing was only the first stage in the court battle between Rockstar and the union, with the judge asked to rule on whether Rockstar should be made to provide "interim relief" for the fired employees while they await the results of the full trial. The request for interim relief was rejected by the Glasgow Employment Tribunal, but the full trial is still to come.</p>
