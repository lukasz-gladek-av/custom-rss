            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-trophy-hunters-rivalry<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Concord&nbsp;</em>players are resorting to some pretty drastic measures in order to secure the game's Platinum trophy ahead of its shutdown on Friday, new reports have revealed.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1831041419756388429" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted by X (formerly Twitter) user Radec</a>, players are heading into&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s Rivalry, a five-versus-five round-based gameplay mode, and immediately hurling themselves off cliffs and ledges in order to quickly complete matches.</p>
<p>Radec points out that this technique is "the fastest way to earn XP for the Platinum". As a reminder, several of&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s trophies require you to reach certain Reputation thresholds, and doing so requires XP, which you can earn simply by finishing games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/concord-rivalry-trophy-hunters-shootout.jpg?itok=BnyFZhgC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/concord-rivalry-trophy-hunters-shootout.jpg?itok=6axdjdMD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Concord&nbsp;</em>players are having some fun repeatedly unaliving themselves for the Platinum.</figcaption></figure><p>Independent verification that this is definitely happening in&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>Rivalry games <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-players-are-jumping-off-cliffs-in-game-as-they-desperately-grind-for-the-platinum-trophy-before-shutdown" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also comes from IGN</a>, so it looks like if you want a proper, regular game of&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>before it shuts down, you'd better pick a different mode.</p>
<p>Of course, the jury's out on whether or not this tactic will actually work. In a <a href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1831054519167529019" rel="noopener" target="_blank">followup post</a>, Radec says they've been using this tactic "for an hour and only went from Level 44 to 45". That Platinum might be out of your reach, even if you start dying as efficiently as possible in&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>now.</p>
<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;Sony announced yesterday that&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, a first-person hero shooter released just under two weeks ago, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">will be shutting down on both PC and PS5 on Friday</a>&nbsp;so as to allow the studio to think about what to do next with the game.</p>
<p>The publisher also confirmed that all players who have purchased&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>will receive refunds, whether that's on PlayStation or PC, so you won't have wasted any money if you were one of the apparent handful of people who bought it.</p>

<p>This is normally where I'd say&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>is available on PC and PS5, but, well, it isn't. The game can no longer be purchased on either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2443720/Concord/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002695" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, and the jury's out on whether it will ever return. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>After <a href="https://x.com/sharkeatsman/status/1826122649963245882">eight years in development</a>, it took less than a month for <em>Concord</em> to die.</p></div><p>Yesterday, Sony announced that the game, which only launched on August 23rd, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc">would be shutting down on September 6th</a>. Ryan Ellis, game director at developer Firewalk Studios, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">said that</a> it “didn’t land the way we’d intended.” That seems to be an understatement: the game is going offline, full refunds are being issued, and it’s unclear if <em>Concord</em> will ever come back. While the speed at which the game ended may be surprising, the fact that it happened isn’t. <em>Concord</em> is just the latest victim of publishers chasing the live-service trend with outsize expectations. Unfortunately, there’s only so much room — and <em>Concord</em> was too generic to find space.</p><p>It’s easy to see why so many studios and publishers want in. The longevity and profitability of games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>League of Legends</em> are impressive. They’re also nearly impossible to replicate. <em>Concord</em> follows other high-profile failures like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22274771/ea-wont-continue-anthems-post-launch-development">EA’s <em>Anthem</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">Xbox’s <em>Redfall</em></a>. Both instances saw beloved single-player studios — BioWare and Arkane Austin, respectively — pivot to persistent multiplayer games with disastrous results. (Each lasted longer than <em>Concord</em>, but still had relatively short lives in terms of updates.)</p><p>There are a few obvious errors specific to <em>Concord</em>. It was a hero shooter, a genre with entrenched competition like <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>, making it a tough sell. Its reach was limited to the PS5 and PC. Worse still, it was a full paid release in a space where free-to-play is the standard. But <em>Concord</em>’s biggest problem was that it was just fine. With generic characters and frustrating map design, there was nothing to make it stand out among so much competition. In the live-service space, where games are designed to suck up as much of your time (and money) as possible, being an average game isn’t enough. There’s only so much of both to go around, and pulling players away from their existing time sinks is not an easy thing. When you’re up against <em>Fortnite</em>, you need a hook.</p><div><p>We’ve seen this play out with the few games that have managed to carve out some longevity in the space. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/13/17003856/sea-of-thieves-game-preview">Rare’s pirate sim <em>Sea of Thieves</em></a> is unlike any other virtual world, while Riot cleverly saw room in the <em>Counter-Strike</em> market when it launched <em>Valorant</em>. These experiences also keep expanding their presence in terms of both content and platforms; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079090/hi-fi-rush-ps5-xbox-release-date"><em>Sea of Thieves</em> hit PS5 this year</a> while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173544/valorant-ps5-xbox-release-date-riot"><em>Valorant</em> made its debut on consoles</a>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24071317/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-video-game-great"><em>Helldivers 2</em> came out of nowhere</a> to offer a distinct co-op experience. Other smaller games have similarly managed to generate buzz with a notable gimmick, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24211078/spectre-divide-preview-mountaintop-fps-game">the dual bodies in <em>Spectre Divide</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23991851/the-finals-embark-studios-launch-xbox-ps5-pc-steam-available-now">the game show theme of <em>The Finals</em></a>.</p></div><div><p>But those kinds of sustained hits are rare, and <em>Concord</em> will almost certainly not be the last to be buried in the live-service graveyard. It probably won’t even be the last from Sony itself. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/23/23735274/sony-playstation-new-franchises-live-service-games-business">The company previously announced plans to go hard in the space</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953640/sony-pushes-back-its-live-service-game-ambitions">then scaled those ambitions back considerably</a>. (Those early plans were the main impetus for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/15/23220335/bungie-sony-acquisition-complete-official-done">spending so much on <em>Destiny</em> developer Bungie</a>.)</p></div><p>It’s becoming increasingly clear that there’s no such thing as too big to fail when it comes to a live-service game, which means that a lot of the high-profile releases coming out soon are not sure things. That includes the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23735830/bungie-marathon-sci-fi-pvp-extraction-shooter">Bungie’s <em>Marathon</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24113437/marvel-rivals-trailer-netease-pc-mcu-disney">NetEase’s <em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game">Valve’s <em>Deadlock</em></a>. (If you think Valve is immune to failure, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314103/valve-ending-development-artifact-tcg-dota-2">might I point you to the existence of <em>Artifact</em></a>.) They might not shut down as quickly as <em>Concord</em>, but it’s not inconceivable that any of them could fail to garner enough sustained attention.</p><p>In the post announcing the game’s closure, Ellis said that <em>Concord</em>’s developers were going to “explore options, including those that will better reach our players.” Most likely, that means the game might appear again in the future, with a free-to-play structure and maybe some gameplay tweaks. But addressing those core problems will be a lot tougher than that. When every game wants all of your time, players need a really good reason to give up their favorites. That’s what <em>Concord</em> was missing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following the announcement that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord will be closing down</a> just a mere two weeks after launch, players have resorted to just jumping off the maps in order to grind XP and get their Platinum trophy.</p>



<p>Posted to X (formerly Twitter), user @realradec showed how most, if not all, Concord games in the mode ‘Rivalry’ now play out.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to the user, this is the fastest way to gain XP and, thus, the fastest way to get the Platinum trophy before the game shuts down.</p>



<p>PlayStation will take the game offline on September 6 and “explore options, including those that will better reach our players”.</p>



<p>The PlayStation blog reads that “Concord sales will cease immediately and we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased the game for PS5 or PC.”</p>

			<p>Releasing only a PlayStation 5 Pro digital model would help Sony keep the system's price down, as the Japanese company seems to be struggling to contain production costs.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry commented on the yet-to-be-revealed new system and a recent<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/"> leak</a> that suggests a digital model could be the only one to get released. Looking at the split between the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation 4 Pro, which was close to 80 to 20 in favor of the base model, there's little doubt that the PS5 Pro is going to be a niche model. As such, it's unlikely Sony will bifurcate the market after having done so already with the base model.</p>
<p>In addition, the system's price is definitely going to be a concern. Sony seems unable to keep the production costs low, as suggested by the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-gets-price-rise-in-japan-increasing-by-90/">base model's price increase in Japan</a>. In this regard, releasing only a PlayStation 5 Pro digital model would help the company keep the price low and make the system more enticing, given how the price is undoubtedly going to be higher than that of the base model due to the hardware under the hood.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a PlayStation 5 Pro digital model only release could create some other issues with the enthusiast crowd it targets, which often gravitates toward physical copies of games. The system is most likely going to be compatible with the detachable disc drive, but that would add to the cost of upgrading. Still, Digital Foundry finds that releasing only a digital model would make more sense.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>Reliable insider Jeff Grubb recently revealed on <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jeffygrubbgrubb/post/C_d1YEePg7G?xmt=AQGz8EE7MeQtLaXWuYFR61AQVYELKGUkC0sncHaT1Rk4IVU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Threads</a> that an announcement for the Destiny mobile game, ‘Destiny Rising’ could come “soon”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, a known gaming news source, Kurakasis, stated that Destiny Rising is “an unannounced Destiny mobile game” developed by Bungie. Jeff Grubb added to the news, saying that this information is indeed “real” and that “not many people from Bungie” are working on it. Grubb said that the game might receive an announcement soon.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the comment section, Grubb was also asked whether he knew what type of game Destiny Rising would be. He replied, “It’s going to be Destiny on mobile but with a lot of changes”. Grubb provided an example, stating that the developers will include “hero characters” instead of allowing players to build their own characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bungie announced large-scale layoffs and restructuring in July 2024, letting go more than 200 employees. During that time, information about ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-was-bungies-payback-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Payback</a>‘ popped up. Payback was supposed to be a completely different style of game set in a Destiny universe but was cancelled a few months ago to allow Bungie to work on more “imminent games.” It seems that this Destiny mobile game was one of the titles that survived the restructuring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-regrets-guitar-hero-destiny/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer</a> recently admitted that he regrets passing on games like Destiny and Guitar Hero. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-cheat-seller-appeal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the court has denied the cheat seller’s appeal</a> over the $4.3 million win to Bungie. What are your thoughts on the Destiny Mobile game? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

Those with a penchant for pageantry can leverage a delightful and downright deadly set of tools to craft their very own dungeons. Others with a taste for adrenaline can then run the gauntlet solo or in groups of up to four players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although the title will launch with a set of courses cobbled together by developer Glowmade–the UK studio founded by Media Molecule and Lionhead veterans in 2015–</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>King of Meat</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will ultimately need players to buy into the idea of crafting their own devilish dungeons if it wants to go the distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer at Gamescom 2024 about how Glowmade intends to stack </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>King of Meat's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Create Mode–which is where players can turn their own dreams into somebody else's nightmares–with tools that compel and delight, studio co-founder and creative director Jonny Hopper explains the team had a simple mantra.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A consistent visual language is key to empowering creators">A consistent visual language is key to empowering creators</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It has got to be hard to make something bad," says Hopper. "There's a midline, which is where most of us can sit, where we can put stuff together and make a level. It has to be simple to make the basics and hard to make something that's unworkable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hopper notes Glowmade sought to create a toolkit that felt "tactile." That means every tool or item that players can leverage should behave in ways that meet, rather than subvert, expectations. "What we're doing is giving [players] this tactile toolkit built around visual things," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are a bunch of menus, but when you place down a spinning spike trap it does what you expect it to do every time. That's how we approached visual language. You know, a button is a button. We chose to go down the route of 'here's your button, it's a pressure pad,' rather has making players construct all the logic to make their own pressure pad."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In honing that visual language, the studio looked to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario Maker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for inspiration. Fellow Glowmade co-founder Mike Green feels that project worked because players approached it with an innate understanding of how items and abilities function in a Super Mario level. That subconscious knowledge ensured it felt approachable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In our first game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>WonderWorlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we had a really comprehensive logic system. You could do so much in that game, but it made it inherently more complicated. If you wanted to make a door, for instance, you couldn't just put a door down. You had to build a thing out of wood and then put rotators on it," says Green.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But you know, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Maker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, everyone knows Super Mario so we all know what a green pipe does and how the enemies work. What I like about it is there's just this consistency. It doesn't matter what level you go into, because you know how these things behave."</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xPmUWMUKWQY?si=eRzdKwK9QYA69Rvf" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Green explains Glowmade is using the same technology it deployed in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>WonderWorlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to rapidly prototype gameplay tools and objects. That means the team can iterate quickly, building new items before reviewing and refining them to create "better versions" that can be coded up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those impending additions are approved or rejected based on whether they're enjoyable to use and feel intuitive. Some of the most obvious red flags during that vetting process is the demand for specificity and complexity over simplicity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I remember there have been conversations where there has been a very specific request, which is very much a case of 'I need to solve this incredible edge case of a problem that I have invented and I would like this tool to do it," says Hopper.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At that point we need to step back because that's just adding complexity for a tiny, tiny edge case. Does it really solve a problem, or is it just helping you in [this one instance]? We need to keep that balance between what a professional level designer wants in an all-encompassing level design tool and what we should offer to everyone else."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite their insistence that UGC tools need to be universally approachable, Hopper acknowledges there'll be groups of players who simply want to create–and others who purely want to play. With that in mind, he suggests </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>King of Meat</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> needs around 10 percent of players to really commit to creation in order to deliver sustainable success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If 10 percent of the player base [choose to create] then that's great. If 10 percent of what they make is any good, then you've basically got more levels than you're ever going to need," he says. "You don't need 100 million players for that to be viable. That's our success metric."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

        <p>Project hit $100k crowdfunding goal in 10 minutes.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> fans have pledged more than $2m to ensure a new, official board game version of CD Projekt Red's role-playing game is made.
</p>
<p>
The crowdfunding campaign for Cyberpunk 2077 - The Board Game on <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/cyberpunk-2077-the-board-game">GameFound</a> obliterated its initial $100k goal in just 10 minutes and four seconds. As of writing, almost £2.1m has been pledged, and counting. 16 days of the campaign remain.
</p>
<p>
This tabletop version of Cyberpunk 2077 sees you taking on missions and follow branching, replayable stories as V, Panam, Jackie or Judy across Night City. It's been created by Game On Board, the company that previously made a couple of official The Witcher board games, with support from CD Projekt Red itself.
</p>

 </a>

<p>
A standard edition of the Cyberpunk 2077 board game will set you back $79 (about £60) and include stretch goals that would otherwise cost extra once the base game is launched. 
</p>
<p>
A fancier deluxe edition costs $139 (about £106), upgrades various tokens from cardboard to plastic, and includes deluxe stretch goal rewards.
</p>
<p>
Back in the world of video games, work has begun on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiplayer-being-considered-for-cyperpunk-2077-sequel-says-cd-projekt">may finally include the franchise's long-awaited multiplayer option</a>. Don't expect Cyberpunk 2078, or whatever the game ends up being called, for a while though. The bulk of CD Projekt is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-the-witcher-4-will-enter-full-production-soon">currently focused on its upcoming fourth major The Witcher game</a>, which is set to release first.

<p>As with previous months, five percent of Choice membership will go towards charitable causes.</p>
<p>This month, Humble is supporting Action Against Hunger, which is committed to ending world hunger. "The organisation works to save the lives of malnourished children while providing communities with access to safe water and sustainable solutions to hunger," Humble explains. "With 30 years of expertise in emergency situations of conflict, natural disaster, and chronic food insecurity, ACF runs life-saving programs in some 40 countries benefiting seven million people each year."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQGddOAZGLU">learn more about Action Against Hunger here</a>.</p>
<p>(And a quick note - Eurogamer has covered Humble for years, but the company is now also a part of the same parent company, IGN Entertainment.)</p>
<p>As for the games themselves, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is an action-adventure game from Eidos-Montréal which gives us an original take on Marvel's oddball spacefaring family. "Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is enjoyable enough at times, but weighed down by a deluge of unnecessary systems and bullet-sponge combat," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-breezy-but-unfocused-action">Eurogamer's Guardians of the Galaxy review</a>.</p>
<p>For more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guardians-of-the-galaxy-developer-addresses-square-enix-sales-expectations-how-it-wanted-to-create-a-new-marvel-ip">I spoke with the team behind Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a> back in 2022 all about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s sales expectations and how it wanted to create a new Marvel IP.</p>
<p>Coral Island, meanwhile, is a tropical farm life sim heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>'s more modern take on the genre. However, it sets itself apart with a focus on ocean exploration and conservation.</p>
<p>Coral Island was published by Humble Games, and developer Stairway Games recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/coral-island-developer-blames-humble-games-layoffs-for-leaving-switch-port-in-a-place-of-uncertainty">blamed layoffs at the publisher for leaving its Switch port "in a place of uncertainty"</a>.</p>
<p>Next up, You Suck at Parking - which incidentally is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-titles-for-september-include-big-rigs-in-space">leaving Xbox Game Pass later this month</a> - tasks players with parking their car as quickly as possible, regardless of any style or finesse. "It's a hot race against the clock as you drift, cruise, and go airborne over 250 frustratingly fun, wild levels," the game's description boasts.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-dlc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon%E2%80%99s-dogma-2-dlc-may-be-in-the-works-judging-from-some-recent-findings.971565/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-dlc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Dragon's Dogma 2 DLC expansion seems to be in the works, and its reveal could be edging closer, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported on the Gaming Leaks subreddit, there's been some behind-the-scenes activity on Steam. According to the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2054970/dlc/">Steam Database</a>, there have been some encrypted DLC updates that have only been affecting the game's main app, as well as multiple updates for an unnamed DLC pack that has been in the works for at least 5 months.</p>
<p>With this type of behind-the-scenes activity, there's usually something cooking, so it could definitely be the same for Dragon's Dogma 2. Still, without an official announcement, we should take everything with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>This month's Tokyo Game Show would be the perfect avenue to show how the Dragon's Dogma 2 project is still alive following the departure of its director <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/">Hideaki Itsuno</a>. The first game's Dark Arisen expansion, which turned the whole game into a memorable action RPG with tons of tweaks and improvements, was directed by Kento Kinoshita, who also worked as a lead designer on the sequel, so there's a good chance that he will lead the further development of the game and its potential expansions, and possibly a new entry in the series, from now on.</p>
<p>In its current state, Dragon's Dogma 2 is definitely not the game that should have been. While the experience is fine for the most part, it feels more like a reboot of the original than a proper sequel, with some under-baked features that fail to reach their full potential. You can learn more about the game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">review.</a></p>

</div><div>



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a> was a game of stark and severe Brutalist aesthetics, and also, a game about playing scales with a trumpet, walljumping with a baseball bat and using a leafblower to fly. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-a-brutalist-city-with-climbing-axes-and-a-trumpet-in-this-great-free-indie-game">Snuck out over winter 2022</a>, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.</p>
<p>Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Technically, this isn't news. Straftat has been public knowledge since last year - find some unedited WIP capture from March below. But this is the first time I've laid eyes on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2386720/STRAFTAT/">the Steam page</a>, and I adhere to the epistemological position that reality only exists when it is observed. As such, I consider it entirely logical and coherent to assert that Straftat has <em>only</em> existed as of the writing of this news post. You're welcome.</p>

<p>There are several schools of thought on the name. One is that Straftat is German for "criminal offence", perhaps a reference to, like, an edgy Berlin club of some kind. There are certainly many offences being committed in the game, from crimes against windows (Straftat is part of the unofficial defenestration genre recently re-popularised by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tactical-breach-wizards">Tactical Breach Wizards</a>) to crimes against fashion.</p>
<p>Another take on the name is that it's an abbreviation of, like, "Strafe Tactics", a Modern Warfarelike techno-flourish that seems out of synch with the game's bleached and swooping vibes. And thirdly, there's the argument that Straftat is "Tat Farts" written backwards, which is the speculation I favour - it certainly describes a lot of free-to-play live service games. I'm not clear how Lemaitre Bros are funding development of Straftat, but then again, I wasn't clear how they funded development of Babbdi either - will they be selling those hats and hairdos or allowing player-trading, a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike </a>and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo</a>? Whatever their approach is, I hope it carries on working.</p>
<p>I really like the pace and variety and energy of this, and it's a pleasure to see the developers' talent for first-person environments applied to such a vast album of maps, though I naturally have some concerns about diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Some of the maps are more suspenseful with fog and trees, almost Darkroot Garden-esque, while others are fleshed-out urban spaces with signage and props that might have been cribbed from Babbdi's infrastructure. The combat gives me flashbacks to the duelling communities of games like the Jedi Knight series. It doesn't look like there's any progression bullshit to worry over - just on-map power-ups.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reveals-mario-luigi-brothership-setting-of-concordia<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Nintendo has revealed fresh details of its forthcoming RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>, including its setting: Concordia.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-luigi-brothership-bringing-the-action-rpg-series-to-switch-this-year">announced at Nintendo's Direct in June</a>, marking the series' debut on Switch and latest game since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-luigi-paper-jam-bros">Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam</a> on the 3DS in 2015. It could potentially be the final Mario game on the console before the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/a4000ce6-792e-49cb-8a9e-75497a691f4f">Nintendo Japan shared a blog post with new details</a> and, since then, a new trailer for the game has been released ahead of its launch on 7th November - see it below.</p>

<p>Concordia is a typically colourful world of all the elements and some new square-headed inhabitants.</p>
<p>Just don't confuse the name with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Sony's Concord</a> - the reveal is certainly unfortunate timing.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Japanese blog</a>, Concordia is home to various "drifting islands" - I won't include the names due to translation inconsistencies. However, there's an island filled with displays of objects made by its residents; a tourist island dominated by a strangely shaped tree; an island of old buildings suffering from kidnapper birds; an urban metropolis island that looks inspired by Tokyo's Nakagin Capsule Tower; and an island that's half ice, half magma.</p>

<p>Further, the blog includes details on Mario and Luigi's combined attacks. For instance, their jump and hammer attacks can be combined with correct timing of button prompts for high damage. There are also Brother Attacks that consume Brother Points, including the familiar red shell and a lightning-infused dynamo attack.</p>

<p>If you've not played the Mario &amp; Luigi games, the series began with Superstar Saga on the Game Boy Advance. They're action-RPG games released for Nintendo's handheld consoles, unique in the way each brother is controlled individually with separate button prompts both during exploration and in turn-based combat.</p>
<p>The release of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership comes a year after the remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-rpg-review">Super Mario RPG</a> and the release of the remastered <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-so-brilliant-because-it-embraces-mario-for-the-blank-slate-he-is">Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</a> earlier this summer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p>If I'm being honest, I can't remember much about the original Age of Mythology. I remember thinking it was a great game, but I've not played that twenty-two-year-old game in about five years, and even then, it was only a quick jump in. Playing Age of Mythology Retold has left me wondering a few things, such as "Was the campaign this long when it launched?", "why haven't they allowed for WASD movement of the camera?" "Will I ever play the online PVP mode?" and "What time is it?"</p>
<p>The answers to these questions were, in order, "Yes", "No", "No", and "For Zeus' sake, it's 2 am". That is to say that I did spend a lot of time getting absorbed into Age of Mythology Retold, as I do any good strategy game. Now, after we've had definitive editions of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-definitive-edition-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires II</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-iii-definitive-edition-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires III</a>, with a brand new entry in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-iv-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires IV</a>, how does a move to antiquity and fantasy stand?</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AoMRT-Ra-Attack-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>It's good. Let's get that right out of the way. Like the original, Age of Mythology Retold is good. It's hard to ruin what is sprucing up the old model, fixing glaring issues, doing all the cosmetics, and sending it out for one last show. Though this isn't a classic car show, this is a classic video game show, so the question will be what spruces have been made, and how will this impact the player?</p>
<p>Cosmetically, this has been improved in every way I can think of. The models are much higher quality, and the animations certainly feel like they have been improved. Environmentally, this gorgeous game makes the most of the fantastical settings - taking you from Atlantis to the depths of the underworld, Mount Olympus, Scandinavia, and more. Everything from the units you control, the buildings you build, and even the berries you harvest have retained the "mythology" feel but are close enough to a modern look that you won't have any complaints.</p>
<p>This is especially true when you cast god powers, which have great effects and stand out. Even more so, unlike in the original, these god powers are not limited to being one-shot. Before we cover more on the gameplay, stick to the cosmetics. The UI has also been improved, both minimalised and modernised. It doesn't take up as much of the screen but displays everything you need to see, and you can even see something as simple as the minimap improved by better use of colours.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn't point out that Age of Mythology Retold also has a multitude of options when it comes to accessibility. Are you colourblind? No issues; let's start changing things. You can also add text narration, increase the contrast of things on the minimap, preview colours for building placement, a narrator for menus and in-game, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text. I'm a firm believer in being as inclusive and accessible as humanly possible, and it's always fantastic to see such a range of options in any title, never mind a strategy title, which is always going to be more complicated than your general action adventure.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AoMRT-Greek-Battle-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On the gameplay side, the developers (there are too many to list) have made a few improvements, tweaks, and additions. Not all of the additions are things I use, but the core is the villager priority system. Rather than directing your villagers onto specific resources, you can have the AI direct them based on pre-set ratios of food, wood and gold (though, oddly, this misses out on the fourth resource in favour). You can also custom-set the percentages and allow the AI to build farms. It could be a helpful system, but the few times I used it, my villagers put themselves in harm's way.</p>
<p>The other core change I did use is the allowance of god powers to be used more than once - which is also why the cap on favour has been lifted. The more you use a power, the more it costs, but we all know that having Zeus blast down your enemy is always worth allocating some villagers to pray at the temple. Linking into your link to the gods is the brand new wonder age; once you have built your wonder, god powers become cheaper, letting you create even more havoc on the battlefield.</p>
<p>These three things are just that, three, but they are wide-reaching. While I don't use the villager priority system, it must be a godsend for those who would rather focus on combat and not have to micromanage. Pun intended. Reusable god powers and the new wonder era add a new level to a great strategy game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AoMRT-Norse-Town-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If I have any issues with Age of Mythology Retold, I've encountered a few bugs here and there. It's nothing game-breaking, but sometimes it's just irritating. One is where the cursor will lock on one of the sub-cursors (as I call them); instead of a simple pointer, it will be stuck on the icon to build something, or it will be stuck on the attack icon. Other small issues</p>
<p>That is all I can say. The base was a great strategy game, and this keeps that base. A few new features have been added: one, which I don't use, but I can see the use, and two, which gives it a step up. Add to this vastly improved visuals, effects, and a much cleaner UI, and you have a game that I would recommend anybody pick up and play.</p>

<p>Age of Mythology Retold brings back a classic, with new - great - visuals, a new UI, and a few new gameplay features. While it does, for the most part, feel more like a remaster, there's still an incredible amount to love here, and the few new features the army of developers have added bring a whole new level to the game.</p>

<div>
		<div>
		<h6>
			<span>Pros</span>
		</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Much improved visuals, and UI, bringing it into the modern age.
</li><li>Additional gameplay changes, such as unlimited god powers, adds a whole new dimension to the game.
</li><li>Still has great gameplay.
</li><li>Massive campaign from the original is still present, and in full form.</li>		</ul>
	</div>
			<div>
		<h6>
			<span>Cons</span>
		</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Has a few bugs here and there.
</li><li>Not much beyond the few gameplay changes to justify a "retelling" rather than simple reskin.</li>		</ul>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, that 5v5 multiplayer first-person shooter about Guardians Of The Galaxy-like space persons, will be taken offline on the 6th September. Anyone who bought it is being offered a full refund and it's been wiped off storefronts. All of this comes just shy of three weeks since the game dropped, with Sony citing a launch that "didn't land the way we'd intended".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In their <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">announcement post</a>, Firewalk Studios thank those who supported the game, before broaching the bad news.</p>
<blockquote>"However, while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended. Therefore, at this time, we have decided to take the game offline beginning September 6, 2024, and explore options, including those that will better reach our players."</blockquote>
<p>Concord was announced at a PlayStation showcase last year. Katharine (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-stop-it-with-all-the-bland-new-multiplayer-shooters-that-will-die-in-six-months">immediately deemed it</a> yet another bland hero shooter, and honestly, it's hard to disagree. Even as RPS' resident FPSer and former Overwatch guides-er, I never harboured a desire to hop into any of Concord's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-closed-beta-for-concord-sonys-new-hero-shooter-is-underway-and-the-open-beta-arrives-on-thursday">betas</a> and give it a whirl. I certainly don't speak for everyone, but I'd say a lot of us had our fill of Overwatchy hero shooters a <em>long</em> while back, so Concord wasn't so much filling a gap, but widening it.</p>
<p>I'd imagine Firewalk's option-exploration will result in the game returning to storefronts sporting a free-to-play label, or at least a heavy discount, given that it had a hefty £40 barrier to entry. I can't see them <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wayfinder-is-ditching-its-free-to-play-live-service-model-to-become-a-paid-co-op-rpg-without-microtransactions">doing a Wayfinder</a> and rejigging the game's multiplayer to fit a co-op PVE experience… because there isn't a PVE element. So, the question is how much cheaper they'll make it, and how they'll rejig the game with monetisation in mind.</p>
<p>Either way, Concord's really up against it. Valve's not-so secret shooter/MOBA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deadlock-valves-new-multiplayer-shooter-now-has-a-barebones-steam-page">proving popular</a>, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is bearing down on us (I know it's not a live service, but it's still a big shooter, innit). In the face of all that, can a reborn Concord perform a switcheroo so grand that it pries people away from the live services they're already chained to? Only time will tell, I guess.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>After PlayStation and Firewalk made the decision to pull Concord from sale two weeks after the hero-shooter made its debut, industry members have started to share their sympathies with the team involved.</p>
<p>Gears of War's Cliff "CliffyB" Bleszinski shared a short post on social media, reading: "Concord, I feel your pain."</p>
<p>Bleszinski previously set up Boss Key Productions, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cliff-bleszinski-announces-closure-of-lawbreakers-developer-boss-key">now defunct studio</a>, which released its own hero shooter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lawbreakers">LawBreakers</a>. Despite a big pre-release push by publisher Nexon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lawbreakers-developer-confirms-that-its-now-focussing-on-other-projects">LawBreakers flopped</a>, with its Steam concurrent player count peaking at 7482 in June 2017 when it launched via open beta.</p>
<p>In a follow up reply, Bleszinski noted his team had worked on LawBreakers for three years prior to its release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">Concord had reportedly been in development for eight</a>.</p>

<p>"I feel terrible for everyone who worked hard to put this out," Johanas posted on X. "Also it was the first PvP game in a long time that resonated with me and I was having a huge amount of fun with so this stings even more.</p>
<p>"I hope it finds a way to come back."</p>

<p>Thomas Puha from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> studio Remedy also posted following Concord's news. "Everybody working on Concord, hang in there," Puha wrote.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/RiotRMD/status/1831219269146665224">second post</a>, Puha said he was often asked about sales (it has been estimated Concord <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">only sold around 25,000 copies across PS5 and PC</a>). "I sometimes get asked about selling games and I always say it’s really difficult these days. Something like 60 million PS5’s sold and Concord struggles to sell (I don’t know the numbers) as many others have," he wrote.</p>
<p>"Even selling half a million units these days is a challenge. Then you get megahits like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and no one is quite sure how it did as well as it did. That game deserved it and it’s encouraging that hardcore games like that and [Baldur's Gate 3] do so well."</p>

<p>Lastly, Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad has shared his thoughts.</p>
<p>"The comments around Concord from right-wing gamers shows the power of collective self-deception," Ahmad wrote, following claims from some that Concord's muted launch was impacted by so-called 'wokeness'. "If you say delusional stuff about DEI enough times and build a conspiracy focused narrative, they start seeing that false narrative everywhere</p>
<p>"I guess we have to live with this now."</p>

			<p>The Little Nightmares series is among the most unique gaming franchises running today, featuring gameplay that masterfully combines platforming and puzzle-solving with a creepy atmosphere that makes each adventure incredibly tense. After the second entry in the series, however, it looked like the franchise would be changing forever. Original developer Tarsier Studios left the franchise behind (and is now working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tarsier-studios-announces-reanimal-a-new-fantastical-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REANIMAL</a> with THQ Nordic) after getting acquired by Embracer, passing the torch to Supermassive Games, a studio well-versed in horror games, for the development of Little Nightmares III.</p>
<p>During this year's Gamescom, I had the chance to try out the game, controlling a new character, Alone, and collaborating with another called Low controlled by another player, to escape the creepy Candy Factory and the old lady who seemed intent on eating the two. Right from the beginning of the demo, there was no doubt that I was playing a Little Nightmares game. Everything was in the right place: the characters, the atmosphere, the tone, and the gameplay. This was not a guarantee at all, given the development studio switch, so Bandai Namco, who owns the IP, definitely made the right choice, picking Supermassive Games to develop the game.</p>

<p>Though very familiar, the Little Nightmares III experience does have some important differences over its predecessors. For starters, both Alone and Low can use weapons, a wrench, and bows and arrows to defeat enemies and complete certain puzzles, such as activating contraptions, hitting unreachable switches, and so on. The biggest change, however, is the introduction of co-op mechanics, which should impact the experience quite a bit.</p>
<p>"Should" is the right word to use at this point, as the Little Nightmares III Candy Factory demo did an excellent job showcasing how the game effortlessly feels like part of the series but did a much poorer job highlighting how co-op impacts the experience. The few puzzles that required two players to collaborate, such as opening heavy grates or moving stuff around to reach new areas, didn't look particularly inspired and might have easily been single-player puzzles, too, with some tweaks. If anything, the co-op mechanics were more of a hindrance, as during a stealth sequence set in an office where Alone and Low had to sneak past the aforementioned old lady to make an example, it was easier to mess up and have to restart the sequence from the beginning. Hopefully, future showings will do a much better job.</p>
<p>For the rest, as mentioned, it was business as usual in the short time I had with Little Nightmares III. I jumped on platforms. I completed some simple puzzles with the help of items found lying around. I avoided danger by hiding or frantically running away. All of this should please fans of the series quite a bit. Despite the departure of Tarsier Studios, there's no denying the series is in some very capable hands who fully understand what makes the series so peculiar.</p>
<p>Little Nightmares III is scheduled for a 2025 release (following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gets-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a>) on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>It is 1959. The cold war is in full swing, television is taking over, and environments have just become fully destructible. What a time to be alive. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deliver-at-all-costs">Deliver At All Costs</a> is a chaotic courier sim set in those heady days that sees the player barrelling around a "semi-open" US town as they take on absurd odd jobs. "From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time. </p>

<p>Your demolitionist misdeeds will cause some trouble with the law and local townsfolk, it seems. "They will respond to your actions in the most unpredictable of ways," say the developers. It's being made by Swedish studio Far Out Games, a band of students who formed a studio some years back to "turn our school project into our dream game" and are now being published by Konami. Good work, young 'uns.</p>
<p>There's a tale to go with it all. You play as delivery boy Winston Green, who's described as a  "down-on-his-luck courier with a fiery temper and a mysterious past". It's suggested that there'll be some intrigue as his cargo gets wackier and wackier, and the idyllic town of St Monique starts to give up her secrets. </p>
<p>I think my favourite feature is how the citizens you've annoyed hang onto the back and sides of your vehicle with their legs flailing as the player takes another hard corner. Gee whiz, they sure are upset. You'll be able to leave your car and wander around on Winston's legs, GTA style, and you can unlock character upgrades like a useful bicycle. Your car can also get totalled (as seen in the trailer when the player gets badly bashed by boulder) but you'll have a means of reclaiming it. </p>
<p>It seems part <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, part old-school GTA. As someone who recently rediscovered the joys of absolutely caning it around in an old banger in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a> (one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">best racing games</a>), I can get behind a little more vehicular destruction. There's no release date just yet, but we'll let you know. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Microsoft representative has confirmed through a new statement that Black Myth: Wukong’s “delay is not due to Xbox Platform limitations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/microsoft-confirms-black-myth-wukong-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-comments-on-exclusivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a> report, the Microsoft representative stated that the team is “excited about the launch of Black Myth: Wukong on the Xbox Series X/S and are working with Game Science” to release the game on their platforms. The representative added that they would “prefer not to comment on deals” made by their partners with other platform holders. However, they can confirm that the “delay is not due to the Xbox platform limitations”.</p>



<p>Microsoft issued a statement in response to concerns surrounding the game’s delay, which was attributed to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release-is-indefinitely-delayed-due-to-memory-leak-bug-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memory leak issue</a> on Xbox consoles. Black Myth: Wukong was seemingly ‘indefinitely delayed’ as the developers are optimising it for the consoles.  Subsequently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-has-exclusivity-deal-with-playstation-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was claimed</a> that the delay on Xbox stemmed from an exclusivity agreement with PlayStation.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new report also speculates that Game Science and PlayStation could have a non-traditional exclusivity deal for Black Myth: Wukong; however, neither entity has confirmed this officially. At the moment, there is no release date for Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox Series X/S consoles.&nbsp;</p>

Ryan Ellis, director at Sony-owned developer Firewalk, said: "while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Soon after that announcement, reports indicated that Concord players were throwing Rivalry matches in a bid to earn experience points as fast as possible. Rivalry mode sees two teams of five players battle for dominance across best-of-seven single-life rounds. At least, that’s how it’s supposed to work. Now, players are starting a match and immediately running off a platform to their doom, resulting in a win for the opposing team and the end of the round.</p><p>Rivalry matches are the perfect choice for this tactic. Win or lose, it rewards players with more experience points than other game modes. And because it’s the best-of-seven single-life rounds, as long as the whole team gets in on the act and each round takes about 30 seconds, you can finish a match in just a few minutes — again, as long as all players follow suit and you lose or win four matches in a row.</p><p>Thus, this is the quickest way to earn experience points in Concord, and thus the quickest way to earn that Platinum trophy (you need to get to reputation level 100, which takes hundreds of thousands of XP), with just two days left before the game shuts down. But be warned: your win percentage will take a hit if you keep deliberately losing. Still, that might not be much of a concern given Concord’s impending doom.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is literally every match of Rivalry in Concord rn because this is the fastest way to earn XP for the Platinum 😂😂 <a href="https://t.co/BZ12OV7lc1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/BZ12OV7lc1</a></p>— Radec (@realradec) <a href="https://twitter.com/realradec/status/1831041419756388429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>IGN has verified that Rivalry matches are currently being played out in this fashion. The race, it seems, is very much on.</p><p>Some Concord players are saying there’s not enough time to grind to the Platinum trophy, so it might escape them. Others are holding out hope that Concord returns in free-to-play form, although there’s no guarantee it will return at all. As a result, the Concord Platinum trophy may go down as one of the rarest in PlayStation history.</p><p>What’s clear is that Concord itself is one of the biggest flops in PlayStation history, a game one of its developers said was in the works for an incredible eight years. There is now concern for the fate of its developer, Firewalk, and Sony faces tough questions about its upcoming live service games, including Bungie’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> and Haven’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgame$</a>, neither of which have a release date.</p><p>Concord’s launch was nothing short of disastrous, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>analysts telling IGN it has likely sold as few as 25,000 units</u></a>. It debuted to a tragic 697 peak concurrent players on Steam, a number that made the 12,786 players of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue"><u>was dubbed a disappointment by Warner Bros.

        <p>Sony's new shooter has just two days left.</p>

            <p>
PlayStation's shock decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">shut down its live-service flop Concord</a> just a fortnight after launch has spurred players who did buy the game to try and reach its max level via an unusual method - before it all disappears.
</p>
<p>
Players are now leaping off cliffs to end matches and earn XP at rapid pace, with a healthy chunk of XP awarded whether a team wins or loses. If Concord was set to last longer, it feels like something developer Firewalk would fix. Now, not so much.
</p>
<p>
Why are Concord owners so concerned with reaching the game's max level of 100? Well, you need to do so to unlock the "Experienced Freegunner" Trophy, and by extension the game's Platinum. Regardless of whether Concord ever returns after Sony pulls the plug and issues refunds, players will have that award - for now, likely one of the rarest Platinum Trophies available - on their profile permanently.

In a statement released last night, game director Ryan Ellis admitted Concord's "initial launch didn't land" and said the hero shooter would go offline indefinitely from this Friday, 6th September. Owners of the game's digital editions will automatically receive refunds, and have the game removed from their libraries.
</p>
<p>As for what - if anything - is next for Concord, Ellis said Firewalk would take time to "determine the best path ahead" and "explore options, including those that will better reach our players".</p> <div>

            <p>Microsoft has again confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delay to the Xbox release of Black Myth: Wukong</a> is not due to "platform limitations".</p>
<p>Game Science's action-RPG was released last month on PC and PS5, but the Xbox version was delayed for an unknown reason. Speculation grew the developer was struggling to run the game on the Series S console, while other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">rumours suggested the game was in fact a PlayStation console exclusive</a>.</p>
<p>A representative from Microsoft has now confirmed to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/microsoft-confirms-black-myth-wukong-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-comments-on-exclusivity/">Forbes</a> the game is still on the way, though it won't comment "on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders".</p>

<p>The full statement reads: "As we have said before, we're excited for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us."</p>
<p>A similar statement was previously supplied to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded">Windows Central</a>, in which Microsoft said it "can't comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders".</p>
<p>Both Forbes and IGN reported the delay was due to an exclusivity deal with PlayStation, though this was disputed by other industry insiders.</p>
<p>Game Science and PlayStation have not commented publicly on the speculation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">Black Myth: Wukong had already sold 10m copies</a> after just three days on sale across only two platforms. Two weeks later, that number will likely have risen considerably - and will of course be boosted further by the forthcoming Xbox release.</p>
<p>However, the Xbox version remains without a release date at present, despite ongoing speculation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The initial reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 console could be happening this month, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Gamesindustry.biz's Christopher Dring revealed earlier today on X that "industry whispers" on the Nintendo console indicate that something related to it is happening this month. While a full reveal is unlikely, there's a good chance that the console will at least be formally announced, possibly with its official name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">With industry whispers around ‘something’ Switch 2-related happening this month. I thought I’d remind everyone of the official list of the greatest games consoles of all time.</p>
<p>1. Nintendo Switch<br>
2. Everyone else</p>
<p>— Christopher Dring (@Chris_Dring) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/1831232577161605130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While we have to take the possible Nintendo Switch 2 reveal this month with a grain of salt, there's a very good chance that something is indeed happening soon, going by precedent, as the original Switch was first revealed in October 2016. How much we will learn in this initial reveal about the system remains to be seen, but one thing seems to be certain: the wait is almost over.</p>
<p>Despite the reveal happening soon, we shouldn't expect the Nintendo Switch 2 release date to be too close. Recent rumors suggest that the console will not be released in the current fiscal year, as developers have been told not to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-miss-early-2025-launch/">expect an early 2025 release</a>. The console's release window is not the only thing that is still up in the air, as virtually nothing is known about the console, though other rumors suggest that it should have decent <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-smooth-1080p-ray-tracing/">ray tracing capabilities and performance.</a></p>

When I catch word of a chocolate-and-peanut-butter blend of genres such as "cyberpunk survival horror RPG", my eyes light up. Literally, they light up like the pilot lights of flamethrowers, like glyphs on a cursed monolith that has been exposed to fresh blood after a billion years of dormancy. When I hear that the aforesaid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is set on a "dying space station", I begin to emit a monotonous reverberation, like <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-09-nasa-strange-noise-heard-astronaut.html">the mysterious banging recently heard aboard the Boeing Starliner</a>. And when I hear that it's being made by the people behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/shadowrun">Shadowrun</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battletech">Battletech</a>, I extend dozens of independently cognitive motorised tentacles and begin writing a news article.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Revealed just today, Harebrained Schemes' Graft isn't just "cyberpunk", it's "post-cyberpunk". Strictly speaking, "post-cyberpunk" probably means the noughties, when the neon promise of cyborgs and endless digital networking finally gave way to the dour mundanity of everybody having a smartphone, a Facebook account and a case of low-key perma-anxiety, but I'll allow it, because I do love me a doomed space station. Here's the trailer.

<p>
Some blurb: "the Arc is dying. You must escape. Once, it hung in the sky like a jeweled moon - a continent-sized station filled with biomechanically enhanced citizens, all working toward some greater purpose lost to time. Bodies were replaceable, resurrection assumed.
</p>
<p>
"Now your city - one of the last - has fallen, swallowed by the encroaching darkness of the station's slow death," it continues. "Beyond its walls you find yourself in the Arc's decaying superstructure, where both power and light are precious resources. But the darkness isn't empty. It only feels that way at first."
</p>
<p>
I am enthused by this scene-setting, and by the promise of roaming "self-replicating labyrinths" and real-time shoot-outs with "feral abominations" and the "ruthless agents of a mad AI". But I'm more enthused about the game's progression or upgrades element, which has uncommon narrative gravitas. Your character can attach or, if you will, "graft" augmentations to their body, but each piece of technology you stitch to your nervous system brings with it the recollections of the previous owner.
</p>
<p>
"With each Graft, strange cravings and half-glimpsed memories flood your system," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3141390/GRAFT/">the Steam page explains</a>. "Now you remember the hot breath of a lover you never touched. Now you find yourself suddenly obsessing over cruel and sadistic impulses. Now you remember the monotony of an endless solitary confinement. You must choose what each of these fragments means to you, and you must live with the consequences of each choice."
</p>
<p>
In summary, "you are the Ship of Theseus. Who, or what, will you be when you escape?" Choice of nanoware dictating whether you character ends the game a serial killer or a philanthropist? Yes, I can get on board with this.
</p>
<p>
Harebrained Schemes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">"parted ways" with former parent company Paradox Interactive last October</a>, following lower-than-satisfactory sales of The Lamplighters League. Discussing the decision, Paradox chief operational officer Charlotta Nilsson declared that "a new project or sequel in the same genre was not in line with our portfolio plans". It's rumoured that Harebrained pitched a new Battletech game to Paradox before the split. I wouldn't be surprised if nascent ideas for Graft took shape while the studio were still part of the Crusader Kings publisher.

			<p>Black Myth: Wukong was the success story of August in the games industry; that much is certain.&nbsp;<span>The debut title from Chinese developer Game Science&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sells-a-whopping-10-million-copies-in-just-three-days-surpassing-industry-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 10 million copies in three days and crushed Cyberpunk 2077's record for the highest player concurrency on Steam registered by a single player game.</span>&nbsp;CD PROJEKT's game reached 1.05 million concurrent players at its height, while Black Myth: Wukong, no doubt thanks to the massive Chinese community, has peaked at 2.41 million players, ranking second in the all-time peak concurrency Steam chart only behind PUBG: Battlegrounds.</p>
<p>The game was launched on PC and PlayStation 5, but not Xbox. At Summer Game Fest 2024, when Game Science opened pre-orders, the developer also <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delays-xbox-series-sx-version-opens-pre-orders-on-pc-ps5-shares-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a delay for the Xbox Series S|X version. Early on, there were whispers of a potential timed console exclusivity deal signed by Sony, although Microsoft did not <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-on-xbox-black-myth-wukong-delays-doesnt-want-to-comment-on-possible-exclusivity-deals-from-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comment</a> on that rumor. However, last week, several insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-memory-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the real reason was a technical one, specifically a memory leak issue.</p>
<p>Forbes was able to get a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/microsoft-confirms-black-myth-wukong-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-comments-on-exclusivity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> from a Microsoft spokesperson, who denied there were any such issues that they were aware of.</p>
<p><em>As we have said before, we’re excited for the launch of Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us.</em></p>
<p>The situation remains confusing, to say the least. Is there a soft exclusivity deal for a set period of time? It's hard to say at this point. However, Black Myth: Wukong still has no release window for Xbox. Meanwhile, a rumor from earlier this week <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hints</a> there could be two DLCs for the game before the inevitable sequel goes into production.</p>

			<p>KONAMI is publishing a new game called Deliver At All Costs. A top-down action title developed by Far Out Games, a small indie studio started a few years ago in Gothenburg, Sweden, by three students, Deliver At All Costs is set in 1959 and sees players step into the shoes of Winston Green, a courier transporting 'unconventional cargo'. Here's the official overview provided by the developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plow through the city across highly destructible environments, wreaking havoc in a wide variety of vehicles. Take on bizarre deliveries and missions each with its own unique play style and mechanic. From delivering a giant flailing Marlin to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion, always expect the unexpected.</li>
<li>Explore an intricately designed world with large semi-open environments both on foot and in your vehicle. Be careful not to upset the citizens, though - they will respond to your actions in the most unpredictable ways…</li>
<li>Amidst the chaos and destruction, embark on a story of mystery and intrigue divided into three acts, with a cast of distinct and memorable characters. Witness Winston’s journey as he spirals downward into the depths of insanity.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the 1950s with aesthetics and evocative music paying homage to the classic era. Featuring 1950s design elements, an original soundtrack, radio ads, English voice acting and a UI fitting of the times - all capturing the essence of what made the 1950s iconic.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880610/Deliver_At_All_Costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">page</a> also already lists the PC system requirements for Deliver At All Costs.</p>
