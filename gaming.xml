<p>Arisen for a new console</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The <strong>Tales of</strong> series is on a bit of a roll at the moment, and Switch 2 owners have something to celebrate, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tales-of-arise-beyond-the-dawn-edition">Tales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn Edition</a> is coming to the console on <strong>22nd May 2026</strong>. it's getting both a physical and digital release.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tales_of_arise">Tales of Arise</a> is the most-recent entry in Bandai Namco's action RPG series; it came out on other platforms back in 2021, with the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tales_of_arise_beyond_the_dawn">Beyond the Dawn</a> expansion following in 2023. The Switch 2 release will include the expansion as-standard.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is the first Tales of game to get a native Switch 2 version — even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_berseria_remastered">Tales of Berseria Remastered</a>, which comes out at the end of the month, is only on Switch 1. But Tales of Arise also isn't part of the recent slate of remasters, making this a straight port of the critically-acclaimed game.</p>
<p>If you're curious, here are some more details on the game courtesy of Bandai Namco:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tales of ARISE</strong> immerses players into a conflict between two worlds. For 300 years, <strong>Rena</strong> has ruled over <strong>Dahna</strong>, pillaging the planet’s resources and stripping its people of dignity and freedom.</p>
<p>The story begins with two individuals, born in different worlds, each looking to change their fate and create a new future. Featuring a diverse cast of characters, an intuitive and rewarding combat system, and a captivating story set in a lush world, <strong>Tales of ARISE</strong> delivers a first-class <strong>JRPG</strong> experience.</p>
<p>Players will follow <strong>Alphen</strong>, a masked amnesic man who can’t feel pain as he encounters <strong>Shionne</strong>, the cursed woman that inflicts agony upon everything she touches. They will both get to know each other and meet a varied cast of allies to take on the Renan Lords, powerful foes, in order to free <strong>Dahna</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We've had four Tales games on Switch 1 and Switch 2 between the start of 2025 and 2026, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_graces_f_remastered">Tales of Graces f Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_xillia_remastered">Tales of Xillia Remastered</a>, and the aforementioned Tales of Berseria Remastered and Tales of Arise. Where will the series take us next on Nintendo's hybrid console? We'll have to wait and see.</p>

It will include a four-team box, and additional pledge levels will include more teams, arenas, rules for championship play, and 6-player battle royale. The game is designed for players ages 12 and up and a single match can be completed in about 60 minutes.</p><p>The Kickstarter campaign for the game will go live on March 17.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> character design has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-oddball-aspirational-character-hero-design-2000617761"><span>gotten a bit homogeneous</span></a><span> over the years, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-heroes-characters-hotter-young-skins-collab-2000665796"><span>fans have taken notice of it</span></a><span>. Specifically, the women of Blizzard’s hero shooter have suffered from a bit of “same face syndrome” for years, with characters like Widowmaker, Ashe, and Freja being nearly identical in some skins. However, it’s gotten especially bad for the game’s East Asian heroes since Kiriko came onto the scene in 2022. Now Anran, one of the new heroes joining the game next week, is the latest victim of this phenomenon.</span></p>  <p><span>Anran is a fire-wielding hero and the sister of the game’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-trial-trailer-story-gameplay-voice-2000616929"><span>water-bending support hero Wuyang</span></a><span>. As such, she appeared in animated trailers, comics, and other lore before she was implemented into the game itself. Before her in-game appearance, she was depicted with a longer nose and sharper features, and overall had a distinct face compared to other characters on the roster. Now that we’ve seen her in the game itself, however, fans have pointed out that her face is much more round and her nose has been shrunken down to the same button nose Kiriko and Juno have.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the audible sigh I let out <a href="https://t.co/0HYZoKjiB7">pic.twitter.com/0HYZoKjiB7</a></p> <p>— Dahja 🐧 (@Dahja3D) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dahja3D/status/2019101290928947499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The similarities are so striking that some fans are joking she looks like she’s an alternate skin for Kiriko. The comparison between Anran’s old face and her new one is pretty stark, but seeing Kiriko or Juno’s face next to her current appearance is when the issue really becomes apparent. She looks less like Wuyang’s sister than she once did.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">how do you have a team of artists and still end up with same face syndrome as bad as this .

The team with the most players within the Control Zone earns points—the first team to reach 100 points wins the match. The variables in zone location and individual player tactics mean no match ever plays out the same.</p><p><strong>Persistent Cash <a title="Platforms > Meta [165 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>game</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

From reviving squadmates, transporting friendlies to the zone, or controlling the objective. We don’t just encourage teamplay; we reward it. It’s the player’s choice how they want to play, earn and spend their profits.</p><p>Cash persists from match to match, so spending big on better gear, equipment, or a vehicle at the right time has the potential to turn the tide of battle and could yield massive returns.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1024429"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Play Your Way</strong></p><p>You choose how you want to play and profit.</p><p>There’s no one way to play, earn and progress. Instead, <em>WARDOGS</em> gives players the freedom to take on the Control Zone in any number of ways. Whether you’re a lone wolf helping out your team or part of a dedicated squad, how you approach the battlefield is entirely up to you.</p><p>You could chase the “Hot Zone” to earn double the cash, purchase a ghillie suit and snipe from a distance, or ferry supplies to teammates by helicopter. Additionally, you could choose to fortify a strategic chokepoint by building your own forward operating base, or if you’re feeling destructive… man an artillery tank and rain down destruction on the enemy.</p><p>There are no set rules of engagement. It’s ultimately your choice how you want to approach the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Destruction and Base Building</strong></p><p>Bring the chaos to tactical warfare.</p><p>Destroy apartment blocks with rocket launchers or tear your way through towns in heavily armored tanks.

<p>Just in time for the World Cup</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Konami had a pretty presence during today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase. But Bomberman wasn't the only franchise making its appearance on Switch 2, as Konami announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/efootball-kick-off">eFootball: Kick-Off!</a>, which will be exclusive to Nintendo' newest console when it launches <strong>this summer</strong>.</p>
<p>Amazingly, this is the first time <strong>eFootball</strong> has appeared on a Nintendo console since it started in 2021, but the series has a much-bigger history. It's actually an evolution of Konami's iconic footy franchise, <strong>Pro Evolution Soccer,</strong> known as Winning Eleven in Japan.</p>
<p>And while this isn't the free-to-play mainline game, eFootball: Kick-Off! promises plenty of content, with a World Tour mode that allows you to create your own club and team, an International Cup mode (which is coming a DLC), Beginner-friendly modes, and local and online play.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game from Konami:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Game Modes &amp; Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>World Tour:</strong> Establish your own club team and compete in tournaments across the globe. Win matches to acquire players from defeated opponents or use currency earned through play to sign legendary footballers. Build your original team and aim to conquer the world.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>International Cup:</strong> The world’s most prestigious international competition returns once every four years. Take charge of your national team and compete on football’s grandest stage, where history is written and global supremacy is decided.<br>
<em>*The ‘International Cup’ mode is scheduled for release as additional downloadable content.</em></p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Beginner-Friendly Modes:</strong> Jump into fun and accessible experiences such as 6-on-6 football, designed to create fast-paced action and plenty of goal-scoring opportunities. The Rank system evaluates performance and allows players to naturally progress as they improve.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Local &amp; Online Play:</strong> Enjoy matches anytime, anywhere, playing solo, challenge friends via local wireless, or test your skills against players worldwide in online competitions.</p>
<p>Built specifically for Nintendo Switch™ 2, eFootball™ Kick-Off! features responsive controls and pick-up-and-play gameplay that welcomes newcomers while still rewarding smart tactics and competitive mastery.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>As the eyes of the football world turn to North America this summer, Nintendo players can find their own path to victory. Big goals, dramatic moments, and pure football fun define this new chapter.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“It Can Be Now, It Can Be Later, But We’re Not Done With It”: MachineGames Will Make Wolfenstein 3, Eventually]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/it-can-be-now-it-can-be-later-but-were-not-done-with-it-machinegames-will-make-wolfenstein-3-eventually/</link>
            <guid>1427452</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Right now, there's a big air of mystery around <strong>MachineGames</strong>, and what its next project will be. The developer is mostly known for its take on the <strong>Wolfenstein</strong> series; its last game, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a></strong>, meant it took several years off from the Wolfenstein franchise to make a different kind of excellent Nazi-punching adventure.</p>



<p>But now that its treasure-hunting adventure is out, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-a-bit-of-a-disappointment/">with its own DLC</a>, and will soon be <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-trio-of-bethesda-ports-are-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026-fallout-4-indiana-jones-and-oblivion-remastered/">available on the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong></a>, the question once again becomes: what's next for MachineGames? Presumably, what's next is <strong>Wolfenstein 3</strong>, and in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/machinegames-on-being-part-of-microsoft-going-back-to-the-office-and-wolfenstein-3">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, MachineGames studio director, <strong>Jerk Gustafsson</strong>, reiterated that, yes, MachineGames will make Wolfenstein 3 one day, even if it's not the studio's next immediate project.</p>



<p>"<em>Our intention has always been to go back to Wolfenstein,</em>" Gustafsson says. "<em>We wanted to finish the trilogy. And when we do that, that is something that I don't want to comment on. <strong>It can be now, it can be later, but we're not done with it. That's what I can say</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>It's a similar sentiment Gustafsson has shared before. Last September, as part of a NoClip documentary digging into the making of Wolfenstein, Gustafsson confirmed that the studio has <a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-plans-for-third-wolfenstein-bj-blazkowicz-game-trilogy/">"<em>always seen this [Wolfenstein] as a trilogy</em>," adding that the studio has "<em>a story to tell</em>" for BJ Blazkowicz</a>.</p>



<p>And last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/machine-games-reportedly-has-wolfenstein-3-r6-siege-like-multiplayer-game-on-the-cards/">reports from Windows Central and Kotaku pointed to <strong>Wolfenstein 3 already being in development</strong></a>, though it's unclear what stage of development the game is in. Gustafsson's comments in this interview with GI.Biz are further evidence that the studio isn't done with Wolfenstein, but it does introduce the potential that the next game we see from MachineGames won't be the third entry in its mainline Wolfenstein series.</p>



<p>That said, it's still likely a game within the Wolfenstein franchise, especially if <strong>Microsoft</strong> and MachineGames want to try and line it up with the development of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein TV show currently in the works at <strong>Amazon MGM Studios</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Two years ago, a rumour appeared pointing to the studio making something that<a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-unannounced-game/"> was neither Indiana Jones nor the next entry in BJ Blazkowicz's story.</a> Its next project could be that rumoured game, if that game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-might-have-canceled-an-unannounced-project/">wasn't the same one that was reportedly cancelled last year</a></strong>. </p>



<p>Hopefully, it's not too much longer before we learn what the studio is working on, even though it currently doesn't seem like the studio will have something ready for 2026, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-2026-schedule-halo-summer-kiln-april-new-controller/">if the rumours around what Xbox has planned for the year are true</a>.</p>

Ah, live service games. You put out a new feature, everybody complains about one thing or another, you say something like "we've heard your feedback" and change it the next time around. This, almost word for word, is exactly what's happened with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' and its impending second Expedition, the details of which have been outlined in a handy blog post from developer Embark.
</p>
<p>
Expeditions, for the uninitiated, is essentially the extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> take on prestiging, essentially resetting yourself back to the beginning, with a few bonuses to make that reset less of a full-on one. That feedback that Embark have heard is related to how much it costs to set off on an Expedition. Those that chose to go through with the first Expedition needed five million coins from their stash value in order to do it, but now all you'll need is three million, and you'll still get five skill points as your reward.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, those that couldn't scrounge up the moolah to Expedition the first time around, there'll be a skill point catch up system allowing you to reclaim any you missed. "The catch up Skill Points will be heavily discounted, making the total Coins needed to reach max Skill Points less for each Expedition," the aforementioned <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/second-expedition-rewards-and-requirements">blog post</a> explains. "Amass the entire Stash value and enjoy your Skill Points before everyone else, fail to do so and the catch-up system will allow you to close the gap over time."
</p>
<p>
Those going on their first Expedition will also get the Patchwork outfit, while those on their second will get an evolved version of it with four additional toggles and colour options. Your stash spaces will also increase up to 24, and you can get up to five skill points. All of that is permanent, while some of the consecutive buffs include a 10% XP boost, a 12% scrappy materials boost, and a 70% repair value increase. Whether any of this is worth it or not still, that's up to you, but at least it's a bit cheaper now! Oh, and you'll be able to sign up to this expedition from February 25th, and will kick off March 1st. Happy Arc Raiding!

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Covers Up Violence With Hilariously Bad Gameplay]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-leon-kennedy-gameplay-footage-violence-2000666127</link>
            <guid>1427443</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Usually, trailers for upcoming games tend to show good gameplay. You know, things like attacks that land and shots that actually hit their targets—stuff that might get players excited about the idea of being </span><i><span>good </span></i><span>at a game. But when promoting two of the biggest third-party games coming to Switch, Nintendo has thrown that idea out the window, presumably to avoid sullying its family-friendly image with gory violence.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>During Thursday’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999"><span>Nintendo Partner Direct</span></a><span>, Nintendo showed off </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</span></i><span>, two games headed to its new portable console in the next few months. What stood out most about these segments wasn’t the visual quality of the two blockbusters running on less powerful hardware, however, but how terrible whoever was capturing the footage was at playing the games.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666131" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666131"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666131">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The Direct’s trailers for both games were full of missed shots and poorly-timed attacks, as pointed out by former </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> EIC </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3me4ntqnrns2l"><span>Stephen Totilo</span></a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/apzonerunner.com/post/3me4mfg3mak2j"><span>and others</span></a><span>. One shot from the </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>trailer showed Leon Kennedy picking up a zombie’s chainsaw to fight off enemies only to miss and hit the railing on a bed, causing sparks to fly. Another shot from the </span><i><span>Great Circle </span></i><span>trailer showed Indiana Jones missing a boat full of Nazis and hitting the water below them instead.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>trailer is especially funny to watch—the narrator raves about Leon’s “physical prowess” and how “he can fire from a distance using handguns and rifles” over clips of him missing shots by literal feet. Compared to </span><a href="https://youtu.be/T54OWinnymM?si=L4rujiQUA9nYDYd2"><span>a recent Capcom trailer for <em>Requiem</em></span></a><span>, which has no problem showing some pretty graphic stuff, it seems clear Nintendo went out of its way to hide the violence in its latest showcase.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000666132" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666132"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666132">Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Nintendo hasn’t been very keen on showing violence in previous Directs, either. When it announced a Switch port of </span><i><span>The Witcher 3 </span></i><span>during its </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Zr9eAtwcYlo?si=zAk1fiwKEOnXWZTo"><span>Direct at E3 2019</span></a><span>, it edited out a clip of the game’s notorious hanging tree that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/BAC-jqZTCv8?si=b_IcTCmAfUTeP4lj"><span>was shown in online uploads of the trailer in some regions</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Other trailers for more violent games that have been ported onto Nintendo systems, like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijqVBkgZ79Y&amp;pp=ygUaY3liZXJwdW5rIHN3aXRjaCAyIHRyYWlsZXI%3D"><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i></a><span>, have received more atmospheric trailers that avoid showing gameplay. Some trailers haven’t been shown at all. The </span><a href="https://youtu.be/ztMGTTAjsAQ?si=PSgtM6Au08YQdbM1"><span>2017 Direct announcement</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Wolfenstein 2</span></i><span>, a shooter about murdering tons of Nazis, lacked a trailer entirely and was revealed only with a still image of key art. And, during the same Direct, gameplay for </span><i><span>Doom </span></i><span>featured more apparently intentionally bad gameplay, clips in which the player fires off to the side of enemies without landing any hits alongside one shot where the player is about to be attacked and…does nothing at all.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666133" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666133"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666133">CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Contrast that with how the developers themselves sometimes show their games being played on Nintendo’s consoles. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN7VJ1zec0g"><span>Here’s a CD Projekt Red trailer</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2: Ultimate Edition</span></i><span> showing off Joy-Con motion controls. It shows a woman mimicking the real-life hand gesture to throw a grenade whose explosion proceeds to decapitate the enemy on screen. Later she frantically slashes the air to slice through enemies with a katana. No one in the video misses a single kill and they’re all smiling while they do it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Putting smiles on players’ faces is Nintendo’s corporate mission, but not with bullets and blood, apparently, at least when the Nintendo Direct cameras are rolling. We don’t have confirmation from Nintendo that it’s an intentional policy, but it’s certainly a recurring theme. However, it’s clear that Nintendo at least has a complicated relationship with the trailers for M-rated games, more of which are getting ported to Switch 2 every day.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While today was certainly an embarrassing day for poor Leon Kennedy, as a big gamer who could definitely be a </span><i><span>better </span></i><span>gamer myself, I at least felt a little represented by the horrible gameplay shown off.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p>For over a year, buying booster packs of <em>Pokémon</em> cards on the official Pokémon Center website has required either the most extraordinary luck, or a bot. When new stock is added to the site, it very quickly collapses under the weight of incoming traffic, leading to error messages or queues that never resolve. Any who do manage to get in before the site goes down are limited by strict purchase restrictions, except of course for those running the bots that are able to scoop up the stock in milliseconds. So was today’s peculiar decision to bundle the enormously popular Surging Sparks booster boxes with the never-wanted and very bulky Pokémon Academy boxes a deliberate troll of the scalpers by The Pokémon Company?</p> <p>Surging Sparks is the set that’s generally considered to be the beginning of the current frenzy that’s seen <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-magic-the-gathering-scalpers-cards-2000632017">Pokémon cards become almost impossible to buy</a> for the last 15 months, where rocketing resale prices have led to scalping ruining the hobby for so many, and indeed <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-theft-card-store-phantasmal-flames-2000651666">strings</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233">robberies</a> at <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652">many specialist retailers</a> around the world. Its <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/BUNDLE1157/scarlet-and-violet-surging-sparks-booster-display-box-and-battle-academy-bundle">restock today on the U.S. Pokémon Center website</a> was therefore something of a surprise—occurring without promotion and of course inevitably selling out before most were aware it was even happening. Except, rather than these 36-pack containers appearing for the usual price of around $160, today’s booster boxes were all bundled with the latest edition of the Battle Academy, a hefty $20 box that’s designed to introduce new players to the table-top card game, and all for the undiscounted price of $180.</p>

 <p>If you’re already familiar with the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em>, you’ve likely already snorted a laugh at this. For everyone else, it’s important to know that the Battle Academy is to <em>Pokémon</em> cards what the Fisher Price telephone is to the iPhone. It contains a chunky playing board, push-out cardboard counters, and three 60-card decks with special, numbered cards that don’t feature the standard <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>card back designs, nor even a single holo among them. Even better, the Battle Academy hasn’t been updated in so many years that they still sport the late 2010’s Pokémon V cards. They are, in the scheme of collecting, worthless.</p> <p>This has to be a troll, right? While it won’t have cost any more in shipping (the Pokémon Center is unreasonably good on this, waiving shipping costs for purchases over $20), it’s going to be such an epic pain in the ass for the scalpers, as their every shipment arrives with this enormous extra box of stuff they don’t want or need, and most of all, cannot resell. It’s an extra $20 too, which is just enjoyably inconvenient.</p>

 <p>You could argue that this is also screwing over legitimate customers, and that’s sadly true. However, for independent card stores being repeatedly let down by The Pokémon Company’s official retail suppliers (according to multiple store owners I’ve spoken to in the UK since stock shortages began, the company is allegedly prioritizing larger retail chains over them) it’s a fantastic deal, given they can also sell the Battle Academy boxes to their younger customers.</p>

 <p>It’d be far better to see the Pokémon Center website actually spending the money to build an infrastructure that can cope when it stocks new TCG cards, but in the meantime, if this really was a way to just irritate scalpers, it’s hard not to give over a little kudos.</p>

            <guid>1427437</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new island just came to Fortnite that features a digital reimagining of Qatar’s capital city, Doha, as well as Hamad International Airport and a Qatar Airways aircraft. Called QVerse Island, it’s meant to give travelers an immersive way to experience the sights of the city and its airport. There are lots of minigames, a glimpse at some of the city’s unique architecture, and a hidden golden ticket that you can find for a chance to win a free Qatar Airways flight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can reach QVerse Island within Fortnite by searching for “QVerse” or using code 6020-0265-6735. When you arrive on the island, you’ll pull up to Hamad International Airport and get a look at the skyline of Doha with re-creations of its real-life skyscrapers. You’ll be greeted by Sama, Qatar Airways’ digital cabin crew member, who will give you five quests to complete.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/qverse-island-5-1765238045451.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After you’ve talked to her, you’re free to explore the city and do things in whatever order you choose. Right off the bat, you’ll see floating coins that give you 10 gold each. You can spend that gold at the airport vending machines for things like faster running speed, a jetpack that lets you double jump, or consumable items. You can also look for a hidden door that takes you inside the Business Class cabin of a Qatar Airways aircraft, where you’ll join other Fortnite characters as passengers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you exit the airport and make your way to the street, you’ll see you can summon a car with one button press, making traversal of the city quick and easy. Your HUD will have icons for the island’s biggest attractions, which is also where you can complete the quests Sama gave you. These are some of real-life Qatar’s most recognizable landmarks, like the National Museum of Qatar, West Bay, Katara Towers, and The Pearl Island. And QVerse Island has a persistent day/night cycle, so you can watch the sunset around these locations and see the whole city light up at night.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/qverse-island-4-1765238079743.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each location has a minigame associated with it. At the National Museum of Qatar, you’re given a scavenger hunt to find five lost artifacts that lie scattered around the city. At West Bay, you can use your summoned car to complete a time trial race. At Katara Towers, you’ll need to cross between the towers, high in the air, while a rotating bar tries to knock you off. And at The Pearl Island, you can take on a parkour obstacle course that runs across the rooftops of the city.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you’re exploring, you’ll notice a timer counting down to the next departure. Once the countdown finishes, you’ll be transported to a multiplayer minigame with other people currently on the island. There are four minigames in all: Wild Wheels Safari, Neon City Drop, Jumpus Maximus, and Home Run Rush. For all four, the last person standing wins.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/qverse-island-2-1765238121119.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Wild Wheels Safari, you drive cars around a desert arena while floor tiles gradually fall away. If you fall into a hole, you’re eliminated. Neon City Drop is a similar concept, but you’re on foot and the floor is made up of brightly colored panels that fall away over time. Jumpus Maximus puts you on a giant spinning wheel in the air while rotating bars of different heights try to knock you off. And Home Run Rush gives everyone a superpowered baseball bat that can launch other players out of the stadium.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In between all the fun and games, you can explore QVerse Island to find the golden ticket. You’ll get an on-screen alert letting you know in what area of the map it just spawned, and then it’s up to you to find it. It only stays in one place for a few minutes, so you need to hurry before it moves again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you find it, take a screenshot of your in-game character with it. Then post that photo to Instagram, Facebook, or X/Twitter with the hashtag #FlyWithQR, follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/qatarairways/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Qatar Airways on Instagram</a>, and you’ll be entered in a drawing. A winning entry will be randomly selected, and that person will win a Qatar Airways flight ticket. There will be a new drawing each week and the contest will run for 10 weeks. If you don’t win one week, you can try again the next.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/28/12398-fortnite-add-logos-to-images14-1769625524256.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">QVerse Island is available to explore now, and between February 7–20, gaming content creators around the world will join in on the fun, too. So be sure to check that out. Who knows who you’ll get to face off against in all those minigames? To keep up with the latest news and updates from Qatar Airways, you can follow them on Instagram, Facebook, or X/Twitter.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/new-fortnite-island-created-by-qatar-airways-gives-you-a-chance-to-win-weekly-flight-tickets]]></content:encoded>

"Wow, totally unexpected," <a href="https://x.com/dark1x/status/2019454335483036142" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> Digital Foundry veteran and game preservation fan John Linneman in response. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Late last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-dev-says-nintendo-has-cheaper-cartridges-coming-as-alternative-to-game-key-cards-then-backtracks-but-either-way-its-title-will-now-be-a-proper-physical-release">one Switch 2 developer initially suggested that Nintendo was preparing to make more sizes of Game Cartridge available</a> for manufacturers to ship titles on, rather than relying on Game-Key cards. However, the developer then scrubbed most of this information from the internet, and implied it was unable to announce anything that Nintendo itself had not confirmed officially. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda's other three titles getting physical launches on Switch 2 this year will not be on Game Cartridges, or even Game-Key cards. Instead, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> will all have physical editions that are "code-in-a-box," Bethesda has said. Of course, all of these games will be available via digital download too, via the Switch 2's eShop. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-just-before-nintendo-direct">As announced (and leaked) earlier today</a>, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will launch digitally and physically on May 12. The game's DLC, The Order of Giants, will also be available download separately on that date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition launches digitally on February 24 and physically on April 28. Skyrim Anniversary Edition is available digitally already, and will come in a box on April 28. Finally, Oblivion Remastered has a vague "2026" launch window for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For much more, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-everything-announced-updating-live">everything else announced in today's Nintendo Partner Direct</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/mouse-pi-for-hire-inside-mouses-wild-cartoon-arsenal-ign-first</link>
            <guid>1427428</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Odds are, if Mouse: P.I. for Hire caught your eye, it's because of its unique, hand-drawn, black-and-white 1930s-era "rubber hose" animation style. But it's aiming to be a lot more than just a pretty face. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mouse-pi-for-hire-might-fill-the-animated-void-cuphead-left-behind">We played Mouse last year</a> – and we'll be doing so again as part of this month's exclusive IGN First coverage – but today we're taking a deeper dive into its wild cartoon arsenal and its boomer shooter-inspired combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers at Fumi Games told us, "The core combat gameplay revolves around an 'Always Be Moving' approach, encouraging players to stay constantly on the move to survive." Complicating that will be environmental hazards, like freeze, turpentine, fire, and explosive barrels that can either be used against you or used by you. But ammo and health are scattered about, encouraging further exploration of the environment. And you won't be a tank; just a few hits can put hero Jack Pepper in a serious world of hurt.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, an assortment of core abilities and unlockable ones will help you Always Be Moving, such as a slide, dash, double jump, pipe crawl, kick, wall run, and wall climb – along with your multipurpose tail that, over the course of the campaign, can be used for lockpicking, helicoptering, and as a grappling hook. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Power-ups, too, will spice up the moment-to-moment gameplay, like Spinach (think: Popeye), Coffee (activates Cuphead-like finger guns that shoot rapidly), Chili Peppers (damage bonus + rate of fire bonus + fire damage), and Cheese (health powerup that can be activated anytime you want).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mouse: P.I. for Hire - Weapon Gifs</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But let's get to the stars of the combat show: the weapons (See a bunch of them in the gif gallery above). There are a whopping eleven of them, starting with your fists if you run out of ammo – but you'll probably never use them if given any other choice. Moving up from there, the Micer pistol is what you'd expect, though it does have a burst-shot alt-fire. Your Boomstick, meanwhile, packs a short-range punch – with a hold charge/pump fire as an alt. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things get more interesting and unique with the Devarnisher, which melts the skin off your foes, Roger Rabbit-style, courtesy of the balls of turpentine it fires. Its alt-fire is a larger blob that explodes to affect more enemies. The James Gun is a Tommy gun that stops enemies from attacking and has a spray fire for an alt. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Kiss Kiss is a double-barrelled shotgun that adds fire damage thanks to its exploding shells. The alt fire on this one is a larger, area-of-effect explosion. The Loose Cannon, meanwhile, really leans into Mouse's cartoon framework; it's a literal cannon like you'd find on a pirate ship that has knockback effects as well as doing big damage. In alt-fire mode it launches a charged-up burst shot. The Jar Head, on the other hand, fires waves of psionic power that stun and eventually kill enemies – and it carries an AoE. Its beam-attack alt is particularly potent if you aim at the opponent's head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last of the arsenal starts with the Portable Freezer, firing a cold beam that slows and eventually freezes foes in their tracks, allowing you to shatter them. The alt-fire spits speedy snowballs. I'm eager to try the Hellrazor, a chainsaw that pummels enemies with fire damage if they get hit with the wave. Its alt-fire is a traditional chainsaw that you do not want to be caught on the business end of.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, the D-namite can take out certain walls and floors in addition to blasting the bad guys to bits.  All told, I'm eager to try out all of these toys. Circle March 19 on your calendar, as that's when Mouse: P.I. for Hire will be released on PC, PlayStation platforms, Xbox platforms, and Nintendo Switch platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our semi-retired interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Closed beta end of February.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has finally announced Guerrilla’s Horizon live service multiplayer game, Horizon Hunters Gathering. It’s due out for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A “small-scale” closed playtest is due at the end of February, which you can sign up for via the PlayStation Beta Program. Expect crossplay and cross-progression. There's no release date yet, nor is there word on whether it's free-to-play or a premium game. The debut trailer, which includes gameplay, is below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can see from the trailer and screenshots, Horizon Hunters Gathering has a cartooney art style, which is in contrast to the photrealistic visuals of the mainline Horizon series. Clearly, Sony and Guerrilla are trying to create a more lighthearted experience with Hunters Gathering, with the Zero Dawn and Forbidden West more serious offerings. There are strong Monster Hunter vibes, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/05/announcing-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, game director Arjan Bak said that in Horizon Hunters Gathering, you fight deadly machines in tactical three-player co-op action and adapt your Hunter for intense missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Combat is tactical, reactive, and deeply skill-based, building on the tactical precision of the Horizon games while embracing the dynamics of team play," Bak said. "The foundation of Horizon Hunters Gathering centers around challenging and replayable hunts."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bak confirmed two game modes: Machine Incursion, which is described as "a high-intensity mission" where waves of machines pour out from underground gateways, led by a "formidable boss"; and Cauldron Descent, a longer, multi-stage trial in which "ever-changing rooms push Hunters to their limits, from brutal machine encounters to hidden doors that promise power and reward for teams prepared to open them." Both modes wil be available in the upcoming closed playtest.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a roster of Hunters to play as, each with distinct melee or ranged playstyles and weapons. Bak said there's also a rogue-lite perk system to craft the build you want. Story wise, there's a narrative campaign "which will introduce new mysteries, characters, and threats, but we’re keeping it under wraps for now," Bak said. "What we can say is that Hunters Gathering is fully canon and its story doesn’t stop at launch!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The social hub is the name of the game: Hunters Gathering. It's "a vibrant social hub where players can connect, prepare, and celebrate victories together. Here, you can customize your Hunters, visit vendors, upgrade gear, and team up for your next adventure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horizon Hunters Gathering isn't the only multiplayer game set in the Horizon universe. Bizarrely, NCSoft and Sony are working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-interview-with-ncsoft-is-aloy-in-the-game-how-will-it-work-on-pc-and-what-about-those-stylized-characters">Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game designed for mobile devices, but also playable on PC. NCSoft is said to be working closely with Guerrilla to craft the world, but this is very much an NCSoft-developed game.

        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Animation Studio</strong> – Dial in your trick style to perfection. Tweak body movement, foot placement, timing, and flow with a powerful built-in animation editor. Create signature styles, replicate legendary pros, or invent something entirely new.</li><li><strong>Physics-Based Trick System</strong> – Feel every push, flip, and grind with a deeply tuned, physics-driven control system. <em>Skate Style</em> puts you in full control. Although <em>Skate Style</em> comes with a built in animation editor the tricks are still driven by physics. The animations are used as guides for the physics driven skateboard. This means the feet will actually catch the board and no trick will be the same—just pure, responsive skating.</li><li><strong>Advanced Character Editor</strong> – Build your skater from the trucks up. Shape faces, bodies, outfits, and gear with incredible detail. Every skater is unique—customize clothing, facial morphs, hair, board setups, and more.</li><li><strong>Replay and Clip Editor</strong> – Nail the perfect line and then relive it your way.

Share your style with the world.</li><li><strong>Iconic Real-World Maps</strong><ul><li><strong>Barcelona</strong> – Cruise through the heart of skateboarding’s European capital, from MACBA to hidden alleys and iconic ledges.</li><li><strong>Stalin Plaza (Prague)</strong> – A world-renowned spot, now fully recreated in beautiful detail. Flatground heaven, long ledges, perfect marble—your canvas awaits.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Built for the Community</strong> – Mod support, replay sharing, and regular content updates are just the beginning. <em>Skate Style</em> is a platform for skaters, creators, and digital filmers alike.</li><li><strong>Realism Meets Artistry</strong> – Powered by cutting-edge graphics and motion technology, <em>Skate Style</em> offers a visually stunning experience that doesn’t just look real—it feels real. From the gritty texture of the concrete to the scuff marks on your deck, every detail is crafted for authenticity. The game leverages the latest ray tracing technology for high-end systems, while still delivering smooth performance—running at 40 to 60 frames per second on lower-end hardware like the Steam Deck using the lowest graphics settings.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Skate Style announcement trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZR08G1y3Lw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/next-generation-skateboarding-game-skate-style-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's a free upgrade for Switch 1 owners</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Gameloft's smash hit Disney life sim, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disney_dreamlight_valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, is getting a native <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disney-dreamlight-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> on 25th March 2026.</p>
<p>The game briefly popped up during today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase as part of the sizzle reel, confirming the tease that the developer dropped <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-disney-dreamlight-valley-is-getting-a-switch-2-version">last summer</a> along with a date.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://disneydreamlightvalley.com/news/NintendoSwitchUpdate2026">blog post</a>, Gameloft shared some Switch 2 gameplay footage, featuring a character walking through the Valley and doing a bit of decorating.</p>
<p>In the post, the developer detailed that the game will feel "smoother and easier to enjoy" on the newer console. Improvements come in the form of better frame rates, higher resolution, faster load times, and a much higher item limit of 6,000.</p>
<p>Plus, if you already own the game on Switch, the upgrade will be completely free. That's pretty handy.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-new-live-service-game-is-coming-at-just-the-worst-possible-time-2000666078</link>
            <guid>1427368</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-colorful-three-player-co-op-game-ps5-pc-trailer-2000666041">Earlier today, PlayStation and Guerrilla revealed </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-colorful-three-player-co-op-game-ps5-pc-trailer-2000666041">Horizon Hunters Gathering</a>,</em> the next entry in the popular post-apocalyptic franchise. But this spin-off is a multiplayer-focused online co-op action game that looks a lot like<em> Monster Hunter</em> meets <em>Destiny</em>. It will receive updates post-launch, and oh, wait, this is a live-service game. Oh no, this was a bad time to announce <em>Hunters Gathering</em>.</p> <p>I’m not sure a colorful, cartoonish online-only spin-off of the photorealistic solo single-player open-world series <em>Horizon</em> would have been a smash hit with terminally online fans at any point. But right now, of all times, feels one of the worst possible moments to reveal <em>Hunters Gathering</em> to a world wide web primed to make a Kombucha Girl face at everything it’s doing. The last two years have been littered with the corpses of failed, cancelled, or still-dying live-service games. A lot of players are, understandably, tired of these things and unsure of whether they should even invest any time into caring, as so many seem to flop or shut down.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The hunt is on.</p> <p>Step into the world of Horizon Hunters Gathering, a new co-op action game from Guerrilla coming to PS5 and PC: <a href="https://t.co/TNWH4oRX2Q">https://t.co/TNWH4oRX2Q</a> <a href="https://t.co/BCjSquv30R">pic.twitter.com/BCjSquv30R</a></p> <p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/2019425896008974566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It was just last month that <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a> launched and <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220">was then immediately trashed</a> by a large portion of players. The live-service PvP shooter debuted at the Game Awards, launched with over 90k active players on Steam, and now, less than two weeks after launch, is struggling to reach 5,000 players and is nowhere to be seen on any of my social feeds. Before that, <em>Concord</em>, a previous attempt by Sony to make a live-service game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">infamously crashed and burned in less than two weeks</a>. <em>Marathon</em>, the next game from PlayStation-owned Bungie, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674">has had a very rocky rollout</a> ever since it confirmed it was an online-only live-service experience, making me nervous about its future even as sentiment online seems to be slowly rebounding in its favor.</p> <p>There are so many more live-service games that seem to be struggling to exist in an era when most people are just playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gaming-newzoo-balatro-helldivers-2-gdc-time-spent-1851771352"><em>Roblox, Fortnite, GTA Online, </em>or <em>DOTA 2</em> forever</a>. As reported by <em>TheGamer,</em> <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/2025-live-service-games-player-analysis/">many of the live-service games launched in 2025 have lost most of their players</a>, according to SteamDB. And while there are a few recent exceptions, like <em>Arc Raiders</em> and <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it is really, really hard to break into the market and stay around. Even brief bright spots, like last year’s mini-breakout MOBA <em>Supervine</em>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/moba/another-moba-gives-up-supervive-developed-by-former-riot-devs-is-closing-in-february-just-7-months-after-it-launched/">eventually lose steam</a>.</p>

 <p>All of these attempts to carve out a sustainable multiplayer niche over the last two years have whittled down players’ patience. At this point, every live-service multiplayer thing gets dunked on relentlessly the moment it’s announced. Sure, some of that negativity is just assholes drafting off the “hate everything” digital ecosystems on TikTok and YouTube. But a lot of it is also just people tired of more games that ask a ton of their players without first earning it, only to eventually pay it back with a shutdown notice screenshot on social media.</p>

 <p>This is the environment that Sony has announced <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em> into, and it shouldn’t shock anyone that a lot of the reactions to the game are people saying they have zero interest or actively calling it bad. Can you blame them? The last two years have shown that live-service games are prone to failure, likely to collapse shortly after launch, and not worth checking out if you already play one or two of them, like <em>Fortnite</em>. Maybe that’s why they slipped it out in a PlayStation Blog post instead of a proper State of Play showcase.</p> <p>So, while I think <em>Hunters Gathering</em> looks neat and could be fun, I’m well aware that one day I’ll likely be writing a story about how it’s no longer getting updates and is shutting off the in-game microtransaction shop. You’ll read that headline on X or Reddit, go “Oh right, that game…” and then just keep scrolling by. It’s hard to get too excited about a new game, even from a PlayStation studio, when that fate already feels sealed. Maybe especially from a PlayStation studio.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo’s Trailers Of Violent Games Are Full Of (Purposefully?) Missed Shots]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/resident-evil-requiem-nintendo/</link>
            <guid>1427365</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>There was a Nintendo Partner Direct this morning, full of <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Switch ports and Bethesda games</u></a> and starting with an intensely soothing preroll of puzzle pieces slotting into grooves that I could have watched for hours. There were also trailers for some fairly violent games, <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, that looked a lot less violent in the hands of whoever was controlling them for their Switch trailers.&nbsp;</p><p>Viewers on social media were swift to point out that in the gameplay for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DTMmld4Wzs&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Requiem</u></em></a>, protagonist Leon Kennedy misses all of his gunshots against the game’s enemies, even though the enemies are close enough to be basically impossible to miss. In a scene where Leon wields a sniper rifle, even accounting for enemy movement, his shot isn’t remotely close. (As someone who is shit at sniper rifles in games, I have sympathy here, but come on.) In potentially gory moments of close combat, Leon swings a chainsaw basically into thin air; in others, the trailer cuts away before an axe can connect with an enemy’s head.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d/app.bsky.feed.post/3me4ntqnrns2l" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigmitjj4vpp32xqn5gvaxhwd6ir6c7q7p2qtrxtw3nmk7aky2iwpy"><p lang="en">Usually, video game trailers that show gameplay show successful gameplay, because presumably that's what sells

But, I guess to tamp down on depictions of gory violence, the Resident Evil Requiem footage in today's Nintendo Direct showed some missed attacks. 

Frankly, it made it feel more authentic</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d/post/3me4ntqnrns2l?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2026-02-05T15:01:43.867Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>Similarly, in an <em>Indiana Jones</em> trailer, Indy notably fires a gun nowhere near some other boats as he races by them:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BV3H__rdMw4?start=45&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Indiana Jones and the Great Circle – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 2.5.2026"></iframe></figure><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1qwkonv/comment/o3qa7lb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><u>Some</u></a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/apzonerunner.com/post/3me4mfg3mak2j?ref=aftermath.site"><u>viewers</u></a> suggest this is due to Nintendo trying to avoid too much violence in its Directs, with Game File’s Stephen Totilo highlighting <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3me4ntqnwk22l?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a different version of the Resident Evil trailer</u></a> that shows Leon having a much better go of things. We’ve reached out to Nintendo for more information and will update this piece if we receive a reply.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a funny thing, something I didn’t notice until it was pointed out, and it’s led me down a rabbithole about whether other Switch trailers are like this. There are plenty of regular Switch trailers, not part of presentations, that don’t seem to have this issue. For instance, a Switch 2 trailer for the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8kPSGj7dqY&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Squirrel With A Gun</em> </u></a>very much features a squirrel shooting a human with a gun, and there is a predictably gory<em> Doom </em>trailer for Switch in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lRpoGucGA0&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>2018</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But other <em>Doom</em> trailers go differently: In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpKEWIRwoxM&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bethesda’s 2021 trailer </u></a>for <em>Doom Eternal: The Ancient Gods Part One </em>on Switch, there’s a moment early on where Doomguy shoots an enemy:</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Bethesda version</span></figcaption></figure><p>But in the same trailer for Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ggPNp1vbnY&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>2021 E3</u></a> presentation, he misses:</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Nintendo version</span></figcaption></figure><p>Likewise, there's a later violent moment in the Bethesda trailer--</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Bethesda version</span></figcaption></figure><p> --which is replaced with non-violent navigation and a much tamer fight in the Nintendo version:</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Nintendo version</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t think I’ve uncovered some huge revelation here, just something I’ve never noticed about trailers in Nintendo presentations. These tweaks certainly makes sense for <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-super-nintendo-keza-macdonald/" rel="noreferrer">Nintendo’s image</a>, especially in a presentation with multiple games that would invite a broad age range of audiences. Still, it feels a little bit like Nintendo trying to have its cake and eat it too. If you’re putting a violent game on the Switch, there’s not really any getting around that it’s violent, and dealing with it by just having someone be really bad at shooting feels like a half-measure.</p><p>In the case of today’s <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, the whole thing was so laughably obvious that it drew attention to the ostensible strategy, which is now going to gnaw at me in every subsequent Direct. If you are the person <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-trailer-capture-director-maker/" rel="noreferrer">tasked</a> with missing all your shots in Nintendo trailers, please get in touch.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-players-can-prepare-for-the-second-expedition-with-a-new-catch-up-mechanic-and-lowered-stash-value-requirements/</link>
            <guid>1427359</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>One mechanic that <strong>Embark Studios</strong> uses to keep players engaged in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> is the game's <strong>Expeditions</strong>, which are essentially a big reset for your Raider. Things like your Workshop, player level, skill points, blueprints, coins, quests, and stash upgrade progress all get reset, letting you start again with new rewards and buffs to make your next round of Topside visits all the more intriguing.</p>



<p>What makes Expeditions interesting to complete (<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-dominance-continues-reportedly-stands-as-top-selling-game-across-steam-xbox-and-playstation-for-third-consecutive-month/">and what helps keep players logging onto ARC Raiders each day</a>) is that you have a limited amount of time to prepare for them, with Expeditions running on a tight, 60-day schedule, as you prepare the necessary resources to embark on one. Players will be able to head out on the game's first Expedition since it launched on <strong>March 1, 2026,</strong> with the deadline to sign up for it being <strong>February 25, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Ahead of that, and ahead of the game's second Expedition, Embark has introduced a couple of changes to get players better prepared for the endeavour. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARCRaiders_Expeditions-Infographic.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The first major change comes directly from player feedback. After hearing from players that the required Stash value for the maximum amount of rewards was too high, Embark has decided to lower it. The required value for maximum rewards is now <strong>3 million coins</strong> <strong>(600K per skill point)</strong>. Players will still get five skill points for reaching the 3 million Stash value mark.</p>



<p>The second major change is the introduction of a new <strong>catch-up mechanic</strong> meant specifically for Raiders who were not able to obtain enough coins during the first Expedition period. This mechanic lets Raiders reclaim the skill points they missed, with catch-up skill points being heavily discounted. "<em>Amass the entire Stash value and enjoy your skill points before everyone else, fail to do so and the catch-up system will allow you to close the gap over time</em>," <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/second-expedition-rewards-and-requirements">a blog post on the game's official website reads</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>For this Expedition, you will need to gather 300K Stash value per skill point missing from the first Expedition. When departing, coins will contribute to the skill points of the second Expedition, before contributing to missing skill points from the first one</em>."</p>



<p>If you're participating in the Expedition for the first time with the start of the second Expedition next month, then you'll also be able to get the rewards from the first Expedition. The rewards for the second Expediton are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Evolved Patchwork outfit (permanent)</li>



<li>Scrappy cosmetics (permanent)</li>



<li>Expedition Indicator Icon (permanent)</li>



<li>24 Stash Spaces (permanent) </li>



<li>+0-5 skill points (permanent) </li>



<li>5-10% XP boost (consecutive)</li>



<li>6-12% Scrappy materials boost (consecutive)</li>



<li>60-70% repair value increase (consecutive)</li>
</ul>

              <p><span>You know, if you’re ever looking for an example of the power of human artistry, you can typically look to incredible sculptures and statues that depict the human form like </span><i><span>David </span></i><span>by Michelangelo or the work of Rodin. But these pieces have the advantage of not being mass produced for people to buy and stick on the Nintendo system to unlock cosmetics. The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-leon-infection-dead-dies-theory-2000663084"><span>Leon Kennedy</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span> amiibo doesn’t have such luxuries, but it nonetheless accomplishes something remarkable as well: it somehow finally makes the zombie-shooting heartthrob ugly.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Requiem for the dead. Nightmare for the living.<br>Grace Ashcroft and Leon S. Kennedy join the amiibo family in summer 2026.</p> <p>Amiibo will be sold separately. <a href="https://t.co/zOfUuU3IH3">pic.twitter.com/zOfUuU3IH3</a></p> <p>— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/2019420370554745295?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>That’s not to say that the Grace Ashcroft figure is much better. Both of them look like cheap wedding cake toppers. Amiibos typically feature more stylized characters like most of Nintendo’s heroes, so they don’t often have to be very detailed. </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>, however, is a photorealistic game that would lend itself to a more detailed statue. These figures’ faces are so generic-looking that if it weren’t for Leon’s distinctive swooping hair, I probably would have a hard time identifying him. And trust me, I’ve looked at his face extensively for decades. Where is his old man scruff?</span></p>

 <p><span>“Reading the comments I feel like I’m taking crazy pills, but I must admit I’m not familiar with Amiibo and their usual quality,” Nexxtic wrote on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1qwmppb/nintendo_just_revealed_amiibo_for_both_grace_and/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span>. “Are they always this… rough? I think these look pretty bad, especially Leon. Like one of those bad Switch ports.”</span></p> <p><span>“Grace seems nice, Leon a little less so,” wrote AdResponsible5888.</span></p> <p><span>If nothing else, the existence of a Leon amiibo—a goofy looking one at that—means we get good jokes. Even if a lot of them have the same punchline.</span></p>   <p><span>Hopefully these aren’t the expensive $40+ amiibo, and are in the $15-20 range. They’re both coming out after </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>’s launch, with the game itself arriving later this month on February 27 and both figures launching in the summer.</span></p>
