            <p>If your time with foundational PC strategy 4X game series <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> consists of exactly one save file that ended somewhere in the Middle Ages, don't beat yourself up, for you have plenty of company. When they got hold of detailed audience data for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a>, Firaxis creative director Ed Beach and executive producer Dennis Shirk were dismayed to discover that fewer than 40% of their players ever finish a single game. Hence, to some degree, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a>'s new Age system, which is designed to counter feelings of exhaustion by smashing the chronology up into more digestible chunks, with something of a Civ power level reset between Ages to stop you feeling like you're either hopelessly behind or so far ahead that ultimate victory is guaranteed.</p><!--more-->
<p>That 40% figure comes from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/arts/civilization-7-design-firaxis.html">an interview with the New York Times</a>, which pairs Firaxis insight with thoughts from academics and third party designers about Civilization's pretty well-rehearsed colonialist leanings. While the data refers to Civ 6 specifically, I'm pretty confident you can apply these findings to Civilization games in general. There's <a href="https://kotaku.com/nine-out-of-10-will-not-finish-the-game-they-are-playin-5832450">ample</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/17/gdc-most-players-donat-finish-games">evidence</a> to the effect that most video game players leave games unfinished, and 4X games in particular are arguably most fun at the outset while the world is still a mystery.</p>
<p>Among the NYT's interviewees is Indian game developer Nikhil Murthy, whose current project Syphilisation is both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nikhil-murthys-syphilisation-is-a-ferociously-in-depth-empathic-reworking-of-civilization-and-other-4x-games">a post-colonial critique of Civilization and an investigation of Civ play possibilities</a> buried by the mantra of Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, Murthy comments that Civilization's endgame-focussed "winner takes all" mindset has a flattening effect on all the fun you can have with its systems. New School professor McKenzie Wark elaborates upon Murthy's argument with the thought that the most intriguing Civ players are the "trifling" ones who don't really care about victory. "You're just interested in exploring the rule set," she told the paper. "So your civilization inevitably gets defeated, but you find little affordances as you go along."</p>
<p>The NYT piece is too brief to go into much detail here, sadly, but it reminds me of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-you-make-an-anti-imperial-empire-game">my own roundtable chat</a> about 4X design with Murthy, Paradox Interactive's Ryan Sumo and Civilization lead designer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jon-shafer">Jon Shafer</a> from 2023. At one point in that conversation, Shafer recalls that during his time at Firaxis, designers frequently heard that players enjoy "that first X-and-a-half, the exploration part and the initial expansion part, before you're really in competition".</p>
<p>Civ7 creative director Ed Beach also alludes to this in <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/dev-diary/ages/">a developer diary about the Age system</a>. "From our perspective, not finishing the game is a signal that players are hitting points where they're no longer having fun," he writes. "We want everyone to have a great experience from start to finish. We know that players often feel the beginning hours of Civ are magical, and we want to make sure that every part of the game feels just as epic and exciting as that initial rush."</p>
<p>I can't tell you whether Firaxis have succeeded in this with Civilization 7. Our review remains forthcoming. But I am certainly among the players who favour the early game and prefer tinkering about as a mid-rank Civ to assuming a position of monotonous economic, cultural or military dominance. How about you, reader dear?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">What happens to GTA Online when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> comes out? That’s a question a lot of GTA Online players have been asking ever since GTA 6 was announced. And now, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">GTA 6’s fall 2025 release date</a> approaches, they’re no closer to an answer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online">GTA Online</a> is Rockstar’s hugely profitable live service that continues to pull in players even now, well over a decade since launch. Its enduring appeal and ability to print money is thought to have influenced Rockstar’s decision to prioritize the live service over story DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5, much to the annoyance of some fans. But there is a more pressing concern looming over the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When GTA 6 eventually comes out, it is expected to bring with it a new and improved GTA Online. Perhaps this will be GTA Online 2. Perhaps it will be called GTA Online, as before. Either way, players of the existing GTA Online have expressed concern that all their time, effort, and money spent in the current GTA Online will be left behind for a potential clean break later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why invest time and money into GTA Online now, in early 2025, when the new GTA Online is potentially due out in perhaps eight months or so? That’s a question IGN put to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick during a recent interview ahead of the company’s third-quarter financial report, and his answer makes for interesting reading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Zenick wouldn’t be drawn specifically on any new GTA Online because it has yet to be announced, he did talk generally about Take-Two’s form when it came to NBA 2K Online, a free-to-play online-focused version of 2K Sports’ hugely successful basketball franchise aimed at the Asian market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NBA 2K Online launched all the way back in 2012, and then 2K Sports released NBA 2K Online 2 in 2017. Both games were maintained simultaneously, so fans of the first version could continue to play and invest their time and money safe in the knowledge they wouldn’t be left behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm going to speak theoretically only because I'm not going to talk about a particular project when an announcement hasn't been made,” Zelnick began. “But generally speaking, we support our properties when the consumers are involved with those titles. As an example, we launched NBA 2K Online in China, I think originally in 2012 if I'm not mistaken. And then we launched NBA 2K Online 2 in China in 2017. If I'm not mistaken. We did not sunset Online 1. They both are still in the market and they serve consumers and they're alive and we have this massive audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we've shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last line is of particular importance. It suggests — but doesn’t confirm at this stage — that if there is a GTA Online 2, it won’t come at the cost of GTA Online falling by the wayside. If people keep playing GTA Online, Zelnick is suggesting here, then Rockstar will continue to support it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that there’s still a huge amount we do now know about GTA 6, given all we’ve had so far is Trailer 1 and a release window. But if GTA 6 is definitely due out fall 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boss-of-gta-6-and-borderlands-4-owner-take-two-says-it-will-time-its-releases-to-respect-the-consumers-need-to-spend-a-lot-of-time-playing-these-hit-games-before-they-go-on-to-the-next">potentially after Borderlands 4’s just-announced September release date</a>, Rockstar will have to reveal more sooner rather than later. In the meantime, check out Zelnick's comments on whether <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">skipping PC for GTA 6's launch is a mistake</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Highlights included Housemarque’s reveal of its Returnal successor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saros-is-housemarques-successor-to-returnal-arriving-in-2026">Saros</a>, and the long-awaited release date for Konami’s Unreal Engine 5 remake, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-finally-confirmed-officially-this-time">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. But one notable video game was a total no-show: Bloodborne.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">the persistence continues 😭 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bloodborne?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#bloodborne</a> <a href="https://t.co/GOcAO4Bi5g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GOcAO4Bi5g</a></p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1889812558040932572?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As the 40-minute show wrapped up, most fans wiped off the clown makeup so they could inevitably rebuild expectations for some sort of comeback in the future. For others, the absence stung more than usual. March 24, 2025, marks the 10-year anniversary of Bloodborne’s launch on PS4, making this year feel like a now-or-never moment for PlayStation and developer FromSoftware to do... anything with the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne remaster campaigners have slowly grown their numbers over the last five years, but hopes for an announcement took on a new form when Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-bloodborne-60fps-patch-says-sony-has-sent-him-a-dmca-takedown-but-why-now"><u>issued a DMCA takedown</u></a> to Lance McDonald, the creator of a popular Bloodborne 60fps mod for the action RPG, late last month. Sony was calling for links to the patch to be scrubbed from the internet, and only one week later, a PlayStation 1-style demake called Bloodborne PSX <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-the-bloodborne-psx-demake-becomes-the-latest-fan-project-to-suffer-a-copyright-claim-the-creator-of-bloodbornes-60fps-mod-has-offered-his-copium-official-remake-theory"><u>suffered the same fate</u></a>. It’s not exactly a surprise to see Sony taking action against community creations like this, but the timing had many, <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1886240572660457506" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>including McDonald</u></a>, raising their eyebrows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My copium theory is that Sony DMCAed the 60fps patch and the video about the Bloodborne demake so that when they announce a 60fps remake, Google searching for ‘Bloodborne 60fps’ and ‘Bloodborne remake’ won’t have collisions with our fan projects,” McDonald said. “Let me cope.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, just days after Sony moved to pull these fan-made projects down, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow-february-12th"><u>State of Play was announced</u></a>. After years of begging and nearly a decade since launch, this had to be it, right? Well, whether you were surprised or not, not one frame of Bloodborne found its way into the presentation, and fans haven’t been taking it well.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">another year no bloodborne <a href="https://t.co/XCB8LZ3Ds7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/XCB8LZ3Ds7</a> <a href="https://t.co/VVohE0C4gp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VVohE0C4gp</a></p>— ۟ (@scadutree) <a href="https://twitter.com/scadutree/status/1889809555003154451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">some of you clearly didn't watch amazon's secret level playstation episode when Sackboy turned to the camera and said, "We will NEVER remake or remaster bloodborne!" <a href="https://t.co/Y89LwShCVh" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Y89LwShCVh</a></p>— Gene Park (@GenePark) <a href="https://twitter.com/GenePark/status/1889814583868792917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/2BCcceRz2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2BCcceRz2z</a></p>— Micky D (@DeMickyD) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeMickyD/status/1889902996856947048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Driving the cleaver deeper was Sony’s promise to bring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/days-gone-remasered-revealed-with-april-2025-release-date">Days Gone Remastered</a> to PS5 owners in April. This re-release of Bend Studio’s post-apocalyptic narrative adventure arrives on the six-year anniversary of its original launch on PS4 and sees it joining a list of other first-party remasters that includes Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, The Last of Us Part I, and The Last of Us Part II Remastered. No-one outside Sony is sure on what qualifies a game to be deserving of a remaster. With so many players begging to return to Yharnam’s beastly streets and with FromSoftware titles more popular than ever, it’s hard not to walk out of a Bloodborne-less State of Play without a question mark above your head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, as quiet as Sony has been when it comes to Bloodborne content, fans haven’t been completely starved of an explanation from it or FromSoftware. Former Sony Interactive Entertainment executive Shuhei Yoshida, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-retiring-from-sony-in-january"><u>retired last month</u></a>, touched on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory"><u>his theory</u></a> as to why we’ve not seen more Bloodborne during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a recent conversation with Kinda Funny Games</u></a>. He suspects that director Hidetaka Miyazaki is too busy and too attached to the IP to let anyone else get involved other than himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on,” Yoshida said in January, “but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So, I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Everyone thought with Bloodborne's 10 year anniversary approaching and Sony DMCA taking down the 60FPS patch that something was coming but uhhh...</p><p>Nope.</p><p>We get Days Gone Remastered lmao <a href="https://t.co/Q8DzgbSJNi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Q8DzgbSJNi</a></p></div>— Michael (@LegacyKillaHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/LegacyKillaHD/status/1889816510497169759?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Miyazaki, meanwhile, has also addressed desires for a Bloodborne remaster and PC port. When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5"><u>speaking with IGN last year</u></a>, the Dark Souls mastermind clarified that he wasn’t “at liberty to speak to it” because FromSoftware doesn’t own the IP rights. It’s fair reason to dodge the conversation around Bloodborne, though Miyazaki also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested to Eurogamer</u></a> that he believes a remake could benefit from modern hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans,” the FromSoftware lead told Eurogamer early last year. “It does make me very happy to see that there are still so many people passionate about it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There has never been an official mention of a Bloodborne remaster, and 2025 is shaping up to be another year without some form of PS5 or PC port. As the PS5 barrels through its fifth full year on the market, one can only wonder when or if Sony will have anything to announce.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> studio Obsidian Entertainment has plans to make it to 100 years in the business, and will achieve this by staying "lean and invested".</p>
<p>Speaking during this week's <a href="https://www.dicesummit.org/">DICE Summit</a>, Obsidian VP of operations Marcus Morgan and VP of development Justin Britch said they expect the studio to make it to its 100th birthday, which will be in another 78 years time.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-plans-to-make-rpgs-for-100-years-by-not-trying-to-grow-aggressively-expand-our-team-size-or-make-super-profitable-games/">PC Gamer</a>, the team hopes to reach this milestone by keeping the company lean and holding onto the talent it has. It will also set realistic goals when it comes to sales expectations, the execs said, and won't go all-in on delivering huge profits. "Are we serious? … Yes," Morgan said.</p>

</figure>
<p>This strategy has meant Obsidian has refrained from opening multiple international offices, instead partnering with studios already in existence. This has reduced the risk of Obsidian getting too big and weakening the overall culture at the studio.</p>
<p>Additionally, Obsidian works on the assumption that any game it releases will simply be a "mild success", and this determines how much the studio will invest in a project before it gets given the greenlight.</p>
<p>Obsidian also plans to build institutional knowledge by aiming for "the lowest turnover rate in the industry". Meanwhile, the studio will continue to release the types of games it has become known for "not rushed, but often".</p>
<p>Obsidian's most recent game - Avowed - is available next week, on 18th February. We recently awarded the magical RPG four out of five stars.</p>
<p>"What Avowed lacks in gloss it makes up for with charm, depth and a playful heart. It's one of this year's most pleasant surprises," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in DICE news, during the event <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-backtracks-on-diablo-4-annual-expansions-next-due-in-2026">Blizzard announced Diablo 4's next expansion won't arrive until 2026</a>, marking a change in its annual plans.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Avowed may be officially slated for February 18, but owners of the Premium Edition can already play it. As such, a technical report is in order.</p>
<p>I played the game extensively pre-release <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the review</a> and immediately noticed the game's solid performance across the board. As far as Unreal Engine 5 games go, this may be one of the smoothest I've played to date.</p>
<p>Sure, it isn't the most taxing. It is not, after all, an open world title, although its zones are fairly large. It also doesn't path tracing like Black Myth: Wukong, although its ray traced reflections look great on water surfaces, and the ray traced lighting and shadows definitely augment the visuals. More importantly, the stuttering is minimal, especially when you add a frame rate cap. That's always a worry for Unreal Engine games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Avowed-Shaders-Generation-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully, Obsidian has adopted the best practice of running shader generation when loading the game. It will take a while the first time, even with a high-end NVMe SSD like WD Black's SN850X. However, you'll only need to do it again after a driver update, otherwise the game will check them quickly and then load the main menu. The tradeoff is definitely advantageous compared to having the initial experience marred by stuttering.</p>
<p>During the review period, we didn't have access to NVIDIA DLSS 4 or Multi Frame Generation, as the game wasn't listed as supported on the NVIDIA app for the Override feature. Still, I ended up using the DLSS Swapper tool because subtitles were affected by ghosting. By default, Avowed uses a fairly old (3.5.10.0) version of DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. Updating to DLSS 4 easily fixed the problem, though Multi Frame Generation and DLAA were still unavailable.</p>
<p>That changed with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-game-ready-driver-572-42-is-optimized-for-avowed-indiana-jones-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's GeForce Game Ready driver</a>. You can now select the latest DLSS 4 transformer model for Super Resolution, the improved AI-based Frame Generation model, as well as force Multi Frame Generation and DLAA through the NVIDIA app.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed PC 4K@60 Gameplay - Max Settings, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen, GeForce RTX 5090, 9800X3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRv4UwAC4-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game features no built-in benchmark, so I had to come up with a custom solution. I decided to record performance with NVIDIA FrameView while roaming through Paradis, by far the largest city in Avowed with the most amount of NPCs. Of course, I used 4K resolution, and every setting was turned to the max (labeled Epic, as in most Unreal Engine games):</p>
<ul>
<li>View Distance</li>
<li>Shadow Quality</li>
<li>Texture Quality</li>
<li>Shading Quality</li>
<li>Effects Quality</li>
<li>Foliage Quality</li>
<li>Post-Processing Quality</li>
<li>Reflection Quality</li>
<li>Global Illumination Quality</li>
</ul>
<p>The testing rig is:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</li>
<li>MSI MAG B650 TOMAHAWK WIFI</li>
<li>32GB DDR5 6000 MHz G.SKILL Trident Z5</li>
<li>2TB NVMe SSD Western Digital Black SN850X</li>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition</li>
</ul>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>With DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation set to 4x, I had enough headway to run DLAA at 200 average frames per second. Dropping to DLSS Quality provided a 30% boost to the average frame rate, which averaged 260FPS when upscaling from 1440p to 4K. However, the stuttering time increased from 7.30% to 13.29%, likely because of the larger difference between the maximum and minimum frame rates. Indeed, when looking at the 0.1% Low, DLAA and DLSS Quality are nearly identical (118 and 123 FPS, respectively). On the flip side, latency is lower when using DLSS Quality, though the difference is just over 8 ms (40.9 ms with DLSS Quality, 49.1 ms with DLAA).</p>
<p>Keep in mind, though, that the frame rate variance would be far lower when capping the frame rate, which you should absolutely do when actually playing the game. Indeed, during the review period, I capped the frame rate with the in-game slider to 120FPS and had a very smooth experience even without Multi Frame Generation.</p>

<p>Graphically, Avowed received a lot of criticism before its launch. However, the final version is nothing to complain about. In fact, it is often rather beautiful, thanks to the striking biomes and the highly detailed characters and armors. Sure, facial animations may not always be great, but only a handful of studios have really mastered that part of character rendering. As you can see above, the ray traced reflections are very pretty, though it's usually Lumen's lighting that elevates the visuals.</p>
<p>However, I do have to criticize Obsidian for its lack of native High Dynamic Range (HDR) display support. In 2025, this is nearly inexcusable, especially when the Xbox version supports not only HDR10 but Dolby Vision, too.</p>
<p>I had to resort to the Unreal Engine 5 HDR workaround <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Engine:Unreal_Engine_5#High_dynamic_range_.28HDR.29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed on PC Gaming Wiki</a> to enable HDR. Basically, you need to add the following variables to the GameUserSettings.ini file:</p>
<p><em>[SystemSettings]</em><br>
<em>r.AllowHDR=1</em><br>
<em>r.HDR.EnableHDROutput=1</em><br>
<em>r.HDR.Display.OutputDevice=5</em><br>
<em>r.HDR.Display.ColorGamut=2</em></p>
<p>It's not nearly the same as having it natively supported and optimized, though. Hopefully, a patch can resolve this.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Avowed supports the DualSense Edge controller right away despite not having any PlayStation 5 version announced. Granted, you'll have the wrong icons and no Adaptive Triggers or Haptic Feedback, but regular rumble works just fine. Lastly, I had good results with my Dolby Atmos setup when upmixing via the Dolby Access app, which I take as a sign of great surround sound implementation. The game also features sliders for Field of View (from 90 to 105) and for motion blur.</p>
<p>When scrolling Avowed's credits, the game lists many supporting studios, including the Xbox Games Technology Group, which was created in 2023 inside The Coalition. The studio is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-coalition-shows-stunning-ue5-demo-running-on-xbox-series-x-nanite-allows-100x-detail-lumen-is-a-total-game-changer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among the foremost Unreal Engine experts</a>, and I have little doubt that they were instrumental in helping Obsidian achieve their objectives with their game. In this regard, if nothing else, having the support of Xbox's teams has definitely leveled up the experience compared to The Outer Worlds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-units-sold-40000/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Early Nintendo Switch 2 units are reportedly selling on the black market in China for an exorbitant amount of money.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit</a>, the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained last year a CAD model of the new Nintendo system and provided the first accurate look at its design before the official reveal last month shared a screenshot featuring a conversation with a black market seller saying that the system, complete with dock and Joy-Con controllers, costs 290,000 RMB, around $39,780. While no regular user would spend so much money to get the console, the Xiahongshu forums user is selling the opportunity to manufacturers to test accessories on a real unit, so they have something going on to earn back the money spent.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1ip50jr/chinese_cad_model_leaker_shows_a_screenshot_of/">Chinese CAD model leaker shows a screenshot of his DMs with a black market seller, saying the prices for the Switch 2 dock, joycons, and tablet will cost him $39,780</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy-ConcentrationC/">u/Icy-ConcentrationC</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/">NintendoSwitch2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While there's no way to really know if the Xiahongshu forums user really has an actual Nintendo Switch 2, it likely won't take long to learn if it is true, considering the user did share the CAD model online after acquiring it and how people are hungering to learn more about the system ahead of the dedicated Nintendo Direct that will air on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is scheduled to launch sometime this year. A release window has yet to be confirmed, but considering the preview events around the world will be hosted until late May, a release in the second half of the year is to be expected.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lies-of-p-overture-release-period%E2%80%94how-to-play-prequel-dlc.1109433/</guid>

<p>We return to Krat to battle more creatures and find out where everything began. The Lies of P Overture release is an extensive prequel with the DLC aiming to trace the outbreak’s origins back to its beginning.</p>



<p>Lies of P was one of 2023’s most surprising debuts. I hold my hand up and say I thought it looked like nothing but a Bloodborne clone—and a pale imitation at best. I have since gorged on humble pie and was utterly moved once I finally rolled the credits after a million and one deaths. </p>



<p>Lies of P is an unbelievable addition to the Soulslike genre, and the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-overture-prequel-announced-its-not-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P Overture</a> prequel was music to my ears.</p>



<h2 id="h-lies-of-p-overture-prequel-release-period">Lies of P Overture Prequel Release Period</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New possibilities await. Credit to Neowiz Games and Round8 Studio.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Lies of P Overture is set to release during Summer 2025, but we don’t have an exact date to go with this timeframe.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Sony State of Play Event</a> is where we first caught a glimpse of Lies of P Overture. Again, it was surprising due to Lies of P’s ending. I won’t spoil anything, but it felt like the developers would likely be working on a fully fledged sequel.</p>



<p>Neowiz Games and Round8 Studio were actually working on prequel DLC! In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/lies-of-p-overture-launches-summer-2025-on-ps5-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Lies of P’s director discussed Overture and its goals.</p>



<p>“Do you remember the moment when you, as Geppetto’s most ambitious masterwork, woke up in the middle of the great Puppet Frenzy, a massacre that devastated the entire city around you? Now, you will venture back in time to experience the harrowing journey that birthed that fateful moment. Through Lies of P: Overture, we aimed to fully refine, forge and complete the story as we originally envisioned it,” said Jiwon Choi.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-lies-of-p-to-play-overture-prequel">Do You Need Lies of P to Play Overture Prequel?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, you need a copy of Lies of P to play the Overture prequel DLC.</strong></p>



<p>Many DLCs allow you to play the content without needing the base game. That’s 100% not the case here, and you need a working physical or digital copy of Lies of P.</p>



<p>What isn’t confirmed though is if this is post-game DLC, it can be started midway, or available from the second you boot Lies of P up for the first time. With Overture being a prequel, I’d lean toward the DLC being readily available, even if you’ve never played the base game of Lies of P before.</p>



<p>We’ll update this hub once we learn the accurate release date, as well as what’s needed to play Overture.</p>



<hr>



<p>Did the Lies of P Overture DLC announcement catch you off guard too? Did you play or finish Lies of P? What have you made of the early Overture gameplay footage so far? Let us know.</p>

<p>Days Gone 2 is a sequel many gaming fans have wanted for a long time. Its sales suggested the debut title was a success, but 6 years later, we’re still twiddling our thumbs, waiting to get our Freaker on for Days Gone 2.</p>



<p>I’m glad I get to write about Days Gone as I think it’s one of the most underrated games of all time. I played it when it first came out, and I’ll never understand the lukewarm critical reception it got. Freakers and hoards are utterly terrifying, the story is consistently engaging throughout, and it’s a rock-solid survival title from start to finish.</p>



<p>Rumors circulated in late 2024 that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-circulate-that-days-gone-is-getting-ps5-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone PS5 Remaster</a> was in the works. This finally happened at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s February 2025 State of Play</a>. Now, the Days Gone 2 discourse is hotter than ever.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-a-days-gone-2-sequel-happening">Is a Days Gone 2 Sequel Happening?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Could it be? Credit to Bend Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As it stands, a Days Gone 2 sequel is not in development, nor is it on the cards—and there’s a good chance it will never happen.</strong></p>



<p>It breaks my heart writing this, and I hope I get to backtrack on everything I’m writing one day. But we believe developer Bend Studio has moved on and was working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-layoffs-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-service title before it was canceled by Sony</a>. This means outside of Days Gone’s Broken Road DLC—and now the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-remastered-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> release—this may be all the <a href="https://www.bendstudio.com/game/days-gone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Days Gone</a> content we get.</p>



<p>Oh, and we also mustn’t forget its connection to Astro Bot—something <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">Days Gone’s dir</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">ctor</a> wasn’t keen on.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-hasn-t-days-gone-had-a-sequel">Why Hasn’t Days Gone Had a Sequel?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s been widely reported Sony was not the biggest fan of Days Gone when it first came out, despite the game selling very well.</strong></p>



<p>Days Gone took a long time to develop and probably cost a decent amount of money to make and market. But <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/12/20/playstation-game-sales-bloodborne-days-gone-7-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game World Observer reported</a> in 2023 Days Gone had sold close to <strong>7.5 million copies</strong>—bettering Bloodborne and 2016’s Ratchet &amp; Clank—and by now, it’s probably closer to 8 million—with the Remaster sure to give it a boost.</p>



<p>Despite this, Jeff Ross—a senior member of the Days Gone team—had this to say on there being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-sequel-sony-never-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no sequel</a>: “A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence <strong>it will never happen</strong>. <strong>Sony higher ups like Hermen were never fans</strong>, so you won’t hear about it at the PlayStation State of Play today or ever.”</p>



<p>I think the only way we’re going to see a sequel is if there’s interest. The Days Gone remaster needs to sell well, and people need to show they want another game. Plus, if Bend Studio’s rumored live-service title has been stopped, it means they’re free. Maybe they have some time to develop a certain Zombie-game sequel?</p>



<hr>



<p>In short, if <em>you </em>want a Days Gone 2 sequel, support it by buying it. Post about it on social media, make videos, and everything in between. What are your memories of Days Gone? Is it scandalous we’ve never had a Days Gone 2?</p>

<p>"Each year, we plan out a bunch of themed sale events (Fests) that center around a rotating category of games, and we know that announcing those dates ahead of time is helpful to developers planning their overall participation for the year," Valve explained.</p>
<p>"This is especially true given that we sprinkle them throughout a year already marked with each of our four seasonal sales and three Next Fests!</p>
<p>"We announced the schedule for the first half of 2025 last summer, and are now sharing the themed Fests and their dates planned for the second half."</p>

<p>Developers are invited to register their games for the events, as well as the digital store's legendary seasonable sales, which take place four times a year.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-bans-all-steam-games-that-force-players-to-watch-advertisements">Valve re-emphasised its rules around advertising, explicitly prohibiting games that force players to watch in-game ads</a>.</p>
<p>The rules confirmed that whilst cross-promotion and product placement are permitted, games that force players to watch or engage with advertising in order to play are not. Nor should developers use advertising as a "way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Is this the best start to a year in gaming we’ve ever had? It feels as though we’re seeing massive, hugely enjoyable games appear on the daily, and this week it’s been my pleasure to play through<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/"> Avowed</a>, an early highlight on the calendar for RPG fans. I’m also diving into the Elden Ring Nightreign network test which started today, had fun with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/the-knightling-is-set-to-be-a-fantastical-shield-bearing-indie-hit/">The Knightling</a>, and a bunch of other stuff I’m not allowed to talk about that totally don’t feature large creatures in them.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has played the prerequisite amount of Destiny 2, while also finding time to review <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/11/robobeat-review/">Robobeat</a> which he grudgingly liked very much. <strong>Gamoc</strong>, meanwhile continued to tinker with Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 after our review, reiterating that it’s excellent, as well as Phasmophobia, Orcs Must Die 3, and a bit of Palworld.</p>
<p><strong>Aran </strong>has returned to us after an amazing trip to Japan, and he’s getting back up to speed by playing Citizen Sleeper 2 for review, while <strong>Jim</strong> finally saw the credits roll on Alan Wake 2. He told us, “I wasn’t too keen on the ending and felt like it meandered a bit too much without really offering anything diverse or satisfying with its combat gameplay. That said, I feel somewhat obliged to play through the DLC as it ties more into the wider Remedy universe.</p>
<p>“Not sure what my next game will be, either Plague Tale or Rise of the Ronin.” Any suggestions?</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> has had a quieter week than normal, working his way through Gears of War 5. He says, “It’s fine but suffers from serious modern-day gaming bloat compared to the original trilogy. I’ve also been pottering through some indie games for review.”</p>
<p>Having seen off Unicorn Overlord, <strong>Ade</strong> has immediately made a tactical move to another Switch title, “I needed a game to fill the horned horse-shaped hole in my life, so, I’ve started Fire Emblem Engage! I’ve also enjoyed accidentally blowing up pals in Helldivers 2, solving physics-based puzzles in Immortals Rise of Fenyx, and watching Laura build uni halls in the hilarious Campus 2.0.”</p>

<p>Last, but never the least, <strong>Tef</strong> has also been playing Avowed to help produce <a href="https://youtu.be/_PCSaHYOKoY">our video review</a>, complimenting this with some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/killing-floor-3-preview-beta/">Killing Floor 3 for a preview</a> of the closed beta, and is just getting started with the technical test of Exoborne, where he’s roping Miguel and myself in for some exosuit extraction. There’s some other bits and bobs that he can’t talk about yet, though…</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-active-development/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-ix-remake-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-are-still-in-active-development-%E2%80%93-rumor.1109397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-active-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite not having been announced yet, the Final Fantasy IX remake remains in active development alongside another unannounced series remaster, but both may not be released soon, according to a well-known insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, well-known and reliable insider NateTheHate replied to a question regarding the remake of the ninth entry in the series by Square Enix, saying that it remains in active development alongside another rumored remaster, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-playtested/">Final Fantasy Tactics remaster</a>. Unfortunately, it looks like it may be a while until we see how Zidane's adventure will get updated for modern gaming hardware, as the game isn't expected to be released in 2025, although, the insider highlighted, the fact that nothing has been heard about it doesn't mean that it won't release for sure before the end of the year. The Final Fantasy Tactics remaster also isn't expected to release this year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Both remain in active development. FFIXR isn't expected to see release in 2025. Maybe we'll see it launch in 2026.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1888418337790534097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Just because I haven't heard it... doesn't mean it's not coming this year, to be clear. I simply don't have a timeline of release on the game at the moment.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1889021467490136206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake, as mentioned above, has yet to be officially announced and was originally revealed via a huge GeForce Now leak a few years back. While multiple insiders have provided different details on the game, all have suggested that the remake will be quite <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/">faithful to the original and will have a more modest budget than the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy.</a> Final Fantasy XIV and XVI producer Naoki Yoshida also commented on a potential remake last year, acknowledging the demand and highlighting how it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-multiple-games/">difficult to remake the original with a single game</a>, although it's difficult to imagine Square Enix committing to another long undertaking with multiple games to remake a title that, while beloved by many, it's not as popular as the seventh entry in the series.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will get "additional playable characters and bosses" via DLC, according to an entry on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/">Steam page</a>. This isn't massively surprising, given that Nightreign is a multiplayer-focussed spin-off featuring preset Nightfarer heroes rather than custom RPG characters, as in vanilla <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. It also supports the idea that Nightreign is the foundation for a From Software Connected Universe of sorts, with characters and antagonists from the original Elden Ring, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> trilogy, Sekiro and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> reappearing in Nightreign via the Mystic Nexus of Monetisation.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The Steam page mention of DLC has since been removed, but not fast enough to evade the watchful harpies of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/elden-ring-nightreigns-steam-page-lets-slip-itll-have-dlc-bosses-and-player-characters/">Parsimonious Gamer</a>. The now-deleted entry didn't specify which characters or bosses, but it seems overwhelmingly likely that there will be some familiar faces. We already know that Nightreign features a few bosses from previous From Software games, including the first Dark Souls' Centipede Demon and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>'s dragon-riding solar warrior the Nameless King.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-talks-about-attacking-friends-for-their-own-good-and-other-new-elden-ring-nightreign-ideas/1100-6529380/">Gamespot</a>, From Software game director Junya Ishizaki has explained the return of Nameless King and other stalwarts as reflecting the need for variety in a battle royale-flavoured bossrush experience that thrives on creative match-ups. "We needed a lot to add to this mix, so we wanted to leverage what we deemed appropriate from our previous titles," he told the site, going on to note that "our players have a lot of affection for these characters" and that From are being careful to ground things in lore and ensure the bosses "make sense within the atmosphere and vibe of Elden Ring Nightreign".
</p>
<p>
I don't doubt Ishizaki's sincerity when he adds that "from a personal standpoint, I thought it'd be kind of fun", and I don't want to get too picky with the wording of an answer that presumably came via translator, but "leverage" is a word you tend to hear from publishers looking to squeeze more cash out of their established fictional worlds. If Nightreign finds an audience, I expect there will be plenty more leveraging. In this regard, From are of course following in the footsteps of modders, who've been porting bosses between games for yonks and even making them fight each other Salty Bet-style.
</p>
<p>
There are definitely some old From characters I'd love to see in Nightreign. It's interesting to consider how they might be adapted to the game's quickfire open world multiplayer format. Bloodborne's sorrowful cosmic being Ebrietas, for example, although that's partly because I didn't have the heart to attack her in the original game. Sekiro's many Headless varmints.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, though, I'm less interested in which characters might return than in how From Software might justify their presence at the level of environmental storytelling and backstory. While it's an angle I've overegged in the past, From's tales of overthrowing corrupted kings and being corrupted in the process can easily be read as a mythologisation of the pitfalls of prolonging a narrative franchise, stretching out stories till they become boneless and dissatisfying, and reviving characters who should have died or retired several iterations ago. 
</p>
<p>
In Dark Souls 3, for example, there is a cannibalistic monster who fights using the half-eaten husk of a character from the original game. It's interesting to place that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-dark-souls-3s-aldrich-is-2016s-best-boss">act of regurgitation</a> against what we know of Nightreign's update plans, which seem heavily informed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">the undead philosophies of live service games</a>. I wonder if the new game will end up being one big metaphor for seasonal update entropy?

It’s a success for the Ukrainian studio, a miracle, really, considering the harrowing circumstances that followed Russian’s full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. But Stalker 2 suffers from well-documented bugs and issues; chief among them A-Life 2.0.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A-Life was a key feature of the first STALKER game that governed AI behavior across the game world. At a high level, it is a system for simulating life in the Zone that works its magic seemingly independently of the player’s actions or whereabouts. It helps to create convincing AI and the emergent gameplay STALKER is famous for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC had said A-Life 2.0 would make the Zone feel alive as never before, that it would fuel emergent gameplay on a scale previously thought impossible. Indeed for some fans, A-Life 2.0 was STALKER 2’s biggest selling point. But when STALKER 2 actually came out players discovered that A-Life 2.0 didn’t work properly, with some questioning whether it was even in the game at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam"><u>GSC explained what went wrong with STALKER 2’s A-Life 2.0</u></a>, and vowed to fix the system. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-patch-11-is-a-big-one-adds-first-iteration-of-a-life-fixes">Patch 1.1</a>, released in December, was the first step on that road.

<p>We first got word of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February 2023</a>. At the time of its announcement, the game was set to release in 2023, but it later saw its launch nudged back.</p>
<p>We got a subsequent look at Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time in February last year, along with a peek <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">at the various jobs players</a> will be able to undertake in this time travelling adventure.</p>
<p>Away from Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Level-5 also has a new Professor Layton game in the pipeline</a>. It's known as New World of Steam and will place the Professor as something of a newcomer himself, in a story which moves the series' action to America.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Eclipse Glow Games has shared an extended gameplay video of its exciting newly announced action/adventure game Tides of Annihilation. The video, published on IGN's YouTube channel, is embedded below. In the footage, we get to see a bit of exploration, some standard fighting, and a boss fight against the game's version of Mordred Pendragon.</p>
<p>It's clearly a work-in-progress build, but it shows a lot of promise, confirming what we already saw at Gamescom 2024 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-is-a-stunning-action-adventure-game-set-in-a-fantasy-london-inspired-by-arthurian-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported in this article</a>.</p>
<p>In the game, players will explore an alternate version of London that lies in ruins, following a surprise invasion from another realm. They'll step into this world as Gwendolyn, supposedly the city's last surviving inhabitant, as she navigates otherworldly foes and gains awesome powers of her own.</p>
<p>Throughout Tides of Annihilation, Gwendolyn will be able to summon over ten legendary knights (picking two at a time). They were inspired by Arthurian myths, bringing unique skills and abilities that will allow players to craft their own fighting playstyles and combos. Such powers will be needed to face the gigantic knights that now roam ruined London. Players will get not only to fight them but also scale them, as they are practically levels of their own.</p>
<p>In this game, London isn't just devastated, it's also transformed. But there's also the fantasy realm of Avalon, where the supernatural is even more prevalent between ancient magic and legendary creatures. Throughout the journey, Gwendolyn will have to save her family, the city, and even reality itself.</p>

<p>The game is in development for PC and consoles with Unreal Engine 5, and the studio has already confirmed PS5 Pro support with ray tracing and 60FPS mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-patch-fixes-bugs-and-overhauls/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>GSC has published the 1.2 patch for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, releasing more than 1,700 bug fixes across all platforms. In a post accompanying the release, it was revealed that ‘all aspects of the game’ have been addressed, from AI and UI to weapon balancing and open-world exploration mechanics.</p>



<p>It’s one heck of a list, but that has become par for the course for GSC, which has worked tirelessly to optimise STALKER 2 since the game was released in December 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-major-update-1-2">Major Update 1.2</h2>



<p>One of the major areas addressed by GSC Game World in the 1.2 patch for STALKER 2 is the game’s AI engine and mechanics.</p>



<p>This update has swept the ‘A-Life’ ecosystem, with upgrades being applied to the accuracy, stealth, behaviour, and interactions of NPCs throughout The Zone. The team has also provided extended fixes and tweaks to the many mutants that roam this open-world title.</p>



<p>Many performance-based changes have been applied in the STALKER 2 1.2 patch, too. GSC has repaired some sequences that were causing FPS drops, and a major memory leak issue has been sorted out.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en/news/patch-1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full list of improvements</a> is nuts – GSC has considered every little detail in this major patch. For instance, the team has looked at everything from visual glitches occurring when NPCs <strong>smoke</strong> to the visual clarity of PDA models in low-light areas. The granularity is insane.</p>



<p>Hundreds of fixes have been applied to the full suite of missions – both major and minor – that players explore as they traverse the story of Heart of Chornobyl. In December, I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">gave STALKER 2 a glowing review</a> despite there being a few issues that surfaced in some of the missions I uncovered.</p>



<p>Patch 1.2 was more about fixes than it was about <strong>additions</strong>, so don’t expect there to be too many new things to uncover the next time you log into the game. GSC added some extra controller features, and there’s a new ‘night music theme’ that’ll play when you explore Zalissya. Plus, some new notes have been scattered around the open world, but that’s about it.</p>



<p>Are you still playing STALKER 2? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

From the “Yellow Turban Rebellion” to the climax of the “Battle of Chibi,” the story will transport players to the heart of an ancient China in turmoil. Through the eyes of a nameless hero, players will have to fight fiercely and make choices to restore peace, shape history to their own experience, battle enormous enemy armies, whilst navigating the chaos of the Three Kingdoms era.</p><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> delivers an overwhelming sense of realism on every battlefield, with the largest number of soldiers in the series’ history to date. Enemy soldiers attacking <a title="Genres > Co-Op [234 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a>ly are a formidable threat, and players will not only fight with their own skills but also charge forward with their allies into massive enemy armies, allowing for a sense of realism on the battlefield of unprecedented scale where thousands of soldiers will collide.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The protagonist of this title takes to the battlefield alongside the heroes of the Three Kingdoms, wiping out swarms of enemies with swords, fists and various other weapons. Travelling across the world map as they embark on their epic journey, players can suppress rebellions or choose to rescue government forces during “Missions,” overcome “Skirmishes,” and visit various locations where they will be able to buy weapons. Throughout their quest, players will also encounter a variety of characters familiar to the <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> franchise such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei. Depending on the bond forged, these characters can become travelling companions, or an enemy as players dive into the most aggressive 1 vs. 1,000 combat in series history!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Team Asobi's Astro Bot has dominated DICE Awards 2025 with five award wins:&nbsp;Outstanding Achievement in Animation, Outstanding Technical Achievement, Family Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Game Design, as well as the most coveted one, Game Of The Year.</p>
<p>It's another big victory for the platform game, which had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received the Game of the Year prize at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards</a> ceremony in December and <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-sweeps-at-new-york-game-awards-ceremony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the New York Game Awards</a> last month. So far, when taking in most outlets and organizations, Astro Bot has put itself far ahead of any other game released in 2024 when it comes to GOTY awards. <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-24-best-games-of-2024-and-most-anticipated-of-2025-from-staff-and-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here on Wccftech</a>, though, it only won the genre-specific award, whereas the overall Game of the Year went elsewhere.</p>
<p>On another note, the developers have just started releasing free new Astro Bot content. The Tick-Tock Shock level is already out, while four more levels will be rolled out according to the following schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feb 20: Thrust or Bust</li>
<li>Feb 27: Cock-A-Doodle-Doom</li>
<li>Mar 6: Hard to Bear</li>
<li>Mar 13: Armored Hardcore</li>
</ul>
<p>Team Asobi also confirmed that a PS5 Pro update for Astro Bot is on the way, allowing players to enjoy the game at 4K@60 frames per second.</p>
<p><iframe title="Astro Bot Add-On - Tick-Tock Shock | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iI4iROxxkHU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As for the rest of the DICE Awards 2025 winners, Helldivers 2 won four prizes: Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition, Outstanding Achievement in Audio Design, Action Game of the Year, and Online Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which our staff voted as Wccftech's Game of the Year, won in the Outstanding Achievement in Character, Outstanding Achievement in Story, and Adventure Game of the Year categories.</p>
<p>Balatro developer LocalThunk also won three awards: Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement for an Independent Game, and Mobile Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong prevailed in the Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction category, while Metaphor: Refantazio won RPG of the Year.</p>
<p>For the individual award, Don Jones received the Lifetime Achievement Award, while former Insomniac founder and CEO Ted Price (who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/resistance-4-was-unsuccessfully-pitched-to-sony-a-while-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the cancellation of a Resistance 4 project) was officially inducted into the Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege was released in 2015 and has been a stalwart figure in the first-person shooter space ever since. It’s a flagship title for Ubisoft, a live-service title with millions of fans and a booming esports ecosystem. It’s arguably one of the best games in the space that has proven time and again that it has the staying power to weather the ebbing and flowing of the wider industry.</p>



<p>This weekend, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-esports-eliminated-six-invitational-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Six Invitational</a>, a massive $3 million esports event, wraps up in Boston, Massachusetts. It’s expected that Ubisoft will make a grand reveal on the final day of the event – February 16 – outlining the future of Rainbow Six Siege.</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s Yves Guillemot has also alluded to big things being in store for the tactical shooter.</p>

<p>Ubisoft might have struggled with other franchises in recent years, but Rainbow Six is going strong, thanks to Siege. This decade-old tactical shooter has solid player numbers and a pipeline of content updates that show no signs of ending.</p>



<p>I caught up with Ubisoft’s representatives a while back and it was suggested that the company has plans to carry Rainbow Six Siege to <strong>100 Operators </strong>in total before stopping. At the time of publishing, there are 74 Operators, and more are being added all the time.</p>



<p>Despite that note, people have claimed recently that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-2-reveal-si-2025-rumour/">Rainbow Six Siege 2</a> is on the horizon, but I feel that’s unlikely.</p>



<p>During a recent financial update, Ubisoft’s CEO, Yves Guillemot, touched on the future of Rainbow Six, suggesting that something mighty is in store for the franchise:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As you know, we are preparing a big launch for Assassin’s Creed Shadows in the short term. Next year, <strong>we’ll have big plans that will benefit Rainbow Six across all platforms, </strong>that’s focusing well, and that’s a key milestone in the gross plan for the company.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ubisoft has invested extensive time, effort, and money in Rainbow Six Siege. It’s not only a staple of the esports industry, but one of the most consistent shooters in the wider gaming market. It’s available on multiple platforms, has crossplay mechanics, stacks of maps, modes, and weapons, and it’s getting better with time.</p>



<p>Love it or hate it, Rainbow Six Siege is around for the long(er) haul, and more is coming.</p>

<p>Eclipse Glow Games has released an 11-minute gameplay walkthrough for Tides of Annihilation, which was unveiled this week at the State of Play showcase. Tides of Annihilation has been dubbed ‘Stellar Blade meets Elden Ring’, mostly by <strong>me</strong>. I was looped into the development of Tides of Annihilation last year and loved what I saw, and now it’s out there for everyone to admire.</p>



<p>It doesn’t have a release date, but when it drops, Tides of Annihilation will be available on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC platforms. </p>



<p>Check out the full gameplay walkthrough below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-world-bending-battles">World-Bending Battles</h2>



<p>Tides of Annihilation is an innovative and impressive game that has a relatively unique story. It tells the tale of Gwendolyn, one of the last survivors of humanity and a warrior battling to push back dark, otherworldly forces. To do this, she’ll lean on the spectral powers of ancient knights of Arthurian mythology, fighting alongside them in clashes with immense bosses.</p>



<p>It’s set in an apocalyptic rendition of London, and all the landmarks are front and centre for all to see. In that respect, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-annihilation-revealed-by-eclipse-glow-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s quite like Stellar Blade</a>, and the female protagonist with her undeniable sword-based skills adds further credence to that comparison.</p>



<p>Here’s the 11-minute gameplay walkthrough from Tides of Annihilation:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tides of Annihilation - Extended Gameplay Walkthrough" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_hU-lpWlaEs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Tides of Annihilation promises to be a challenging game, but when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-annihilation-interview-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I interviewed the developer</a>, I learned that there will be accessibility considerations made for gamers who want an easier experience. I also learned that there will be extensive customisation opportunities in the game, with players tweaking Gwendolyn’s hair, makeup, outfits, and skill loadouts.</p>



<p>Does Tides of Annihilation look like something you’re eager to play? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
