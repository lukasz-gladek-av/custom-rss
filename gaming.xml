		<p>Watching the trailer for Reach, nDreams Elevation’s latest VR game, it wasn’t the visuals or the story that grabbed my attention and made me want to play the game, but that it seemed to be filled with leaps and dives that would make even me, someone who doesn’t suffer from VR motion sickness, reach for the sick bag. It honestly looked almost unplayable at points, but Elevation is a special team within nDreams that has the time to research and prototype new ways of playing in VR, so I was intrigued to see how they were advancing the format.</p>
<p><iframe title="Reach - Gameplay Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOuzzp4V9HQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game is described as an action-adventure and we’ve had that sort of game in VR before, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/16/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-psvr-2/">Horizon: Call of the Mountain</a> springs to mind, but that always felt quite staid and constrained – you were either moving, climbing, or shooting, one at a time. Reach is much more like a non-VR action adventure where you are performing multiple actions at the same time, chaining together movement and actions to really live in that fantasy.</p>


<p>The first mission, which acts as a tutorial, sets our heroine clambering up city walls, shooting bad guys and running for her life. Rather cleverly, she is a stuntwoman and so the whole first mission is an elongated sequence where she is acting in a movie. Of course there’s a big set piece moment that she’s tasked with performing, to escape from a helicopter, make death defying leaps through windows, clamber around the side of buildings and try and stay on your feet as the building collapses around you. It’s quite exhilarating and reminded me of the chase sequence in the James Bond movie, Spectre.</p>


<p>Skipping ahead a few levels my demo moved deep underground to a mysterious ancient city filled with robots that are not keen on a human poking around. There’s a lot more puzzling in the sections, some of which requires you to work mechanisms to open doors, and other times just to sit and wonder how on earth you are going to reach a certain ledge or doorway. The mechanical puzzles felt satisfying as they usually involve using a weapon rather than just pulling a series switches and there’s lots of audio and visual feedback to let you know if you are getting things right.</p>
<p>The main weapon in Reach is a bow which can be upgraded to fire four different types of arrow, but while a full frontal assault on the enemy robots can work you are also encouraged to use stealth. By sneaking up behind the automatons you can go full Predator and rip their spines out, taking them down in one move and saving your precious arrows. You will also need to work tactically when there are multiple robots, taking them out in an order that will not get you caught.</p>

<p>Adding an extra layer to the platforming and puzzling is your shield, which also lets you play out your Captain America fantasies by flinging it ahead and watching it ricochet with improbable accuracy as it takes out multiple enemies. It can also slotted in to sections of walls to create an extra platform. If that wasn’t enough, yet another upgrade lets you zoom up to the ceiling like Batman using a grapple gun.</p>
<p>Adding all these tools and abilities together creates something rather special. You get to play your way, rather than in a prescribed fashion. In fact you will want to experiment as during playtesting the testers were performing moves that the team didn’t realise were possible, so they added a few extra secrets to discover if you manage to pull off some spectacular.</p>
<p>Looking at screenshot of Reach and you may not be that impressed – it’s certainly pushing the Meta Quest 2 or 3 to its limits, but missing the extra detail allowed by the power of the PSVR 2. It really is a game you have to play to be impressed by, or at least read a glowing preview about. It may not look like it’s doing anything particularly new, we’ve all played VR games with bows and clambering ledges, but it really is one of the most immersive games I have played. All the old ways of making VR comfortable that took you out of the game have been peeled away, and once you have got the hang on the controls it just feels natural.</p>

<p>It’s an odd comparison but to me it feels just as ‘real’ as Beat Saber. That’s the only other game where I have felt completely absorbed in the world and not like I”m playing a VR game. The biggest compliment I can give the game is that I was meant to play it for about 45 minutes but they eventually yanked me out of VR after an hour and a half, and it honestly felt like half that time. If you have been wanting to dust off your VR headset then Reach may just be the game to tempt you.</p>

<figure><a title="madden big patch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c10fce3ee4b2e/madden-big-patch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA Sports</em></figcaption></figure><p>EA Sports has dropped a huge new update for the recently released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden NFL 26</a>. The September 17th patch introduces a large number of fixes, adjustments, and other bits and bobs to a game that does a very solid job of bringing the full Madden experience to handheld - so long as you can take the frame rate hit.</p>
<p>Focusing in on highlights here, this patch (which brings the game to version 1.7) brings defensive adjustments in the midfield that should make runners a little easier to catch, whilst a new mechanic that's been brought over from EA's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ea_sports_college_football_26">College Football</a> franchise allows you to make your own default pass protection system to suit your chosen coach philosophy. Audio and visual effects, some quirky animations and other bugs also see fixes.</p>
<p>You can check out the full, and very long, patch notes over at <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-september-17-2025">EA's site</a>, but here are some highlights for your perusal:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Animation &amp; Visuals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted Small Agile Back hit stick animations to look more realistic and grounded.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue sometimes causing defenders to warp back to their feet when mid-lunge in tackling.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Art</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added additional NFL Player &amp; Coach Likeness Heads</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Indeed, a glance over to the game's forums in the wake of the news of this update, and players seem very happy with the laundry list of changes in the patch notes, most of which have been in response to feedback. So well played there, EA.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">8/10 review</a>, we said Madden NFL 26 is "a very solid port of one of the best outings for this franchise in recent memory. Yes, you'll need to get used to a drop in the frame rate to 40fps on Switch 2, but it's a reasonable downgrade in order to get this type of game running as well as it does on a portable machine."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Wreckreation is the latest game from Three Fields Entertainment, a studio that was founded by <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">former Criterion developers</a> who worked on the beloved Burnout series. Published by THQ Nordic, after Wreckreation was first announced back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/">2022</a>, three years later we have a release date to look forward to, with the open-world driving sandbox arriving on October 28, 2025.</p>



<p>The news was announced alongside a new trailer that showcases the bright vistas and the insane tracks that are possible for players to create in this sandbox title, as Wreckreation is as much about building your own dream tracks as it is racing them.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Wreckreation | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kEMB3PehB38?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>What makes building your own tracks as core to Wreckreation as the actual driving is the fact that you're not swapping from one mode to another if you want to make a change or adjustment to the road in front of you.</p>



<p>Changes to the track, your environment, like the weather or time of day, adding loops, and even adding a slew of decorations can all be done on the fly at the press of a button. With more than 50 cars, and 400 square kilometers of sandbox to run around in, there are plenty of ways you can create your own racing paradise.</p>



<p>Wreckreation will launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 28, 2025, for $39.99/€39.99.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Quest Smash/Grow Is a Mobile Roguelite RPG Coming Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-smash-grow-mobile-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-smash-grow-is-a-mobile-roguelite-rpg-coming-next-year.1300305/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest Smash/Grow</em>, a mobile roguelite RPG that features classic&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>enemies and aesthetics, and you could get a chance to try it out soon.</p>

<p>According to the game's new <a href="https://smashgrow.dragonquest.com/en/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest Smash/Grow&nbsp;</em>is a game in which you'll "smash your way through hordes of monsters", using "<em>Dragon Quest</em>'s signature Coup de Grace attacks" to deal huge damage to them.</p>

<p>Each run will bestow random Blessings on you to augment certain parts of your playstyle, so you'll need to "adapt your battle strategy to match an ever-changing tactical situation", according to Square Enix. The studio says that "no quest is ever the same" in the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-smash-grow-mobile.jpg?itok=kdZ4Fpiu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-smash-grow-mobile.jpg?itok=hAneOuCg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest Smash/Grow&nbsp;</em>brings the series' trademark aesthetics to the mobile roguelite RPG realm.</figcaption></figure><p>Each run of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest Smash/Grow&nbsp;</em>will see you sprinting through a linear level in which groups of enemies will attack you, and you'll need to dispatch them, collecting their crystals to gain Blessings and upgrade yourself.</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Smash/Grow&nbsp;</em>is a roguelite, it's likely that there will be some element of permanent progress as well; perhaps you'll unlock new Blessings for future runs, or maybe you'll progress through a story as each run concludes.</p>

<p>Either way, you may well get a chance to try the game out sooner than later, because a closed beta test is taking place between October 14th and October 21st. Since it's a closed beta, though, you'll need to <a href="https://smashgrow.dragonquest.com/en/cbt/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apply to enter</a>.</p>

<p>The test will require you to have either an iOS device that's equivalent to the iPhone XR or later or an Android device with a Snapdragon 855 SoC (or better, of course). There are 30,000 places available, so make sure to get your application in quickly!</p>




<p>It's all go for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>right now. During <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-september-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">last week's Nintendo Direct show</a>, Square Enix announced a full 3D remake of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest VII</em>, and work is apparently <a href="https://gamerant.com/dragon-quest-12-update-may-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">continuing</a> on&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest XII</em>, although we still don't know too much about the game.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest Smash/Grow&nbsp;</em>is set to come to Android and iOS devices sometime next year, and the closed beta is scheduled to take place in October. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p><span>We’re a week out from the assassination of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk, and the internet is still running wild with new information, commentary, and, as the internet often does, dark jokes. That includes AI slop, and one particular brand of it became so viral that Bandai Namco, or more specifically, the company’s toy division, has released a statement about its logo being used in fake mockups of Gunpla models depicting Kirk’s assassination.</span></p> <p><span>The statement was released on the company’s </span><a href="https://x.com/BandaiCollect/status/1968140558959882612"><span>social media channels</span></a><span>, and while it doesn’t reference Kirk’s death by name, it says that it has been made aware of “AI-generated images circulating online that depict the Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectibles America Inc. logo on packaging associated with graphic or violent content, including references to recent events.” The images, which </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>has verified, include a fake model of the moment Kirk was shot on September 10 at the Utah Valley University campus with a fake Bandai-branded box in the background. The full statement reads as follows:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>We have recently been made aware of AI-generated images circulating online that depict the Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectibles America Inc. logo on packaging associated with graphic or violent content, including references to recent events.</span></p> <p><span>We want to make it unequivocally clear: Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectibles America Inc. strongly condemns any form of violence and does not support or endorse the use of our brand, products, or logo in any such context.

        <p>This is not your parents’ football game or a bloated <a title="Genres > Simulation [834 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> that chases realism at the expense of fun. <em>Mutant Football League 2</em> is a brutal, darkly comedic eight-on-eight arcade-style action-packed football game. Teams of Mutated Super-Humans, Monstrous Orcs, Skeletal Deadheads, and Armored BruiserBots are pit against each other in fantastical arenas packed with deadly traps and sinister hazards like buzzsaws and giant mutant worms.

                <p>Microsoft recently cut thousands of jobs as part of its latest round of mass layoffs, and as part of the drawback, the company also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">canceled the new Perfect Dark and closed its developer, The Initiative.</a></p><p>The studio's top boss, Darrell Gallagher, has now written a eulogy of sorts for Perfect Dark and The Initiative, while also confirming his own departure from Microsoft.</p><p>"After an incredible journey, my time at Xbox has come to a close with the wind-down of Perfect Dark and The Initiative. I couldn't be prouder of the talented and passionate team I had the privilege assemble and lead," Gallagher said on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7373350179040714752/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. "Together, we set out to reimagine an iconic franchise and poured creativity, craft, and dedication into every step of the way. The public reception and excitement for what we were building has been inspiring and deeply appreciated by all of us."</p><p>Gallagher said the "spirit, talent, and achievements" of the developers will live on "well beyond the project."</p><p>"I leave with nothing but pride in what we accomplished together and excitement for what's next--both for myself and for the amazing developers I was fortunate enough to work with. Here's to new adventures and to celebrating the journey we've shared," Gallagher said.</p><p>Gallagher has worked in the video game industry for decades, having spent time at Rockstar Games as a lead artist, then at THQ as studio art director. He later joined Crystal Dynamics and was the art director and later head of studio before being promoted to become head of product development and studios at Square Enix. He joined Activision in 2016 and was a senior vice president and head of development for various Call of Duty games. In 2018, he joined Xbox to establish The Initiative and kick off work on the reimagining of Perfect Dark.</p><p dir="ltr">A report from shortly before the debut of Perfect Dark's gameplay trailer stated the reboot of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-is-allegedly-in-bad-shape/1100-6523261/" data-ref-id="1100-6523261">spy FPS was in bad shape</a> and that the project hadn't "really come together" despite co-developer Crystal Dynamics being brought in to help development. GTA parent company Take-Two apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-almost-got-a-second-chance-at-take-two-report/1100-6534419/" data-ref-id="1100-6534419">almost stepped in to save Perfect Dark</a>, but a deal didn't come together in the end.</p><p dir="ltr">Perfect Dark and The Initiative are just a few of the games and studios to be affected by the latest wave of layoffs at Microsoft. The Initiative was the only studio that was closed, but other studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online</a>, Blizzard, Forza developer Turn 10, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/" data-ref-id="1100-6532918">Call of Duty Black Ops 7 developer Raven Software also saw layoffs</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a> was also canceled.</p>

                <p>Borderlands 4 boss Randy Pitchford is encouraging people to request refunds if they aren't enjoying the newly launched game, and now one publisher known for being cheeky has weighed in and offered up an alternative.</p><p>Devolver Digital said anyone who gets a refund for Borderlands 4 can spend that money on one of its games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3247750/Mycopunk/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mycopunk</a>, which launched in July and costs $15. The game bears some stylistic resemblances to Borderlands 4, and, like that game, is also a co-op shooter set on an alien planet.</p><p>You can buy Mycopunk from GameSpot sister site Fanatical.</p><p>Devolver is known for capitalizing on wider games industry talking points to promote its own games. For example, the publisher has maintained that it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devolver-re-commits-to-releasing-a-game-on-the-same-day-as-gta-6-after-delay/1100-6531291/" data-ref-id="1100-6531291">intentionally launch a game the same day as GTA 6</a>, something the company re-committed to after GTA 6 was delayed to May 2026.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, Pitchford has been posting non-stop since Borderlands 4 launched on September 12. He's involving himself in the discussion about Borderlands 4's PC version, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">calling people "4K stubborn" and disputing reports of performance issues.</a> In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/randy-pitchford-remains-defiant-about-borderlands-4-pc-issues/1100-6534798/" data-ref-id="1100-6534798">one highly publicized post</a>, Pitchford said, "Please get a refund from Steam if you aren't happy with it."</p><p>Exactly how many people are getting Borderlands 4 refunds is unknown. As of September 17, the game remains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam's No. 1 best-selling game in the US.</a> It's also in the top 10 for most-played games on Steam right now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">exceeding 200,000 peak concurrent users today.</a></p><p>Borderlands 4 has a "mixed" aggregate rating on Steam. Developer Gearbox has sent out an alert about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psa-new-borderlands-4-bug-may-steal-all-your-skill-points/1100-6534784/" data-ref-id="1100-6534784">a bug that may erase all of your skill points</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/twilight-imperium-digital-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twilight-imperium-digital-brings-the-legendary-tabletop-game-to-pc.1300266/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Red Square Games and Asmodee have announced&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium Digital</em>, and it is, as you've probably already guessed, a Steam version of the popular (if extremely weighty) tabletop game.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/RedSquare_Games/status/1967984321970540682" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a> on social media, Red Square says the digital version of&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium&nbsp;</em>has been made "with love by fans at Red Square Games and Asmodee", and that the game is for both "the old guard" and "the new heirs".</p>

<p>The game's Steam page describes it as an adaptation of what the two studios call a "legendary board game of galactic conquest" which has been "reimagined for digital play", so there should be a few concessions to make it a little more streamlined on Steam (steamlined?).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/twilight-imperium-digital-board.jpg?itok=FWy1wyn4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/twilight-imperium-digital-board.jpg?itok=K9xAsUQn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>adapts the legendary strategy game for Steam "soon".</figcaption></figure><p>If you're familiar with&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium</em>, you'll probably know how this one's going to play out. Expect a vast game of diplomacy, combat, and exploration in which you'll need to decide whether to trade peacefully with your other players or dominate them with military might.</p>

<p><em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>will offer 17 unique factions, each of which boasts "asymmetric powers and playstyles", and it also promises "massive replayability" thanks to its randomized galaxies and objectives.</p>

<p>If you can't convince anybody else to play this one with you, there's a solo mode in which you can take on a computer opponent, but naturally,&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>will thrive best in multiplayer. The game also supports hotseat and asynchronous play so you can enjoy it "at your own pace".</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium Digital</em>, which should give you a decent sense of how the game will play out in comparison to the tabletop experience, right here.</p>




<p><em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3669430/Twilight_Imperium_Digital/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam right here</a>. Hey, who knows? Maybe this will lead to a digital version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/twilight-imperium-spinoff-twilight-inscription-announced" rel="nofollow">spinoff&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/twilight-imperium-spinoff-twilight-inscription-announced" rel="nofollow">Twilight Inscription</a>&nbsp;</em>somewhere down the line.</p>

Sony started beta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712212/sony-ps5-power-saver-handheld-rumors">testing these features in July</a>, but they’re now rolling out to everyone today in the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/">version 25.06-12.00.00</a> console software update.</p><p>The new Power Saver mode will reduce the power consumption of PS5 consoles in exchange for scaling back game performance, according to Sony’s PS5 update notes, which could come in handy for the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">rumored PlayStation handheld</a>. Power Saving mode can be toggled on or off for supported games by heading into Settings &gt; System &gt; Power Saving &gt; Use Power Saver. When enabled, an icon will appear next to the supported game in Switcher or the control center, according to Sony.</p><p>The software for DualSense and DualSense Edge wireless controllers has also been updated to make it easier to switch them across connected devices. Controllers can now be paired with up to four devices simultaneously, preventing users from having to go through the cumbersome process of manually reconnecting the controller when switching between consoles, PCs, and cloud streaming devices.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/779837/sony-playstation-5-ps5-update-power-saving-mode#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/779837/sony-playstation-5-ps5-update-power-saving-mode]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Yaaarrr. There be a fresh report about the long-rumoured <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> remake Ubisoft have still yet to publicly acknowledge. It claims the publisher are currently looking to release the retooled piracy game in early 2026, as well as providing more alleged details as to how the remake'll differ from the original.</p>
<p>This Black Flag remake's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">reported to be in development</a> several times over the past couple of years, with the voice actor of original protagonist Edward Kenway <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-claims-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-over-remake-tease">alleging that he got in trouble</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships">being recorded teasing it at a convention</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>Enter this video report from French publication Jeux Vidéo Magazine. They cite sources as having told them that Ubisoft are currently aiming to release the remake early next year, with March being the month it's most likely to make port. That said, Jeux Vidéo Magazine also cite some sources as having cast doubt over that and indicated it could be pushed towards the end of 2026, due to there allegedly being a lot of work left to do at this point.</p><p>The report also details a number of tweaks that developers Ubisoft Singapore, along with support studios Ubisoft Bordeaux and Ubisoft Belgrade are supposedly making to the original, mostly to bring Black Flag in line with the series' more recent entries. Parts of the present-day sections that saw you coming out of the Animus and wandering around the office of Abstergo Entertainment are reportedly being swapped out for more adventures set in the past, with cut content involving pirate Mary Read making up part of that.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be too big a surprise, given the series has moved away from hefty present day elements of late, having adjusted to life without early protagonist Desmond Mason spearheading the non-past assassin/templar bickering. This year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features very little to take you out of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review">murdering your way through feudal Japan</a>, unless you're prepared to muck about in the Animus Hub menus or spend too long staring at a warning about fragmented memories.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jeux Vidéo Magazine report that the inventory and combat systems have been overhauled in a more RPG-style fashion that'll bring them closer to the likes of Shadows and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Valhalla</a>. Tech-wise, we can apparently expect improvements like load-screenless sailing, smaller islands being less barren, and the use of Shadows' engine making things look a bit less dated.</p>
<p>We reached out to Ubisoft for comment, and the publishers responded that they "haven’t got anything to share" right now.</p>
<p>My feelings are a bit mixed at the moment as to whether this Black Flag remaster'll have much to offer over just firing up the original again for some very good piracy and assassining that's also there. Then again, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, a revamp which left me quite on the fence about its deliberately minimal tweakage outside of the obvious facelift, proved plenty popular earlier this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-seems-to-be-clearing-out-the-2025-m4-macbook-air-at-an-all-time-low-before-amazon-prime-big-deal-days.1300254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Greater minds than ours have been driven crazy trying to predict what’s coming out of Cupertino, and when it’s coming. Now that Apple’s gotten the iPhone 17 and new AirPods drops out of the way, will there be new MacBooks on the horizon? One set of tea leaves to keep an eye on is the deals they’re offering on their current models, and right now seemingly out of nowhere, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">the 13-inch 2025 M4 MacBook Air is just $800 at Amazon — its lowest price ever.</a></p>
<p>Does that mean there’s a new MacBook Air right around the corner? Who knows — early 2026 is a better bet. But this $800 deal on the current flagship of the MacBook Air fleet is very real, and we can’t imagine it going much lower if at all when the 2025 holiday rush starts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 For the Win</h2>
<p>One day there will be an M5 chip driving a new line of MacBooks, but until then, you cannot beat the M4 for speed and sheer processing power. This M4 MacBook Air runs twice as fast as the M1 models that were all the rage more recently than we realize, and a staggering 23 times faster than the last Intel powered models of the MacBook Air.</p>
<p>Of course, the one consistent calling card of any MacBook is the display, and this MacBook Air’s 13.6-inch Liquid Retina screen supports a billion colors, all delivered with brilliance and sharpness. Pair that screen with the 12MP Center Stage camera, three microphones, and four Spatial Audio speakers built into the MacBook Air, and your video calls will always be peak. The M4 processor, Spatial Audio speakers, and Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 connections make the 2025 MacBook Air a streaming and gaming superstar.</p>



<h2>Apple-Style AI</h2>
<p>The 2025 M4 MacBook Air comes with Apple Intelligence built in, with incredible speed and ability as an assistant for research, productivity, or pretty much anything else you want it to do for you. All those searches are yours and yours alone too, because Apple Intelligence has some of the best and most robust privacy features of any AI system — so private that even Apple can’t get to your search history.</p>
<p>Trying to read the smoke signals from Apple about how and when to jump on&nbsp;<em>the</em> best deal is, honestly, often a waste of time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">What we can tell you is that this $800 deal on the 13-inch 2025 M4 MacBook Air is the lowest price ever for this laptop at Amazon</a>, and that the M4 MacBook Air is worth every penny of the price regardless of when the next-gen MacBooks drop.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">During last week's Nintendo Direct, Square Enix surprised Dragon Quest fans with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-7-remake-announced-after-months-of-speculation/1100-6534696/">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>, a remake of the classic PlayStation RPG from the year 2000. It seems Square Enix was not done with the surprise Dragon Quest reveals, as today the company announced Dragon Quest Smash/Grow, a roguelite RPG for mobile devices that will enter a closed beta test next month.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest Smash/Grow tasks players with fighting hordes of enemies at once, "smashing" through their ranks in order to "grow" their characters with experience and loot. Once powerful enough, players can then unleash powerful Coup de Grace attacks in order to finish the enemy armies off.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3mPefOfho" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6U3mPefOfho" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The roguelite mechanic in Dragon Quest Smash/Grow is called Blessings, which are chosen from randomly generated options throughout the course of a run. Each run will depend on the Blessings made available to a player throughout the adventure; as is typical with roguelite games, no two runs will feel exactly alike.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest Smash/Grow will be available for both iOS and Android devices. A closed beta test for Dragon Quest Smash/Grow has been announced for October 14-21. Players can pre-regiser for the beta test on iOS using TestFlight, Android via the Google Play Store, and at the <a href="https://smashgrow.dragonquest.com/en/cbt" rel="nofollow ">game's official website</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Square Enix has been busy with reveals over the past few months across many of its RPG franchises. Along with Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and Smash/Grow, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade was confirmed for a January 22 release on Nintendo Switch 2, while Octopath Traveler 0 and The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales were both announced over the summer.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>If you've played any PC or console games over the last 12 months, there's a good chance that at least one of them was a remake or a remaster. That's according to new research, which found that not only have these games been popular with the people they polled for this research, they've also been "desirable" diversions.</p><p>Specialist strategy and insights consultancy firm MTM (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/90-of-gamers-have-played-a-remake-or-remaster-finds-new-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesIndustry.Biz</a>) polled 1,500 people--750 people each in the US and the UK--who play games regularly. "Our report shows that there is a strong appeal for remakes and remasters, but it's a tight balancing act for studios to get right," said Martin Bradley, head of gaming at MTM. "Many of these games are far out-selling their original release."</p>

<p>MTM also revealed that 85% of the people who played a remaster or remake in the last year had not even played the original version of the game, so this wasn't entirely a case of nostalgia guiding their choices. That being said, MTM added that nostalgia is still a powerful influence, even when gamers understand that they might be missing out on fresher and novel gameplay experiences by choosing reimagined games over newer titles.</p><p>It hasn't been difficult to find a remastered game either, as publishers have focused their efforts on reviving classic games in addition to new projects. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/">one of the best-selling games of the year so far</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, and the House of the Dead 2: Remake were all released this year, and looking ahead, remakes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-4-remake-sounds-like-its-still-a-long-ways-away/1100-6532621/">Persona 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-indefinitely/1100-6487180/">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-celebrates-splinter-cell-20th-anniversary-shares-remake-concept-art/1100-6509255/">Splinter Cell</a> are also on the way.</p><p>Nintendo has also been keenly aware of the value of its older games for years now, and while it has produced several remakes and remasters, it's even going a step further this year by remaking its flop Virtual Boy console--sort of.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pass-is-adding-nintendos-biggest-flop-virtual-boy/1100-6534695/">Virtual Boy functionality is coming</a> February 17, 2026, to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass, and to play these games, you'll need a new accessory modeled after the original console that you can slot your Switch or Switch 2 device into.</p>

            <p>
Four more games will be leaving PS Plus next month, as part of the subscription service's latest catalogue refresh.
</p>
<p>
From 21st October, the following games will no longer be available to subscribers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Battlefield 1 (PS4)</li>
<li>Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Tour de France 2023 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>The Last Clockwinder (PSVR2)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The loss of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a> will mostly be redeemed by the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> on 10th October. Today, we reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-players-on-ps5-and-xbox-can-block-pc-users-from-crossplay-as-studio-takes-cheating-extremely-seriously">console only cross-play has been confirmed</a>. Battlefield 1 is also getting on for nine years old, and if you really want to play it can be bought cheaply.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed">Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed</a>, an asymmetrical multiplayer game that essentially simulates what it would be like to be a Ghostbuster, didn't review that well on release but has gone on to carry plenty of positive sentiment amongst players.</p>
<p>
However, the loss of a PSVR2 game in The Last Clockwinder is another small blow for Sony's ailing VR device.

<p>Cuts quite the figure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/curse_of_the_dead_gods">Curse of the Dead Gods</a> is an excellent roguelike in the now-classical <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> vein, one that earned itself a lovely 8/10 from us back when it released, and Passtech Games' follow-up to that cracker, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ravenswatch">Ravenswatch</a>, is also quite the banger itself, sitting pretty as it currently is on a very nice score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ravenswatch/">84 on Metacritic</a>.</p>
<p>Think Hades but with heroes, villains and settings plucked from twisted versions of the fairytales of your youth, and you're pretty much there. It's a goodie from a team with a good track record, in short, and today it's getting a free update called Hourglass of Dreams.</p>
<p>Here are some quick details from the press blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In</em> <em>Ravenswatch</em><em>, there is a constant intangible threat: time management. Defenders of the world of Reverie have 3 days and 3 nights (18 minutes) per level before the Master Nightmare awakens. The Hourglass of Dreams update has a significant impact on each run, as it allows players to earn additional rewards by completing a level ahead of schedule. The faster the heroes challenge and defeat the Master Nightmare, the greater the rewards.</em></p>
<p><em>Conversely, they can now decide to take their time to explore the level further and try to strengthen themselves as much as possible, up to 3 minutes after the Master Nightmare awakens. But this additional time comes at a heavy price: depending on its duration, the boss becomes increasingly formidable, with exponentially increased damage and health points!"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The free update also includes character rebalances, more environments, new side activities and quests, with something called the Leprechaun's Cauldron, a Jack and the Beanstalk challenge and more besides!<em><br></em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-games-are-more-likely-to-be-held-back-by-their-pc-ports-than-the-handheld.1300203/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The now-inevitable PC ports, not the rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/">PlayStation handheld</a>, will likely be why <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-6/">PlayStation 6</a> games may not push the system to its absolute limits.</p>



<p>During a new episode of the Moore's Law is Dead <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO7jZFz97Tg">Broken Silicon podcast</a>, Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk commented on the rumored next-gen systems by Sony, making some interesting observations on how the handheld system is unlikely to hold back the home console. First, the developer highlighted how we are in a post-resolution era where a game such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-surpassing-xbox-series-s/">Street Fighter 6 looks better on Nintendo Switch 2 than on Xbox Series S</a>, thanks to NVIDIA DLSS, even though it runs at a lower resolution on the Nintendo system. By focusing on resolution targets, rather than scaling down visual settings, which most devs apparently find more impactful, scaling down games from their home console version to their handheld version shouldn't be a huge hurdle, especially if the leaked specs are correct and using upscaling tech like PSSR and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/amd-fsr-4/">AMD FSR 4</a>, which is getting better and better rather quickly.</p>



<p>Even if the differences between the home PlayStation 6 and the handheld system end up being bigger than the leaked specs suggest, there likely won't be a repeat of the Xbox Series X and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-series-s/">Xbox Series S</a> situation, mostly due to market share. Considering Sony's current share and what the handheld should be able to achieve in a market that's more than ever favorable for these devices, it won't be too difficult to set the portable PlayStation as the baseline system, something that Microsoft never had the chance to do for the Series S with its market share.</p>



<p>According to Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk, the now inevitable PC ports have a higher chance of holding back PlayStation 6 games. Nowadays, every PlayStation console game is being developed with a PC port that will follow the console release in mind. Having to take into consideration different system configurations, many sporting dated hardware like entry-level GPUs from a few generations back, and storage bottlenecks, developers are unlikely to create a game that pushes a console to its absolute limit if this will eventually lead to issues developing the PC port down the line.  The developer makes the examples of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, a multiplatform port which remade a game that pushed the PlayStation 2 to its limits that doesn't look much better than Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and has a lot of technical issues, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, a current PS5-only game that takes serious advantage of the system and pushes the Decima Engine to its absolute limits. Metroid Prime Remastered is also an example of a console-exclusive game that pushed a console, the Nintendo Switch, to its limits thanks to the fact that no PC port had to be considered. With AMD not having the market share to push the widespread adoption of any new feature it may develop for the next generation of consoles, it is easy to see how having to port games to PC will likely impact how they will take advantage of the new hardware.</p>

<p>Considering how much the video game market has changed in the past few years, it will be fascinating to see how Sony and Microsoft will face the challenges ahead with the PlayStation 6 and Xbox Next. Though nothing is officially known about the two systems, leaks suggest the two companies will tackle these challenges in<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/"> very different ways</a>, which will make the next generation one of the most interesting in a very long time.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/779062/nintendo-pokemon-summoning-battle-patent</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-nintendo-and-pok%C3%A9mon-did-not-patent-%E2%80%98summoning-characters-and-making-them-battle%E2%80%99.1300200/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As first noted by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/"><em>Games Fray</em></a> last week, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company were granted a US patent earlier this month involving summoning characters and making them battle. Headlines popped up with similarly vague language as concern spread on social media: That’s a thing in tons of games! Can they do that? Is that even <em>allowed</em>?</p><p>Well, no, because that’s not exactly what they patented. And what they <em>did</em> patent might not stand up to any hypothetical challenges in court.</p><p>The patent in question, <a href="https://gamesfray.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US12403397B2-2025-09-02.pdf">US Patent No. 12,403,397</a>, was filed in March 2023. It does involve summoning and battle mechanics, but it’s more specific than that: The claims describe a system that sounds a lot like auto-battling from <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, in which the player can send a pokémon into the overworld to automatically fight wild pokémon rather than initiating a typical turn-based battle that the player controls.</p><p>The patent outlines the process by which, after the player has summoned a “sub character,” a game’s software would determine whether to initiate a player-controlled battle, an automatic battle with the sub character, or automatic movement by that same sub character. In general <em>Pokémon </em>terms: Say you’re out in the world and you summon your pokémon by throwing its ball. Did you throw it <em>at</em> a wild pokémon? That’s a regular battle. Did you throw it <em>near</em> a wild pokémon? Your pokémon will come out of its ball and start an auto battle. Did you throw it far away from wild pokémon? Your pokémon will come out of its ball and walk around.</p><p>It’s not a patent solely on summoning characters to fight enemies, or on automatically resolving battles — it’s the whole web of options as described in the claim. But that by itself doesn’t mean the patent isn’t concerning for other game developers. Whether this particular patent could unreasonably restrict the mechanics of other games is in part determined by any given court’s interpretation of the patent and the law.</p><p>Charles Duan, an assistant professor at American University Washington College of Law whose research has included software copyrights and patent eligibility, told <em>The Verge</em> over email that there are two main ways one could potentially invalidate this specific patent: by anticipation or obviousness, and by subject matter eligibility.</p><p>To illustrate the first point, Duan said the process outlined in Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s patent reminded him of <em>StarCraft</em>, in which the player can give units an “attack-move” order to automatically battle enemies or, alternatively, micromanage a battle themself. “If an old game like Starcraft, which obviously predates the 2022 earliest filing date of this patent, had all the features that this patent claims, then that invalidates the patent under the patent law rules of ‘anticipation’ or ‘obviousness,’” Duan said.</p><p>However, he added, the arguments in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17573221740001310271">cases like these</a> can “get really technical,” and it tends to be easier to argue that a patent is invalid on the basis of subject matter eligibility instead.</p><p>Subject matter eligibility “focuses on whether the patent’s claims are (1) directed to an abstract idea and (2) contain no inventive step beyond that idea,” Duan explained. In short, you can patent a specific process that’s unique, but you can’t patent an abstract idea.</p><p>“As for (1), basic human business practices and organizations are typically treated as abstract ideas,” Duan added. “Here, the various types of automatic and directed combat sound a lot like ordinary military hierarchies: Generals tell soldiers where to go, and depending on orders the soldiers might follow orders to fight enemies near them, move toward enemies on their own initiative, or receive a destination and automatically fight enemies along the way—all the key parts of [the patent’s claims]. So there would be a pretty good argument that the patent claims are directed to an abstract idea.”</p><p>The concerns about this patent aren’t totally unfounded: Nintendo is definitely willing to use patents to defend its turf in court. In September 2024, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">filed a patent infringement lawsuit</a> in Japan against <em>Palworld</em> developer Pocketpair. That lawsuit, which is ongoing, involves <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291232/nintendo-pocketpair-palworld-lawsuit-patents">a few different Japanese patents</a> filed in 2024 related to throwing a ball at characters in a field, as well as riding characters. US Patent No. 12,403,397, by comparison, was filed in the US in March 2023, before Pocketpair had shown any gameplay footage from <em>Palworld</em>. (<em>Palworld</em> was released in early access in January 2024.) Nintendo of America is also behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eternal-darkness-infamous-sanity-system-patent-has-expired-so-can-anyone-now-copy-it">an infamous patent</a> <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6935954B2/en">filed in 2000</a> on the “sanity system” from <em>Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem</em>, in which the player character’s decreasing “sanity” level can result in trippy visual effects and gameplay-related consequences meant to evoke a sort of mental breakdown. That patent expired in 2021.</p><p>Duan noted that it’s hard to predict how a court will read and interpret a patent, so we can’t say for certain just from reading it whether it’ll stand up to any hypothetical challenges in court. But it does seem like this patent might not be <em>quite</em> as threatening to other game developers and publishers as it sounds in a headline-length description.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/779062/nintendo-pokemon-summoning-battle-patent#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjY1MTI2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Kallie Plagge</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/779062/nintendo-pokemon-summoning-battle-patent]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As the long, long wait for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> goes on, the developers of MMO <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> have seen players take to their game to scratch their Elder Scrolls itch. In fact, they even saw a player bump following the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remarkably, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim came out nearly 14 years ago, in November 2011. Its sequel, Skyrim, was officially announced with a teaser trailer at E3 2018 an eye-watering eight years ago. Yes, Skyrim has released on multiple platforms in the years in-between (so many in fact that it’s become a Bethesda meme), but there’s a tangible clamouring for a fresh Elder Scrolls experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter, The Elder Scrolls Online.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">ESO launched in 2014 and struggled at first, but 11 years later it’s still here and continues to receive updates. The development team at ZeniMax Online Studios have survived multiple rounds of Microsoft layoffs, game shutdowns and studio closures, and recently reshuffled the game’s leadership team to help it survive another 20 years. A significant overhaul is planned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-dont-think-its-much-of-a-stretch-for-the-game-to-go-30-years-the-elder-scrolls-online-developers-promise-big-changes-following-internal-shakeup">In an interview with IGN at gamescom 2025</a>, ESO game director Nick Giacomini and studio-wide director Rich Lambert said they’ve seen plenty of anecdotal evidence that suggests Elder Scrolls fans are playing ESO as a single-player game to help fill the void while they wait for The Elder Scrolls 6 to come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hear that a lot,” Lambert said. “It's really interesting over the years going to the various shows and community events, you hear that a lot, right? I can't tell you how many times I've answered the, ‘When's TES 6 coming?’ ‘What’s TES 6?’ ‘Tell me!’ And it’s like… That’s a different studio, right? But yes, people are super passionate about Elder Scrolls. For a lot of people, this has been their home because they love Elder Scrolls and they just want to play more of it, and we're able to provide that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Lambert, a lot of ESO players play the MMO like a single-player game, which it is well suited to after the developer tweaked how the game worked following its troubled launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the early days, at launch, we tried to walk this kind of tightrope where it was MMO and Elder Scrolls, and we didn't really hit either one particularly well,” Lambert explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And when we decided we were going to make it Elder Scrolls first and then MMO second, that helped solve a lot of the problems. And we started to see the players coming in and saying, ‘Oh, you mean I can solo all of this stuff? Oh, I don't have to play with other players. They just happen to be there.’ And then you have these organic things that happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's a lot of people that play the game that way. And then there's a lot of people that just do housing or just PVP or just play the card game. We built on more systems to that over time, but at its core, a lot of players do play it like a single-player game.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Elder Scrolls Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda released Oblivion Remastered earlier this year and it proved to be hugely popular. You’d think, then, that its release would have negatively impacted ESO’s player numbers. It did, for a while, Lambert revealed, but then player numbers were boosted after those who finished Oblivion Remastered were left hungry for more Elder Scrolls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Oblivion Remaster was another big thing,” Lambert said. “That came out and we were like, ‘Okay, that's going to hit our numbers for a while.’ And there was a small blip and then the numbers went up. Kind of like the Fallout show. We were like, ‘Wow, this is cool. Right?’ So yeah, it's interesting."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nick Giacomini added: “we saw a lot of new and lapsed players come back very quickly after [Oblivion Remastered], and it continued actually for quite some time. It was pretty exciting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, ESO continues to benefit from the wait for The Elder Scrolls 6, but what’s the latest on the hugely anticipated game? The studio confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-officially-in-early-development-but-dont-expect-to-hear-about-it-soon"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 had entered "early development" in August 2023</u></a>, and "early builds" were available in March 2024. The six year anniversary of the announcement arrived in June last year and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while"><u>Bethesda development chief Todd Howard paused to say, "oh wow, that has been a while."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January this year, The Elder Scrolls 6’s June 10, 2018 announcement <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced"><u>became as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls 6 was thought to be set for 2028 at the earliest, presumably on the next-generation of consoles as well as PC. If it does launch then, it’ll do so an incredible 17 years after Skyrim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Alongside side the 1.0 launch, Escape from Tarkov is finally coming to Steam. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, a quick study of Escape from Tarkov's <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/support/knowledge/542" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>FAQs</u></a> reveals that even those who've been playing the shooter through its bespoke launcher for years "must purchase" the game again if they'd like to add it to their Steam libraries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To play Escape from Tarkov through Steam, you must purchase any edition of the game on Steam," the FAQ explains. "You can then link your existing Battlestate Games account with an active copy of the game to your Steam profile. If the editions differ, it will automatically use the higher edition of the two when launching the game through Steam."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While players will continue to be able to play via Battlestate's own launcher, some fans have slammed the developer for not providing free Steam keys, particularly as both Steam and launcher players will share the same servers, and all players, regardless of platform, require a Battlestate account. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are no excuses for buying an extra Steam copy just to play from an existing account," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1nikisx/there_are_no_excuses_for_buying_an_extra_steam/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> one player.

The fact that you can link an existing account and it automatically upgrades to the higher version is what doesn't sit right with me. You drop $30 for the Standard Edition just to link and upgrade to your $120 [Edge of Darkness edition]? You're just buying in to play your account on Steam at that point."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's droves of people who have been waiting for years to have a place to put their grievances where it might actually matter to do so," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1nikisx/comment/nemz7j0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested</u></a> one player. "No doubt, the moment that players have the opportunity to leave a Steam review, they're going to. However, you can't leave a Steam review on a game you don't own. Therefore, any of the many long-time players that have been repeatedly burned by [the developer] are not likely to spend any more money on his dogs**t. Therefore, the only reviews will be from new players that get the full 1.0 experience, without all the years of disappointment behind it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't get why people act surprised all of a sudden," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1nikisx/comment/nejo8v5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> someone else. "And knowing how toxic and hateful this community has become over the years, if they handed free keys to everyone, the reviews would instantly get thrown into a s**tstorm of hate even from people who haven't played in a few years."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are reminding those upset players that anyone can <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4B8B-9697-2338-40EC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>add non-Steam games to their Steam library</u></a>, although, obviously, this is just a shortcut and doesn't unlock any Steam features like achievements.

                <p>EA's new Skate game, the first in 15 years, launched this week and put up big numbers on Steam for its early-access release. The launch hasn't gone over totally smoothly, however, as players encountered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-server-queues-lead-to-complaints-about-always-online-requirement/1100-6534790/" data-ref-id="1100-6534790">server issues and other problems</a>. Another issue people are reporting is a "softlock" problem that prevents people from accessing certain points in the skateboarding game.</p><p>"We've seen a lot of reports on getting softlocked in various points--the Isle of Grom Tutorial, various Missions and/or Challenges," the developer <a href="https://forums.ea.com/idea/skate-bug-reports-en/softlock-mega-thread/12581740" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote in the game's forums</a>.

Players should submit information like what platform they're on, what specific mission or challenge is affected, and their username.</p><p>"Thanks for your patience. We're on it," EA said.</p><p>Skate is a free-to-play, always-online game, and the servers ran into issues on launch day. There was an "ongoing outage" overnight that prompted EA to conduct maintenance--and <a href="https://x.com/SkateStatus/status/1968127349284811247" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">that's now resolved.</a></p><p>The version of Skate people are playing now is unfinished and known to include bugs and other issues, which is pretty standard for early-access games. EA and Full Circle have said they will examine feedback to try to make the full release better whenever it's ready.</p><p>Skate is out now for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game reached <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 80,000 peak concurrent users today on Steam</a>, and that's just on one platform.</p>

<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1967660763499405407">Nintendeal</a> on X (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-cant-believe-a-days-of-our-lives-character-just-name-dropped-a-mid-tier-rpg-franchise-while-flirting">IGN</a>), the moment occurred when Aaron Greene attempted to invite Arianna Horton into his room by asking if she wants to "come play Xenoblade on my Switch". Looking like she just couldn't let the poor guy down, Arianna actually agreed and said "wow, uh, yeah, yeah sure".</p>

<p>It's not the first time a Nintendo franchise has been name-dropped in a TV show, and nor will it be the last, but usually it's the likes of Mario or Zelda that are the go-to franchises for something like this.</p>
<p>Here, however, the fact that Xenoblade is name-dropped indicates that the writer of this particular scene may be a fan; or at the very least is aware of the RPG series from developer Monolith Soft.</p>
<p>It's gone down well with fans, regardless, with user <a href="https://x.com/ZhenghuaYang">Zhenghua Yang</a> stating "This show has 61 seasons and I've never seen any bit of it until Xenoblade was mentioned. Top tier marketing."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As the weather starts cooling down and we start spending incrementally more time indoors week after week, there’s never been a better time to get yourself an iPad. Whether you plan on using it to catch up on emails, to doomscroll on your preferred social media app, or to just pour more hours into&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>but on a larger screen than your phone, the Apple iPad Air might be what you’re looking for. This 2025 model iPad normally starts at $599, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4143/">Amazon is running a limited time deal that’s bringing the price down by 25%. This $150 savings means you’ll only have to pay as low as $449.</a></p>
<p>This $449 discounted price is for the Wi-Fi-only 128GB model. There are three other storage sizes available—each with their own $150 discount. You can get the 256GB model for just $549, the 512GB model for just $749, or the 1TB model for just $949. If you want to add on cellular, the discounts are slightly different. The 128GB, 256GB and 1TB models are down $150 still but the 512GB model is only down $84.</p>
<p>For all combinations of storage or cellular capabilities, you can choose between four stylish colors. Pick either blue, purple, space gray, or starlight.</p>

<h2>Powerful Performance</h2>
<p>So AI has been a pretty big buzzword this past year. Will it be the future of consumer tech? Or is it just a speculative fixation like we went through with NFTs. We’ll find out in due time. Though for right now, Apple and companies like it have promised a ton to consumers with the inclusion of their own proprietary AI models they’re sticking into their products. Apple has Apple Intelligence which can be used to help you craft messages, generate images, and things of the like. The M3 chip is powerful enough to make local processing for Ai models such as this possible.</p>



<p>Beyond AI, the M3 chip allows for improved performance on power-hungry apps, letting you run them side-by-side with each other with no hiccups. Graphically intensive games also get a boost.</p>
<p>To get the full use out of your Apple iPad Air, you can pick up the Apple Pencil Pro (sold separately). Use it to quickly jot down notes, draw or edit photos, and more. It’s compatible with tons of productivity and art apps on the App Store.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4143/">Finally get yourself that iPad you’ve been telling yourself you would with the 2025 model iPad Ai powered by Apple’s M3 chipset</a>. Most versions are on sale right now for $150 off.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mutant-football-league-2/">Mutant Football League 2</a> developer Digital Dreams has announced that the game will officially launch for PC and console on <strong>December 10</strong>. Originally launching in early access last year on PC--and in February 2025 on Xbox Series X|S via Game Preview--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-isnt-the-only-football-game-you-can-play-to-get-hyped-for-the-super-bowl/1100-6529297/">the NFL Blitz meets Evil Dead sports game</a> is the successor to the 2017 cult-classic football game, with the franchise first kicking off in the '90s under creator Michael Mendheim.</p><p>Like EA's popular Madden series, Mutant Football League 2 is focused on the rough-and-tough sport, but it's arguably better because you can tackle the opposition so violently that they can explode into a gory cloud of pink mist. The game mixes a dark sense of humor with 8-vs-8 arcade-style action between teams of Orcs, mutants, undead skeletons, and murderous robots. To make things even more ultraviolent, each arena is packed with deadly traps and sinister hazards like buzzsaws and giant mutant worms.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mutant Football League - Official Release Date Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Basically, if you're looking for an anti-Madden football game, this will probably appeal to you as you'll have to guide a team of rookies to the top of the Mutant Football League through its single-player season, Dynasty Supreme franchise mode, and online multiplayer.</p><p>Some of the big features in the sequel include 36 MFL teams to choose from, buildcrafting to power up your team's abilities with legal performance-enhancers like Skillroids, and the opportunity to create your very own stadium loaded with deathtraps.</p><p>"Mutant League is my bastard child that I've loved since its inception in the early nineties. And now, against all odds, our small team of passionate and dedicated developers has managed to resurrect it for a new generation," said creative director Michael Mendheim. "At its core, it’s fun, hard-hitting, and unpredictable--easy to pick up and play, yet layered with depth and strategy."</p><p>If you're interested in scoring a few vicious touchdowns, you can pick up the game on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p>
