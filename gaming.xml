			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2024-with-or-against-friends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024</a> brought players a few noteworthy new multiplayer games, but it's safe to say 2025 performed much better, delivering many excellent releases that captivated the attention of millions of players and reinforced the idea that cooperation is at the core of the best multiplayer experiences, whether or not competition is involved. It also showed that there's plenty of space for unconventional experiences, too, particularly when the game mechanics can make players depend on each other.</p>

<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-9">Elden Ring Nightreign (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9</a>)</h2>



<p>FromSoftware has never been a studio that focuses squarely on multiplayer in its games. Ever since Demon's Souls, their co-op approach has been intentionally minimal: mainly asynchronous, with limited direct interactions, and ultimately designed to enhance the single-player loop without fundamentally altering it. Before the upcoming multiplayer-focused Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive The Duskbloods, it was the launch of Elden Ring Nightreign that proved how the Japanese studio plans to evolve their multiplayer design going forward (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-duskbloods-will-feature-over-12-playable-characters-fromsoftware-isnt-abandoning-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without abandoning single player games</a>, or so they claim anyway).</p>



<p>This standalone survival co-op experience showed everyone that FromSoftware knows how to innovate even in the multiplayer space. In Nightreign, three players band together as Nightfarers to survive a three-day-and-night cycle. The Night's Tide gradually contracts the explorable map, taking a cue from Battle Royale modes, funneling players toward increasingly dangerous bosses that culminate in a confrontation with the Nightlord itself. Instead of exploring at your own pace like in Elden Ring, the world is actively collapsing around you, demanding constant decision-making about which areas to loot, which boss fights to engage, and which paths lead toward salvation or defeat.</p>



<p>Boss encounters, which feature many remixed classics with new mechanics tailored to the game's three-player party composition, demand coordinated tactics. One player cannot simply tank while others DPS; all three must understand positioning, dodge timing, and damage windows. There cannot be a weak link in an Elden Ring Nightreign; every player must contribute meaningfully. Of course, eventually, someone is bound to fall. In most co-op multiplayer games, when that happens, you simply revive them through a contextual button prompt. Here, though, you must actually attack them, damaging their downed meter to restore them to life; yet another of FromSoftware's ways to distinguish themselves from the pack.</p>



<p>Movement mechanics have been understandably overhauled for co-op pacing. Wall-jumping, spectral hawk traversal (briefly holding onto flying hawks for aerial repositioning), and zero-damage falls encourage vertical exploration and constant forward momentum, in another major shift from the regular Elden Ring experience.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the eight unique Nightfarers each possess distinct movesets and Ultimate abilities. Unlike traditional FromSoftware games, where weapon choice defines your playstyle, Nightreign demands character mastery. Your chosen Nightfarer's unique abilities, including area-of-effect ultimates, defensive shields, and mobility enhancements, become your team's tactical foundation. Squad composition and constant communication are critical to success.</p>



<p>The result of this experimentation is something entirely new. Not merely a Souls game with expanded multiplayer, but a multiplayer game with strong FromSoftware DNA, and one that players are enjoying immensely, as evidenced by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong sales</a> that even <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-in-the-works-fromsoftware-kadokawa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed the expectations of parent company Kadokawa</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/battlefield6-image-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-8-5">Battlefield 6 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.5</a>)</h2>



<p>Unlike Battlefield 2042, Battlefield 6 reintroduced a proper single player campaign to the shooter franchise. This mode's development was spearheaded by Motive Studios, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drawing inspiration from acclaimed military and war movies and TV shows</a>. The story mode did not resonate with either reviewers or fans, but that didn't meaningfully harm the game's reception, proving once again that Battlefield is primarily about that trademark squad-based multiplayer experience.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 arrived as the franchise's most confident statement in nearly a decade. Its developers remembered the lesson that large-scale multiplayer warfare thrives when environment design and player agency converge into tactical possibilities.</p>



<p>Every weapon recoil pattern was painstakingly calibrated, and gunplay feels responsive and skill-rewarding without abandoning accessibility. Every movement option available to players, such as tactical rolls, vehicle-clinging, and wall-mounted weapon positioning, serves a tactical purpose. Arguably, one of the biggest changes is the ability to drag downed teammates behind cover before reviving. This transforms squad survival from the binary dead or alive into a spectrum that rewards positioning and timing.</p>



<p>As a direct response to the failure of 2042's Specialist system, the beloved Battlefield class system (Assault, Engineer, Support, Recon) returns with a clearer role definition than recent entries. Assault players excel at aggressive momentum; Engineers anchor defensive positions with gadgets; Support sustains squad viability through resource provision; Recon provides tactical information through reconnaissance tools. No class is truly complete on its own, thus reinforcing the philosophy that the squad must complement each other's skillsets to excel.</p>



<p>The vehicle implementation exceeded expectations. Helicopters, jets, tanks, trucks, and APCs provide legitimate tactical alternatives to infantry that are powerful in the right situation. The vehicle-to-infantry balance feels carefully calibrated: helicopters are strong but vulnerable to coordinated anti-aircraft fire, jets provide air superiority but demand skilled pilots, and tanks excel at area control but suffer against coordinated squad tactics. Just like with classes, vehicles must be supported by other vehicles and the infantry.</p>



<p>Portal mode returned as DICE's creative sandbox, allowing players to remix maps, customize rule sets, and build custom game modes with more tools than ever. Season 1 added three new maps (Blackwell Fields, a new large-scale map featuring the armored APC Traverser Mark 2) alongside seasonal variants of existing maps, demonstrating genuine post-launch commitment.</p>



<p>The free-to-play Battle Royale component, REDSEC, didn't quite obtain the same level of praise as the core Battlefield 6 modes, but there's still time to improve it during the game's live service phase.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Peak-Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-peak">Peak</h2>



<p>Often, the most innovative multiplayer experiences emerge not from AAA studios but from indie teams willing to gamble on entirely unconventional premises. Landcrab's Peak is one such example, whose excellent replayability and suitability for streaming and social chaos have made it a smashing success, with nearly 15 million units sold to date, <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-new-2025-games-by-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Alinea Analytics estimates</a>.</p>



<p>The premise is deceptively simple: a plane crashes on a mountain. Four nature scouts must summit the peak or die trying. Over a 4-6 hour campaign, players ascend through five distinct biomes (Shore, Tropics, Alpine, Caldera, Kiln), managing stamina, coordinating rescue mechanics, and wrestling with procedurally-generated terrain that shifts every 24 hours.</p>



<p>Climbing is physics-based and genuinely difficult, mainly because Stamina is a resource that demands proper management and rest. Hauling teammates to safety requires the rescuer to sacrifice stamina and stability. Scavenging for questionable food to restore stamina is a strategic puzzle in itself. Resource management becomes emotional: watching a teammate exhaust their stamina on a failed jump, knowing you don't have enough food to revive them both, creates genuine drama. </p>



<p>The proximity voice chat system also forces players to literally huddle together to communicate, fostering immersion and intimacy. Peak is undoubtedly at its greatest when you're screaming at your friend to grab the rope before they tumble into lava.</p>



<p>The daily map rotation ensures no two climbs feel identical. The Shore introduces Peak's basic mechanics, but the Tropics introduces hazardous flora and stamina-draining venom. The Alpine features treacherous ice and avalanche mechanics. The Caldera is a firestorm that must be carefully navigated without burning to death. The Kiln is an unstable volcanic shaft where a single mistake sends you cartwheeling into molten lava. Each biome escalates the stakes and mechanical complexity.</p>



<p>The badge system (cosmetic rewards for specific challenges) and progressive unlocks ensure long-term engagement. This is cooperative multiplayer as it should be designed: challenging, replayable, social-first, and freed from stale genre trappings.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/arc-raiders-snow-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-9">ARC Raiders (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9</a>)</h2>



<p>Embark Studios famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pivoted</a> the ARC Raiders project from a free-to-play cooperative shooter to a premium (although budget-priced) PvPvE extraction shooter that almost perfectly balances PvP intensity and environmental threat without privileging one over the other. ARC Raiders is the studio's answer, a game where artificial intelligence is nearly as lethal and unpredictable as human opponents, where the extracted loot you carry home matters as much as kill counts, and where cooperation paradoxically emerges from selfish, survival-first gameplay.</p>



<p>What distinguishes ARC from competitors is AI integration. The ARC themselves aren't damage sponges or mere environmental obstacles—they're intelligent, behavioral enemies with individual profiles that can be an actual threat. </p>



<p>The loadout diversity ensures tactical expression, and the free loadouts feature (randomized starting gear) allows practice runs without risking their best equipment. Indeed, it's easy to see that ARC Raiders is much more accessible than Escape from Tarkov (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-launch-qa-we-have-big-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just launched its 1.0 version</a>, by the way).</p>



<p>In Embark's game, the extraction mechanics rely on constant communication. Elevator extractions (calling down an elevator and activating consoles to descend) create high-traffic confrontation zones, whereas train extractions require navigating subway stations. Finally, raider hatch extracts (which require specific keys) provide silent, rapid-deployment options. Each extraction type demands different tactical approaches. Moreover, ARC Raiders even lets you extract while downed. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders managed to attract even many gamers who weren't really fans of the extraction shooter genre. Its secret lies in a deep understanding of what makes a PvPvE game thrilling yet approachable: unpredictability mixed with accessibility.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SplitFiction_KeyArt_RGB-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-8">Split Fiction (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8</a>)</h2>



<p>Hazelight Studios has long carved for itself a unique niche within the sea of cooperative game experiences. Their pedigree, from A Way Out to It Takes Two, is all about creating memorable titles that can only be played by two users working together in a split-screen environment. Split Fiction once again demonstrates that the studio can rival single-player games in storytelling sophistication while maintaining design principles that make cooperative play feel essential, not optional, as it often is in most multiplayer games.</p>



<p>In Split Fiction, two authors, Mio and Zoe, are estranged collaborators forced to navigate fantastical worlds they've co-created. When a magical force traps them in their own fictional settings, they must traverse both the fantasy realm they were designing and the sci-fi world Zoe envisioned separately, ultimately discovering that their creative partnership mirrors their damaged personal relationship. The game is fundamentally about reconciliation on multiple levels: creative, emotional, and romantic.</p>



<p>Split Fiction alternates between three distinct gameplay frameworks, each requiring a different cooperative approach. The fantasy segments see one player wielding a sword while the other casts spells, forcing constant communication about positioning and enemy threat. The sci-fi segments invert that paradigm, demanding puzzle-solving coordination where one player controls gravity manipulators while the other navigates platforms only accessible through gravitational reversal. Then there are the equally essential narrative segments, featuring intimate character moments, dialogue trees that branch based on player responses, and relationship changes that carry lasting emotional weight.</p>



<p>The game's artistic direction is phenomenal. Each world is visually distinct: the fantasy realm features warm, earthy tones and lush environments, while the sci-fi world is sleek, sterile, and chromatic. The Friends Pass system, which allows a single purchaser to invite a non-owner friend for free multiplayer, returns to remove the usual friction from co-op adoption. Hazelight understands that co-op games thrive when accessibility is prioritized. No friend should miss this experience due to financial barriers.</p>



<p>Split Fiction may not have won the coveted Game of the Year prize at The Game Awards like It Takes Two did back in 2021, but it was still highly successful, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling four million units in the first two months</a>. Hollywood has also smelled potential, with Amazon MGM <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-has-reportedly-won-the-bid-to-make-the-split-fiction-movie-directed-by-jon-m-chu-and-starring-sydney-sweeney/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winning a bidding war</a> that will lead to a movie featuring rising star Sydney Sweeney in the cast, directed by Jon M. Chu.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>2025 was a year that really showed just how broad and varied the role playing game genre has become. From sweeping historical epics to fantasy worlds, from satirical sci-fi jaunts to anime mascots and beyond, it’s not just the setting that distinguishes the modern RPG, but the gameplay as well. There’s card-based battling, dice rolling decisions, time-based actions and first person shooting.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, there was only really going to be one winner in this category, the gaming world swept up in the distinctive style and panache, and the underdog story of a small French development studio creating a game that goes toe-to-toe with much larger publishers.</p>



<p>What can be said about Expedition 33 that hasn’t already been said as it sweeps the awards everywhere? It’s beautiful in every way that is applicable – the writing, the music, the world, the voice performances are all remarkable. Even the setup is incredibly endearing – a giant woman, face obscured by a mane of long red hair, called the Paintress erases a number from a monolith, rewriting it as one less, and everyone of that age dies, turned to dust and petals that scatter in the wind. Meanwhile an expedition to defeat her prepares to leave, not the first, but hopefully the last.</p>
<p>Then there’s the monsters, disfigured creations of the Paintress, who apparently has an overactive imagination. They are legion and, more importantly, they’re varied, including everything from giant hulking monstrosities, through balletic floating things, grim soldier looking sword-wielders, and the dreaded mimes. Thankfully you have a turn-based combat system where all your characters play completely differently with one thing in common – they’re incredibly powerful if you engage with their mechanics. That, along with some real time parrying and dodging, makes for combat that is incredibly deep and rewarding.</p>

<p>Mystery leaks out of every pore of Expedition 33, exacerbated by the shattered remains of the world in which it is set, and it keeps you guessing right up until the end. Then it gives you even more to think about. The entire time it’s delivered with emotional performances, incredibly expressive facial expressions, and that sense of humour that the stories that make you emotional the most always maintain, because there are no lows without highs. Clair Obscur is a remarkable game, enough so that it’s difficult to do it justice with just words on a screen.</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Gamoc</em></p>
<h3>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 – Runner-Up</h3>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, in any other year, would have won Best RPG. It’s exactly the kind of thing you expect from the genre – it’s massive, intricately detailed, features an involved and very varied main plot, and is otherwise packed with things to do. It’s more than “just” that though, it’s also set in Medieval Europe, along with an exhaustive amount of real world background information to the setting and to mining, horse riding, anything really. This detailed approach extends throughout the game’s systems as well, from armour that requires underclothes to wear – just like in real life – to an elaborate potion brewing system where you need to actually brew the potion rather than select some options on a menu.</p>
<p>That’s nothing if it isn’t enjoyable, though. Thankfully, KCD2 is as fun as it is serious somehow, what with Henry, the poor protagonist, having to blunder through absurd excuses when he fails speech checks, guards alternately being delighted by, then annoyed by the presence of your dog. On the serious side, it’s a story of knights, lords, and bandits with some real heart to it and a lot of characters you’ll find yourself actually caring about. “Grand in scale whilst being full of fine details” is still the best way to describe it, I think, along with “uncompromising,” which is exactly what you want from what amounts to an immersive sim of Medieval Europe.</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Gamoc</em></p>
<h3>Promise Mascot Agency – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Coming right out of left field, Promise Mascot Agency is a simply delightful mixture of a slice of life story, Japanese mascot culture, management and card battling. Taken to the town of Kaso Machi, it’s up to you to rebuild the family mascot agency, starting off with the giant finger mascot, Pinky, and going from there. These aren’t people in costumes, but actual people in their own right, coming with distinctive characters of their own.</p>
<p>It’s an oddball mix, to be sure, but it draws you in with the positive outlook of its story, memorable characters and engaging world to explore.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2025 wasn’t incredible for new shooters, in all honesty. There’s still a lot of reliance on existing live-service shooters, but the year did manage to throw up some amazing new highlights. Insider Gaming has identified one shooter that stood above the rest in 2025.</p>



<p>Between first-person shooters and third-person shooters, there’s a lot to feast on. 2025 might have been dominated by action-adventure games and indie darlings, but the gaming community is still being treated to AAA shooters capable of delivering immense action and gunplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a>‘s 2025 shooter of the year might cause some debate, but there’s plenty of cause to agree.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-shooter-game-of-2025-winner-battlefield-6">Best Shooter Game Of 2025 Winner—Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Boom, headshot! Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 was considered the point of no return for EA and the iconic shooter. Battlefield 2042 did almost irreparable damage to the Battlefield name, and if BF 6 didn’t completely deliver, it was probably over. Thankfully, Battlefield 6 is a gargantuan first-person shooter that reminds us all why players crave an alternative to standard point-and-aim shooters.</p>



<p>Yes, the campaign is underwhelming and fairly forgettable, if not worth a brief jaunt to warm you up for the online multiplayer. Everyone knows this is where Battlefield thrives. Some maps could be a tiny bit bigger, but this will come with time. It does mean you get the most intense and exhilarating action around you: Whether it’s the majesty and splendor or vehicles crashing bullets and shells on metal, a jet soaring overhead straight out of bounds because no one knows how to fly them, or the earth-shaking destruction of a crumbling building.</p>



<p>There’s a reason why Best Audio Design at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> went to Battlefield 6. There’s absolutely no title in history that captures the second-by-second thrill of war. It was tough to see if we’d ever get another strong BF game again, and with the addition of RedSec’s Battle Royale and free content, EA has delivered the full package.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-shooter-game-of-2025-nominations">Best Shooter Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</h3>



<figure><figcaption>ARCs are scary. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>This was a close one, in all honesty. ARC Raiders has been the viral shooter sensation of 2025. Initial reactions to playtests were very positive, almost too positive. Embark Studios shrugged off suggestions that the initial hype couldn’t continue, and the October 30 launch was an instant hit.</p>



<p>Two months after launch and ARC Raiders was still hitting well above six figures in player count. The extraction shooter gained a reputation as a friendly addition to the merciless genre—Escape From Tarkov and Gray Zone Warfare are no free lunch—and might be the most accessible extraction shooter around.</p>



<p>After all, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-invented-a-whole-new-genre-and-nobody-noticed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders did create a new genre</a>.</p>







<h3 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</h3>



<figure><figcaption>No one messes with Doomguy. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>DOOM is in a weird spot at the moment. The 2016 reboot was phenomenal, and it’s a matter of taste if you prefer DOOM: Eternal’s parkour-centric elements. One thing most agree on is that DOOM: The Dark Ages is a slight step back from the pair—but it’s still a brutal and bombastic affair. The Dark Ages’ prequel aesthetic and decision to lean more heavily into the story and cutscenes are hit and miss. DOOM isn’t one of the most celebrated shooter franchises ever because of its narrative storytelling, let’s face it.</p>



<p>But the core gameplay remains punchy and powerful. The parry mechanic and Saw Shield add nice variation; on the other hand, the dragon sequences are gimmicky and unnecessary, and in trying to change too much, some of DOOM 2016’s implicity has been lost. Still,  you’re assured a breathless ride, and fingers crossed the next DOOM reins in the creativity a smidge.</p>

<p>Whereas Borderlands 4 throws a lot of new ideas at the wall, and mostly scores. The open-world design works, and you can find unopened cans of chaos around every corner. The template remains unchanged: Four Vault Hunters to choose from with different abilities, saving the world, finding vaults, and collecting enough guns to use on the fire for Winter!</p>



<p>It would be interesting to see how Borderlands 4 fared at launch had Gearbox released the game in a fully working state. The performance issues destroyed the game’s chances of ubiquitous fanfare from all corners. Borderlands 4 shows that Gearbox has more ideas up its sleeves—the Grapple Hook and jetpacks are fun—and even more is needed if the next game is to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break 100 million units</a>.</p>



<p>Did any shooter that’s not Battlefield 6 get your vote for best shooter of 2025? Is it something that didn’t even make it onto our list, like a certain Black Ops 7?

<section><p>Part of the fun in a portable console launch is analyzing every port to see what the system is capable of, and the Switch 2 is no different.</p></section>

                <p>In November 2017, Bethesda Softworks and port specialists Panic Button performed what seemed like a miracle: They released a Switch port for id Software's recent reboot of Doom. The game, a famously fast-paced, intense shooter with modern graphics, seemed ill-suited to Nintendo's handheld and its capabilities, but despite some visual blurriness and a reduction in the frame rate, the game held up well on the hybrid system. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-switch-review/1900-6416805/">8/10 review</a> of the Switch port, Peter Brown praised the game as "an impressive port that begs you to consider gameplay over graphics."</p><p dir="ltr">Doom was the first Switch "impossible port," a colloquial term that players took to using whenever a third-party game designed for much more powerful hardware arrived on the Switch in pretty good shape. Over the course of the system's lifespan, it would receive many more so-called impossible ports, including versions of Wolfenstein 2: The New Collossus, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, The Witcher 3, No Man's Sky, and Ace Combat 7--large, visually-intensive, action-heavy games, all of them translated to the system with immaculate care. Seeing how the Switch handled these games was always exciting--even when the ports were less-than-ideal, there was still something special about seeing them run on a handheld from 2017.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Cyberpunk 2077 Is A Good Showcase For The Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Prior to the Switch 2's launch this year, Nintendo, in typical fashion, did not tell us much about what the Switch 2 was capable of on a technical level. We knew that the new 7.9-inch 1080p screen was capable of displaying gameplay at up to 120fps and was HDR-compliant. Nvidia announced that the system's custom chip would allow for DLSS, which is capable of upscaling games regardless of native resolution, and that the new system would be, of course, much more powerful than the old one. For early adopters, though, the system's first six-plus months of availability has involved a lot of curiosity over what the system can and can't do, speculating on what games the system could or couldn't handle, and pondering just how close these ports can come to other console versions.</p><p>For many people picking the system up on day one, Mario Kart World was not the most exciting game on the system--it was Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, a heavily updated version of a game that was first released in 2020. Here was a game that absolutely would not have run in any form on the original Switch--one that, in fact, infamously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-dev-admits-poor-performance-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-offers-refunds-and-future-patches/1100-6485478/">struggled massively on the PS4 and Xbox One</a>. At launch, the stability and playability of Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition became something of a referendum on what sort of games we might see ported to Switch 2 in the future. If it can handle Cyberpunk, what else is possible?</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 ended up being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-is-a-great-showcase-for-the-switch-2/1100-6532688/">an excellent port</a>, one that, despite some compromises, ran well and looked fantastic on Nintendo's hybrid system--it was a considerable step up from The Witcher 3 on the original system, already a very impressive port. There were many strong Switch 2 ports of current-gen titles in 2025: Street Fighter 6, various Yakuza games, Cronos: The New Dawn, Apex Legends--and some weaker ones, including 30fps EA FC and NBA 2K experiences, Persona 3 Reload with its odd frame-pacing issues that cause noticeable stuttering, and a Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition port that is noticeably downgraded from the nearly 12-year-old PS4 version. It's difficult not to approach these games not just as discrete products, but as indicators for what kind of life the Switch 2 is going to have--what do these games tell us about what this system is capable of?</p><p dir="ltr">I've tried to play as many of these ports as I can. Getting a new system and putting it through its paces is always exciting, and even games that obviously aren't pushing the system very hard--like SpongeBob Squarepants: Titans of the Tide and Two Point Museum--show an obvious huge increase in fidelity compared to what the aging Switch 1 is capable of. Some of the games have surprised me--Ball X Pit got a significant boost when the Switch 2 version released, and the differences between the Switch and Switch 2 versions of Fantasy Life i are particularly pronounced. As someone who opted for the Switch for many indie and less technologically intensive titles, these upgrades are an exciting indicator of the experiences I'm likely to have over the next few years.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlKCBGzrB1I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XlKCBGzrB1I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>But the best port of the first year--and maybe the best example we have of what the system is capable of right now--is Star Wars Outlaws, handled by Ubisoft's internal RedLynx team. The game, which launched on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2024, arrived on the Switch 2 in good shape and has since been patched and improved to a point where it holds up extremely well against other systems (and absolutely runs circles around the game's performance on Steam Deck). It </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/">may not be a perfect game</a><span>, but the arrival of the game on Switch 2 in such good shape was very exciting--if the system can do this in its first year, what sort of games can we expect to see ported effectively over the next few years, when developers have a better handle on the hardware?</span></p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows has put on a good showing too, although in my time with it the game suffered from several crashes and a particularly blurry presentation in handheld mode; it may be a few patches away from its ideal form yet. Like Star Wars and Cyberpunk before it, the game features cross-progression, meaning I could carry on my PS5 save with minimal fuss--a feature that should, hopefully, continue to incentivize studios to bring their games to Switch 2 alongside other consoles.</p><p>It's likely that more significant ports will be announced in 2026, and we'll learn more about what the system is capable of through those games. I was able to play a build of Elden Ring in portable mode at PAX Australia this year, and despite earlier reports of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-switch-2-performance-isnt-that-great-reports-say/1100-6534171/">poor performance</a>, the version I played ran well and looked fantastic; the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-for-switch-2-delayed-to-2026-due-to-performance-adjustments/1100-6535648/">delayed shortly thereafter</a>, but there's reason to be optimistic. There are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/">many other games on the way</a>: 007 First Light, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, and other major ports should tell us more about what's possible on Switch 2. For now, though, it's fun to speculate and dream about the system's future "impossible" ports.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I played a <em>lot</em> of games on my Steam Deck this year. It seemed like there was a never-ending list of incredible indie games to try — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24339574/indie-games-recommendations-pc-switch-steam-deck-best-new-hidden-gems"><em>The Verge</em> wrote about a lot of them!</a> — and many worked brilliantly on Valve’s handheld gaming PC. Some bigger games made a splash on Steam Deck, too, and while they may not look as good as on a beefy PC, I’m usually happy to deal with that simply because I can play them on the couch or out of the house.</p><p>If you’re unwrapping a Steam Deck for the holidays this year, or have some Steam gift cards burning a hole in your pocket, here are some of my recommendations of games released in 2025 that you might want to check out. (And if you want more ideas, check out my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305570/steam-deck-best-games-2024-verified-playable-valve">favorites from 2024</a>.)</p><div><p id="ball-x-pit"><h2><em>Ball x Pit</em></h2></p></div><p><em>Ball x Pit</em> blends elements from games like <em>Breakout</em>, <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and city builders into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/805022/ball-x-pit-review-pc-nintendo-switch-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">a delightful, genre-blending roguelike</a>. In the main part of the game, you shoot balls toward an ever-advancing group of enemies, and after picking up a bunch of gems and upgrades, you’ll eventually turn into a force of nature with balls flying all over the screen. After a run, you can build up a base to improve your stats and unlock characters — some of which are quite clever, like one that turns <em>Ball x Pit</em> into a turn-based game. And with runs usually taking less than 15 minutes or so, it’s a great game to pick up and play on your Steam Deck.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kepler Interactive</cite></p></div><div><p id="clair-obscur-expedition-33"><h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h2></p></div><p>Sandfall Interactive’s debut RPG floored me earlier this year; it’s an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc">outstanding package</a> with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/656552/clair-obscur-expedition-33-battles">exhilarating turn-based battles</a>, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/667900/doom-the-dark-ages-clair-obscur-expedition-33-parry-season">great parrying system</a>, memorable characters, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/664492/clair-obscur-expedition-33-twist-spoilers">gripping story</a>, and music that I still come back to even though I finished the game months ago. On Steam Deck, the game doesn’t look quite as good as it does on my PS5, but it’s still playable and was recently verified for Valve’s handheld PC. Folks <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1903340?device=steamDeck">on ProtonDB</a> also have some suggestions to tweak settings to make the visuals better.

Supergiant Games builds on the first <em>Hades</em> with a new protagonist, new boons to bring to battle, a bunch of new characters to give ambrosia to, <em>two</em> new routes to explore, and another banger-filled soundtrack. Supergiant even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/811848/hades-ii-is-getting-an-ending-boon">tweaked the ending to make it better</a>. <em>Hades II</em> is Supergiant at the top of its game, and just like my colleague Ash Parrish said in 2024, it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152085/hades-2-steam-deck-performance">the perfect Steam Deck game</a>.</p><div><p id="hollow-knight-silksong"><h2><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></h2></p></div><p>After years of waiting and <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-in-clown-makeup">lots of clown makeup</a>, <em>Hollow Knight</em>’s sequel finally launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680636/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-trailer">in September</a>, and thankfully, it was actually worth the wait. <em>Silksong</em> doesn’t reinvent the wheel; it’s still an atmospheric Metroidvania with adorable bug creatures, tough-as-nails bosses, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777653/silksong-impressions-team-cherry-metroidvania-sherma-is-cool">some bullshit</a>.

In the game, you’re responsible for finding seats for a bunch of adorable geometric shapes who have different needs. Some might want to sit next to a window, or maybe just not next to someone who smells. But if you can’t find a seating arrangement that works for everyone, you can just move on to the next puzzle without any big penalty; it keeps the stakes low, and sometimes, some low-stakes puzzling is what fits the bill.</p><div><p id="lumines-arise"><h2><em>Lumines Arise</em></h2></p></div><p>I have very fond memories of playing the original <em>Lumines: Puzzle Fusion</em> on a PlayStation Portable, and more than 20 years after the release of that game, the <em>Tetris Effect</em>-like <em>Lumines Arise</em> captures that same magic.

The game is a top-down adventure where you battle enemies and explore the game’s world with a magical yo-yo, and you’ll get cool yo-yo tricks like the ability to “walk the dog” to cross bodies of water.

You can play with a mouse to point and click, of course, but if you want to use the Steam Deck’s controls or a gamepad, <em>The Drifter</em> also offers a really smart control scheme that uses both joysticks to let you walk around and see what you can interact with.

<hr>
<p>Jeff Minter is, perhaps quite rightly, referred to as a legend within the gaming industry. His career following the founding of Llamasoft in 1982 has spawned dozens of the most unique and recognisable titles in existence, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tempest_4000">Tempest 4000</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/akka_arrh">Akka Arrh</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/polybius">Polybius</a>, <strong>Attack of the Mutant Camels</strong>, and <strong>Gridrunner</strong>.</p>
<p>Those unfamiliar with Minter should check out Digital Eclipse's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/llamasoft_the_jeff_minter_story">Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story</a>, a phenomenal interactive documentary looking at the creator's career with dozens of playable games from the Llamasoft back catalogue.</p>
<p>Now, however, alongside partner and co-developer Ivan 'Giles' Zorzin, Minter is about to unleash another stylised remake in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_robot">I, Robot</a>, based on the original 1984 arcade curio from Atari and creator Dave Theurer (who, by the way, also created the original arcade <strong>Tempest</strong>, a game which shaped Minter's career).</p>
<p>Following on from the critical success of both Tempest 4000 and Akka Arrh on Switch, I, Robot revamps the original's maze-like gameplay in which you avoid the gazing eye of 'Big Brother', shoot down 'Tetras' in space, and create bizarre painterly masterpieces with the 'Ungame' mode – all the while injecting some of that instantly-recognisable Llamasoft iconography.</p>
<p>We recently sat down with Minter (and Giles, albeit briefly) to find out more about the game, Llamasoft's partnership with Atari, and Jeff's thoughts on the upcoming Switch 2.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:179577,162791 @ 1766847636 -->
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Can you talk about how I, Robot came to be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff Minter, Llamasoft founder:</strong> Well, I'd look through Atari's back catalogue for games to update and I like going for the more obscure things. The big titles are often spoken for anyway, and if you go for something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/asteroids">Asteroids</a> or <strong>Centipede</strong>, people tend to have pretty big opinions on how it should be, so you have a bit less creative freedom.</p>
<p>The more obscure games tend to have very interesting ideas that perhaps didn't get the kind of exposure that they deserved back in the day. I quite like the idea of taking these things, blowing the dust off, and perhaps giving them a bit more publicity in modern times. I, Robot is a particular favourite of mine, I played it back in the day a fair bit; a friend of mine actually owned the coin-op machine, so I was able to go to his house and play it extensively.</p>
<p>The technology was groundbreaking at the time, and so it definitely stuck in my mind. One thing I loved about it was that because the graphics technology was so new, they built a special mode into the game where you just played with the 3D graphics. That was at a time when I started doing my own early light synth work, so there was the idea of playing a game that wasn't quite a game, but still interesting. I've actually implemented something similar into my own version; it's called 'The Ungame', so you can go ahead and play around with the parameters of the lights.</p>

<p><strong>So in what ways has Llamasoft's I, Robot been updated from the original?</strong></p>
<p>There's a chunk of Llamasoft in there, there's no doubt about that. But you also have to make the basic translation from an arcade environment to a home environment; arcade games are built to kick you off within three minutes and get more money in. So you have to adjust it to allow players to sit down and enjoy it a bit longer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope I've kept enough of the original that fans enjoy it, but also there's enough Llamasoft in there that people who like Llamasoft will enjoy it too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basic idea is the same. There's this eye looking at you and you can't jump while it's open. I've extended that from the original a bit, so now the eye can fire at you while it's open along with some other stuff. I've sped things up a little so it's not quite as slow anymore. Every few levels you get something called the Arena Mode, and this essentially sees you being attacked from all sides, but you have extended firepower with which to shoot back.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I've kept the spirit of the original and I hope people like it. I hope I've kept enough of the original that fans enjoy it, but also there's enough Llamasoft in there that people who like Llamasoft will enjoy it too.</p>
<p><strong>Were there any challenges with the development of I, Robot that you perhaps haven't experienced before?</strong></p>
<p>Well, to me, it's always a bit of a step into the unknown when I'm doing a new game. So I don't sit down and design everything first, I kind of just make it up as I go. Sometimes it can take a while for a game to find its groove; you can be fiddling about, you've got some structure there, but it's not quite working.</p>
<p>So it can be a bit of an anxious time because you think, 'I'm never going to make this fit.' I've been in that situation loads of times over my career and eventually you get to trust your instinct that everything will come together. The same thing happened with Akka Arrh, it actually took quite a while for me to find the correct feeling for that one.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, it's not a particularly demanding game, so there's little challenge in that sense. It runs very well on the Switch and it runs very well on the Atari VCS. <em>[Note: Not the original VCS, we hasten to clarify; Atari released a Linux-based console in 2021 that <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/02/atari-wouldnt-have-launched-its-2021-vcs-in-2024">unfortunately didn't quite take off</a>, but still hosts the majority of Atari's first-party offerings.]</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="0f58f3821996a"><a title="Jeff Minter - I, Robot 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0f58f3821996a/jeff-minter-i-robot-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atari</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How have you found development on the Nintendo Switch specifically?</strong></p>
<p>Giles, come here! <strong><em><br></em></strong></p>
<p>[Giles joins the interview.]</p>
<p><strong>Giles:</strong> Doing the graphics, doing the sound, everything works absolutely fine, no problem. Nintendo has good documentation, and really the only complaint is that there are so many different portals for different things, it can get a bit fragmented.</p>
<p>The biggest pain in the ass is making all the stuff conform, all the UI, little things have to be right, and it can take a long time to test certain things, sometimes hours at a time. But no, the machine is nice, it works very nice, the game runs at 60fps.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned that you like going for the more obscure titles; do you get any pushback from the folks at Atari, or do they just let you crack on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> By and large, they just let me do my own thing. Early in development, they'll give me a bit of feedback, and usually I'll say, "It's too early for feedback, everything can change!"</p>
<p>But generally, they're very good about it, and it's one of the reasons I like working with them. They give me complete creative freedom to do whatever I want, and having now done it a couple of times, they trust me enough to just get on with it and something good will come in the end.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-llamasofts-jeff-minter-discusses-his-new-game-akka-arrh-and-working-with-atari">You've mentioned in the past</a> that working with Atari affords you that vital creative freedom, but also brings some financial stability. With this in mind, can we expect this partnership to continue going forward?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Oh yeah absolutely, I'm extremely happy with it. I can just sit down and concentrate on the things that I do well and not worry about the things I don't do so well. Stuff like marketing I'm absolutely terrible at. I'm happy to offload that onto them, and they do a nice job of it; they do wonderful trailers which I could never do.</p>
<p>As you say, there's a bit of financial stability to it, which is always welcome. So yeah, we're definitely not stopping yet.</p>

<p><strong>I would like to ask if there's anything else from Atari's back catalogue that you've got your eye on, but I suspect you're probably not going to tell me!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> All I'll say is that we had a meeting to discuss potentially what I might do next. Before the meeting, I went through the IP catalogue and there were two titles which stood out to me. So one of the Atari guys at the meeting said, "We've been thinking about what you might be interested in doing and what might suit you," and it turns out that the two games at the top of their list were the same two titles that I picked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm very lucky to have this opportunity to work on exactly the kind of things I like to work on, because there's a great deal of stability, and I'm seizing onto that with both hands and going to keep it up as long as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>That's wild! So if I look into the back catalogue, I might be able to guess..?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Well if you're thinking the same way that they're thinking, then maybe you could guess them!</p>
<p><strong>I'm not going to do that now, I don't want to embarrass myself <em>[though for the record, we've got Black Widow in our minds...!]</em> On the flip side, are there any games that are an absolute no-go for you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Well, there's always room to do something, I think, but you've got to respect the original. Sometimes you can go a bit too far and do something completely different. I wouldn't put anything off the table, but I've got to be into the idea of whatever it is that I'm going to do, y'know? I don't think I'd be happy if they just handed me something and said, "Do that!"</p>
<p><strong>Doing things your own way has always been a Llamasoft staple, and it seems to be quite a rare thing in the current climate. I wonder if you can comment on the state of the industry at large at the moment?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Yeah, it's obviously a very difficult time for the industry at the moment. I'm very lucky to have this opportunity to work on exactly the kind of things I like to work on, because there's a great deal of stability, and I'm seizing onto that with both hands and going to keep it up as long as possible.</p>
<p>It's very hard for indies to get known these days. It seems a lot of the times it's more about how good you are at publicity than how good you are a making a game, so a lot of creators are having a tough time. I wake up every day and I count my blessings. I'm very lucky to be able to do this.</p>
<p><strong>It seems especially difficult to stand out amongst the crowd at the moment given how many titles release on digital storefronts all the time. We've particularly highlighted an issue with so-called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-rise-of-scam-games-and-keyword-bingo-firms-flooding-switch-eshop">'scam games'</a> over the last few years...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong><strong>:</strong> Oh yeah, someone told me about something called 'Jumping Hot Dog' or something where you just press a button and get achievements. I don't understand how those things are even allowed to go onto the stores, it's just clogging things up for everybody else.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4ff7a42511f9b"><a title="Jeff Minter - I, Robot 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4ff7a42511f9b/jeff-minter-i-robot-10.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atari</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>How does it feel to see this kind of stuff when you're trying to put your own game out there?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> It's a perversion of the whole thing. To me, making games is about making something which I think is good and that I hope other people enjoy and will think is good value for money. There's pride in it for me. I don't think I could be proud of something that may well make more money than I could do normally, but there's no art, no communication, no substance to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm old school. I was lucky enough to be there at the start of the games business when you really could just do everything out of passion, and everything grew up around that. Now it seems quite a lot of game design and publishing is more about making money than it is about making art. It should be more about art than money, really.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now it seems quite a lot of game design and publishing is more about making money than it is about making art. It should be more about art than money, really.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Perhaps both you and Giles can chip in with this, but what are your thoughts on the Switch 2 from what we've seen so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> I'm very much looking forward to it, it looks like it'll be a nice thing.</p>
<p><strong>Giles:</strong> We've been trying and trying to get a dev kit but sadly nothing at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Yeah I think we're probably fairly low down on the priority list! But we'll definitely be keen to work on it when we get our hands on it, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Giles:</strong> I will say that it's always good to work on the lower side of things, because if you can make it good there, then you can always make it even better on more powerful hardware.</p>

<p>One of those people is legendary game designer Hideki Kamiya, who has been speaking to <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20251219044/index_3.html#clo_kam">4Gamer</a> about his gaming impressions of 2025 (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/stealth40k/status/2004712820403999129?s=46&amp;t=_ZthC0M-yfLcPVPyf_xLfQ">Stealth</a>).</p>
<p>Kamiya spoke about picking up a Switch 2 this year before discussing the fact that it lacks a traditional D-Pad:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For some reason, in this age of diversity, the manufacturer itself has stubbornly refused to offer the option of a "Joy-Con with a D-pad" since the Switch 1. This just didn't fit into my gaming lifestyle, where I usually play while lying down, so I have no choice but to use the Joy-Con when playing games."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/devil_may_cry">Devil May Cry</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/wonderful_101">Wonderful 101</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> reveals that he actually reverted back to the original Switch as a result, because he could use peripherals which add a proper D-Pad (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/08/hardware_review_hori_d-pad_joy-con_controller_for_nintendo_switch">like Hori's special Joy-Con</a>, we assume):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Somehow I was able to get by. I was able to continue my daily routine of "one Tetris 99 a day," but even so, as someone who continues to post shady things on social media every day in the shadows at the very edge of the games industry, I decided that I should gradually make the Switch 2 my regular hardware, and as I was writing this, I purchased a new Cyber ​​Gadget "mini grip with D-pad," which I use with the Switch 1, and after some sanding and modifying it so that it could be attached to the Switch 2, where the button layout is slightly different, I was able to make my own "D-pad Joy-Con 2," which finally allowed me to play titles from "Arcade Archives 2."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Were you hoping to see some more variety in the Joy-Con 2 options by now? Or do you prefer using the analogue stick? Let us know with a comment.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass members have been eating well in 2025, with a bunch of games across every genre offered each month, including Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and more added to the library this year. Where Xbox has PlayStation beat is by offering its own games Day One on Game Pass, so subscribers don’t end up paying extra for brand-new AAA titles.</p>



<p>There are several tiers of Xbox Game Pass, including Essential, Premium, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-13-games-in-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultimate</a>, and PC Game Pass. In the Essential tier, players get over 50 games in the library, no Day One titles, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/claim-fortnite-crew-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Crew</a>, EA Play, and Ubisoft+ Classics. Premium players get access to over 200 games, no Day One launches, but Xbox-published games will be added to the library within 12 months from launch. The rest of it is similar to the Essential tier.</p>



<p>Game Pass Ultimate gives players access to over 500 games, Day One titles, Fortnite Crew, EA Play, and Ubisoft+ Classics, as well as the highest tier of cloud gaming. PC Game Pass provides over 300 games, access to Day One titles, Fortnite Crew, EA Play, and more than 50 Ubisoft+ Classics. All subscription tiers, except PC Game Pass, provide access to all supported platforms, online console multiplayer, and cloud gaming.</p>

<p>It's been a pretty quiet week, understandably, but Nintendo managed to squeeze in a cheeky update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> on the Switch 2, so make sure to download that. Nintendo also hit us with yet another banging eShop sale in the US, so we collated all of the games that we think you should check out in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/137-switch-1-and-2-games-you-should-check-out-in-the-hits-for-the-holidays-nintendo-eshop-sale-us">one handy guide</a>.</p>

<p>And finally, we'd like to once again acknowledge the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/vince-zampella-call-of-duty-co-creator-and-respawn-head-has-died">passing of Vince Zampella</a> at the age of 55. As the co-creator of <strong>Call of Duty</strong>, he was undeniably a huge talent in the games industry, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still nursing a Linda McCartney-induced food coma after a week of glad tidings, so whatever I play this weekend, it’ll have to be something that keeps me very much curled up in my seat. There are another few areas of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> to see and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a> is calling my name. Mmm, cosy.</p>
<p>Have a good one, everybody!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Pushing into the final chapters of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> with the reminder that I will still have to tackle Goro Majima’s saga before I can consider this one cleared. Spending my final days of 2025 with Digital Eclipse’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> for a slice of nostalgia and knowledge and online co-op campaigns with my mates on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>. Still tackling ace pilot difficulty campaign on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_deluxe_edition">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a> (one missile hit and game over), wondering with every mission failure, 'Why am I doing this to myself?' Is my ego writing checks my body can’t cash?</p>
<p>2025 was THE year of gaming for yours truly. I am quite looking forward to seeing what 2026 throws my way, but I am dreading the price of a hypothetical gaming PC upgrade… at least Switch 2 seems to continue to climb the industry ladder, can’t wait to see what new surprises Nintendo throws our way. Have a great New Year, everyone!</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I don't think I'll be getting any games for Christmas, but I have bought my partner the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_i-vi_pixel_remaster">Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</a>, in the hopes that he'll want to watch me play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy 6</a> (which he's mentioned before!). I've never played a Final Fantasy game except half of the remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy 7</a>, which feels like it doesn't really count in a lot of ways. I hear FF6 is good! Don't tell me anything about it, though — I've somehow managed to avoid any FF spoilers for my entire life, and I'd like to keep it that way!</p>
<p>I'm also hoping to play through some of my Steam Deck backlog over the break, which includes a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/regency_solitaire">Regency Solitaire</a> that my friend got me, and <strong>Séance of Blake Manor</strong>. I'm looking forward to both.</p>
<p>Aaaand, if there's any time between all that, I'm going to try to finish <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>, and force my partner to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/1000xresist">1000XResist</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/13_sentinels_aegis_rim">13 Sentinels</a>. I think that's a reasonable amount of video games to fit into 2 weeks, right? Yeah. Totally reasonable.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I fired up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a> a couple of days ago and immediately hit Bandcamp to download the Blood Cultures soundtrack. And then immediately went back to Bandcamp, slightly grumpier, to download another Blood Cultures album that has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiA41zgrj_Y">the first song you hear in the game</a>. I've only played 20 minutes but I'm loving it so far.<br>
I really need to download <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">T2D</a> over Christmas, too - I am the ultimate target audience for that thing and I want to savour it. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a> is an end-of-year arrival (one that Felix put on his top five games of the gear, no less!) that I'm eager to sit down with.</p>

<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>My wife and I have a bit of a tradition when it comes to the time after Christmas but before New Year: we hibernate. We'll pick a game, usually something fairly meaty like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a>, and just go to town on it for a few days straight.</p>
<p>We'll break for dinner (plenty of leftovers), go for walks in the woods, and other stuff besides, but there could well be a 24-hour period where we do not leave the house or do anything of note beyond playing our chosen game. What'll it be this year? Let's just say that we've fallen dramatically behind on our time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> recently.</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I don't plan on playing much over the last remaining days of 2025, but I have recently started <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_monkey_ball_banana_rumble">Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</a> again, so I'd like to dip into that one occasionally if I can find the time. It's a weirdly relaxing game despite some of the deviously tricky stages, y'know?</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I think we'll be welcoming the New Year in with a whole bunch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, which I made the mistake of leaving Zach alone with for one morning and now we have all of the Battle-Tested and Forbidden Weapons, and have had them since level 50. So yeah, any sense of challenge in the main game has evaporated! What can you do about RPG fans, hey?</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'll be checking out the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> update and playing a little more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a>. Nothing crazy, it's the holiday season, and we have a big 2026 ahead of us. See you next year!</p>

<p>Fans of the long-running RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> have a chance to tell Square Enix their thoughts about the series in a new online survey. It’s available until 9th January 2026 and features over 30 questions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s no reward at the end of it, so if you do plan on doing this survey, it's mostly to tell Square Enix how you feel. Of course, it will also narrow down who you are with the usual questions like your age and how many games you've purchased recently.</p>
<p>From there, you're asked things like whether you've bought physical or digital copies of Final Fantasy, your familiarity with the series, how many games in the series you've purchased, what game you like the most, and even how high your expectations are for the series "in the future".</p><div><figure data-videoid="KK3nTYgZ9yY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytKK3nTYgZ9yY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK3nTYgZ9yY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6205b9uwzvog&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Towards the end of the survey, you're also able to provide feedback about the Final Fantasy series with a written response.</p>

<p>If you’re a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> fan and happen to be located in the United States or Canada, Nintendo is currently running a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> ‘Legacy Sweepstakes’ featuring a “bounty” of prizes.</p>
<p>You can enter this sweepstakes via the My Nintendo website for <strong>10 Platinum Points</strong>. This gives you a chance to win the official Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective art book as well as a highly-detailed Samus Gravity Suit PVC statue from First 4 Figures.</p>
<p>Here’s a bit about both, along with a look:</p>
<figure data-uuid="f45e29e93c4d0"><a title="Metroid Prime" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f45e29e93c4d0/metroid-prime.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Developed in collaboration with Nintendo and Retro Studios, this art book showcases concept drawings, sketches, and assorted illustrations from the Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, and Metroid Prime Remastered games. With an extensive range of behind-the-scenes, high-quality artwork, this hardcover anthology spans more than 20 years of game development and includes exclusive commentary from Nintendo producer Kensuke Tanabe and Retro Studios. Printed on premium sheet-fed art paper, this book is stitch-bound, with a lavish cloth hardcover featuring an etched Samus metallic foil.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>First 4 Figures proudly presents a PVC statue of Samus Aran in her Gravity Suit inspired by the Metroid Prime game! Standing 10 inches tall and 7.9 inches wide, this deluxe statue faithfully recreates the sleek design and iconic components of the Gravity Suit. The base upon which Samus stands is inspired by the Screw Attack emblem. Plus, the Exclusive Edition incorporates an LED light-up function that brings Samus to life. When activated, key elements of the suit glow, including the helmet, Arm Cannon, and blue piping along the arms and legs!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The official art book is valued at $49.99 USD and the statue is valued at $164.99 USD. This sweepstakes ends on <strong>3rd February 2026</strong>, and there will be five winners in total that receive both items.

This includes the talented Japanese developer Monolith Soft, best-known during the Switch generation for its work on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> series.</p>
<p>Now that another year has passed, the company has taken a brief moment on social media to acknowledge the release of the two titles it worked on this year. This obviously includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. Here's the translated message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’ll also be plenty of hard work next year on even more projects! Here’s the translated message in full:</p>
<p>“Monolith Soft's last day of work for the year is today.</p>
<p>This year saw the release of two titles: “Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition” and “Mario Kart World,” on which we worked as a subcontractor.</p>
<p>All our staff will continue to work hard next year as well. We look forward to your continued support.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition arrived earlier this year in March. Since then, this version has received some compatibility updates for the Switch 2. As for the new Mario Kart, as we previously highlighted, Monolith Soft was contracted to develop "fields and character designs".</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the developer celebrated the 8th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> with some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/anniversary-monolith-soft-celebrates-xenoblade-chronicles-2-with-a-post-but-were-desperate-for-a-switch-2-revamp">stunning artwork</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-issue-account-wipes/</link>
            <guid>1392772</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><strong>Update</strong> – It appears that this issue affected a select few players, with the malicious operator in question posting an explanation on social media of what happened. They said the account wipes were carried out due to a vulnerability exposed by Steam account linking. This seems to have since been patched, while Battlestate Games still hasn’t provided an official statement.</p>



<p>In recent hours, some of the most prominent personalities in the Escape from Tarkov community have taken to social media to express concerns about a new phenomenon. What has been labelled a ‘vulnerability’ by some is causing Escape from Tarkov accounts to be <strong>wiped </strong>and altered by what is assumed to be rogue operators.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has stressed it’s aware of the issue and is working on it, but no official statement has been posted.</p>







<h2 id="h-has-your-tarkov-account-been-wiped">Has Your Tarkov Account Been Wiped?</h2>



<p>Hours ago, posts started surfacing on social media from users impacted by this Tarkov account wiping issue. In some cases, big-name streamers were recorded suffering from the problem <strong>live on air</strong>. Dr Lupo was one of the content creators struck by the anomaly.</p>



<p>In a comment under one of the investigative posts, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>already took measures. investigating</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s what the players are figuring out about the issue from what they’ve learned:</p>



<ul>
<li>There’s a vulnerability ‘somewhere’ that malicious operators are leaning on to access and reset accounts of other players, most notably prolific players.</li>



<li>Whoever is doing this is able to bypass two-factor authentication, as accounts that have the security layers in place are reporting this problem occurring.</li>



<li>It was thought this issue was related to Escape from Tarkov: Arena, but that most likely isn’t the case.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p><em>We’ve reached out to Battlestate Games for confirmation on what’s happening.</em></p>



<p>In August 2024, a technical malfunction caused player profiles <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-malfunction-profile-wipe/">to suffer from unwanted wipes</a>. It was reported that ‘tens of thousands’ of profiles were impacted by this back-end issue, which led to an irrevocable data wipe.</p>



<p>Popular creator Onepeg explained <a href="https://x.com/Onepeg/status/2004685750894559692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on social media</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My tarkov account got reset. Gg boys.</p>



<p>I did not use the wiki at all for at least the last few days. I haven’t clicked on any weird links. This has to be some other vulnerability.</p>



<p>pfp got changed to a QR code that forwards to a 7 second long youtube video calling me a bitch lmao at least these guys have a sense of humor.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One user took to socials to stress how impactful the issue had been, with their account being stripped of all progress at a pivotal progression point:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I got RESET TO 0 IN TARKOV?<br>Somehow, an hour ago someone logged into my account and reset it to 0, they also changed my profile Pic, my accounts have double log verification, etc. Never had this happen before, with any account whatsoever. I was lvl 53 ready to prestige 5 with all… <a href="https://t.co/dAtts06Ulc">pic.twitter.com/dAtts06Ulc</a></p>— BAXBEAST (@BAXBEAST) <a href="https://twitter.com/BAXBEAST/status/2004607588302717205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>This issue has struck amidst a lengthy Twitch Drops campaign that’s stuffing players’ accounts full of loot, which adds extra fuel to the fire and insult to injury.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Automatic Pizza Vending Machine In The Detroit Airport: The Kotaku Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/automatic-pizza-vending-machine-detroit-airport-the-kotaku-review-pizza-cat-2000655797</link>
            <guid>1392769</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, I finally traveled to New York City to visit the <em>Kotaku</em> office, hang out with the people who work there, and even meet up with some former staff. It was a great time! Had a blast visiting the city, and getting there was a breeze. However, getting home was a mess and involved me crashing in the Detroit Metro Airport for seven hours before heading home to Kansas City. But it wasn’t all bad news. While in the airport, I found a strange vending machine that dispenses hot personal pizza pies.</p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zackzwiezen.com/post/3mafio2oits2b">My wife and I landed in Detroit around midnight.</a> After verifying our new tickets to Kansas City with the staff, we picked out a spot near our terminal and killed time until our flight. Once we had set up a home base in the corner of the seating area, not far from a bathroom, charging station, and water fountain, I decided to explore. I quickly stumbled upon a 24/7 area of the airport<!--StartFragment --><span>—mostly deserted at 1 a.m.<!--StartFragment -->—<!--EndFragment --></span>that was filled with different vending machines. It was the Pizza Cat machine that caught my eye.</p>

 <p>I was hungry. And I didn’t want to eat more chips and jerky. I wanted something hot and tasty. So a big vending machine promising hot pizzas in five minutes made me excited. I wasn’t alone either. Before I could get to the machine, an older man with a large roller suitcase walked up to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7Hdkrxnw9Ms">Pizza Cat</a> and began ordering a pizza. He then stepped back and watched. I did too. The machine hides what it does, but I was able to hear what sounded like a small motor and fan kick on.</p>

 <p>About five minutes later, a cardboard box containing the man’s cheese pizza popped out of a slot. He turned around, looked at me, and then sort of shrugged as if to say, “Huh, this is weird.” I replied, “Weird, but hey, it’s pizza!” I must have startled him because he let go of his luggage, which fell to the floor with a loud thud, and in the process nearly dropped his newly acquired pizza. After I helped him get situated, he scurried off to eat his food.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655810" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655810"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655810">©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Meanwhile, I repeated the process he’d just finished and used the large touchscreen to order a pepperoni pizza. Five minutes later, it popped out in a box. As I was grabbing it, another person, a younger man, slipped in behind me to toss away his pizza box. “Pretty good, actually!” he shared with me before leaving. I wasn’t so sure.</p>

 <p>Sitting back down with my wife in the corner of the airport we’d picked out, I opened the box and found a small, very thin, and slightly greasy little pizza. It had a crispy crust and looked okay. But when I picked up a slice, it felt very soft and rubbery. Thankfully, it wasn’t chewy, but the bland dough and tiny amount of sauce were disappointing. The cheese was fine and the pepperoni slices spicy enough to help it not be a completely bland bit of food.&nbsp; Still, after enjoying NYC pizza just a day before consuming this vending machine pizza, I wasn’t impressed.</p>

 <p>Then again, being able to spend $13 to get a personal pizza whenever I want in the middle of an empty airport at 1 a.m. is nice. If you ever find yourself stuck in the Detroit Metro Airport overnight and crave some food, look for the Pizza Cat vending machine, lower your standards, and enjoy a hot pizza pie. Or something approximating a pizza.</p>

Some of the best games of the year are currently on sale on the eShop, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447">some older ones that deserve a place</a> in everyone’s portable gaming library.</p> <p>Nintendo itself isn’t really running any great discounts on Switch exclusives at the moment. <em>Mario Odyssey</em> and <em>New Super Mario Bros. Deluxe</em> are both $20 off, but everyone probably already has those. There are some notable Switch 2 games on sale, including <em>Street Fighter 6</em> for just $20 (half off), <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> for $40 (down from $60), and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> for $40 (down from $70).</p>

 <p>But if you only own a Switch, here’s a quick smattering of the best deals on the eShop for everything that’s available on both consoles:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>No Man’s Sky</strong></em> – $24 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Divinity: Original Sin 2</strong></em> – $25 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></em> – $16 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hades II</strong></em> – $22.50 (25 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Ball x Pit</strong></em> – $12 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Prince of Persia The Lost Crown</strong></em> – $12 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Death’s Door</strong> </em>– $5 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hollow Knight</strong> </em>– $7.50 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Hades</strong> </em>– $ 7.50 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Baten Kaitos 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster</strong></em> – $15 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</strong> </em>– $20 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong> </em>– $8 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Mega Man Legacy Collection</strong></em> – $5 (66 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII</strong></em> – $6.39 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Sifu</strong></em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Dead Cells</strong> </em>– $12.50 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>The discounts on <em>Silksong</em> and <em>Hades 2</em> aren’t wild, but the games are already so cheap to begin with that it’s still enticing. And if you don’t have the games those are sequels to, you should grab them first since they’re a steal at just $15 for both. <em>Ball x Pit</em> is a great “shut your brain up” game for $12. <em>No Man’s Sky</em> just keeps getting bigger and bigger. And <em>Mega Man Legacy Collection</em> is a great way to get hyped <a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-man-dual-override-trailer-capcom-2000652829">for <em>Mega Man 12</em></a>, whenever that eventually arrives.</p>

 <p>But I want to call special attention to<em> Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, which is the cheapest it’s ever going to be and just got a free upgrade for Switch 2. Now’s the time to get cracking on this dense tactical-RPG in preparation for the next <em>Divinity</em> sequel. <em>Baten Kaitos 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster</em> is also a cult-classic RPG pick-up from the GameCube era that I’d recommend for just $15. And if you had fun with the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> remaster this year, <em>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</em> is very good in similar but different ways. A perfectly grim and grindy strategy RPG for the dark, cold winter months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For years now, <em>Fallout</em> fans have been wondering when the next mainline sequel will arrive. Hype for the game most assume will be called<em> Fallout 5</em> grew even larger last year after Amazon’s TV show made the post-apocalyptic franchise bigger than ever. And while Bethesda hasn’t formally announced<em> Fallout 5</em>, that hasn’t stopped the studio’s creative director, Todd Howard, from talking about it over the years.</p> <p><em>Fallout 4</em> arrived on consoles and PC in 2015. Not long after its launch, people began wondering about<em> Fallout 5.</em> As a result, whenever Howard sits down for an interview, it’s not unusual for someone to ask him about <em>Fallout 5</em> and the future of the franchise. Here’s nearly every time Howard has talked about <em>Fallout 5</em>, presented in chronological order. One thing to keep in mind before scrolling down is that Howard is very careful when talking about <em>Fallout 5</em>, so be prepared for comments that give you plenty to infer and speculate about, but little in the way of cold hard facts.</p>

 <h2>June 2018 – <em>Fallout 5</em> will be a single-player video game</h2> <p>Technically, <a href="https://www.gamestar.de/videos/fallout-76-interview-mit-todd-howard-nicht-so-ein-krasser-umbruch-wie-bei-fallout-3-gamestar-tv-fuer-alle,96653.html">during a 2018 interview with German outlet <em>GameStar</em>,</a> Howard didn’t say anything specific about a new <em>Fallout</em> game. However, when asked if all upcoming Bethesda games would feature multiplayer like <em>Fallout 76,</em> he replied that no, future games from the studio would still be single-player adventures.</p>

 <h2>November 2021 – Bethesda has a <em>Fallout 5</em> “one-pager”</h2> <p>A few years later, during an <a href="https://youtu.be/LUOZsjTwbLU?t=1207">interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, Howard spilled a bit more about the next <em>Fallout</em> sequel. He told the outlet that Bethesda has a “one-pager on <em>Fallout 5</em>, what we want to do,” but made it clear that the plan at the time was <em>Starfield</em> and then <em>Elder Scrolls VI,</em> seemingly confirming that<em>&nbsp;Fallout 5</em> remained many, many years away.</p>

 <h2>June 2022 – <em>Fallout 5</em> is next after <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls VI</em></h2> <p>The following year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-new-details-todd-howard-interview">in another interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, Howard said this about Bethesda’s future:</p> <blockquote><p>“Yes, <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> is in pre-production and, you know, we’re going to be doing<em> Fallout 5</em> after that, so our slate’s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.”</p></blockquote> <h2>June 2023 – <em>Fallout 5</em> might not be Bethesda’s next game after <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em></h2> <p>A year after saying <em>Fallout 5</em> would be Bethesda’s next project after shipping <em>Elder Scrolls VI,</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/0Gs22Sn2VMU?t=1166">Howard backtracked a bit</a> and clarified that he simply meant that <em>Fallout 5</em> would arrive after <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>, not that he wanted to confirm it as the next game. This confusing backtrack worried fans who now wondered if Bethesda had a different project in the works that could further delay <em>Fallout 5. </em>In this same interview, he argued that long gaps between sequels, while annoying for fans, have rarely hurt a game’s success or quality.</p>

 <h2>March 2024 – <em>Fallout</em> TV showrunners were told to avoid certain details that will be in <em>Fallout 5</em></h2> <p>After causing a ruckus online by claiming that the<em> Fallout</em> TV show was “basically <em>Fallout 5,</em>” showrunner Johnathan Nolan clarified that he just meant this is the next story in the universe and not a replacement for an upcoming game. In fact, the show is actively avoiding some parts of the franchise <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-show-todd-howard-amazon-1851325762">because it would cause problems for <em>Fallout 5.</em></a></p>

 <p>“Well, there&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;some things where I said, ‘Don’t do this because we are going to do that in&nbsp;<em>Fallout 5</em>,’” Howard told <em><a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/fallout-tv-series-todd-howard-fallout-5/">Den of Geek</a>.</em></p> <h2>April 2024 – Todd Howard dodges a question about <em>Fallout 5</em>‘s release after <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em></h2> <p>When talking to <em>IGN</em>, Howard was yet again asked about <em>Fallout 5</em> launching after <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>. This time,<a href="https://youtu.be/7dSeF1CMChs?t=1308"> he straight-up dodged the question</a>, but did confirm that Bethesda is working on different projects. “I’m going to avoid putting dates on anything, I’ve learned that the hard way,” said Howard. “So, obviously, you know, our focus as far as new development right now is <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>, but that doesn’t mean that we’re not making plans for other things.”</p>

 <h2>June 2024 – Bethesda is not in a rush to release a new <em>Fallout</em> game</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-new-vegas-2-fo3-remaster-starfield-dlc-1851544120">During a 2024 interview with YouTuber MrMattyPlays,</a> Howard said that Bethesda didn’t feel the need to “rush out” a new <em>Fallout</em> sequel or spin-off, though he also acknowledged that the wait between<em> Fallout 4</em> and <em>Fallout 5</em> is growing longer and longer.</p> <blockquote><p>“Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game. And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s <em>Elder Scrolls</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, or now<em>&nbsp;Starfield</em>, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do.”</p></blockquote> <h2>October 2025 – Howard ends Fallout Day stream with a promise that more is being worked on</h2> <p>To celebrate Fallout Day, the day the bombs fell in-universe and destroyed the Earth, Bethesda held a digital showcase to announce a <em>Fallout 4</em> update, reveal some <em>Fallout 76</em> news, and not much else. Seemingly aware that this presentation would be disappointing to fans longing for <em>Fallout 5,</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-day-fallout-5-tease-event-remaster-2000638661">Howard appeared at the end</a> to offer some hope, telling fans that the studio is “working on even more” and that Bethesda is “looking forward to the day” when all is revealed.</p> <h2>December 2025 – Howard confirms <em>Fallout 5</em> won’t ignore the TV show</h2> <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo">In an interview with the <em>BBC</em></a>, Howard was asked if the events of the <em>Fallout</em> show are being considered by the devs while making <em>Fallout 5</em>. Would the show and the game really exist in one world?</p>

 <p>“In short, yes,” Howard told the outlet. “<em>Fallout 5</em> will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening. We are taking that into account.”</p> <h2>December 2025 –&nbsp; Bethesda is still working hard on more <em>Fallout&nbsp;</em></h2> <p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/23/bethesda-talks-fallouts-future-and-lessons-learned#:~:text=%22I%20will%20say,for%20our%20fans.%22">Speaking to <em>Game Informer</em>,</a> Howard made it clear that <em>Fallout</em> is a very important franchise for Bethesda and that it has been working on projects related to the post-apocalyptic world for a long time.</p> <blockquote><p>“I will say, first, looking at <em>76</em>, we’ve never stopped developing <em>Fallout</em>. We’ve had a full team on <em>Fallout</em> for a long time. So <em>Fallout</em>, as a franchise, is the one we’re still doing the most work in above anything. Now, the majority of our internal studio is on<em> Elder Scrolls VI.</em> We are doing other things with <em>Fallout</em> that we haven’t announced, and you know, there’ll come a time for that. I get the sort of anxiety from fans, like, ‘Well, what else? What else? Feed me!’ But, look, we’re working on stuff, and we do like to wait. And so, I think there’ll be a moment to talk about that, and we want to make those special moments for our fans.”</p></blockquote>

			<p>It's safe to say that our top five list of best adventure games released in 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tops last year's</a>, thanks to the greater variety of mechanical experimentation and enhanced emotional depth offered by the new releases.</p>



<p>From philosophical claymation nightmares to puzzle mansions that redefine established conventions, these developers, often unable to unload a triple-A budget during production, proved that the adventure genre is at the very forefront of gaming's narrative and artistic ambitions, delivering incredibly varied experiences that focus more on letting the players think instead of mashing buttons.</p>



<p><em>Other Best Games of 2025 per Category: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/"><strong>Fighting Games</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-best-sports-and-racing-games-2025/"><strong>Sports &amp; Racing Games</strong>,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/"><strong>Role-Playing Games</strong></a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2025-a-year-of-frights/"><strong>Horror Games</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2025-jumping-and-smashing-to-victory/"><strong>Platformers</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2025-the-year-of-the-indie/"><strong>Indie Games</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/"><strong>Action</strong></a></em>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2025-expanding-the-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>DLC/Expansion</em></a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2025-firing-has-never-felt-so-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shooter Games</em></a></strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blue-Prince-Key-Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-blue-prince">Blue Prince</h2>



<p>Primarily developed by a single developer called Tonda Ros, Blue Prince emerged as 2025's most critically acclaimed game across its first quarter, surpassing AAA launches and establishing itself as an early contender for the end-of-the-year awards. The game was in development for nine years, but the wait was definitely worth it.</p>



<p>The room-drafting system is the main attraction. As the heir to Mt. Holly Estate in search of the elusive Room 46 (the stipulation made by the deceased great uncle for protagonist Simon P. Jones to gain access to his inheritance), players don't simply navigate a static environment; they modify it. Upon encountering a closed door, players choose from a pool of available room cards. These decisions fundamentally alter the puzzle landscape: a Library provides ladders and hidden passages, a Workshop grants access to gear puzzles, and a Drawing Room allows for redrafting adjacent rooms. The act of selecting room types becomes the core puzzle, not just a narrative device.</p>



<p>It sounds deceptively simple, but there's hidden complexity at play here. Each room has orientation mechanics, connection rules, and specific puzzle prerequisites. Ambitious chambers demand seven preceding room types, forcing players to plan runs with chess-like precision. At the same time, the randomized draft pool ensures no two playthroughs feel identical. There are ways to retain items between runs. You can also gain permanent upgrades. These provide extra steps, gems, or coins at the start of a run.</p>



<p>The main narrative weaves seamlessly through mechanical gameplay, and there are also side mysteries to tackle, such as the disappearance of kids' author Marion Marigold. Ultimately, there's little doubt that Blue Prince is the year's most successful puzzle adventure game, not to mention one that will be celebrated and remembered for a very long time.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/the-midnight-walk-keyart-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</h2>



<p>The Midnight Walk, the debut game from MoonHood, a Swedish indie developer founded by ex Zoink developers who worked on Lost in Random, is a first-person adventure set in a world consumed by darkness and rendered entirely through stop-motion craft—utilizing yarn, papier-mâché, felt, and paint. Here, two characters, the player character known as the Burnt One (a charred husk of a being who rises from a grave) and the companion known as Potboy (a small candle-like being whose flame illuminates darkness and attracts ravenous creatures desperate for its warmth), eventually meet. The Burnt One lacks sight and hearing initially and so pairs with Potboy as the two cover each other's weaknesses.</p>



<p>Together, they journey toward Moon Mountain to restore the sun. Through the six chapters, the developers tell self-contained stories that unveil what happened to these haunted forests, ruined villages, and corrupted landscapes. Each story explores loss, regret, and the question: can we ever make things right?</p>



<p>Mechanically, it could be called a walking simulator. However, its delivery of the narrative is extremely effective: MoonHood employs stunning black-and-white short films, true visual poetry that conveys emotion without the need for dialogue. Indeed, somehow the game continues to elicit strong emotions from players throughout each chapter and without overstaying its welcome (the game takes between seven and eight hours to complete).</p>



<p>The Midnight Walk proves that the genre does not need combat at all to win over gamers, relying instead on sheer artistic and emotional value to provide a memorable experience that also tastefully explores profound themes. Playing it with a Virtual Reality headset offers the maximum level of immersion.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Keeper-Art.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-keeper-6-5">Keeper (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/keeper-review-shine-a-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6.5</a>)</h2>



<p>After the critically acclaimed Psychonauts 2, Double Fine Productions returns four years later with Keeper, a visually gorgeous and thematically sophisticated adventure game. The premise sounds whimsical: an animated lighthouse walks across a bizarre landscape, eventually acquiring the ability to jump, float, and even manipulate time. But industry legend Tim Schafer and his colleagues leveraged that whimsy factor to explore how two fundamentally different beings, the lighthouse and a bird-like creature called Twig, can build trust and grow together.</p>



<p>The lighthouse manipulates light beams in two modes: unfocused (subtle environmental influence, triggering growth and reactions) and focused (precise puzzle-solving, object transformation, pathway revelation). Twig, on the other hand, assists by reaching perches, activating levers, and flagging secrets. Puzzles typically demand combining light manipulation and bird-enabled interactions—neither character is complete alone. A bit like in The Midnight Walk, this mechanical interdependence mirrors the narrative theme: one character's weakness is the other's strength.</p>



<p>The art direction is transcendent. Environments shift between color palettes that underscore emotional tone: lush greens for hope, ash-gray for desolation, and pink-mist valleys for surreal wonder. Do note that the game doesn't feature any traditional dialogue, and that's by design, as Double Fine wanted to leave Twig and the lighthouse's adventure entirely open to interpretation. As such, it might not be a game for everyone, as noted by Chris Wray in Wccftech's review. That said, it's certainly worth looking into, especially for its absolutely breathtaking art style.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Lost-Records-Bloom-Rage.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-lost-records-bloom-amp-rage">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</h2>



<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unsuccessful commercial release</a> of the God of War-like action adventure RPG Banished: Ghosts of New Eden (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which I maintain was severely underrated</a>), Don't Nod returned to their narrative adventure roots with Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, a game that clearly hearkens back to their most acclaimed work: Life is Strange. </p>



<p>The narrative framework is split across two timelines: 1995 and 2022. In the present day, Swann Holloway (the only playable character) returns to her hometown of Velvet Cove after 27 years, reuniting with childhood friends who haven't spoken since a shared traumatic event they collectively repressed. In the past, players watch these four girls (Swann and her friends Autumn, Nora, and Kat) during a transformative summer where friendship deepened into something supernatural. They form a band, the titular Bloom &amp; Rage, discover a mysterious glowing Abyss in the forest, and make a blood pact with unknowable consequences.</p>



<p>Just like in Life is Strange, the characters seen in this game aren't paper-thin archetypes; they're complex, contradictory human beings. Swann wrestles with artistic ambition versus belonging. Autumn struggles between family duty and personal authenticity. Nora navigates privilege and responsibility. Kat faces terminal illness and the question of legacy. </p>



<p>The mystery unfolds through fractured memories, and there is a distinctly different vibe in the two timelines: 1995 feels idyllic, while 2022 reveals trauma and unprocessed guilt. The writing and aesthetic also perfectly capture the era, including the pre-smartphone immediacy of friendship, and the intensity of teenage bonds that felt infinite until they abruptly ended.</p>



<p>The game was released in two episodes. The first, titled Tape 1, received almost unanimous praise, while the second turned out more divisive among Dontnod fans. That said, the game is proof that the studio hasn't lost its touch in portraying the teenage experience.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dispatch-art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h2>



<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-closing-walking-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of Telltale Games in 2018</a>, several former employees established a new team called AdHoc Studio. It took a long time before their first game made it to the market, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dispatch</a> made a massive impact among adventure games when it arrived in 2025's final quarter, immediately establishing itself as a must-play game. Its premise is that Robert Robertson III, formerly the superhero Mecha Man, is drowning in desperation after the precious suit built by his grandfather gets seemingly destroyed beyond repair in a showdown with the villain Shroud.</p>



<p>Robert has no powers of his own and thus is unable to continue his lifelong fight against crime until a bona fide superhero, Blonde Blazer, approaches him about helping in another way: as a dispatcher for the Superhero Dispatch Network (SDN). Not only is Blazer offering a job, but she also promises that the SDN will fund repairs to the Mecha Man suit. The catch is that Robert gets assigned to the Z-Team, a group of reformed supervillains enrolled in the so-called Phoenix Program, a Hail Mary-type bet in an attempt to make superheroes out of them.</p>



<p>The narrative is woven with impressive expertise, shifting seamlessly between a funny workplace comedy with plenty of jokes and jabs and a deep meditation on redemption, found family, and trust. The writing is exceptional, making the characters feel three-dimensional and real, but the performances are a match, with renowned actors Aaron Paul and Jeffrey Wright delivering stunning voiceovers as Robert and Chase.</p>



<p>Mechanically, the game combines the rippling dialogue choices seen in Telltale's previous games with a workplace simulator/team management component, where players must choose which hero to dispatch on each day's missions, ensuring they are a good match to complete the task while also keeping them happy in the process. </p>



<p>AdHoc Studio crafted a setting that feels very refreshing compared to your usual superhero universes. Personally, I cannot wait to find out what's next for Mecha Man, Blonde Blazer, and the others, though the next game might have to find a different core mechanics than dispatching heroes.</p>

  </picture><p>It is, appropriately, set in the dark fantasy setting of <em>The Black Company</em> series created by Glen Cook. The series is known for focusing on the experience of soldiers in heroic fantasy settings. Human fighters that just want to do their job, get a stiff drink, and stay alive one more day.&nbsp;</p><p>The players are mercenaries drafted into the titular Black Company, a group of soldiers sent to fight and die on deadly missions for an Empire ruled by sorcerers with godlike power. This means constant missions and campaigns against impossible odds where death is almost guaranteed.</p><p><em>The Black Company Roleplaying Game</em> will attempt to bring that level of grit and struggle to gaming tables. The game contains rules for making your own characters and campaigns as well as play as key characters from the books.</p><p>The core system revolves around percentile dice, much like Cubicle 7's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-old-world-rpg-players-guide-preview" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer</em></a> TTRPGs. Only the players roll dice for all skill tests. In addition, the game has no hit points or sanity points; players have a single Damage and Stress state respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>The first initial playtest for <em>The Black Company Roleplaying Game</em> will be available until February 1, 2026. This material will focus on the game's core rules. It will contain a 10-page packet, six premade characters, a prewritten adventure, and a one-page city map.</p><p>Players are encouraged to submit feedback via an online survey and are encouraged to do Actual Play recordings. All Arc Dream asks regarding the latter is to disclose the game is a playtest and not the final version.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<figure data-uuid="5a355c79d7a30"><a title="Nintendo Hints That Metroid Prime 4's Tortured Development &quot;Divorced&quot; It From The Evolution Of The FPS Genre 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5a355c79d7a30/nintendo-hints-that-metroid-prime-4s-tortured-development-divorced-it-from-the-evolution-of-the-fps-genre-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you'll know if you've <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">read our review</a>, we adored <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, and consider it to be one of the highlights of the Switch 2's library.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/">with a Metacritic rating of 79 at the time of writing</a>, it's clear that Samus' latest adventure didn't strike the same chord with many players.</p>
<p>It's certainly a different experience from prior Metroid outings, and it seems that Nintendo is willing to chalk this down to its protracted development period – lest we forget, it was originally announced in 2017 with Bandai Namco assisting, but was rebooted in 2019 with Retro Studios returning to the helm.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/" rel="noopener">Famitsu</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson (a name isn't given, it's worth noting) gives the following assessment of Metroid Prime 4's development period (thanks to <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-discusses-its-approach-to-metroid-prime-4-and-why-it-isnt-open-world/">Nintendo Everything</a> for the translation):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“At the start of the project, perhaps due to the influence of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, we saw a lot of comments on the internet saying ‘we want to play an open-world Metroid’. However, Metroid’s core element of ‘increasing the amount of explorable areas by unlocking powers’ is not very compatible with the ‘freedom to go anywhere from the beginning’ of open worlds. Thus we thought to design a limited area that could be freely explored, and have that be a hub that could connect to other areas. Then we thought that if one could move around on the bike in a satisfying way in that area, it could be a segment that mitigates the tension from exploration, and paces the whole game.</p>
<p>In the end, the game took much longer than expected to finish, and we realized that players’ impressions toward open-world games had changed. That being said, development had already been reset once before (when we started again from scratch with Retro Studios) so backtracking development again was out of the question, and we resolved to move forward with our original vision. During this time, shooting games and action games went through evolutions, with an increase in game speed in particular, but taking in those changes would have made it difficult to construct the tempo of an adventure game, so we actively chose to not take them into account. Therefore, I think this game is pretty much divorced from the changing of times.”</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as we (and many other outlets) loved Metroid Prime 4, it's fair to say that Retro Studios wouldn't have chosen to inherit a design template it had little influence or control over, and this surprisingly candid interview appears to back up this assumption.</p>

For over a decade, my family smiled through every milestone, whether it was a birthday, an anniversary, or something else, happy my grandma could be a part of it.&nbsp;</p><p>My wife and I welcomed a beautiful baby girl into this world earlier this year and my grandma hasn’t met her.&nbsp;</p><p>She never will, because in 2023, she died due to returning cancer complications, and I wasn’t there. I was in France for a work trip, and I still so vividly remember the call I got that terrible evening. I remember the once delightful smells of the noodles before me, which quickly turned nauseating; I remember telling my coworker I had to leave, recognizing that he instantly knew what I had learned; I remember seeing a sunset so beautiful that words don’t do it justice, as if grandma was telling me, “I’m better now,” on my way back to the hotel, where I’d spend hours crying, wishing I could see her one more time, wishing I could squeeze cancer like a rotting orange, ridding this earth of its putrid juices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have always hated cancer – it takes and it takes and it kills and it infects and it taints and it threatens indiscriminately.&nbsp;</p><p>I like to believe my grandma is in a better place, wherever or whatever that might be; surely she’s not suffering anymore, right? But she did at one time, and my grandpa, who has since told me countless times he’s ready to depart from this world to see her again, does, and my mom, who slowly watched her mom fight relentlessly a battle she’d eventually lose, does, and I do. Still, I have always hated cancer, but now I really, really hate cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<em><strong>The rest of the this piece contains spoilers for Total Chaos</strong></em></p><hr><p>Total Chaos is a horror game in all the ways the genre typically entails. There’s blood and gore and monsters and jump scares and terror. But Total Chaos is also a catharsis, letting me take all manner of makeshift weaponry straight to the heart of a rot. Every thwack and swing, every gunshot, brought a smile to my face as I ripped through a mysterious disease rotting Tyler, both the protagonist and antagonist, to the core as he battles cancer, depression, and the recklessness with which those diseases affect not just the diagnosed, but everyone in its blast radius.</p>

<p>Fort Oasis was once a vibrant mining town that Tyler and his wife called home. But home became a cage for Tyler and his wife, the former unable to leave this now-decrepit place, the latter desperate to return to the mainland and be closer to family. Critically, she also cannot take the pain of watching Tyler’s cancer and subsequent depression morph him into someone unrecognizable, someone capable of crafting together sticks, rocks, nails, and hammer heads into weapons of destruction that he uses to lay waste to the cancerous hordes stumbling through Fort Oasis.&nbsp;</p><p>These hordes consist of a few types of enemies that all blend into a lifeless amalgamation of blood, gore, and muscular atrophy. I could criticize this, but cancer is lifeless – void of the humanity which it feasts on – and so their design is apt. Like cancer, they are once recognizable conglomerations of cells that have become something I care not to give the space to breathe, and so I hack away at every. single. one. The game often encourages me to run ahead to safety; instead, I recklessly use each item in my inventory to guarantee every monster stays down and dead forever, bashing lifeless bodies long dead as I imagine each as a cell unable to stop growing, like the ones that attempted to desecrate my grandma’s beautiful soul.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a horror game for them, but not for me. It is catharsis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like the enemies my hatred gorges on, maze-like levels shed their mystery and become my stomping grounds for catastrophe. I search every nook and cranny for crafting supplies, medkits, and rotten food to continue my insatiable appetite so that the beatings can continue. Total Chaos is a constant fight between a game with mechanics like health, hunger, and bleed, and my desire to kill just one more monster in her name.</p><p>Throughout my 12 hours with Total Chaos, Tyler’s voice morphs into a melody encouraging me to go on. I’m reminded of the countless times I squeezed my grandma’s hand, asking – no, begging – her to keep fighting. And she did, for me, so I did, for Tyler.&nbsp;</p><p>She just wanted to be free. He just wanted to be free.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Defeating cancer is to outlast that poison. Cells scream in agony as chemo ends their torment, but so, too, does the rest of the body. Defeating cancer is to outlast those cells, for as the poison kills them, it also kills you.&nbsp;</p><p>And so I continued surviving in Total Chaos, trudging through hedge mazes filled with exploding corpses, concrete forests, and flesh-ridden buildings, and deeper to the black, rotting, festering core of Tyler’s expanding ache.&nbsp;</p><p>The finale: I must outlive Tyler. He is Tyler. Tyler is Tyler.&nbsp;</p><p>One man desperate to fight, to restore…&nbsp;</p><p>…the other, desperate to rest.&nbsp;</p><p>There, and only there, did the bloodshed end as I pummeled Every. Single. Bullet at my disposal, straight into the heart of this pain. Then, he was free. The credits rolled. The chaos was over. But both darkness and light remained, hovering over Fort Oasis, watching over what was left.</p><p>I like to believe Tyler is in a better place, wherever or whatever that might be; surely he’s not suffering anymore, right?</p><hr><p><em>If you or someone you know is struggling with cancer, the Cancer Support Community toll-free hotline is open 7 days a week and can be reached at 888-793-9355.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinions/2025/12/26/hating-cancer-and-the-cutthroat-catharsis-of-total-chaos]]></content:encoded>
