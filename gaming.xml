		<p>Last month, Nightdive Studios confirmed it was working on The Thing: Remastered, a remake of the 2002 game that was based on the 1982 classic sci-fi horror film. While details are scant on the release date for The Thing: Remastered, Nightdive Studios has released a new developer diary which focuses on the game’s artwork and design, showing some of the differences from the 2002 game.</p>
<p><iframe title="How Is The Art Progressing on The Thing: Remastered? Full Deep Dive Interview with Joel Welsh" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzvs7EXgCxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Thing: Remastered deep dive on the artwork is conducted by Locke Vincent and he is joined by Joel Welsh, the studio’s art lead, who explains some of the decisions being made. For example, in the screenshots of the The Thing: Remastered we are shown that there is more detail, like tiles on the floor and additional signage compared to the original game. Joel also confirms that some of the development team of the original had been able to supply information for Nightdive Studios to use and work with, allowing for a smoother development process for this remaster. A lot of the assets remain the same, but in a higher resolution. Each change is being done on a case by case basis, with care being made that any changes fit with the scenes of the game and the film.</p>
<p>It has to be said that all of the work shown by Nightdive Studios is still a work in progress, and that there will be further changes to the visual design of the remaster. As said, we do not yet know when The Thing: Remastered will be released though we do know it is expected for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/21/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-announced-features-captain-america-and-black-panther/">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra&nbsp;</a>was announced back in March by Marvel and Skydance, offering a new story for Marvel in videogames, with the focus being on Captain America and Black Panther during World War II. Today, it has been confirmed that Skydance has partnered with PLAION, which will handle the global distribution rights of Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lb2wwEx6DVw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We are proud to partner with Skydance Games and industry legend Amy Hennig on what is one of the most anticipated AAA games currently in development,”</em> said Klemens Kundratitz, CEO, PLAION.<em> “This partnership between two ambitious independent companies is a testament to PLAION’s ongoing mission to become a global force in videogame publishing.”</em></p>
<p><em>“We believe PLAION is the perfect publishing partner for the multiplatform, worldwide release of&nbsp;MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra”</em> said Julian Beak, Co-President at Skydance Games. <em>“For our studio’s debut title, we’re crafting an original Marvel story directed by Amy Hennig. We’re thrilled to have found a global publisher that shares our ambitious vision for the project.”</em></p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will have four playable characters with the perspectives switching between Captain America, Black Panther, Nanali, and Gabriel Jones. This will give different gameplay aspects too, with Nanali likely having much more sneaking and spying compared to the other characters. The cast for the game will be Khary Payton as Azzuri, T’Challa’s grandfather and the Black Panther in this game’s timeline, Drew Moerlein taking on the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America, Megalyn Echikunwoke portraying Nanali, a Wakandan spy, Marque Richardson lending his voice to Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, Lyne Renée voicing Julie, a member of the French Resistance, and Howard Stark, Tony Stark’s father, is being voiced by Joel Johnstone.</p>

<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is set to release in 2025, with PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S being the likely platforms.</p>

<p>If you do have Jackbox games in your library, though, you'll be able to sift through them and choose whichever one you want to play without having to load up the relevant game.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll also be able to organize your library and sort it according to your preferences, so if there are Jackbox games you don't like, you can leave them out of your&nbsp;<em>Megapicker&nbsp;</em>if you prefer.</p>
<p>If you're lacking Jackbox games, then the studio's got some rather enticing offers for you to take advantage of, including a free game to get your collection started, as well as a sale.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you like your time with&nbsp;<em>Drawful 2&nbsp;</em>and you want to pick up new games - or if you've yet to embark on your Jackbox journey, full stop - then&nbsp;<em>The Jackbox Party Pack</em>, the first game in the series, is available at a 90% discount for a month starting from today.</p>
<p>Various other sales will also be available on&nbsp;<em>Jackbox Party Pack&nbsp;</em>games, so make sure to keep an eye on the Steam pages for the games so you don't miss out.</p>
<p><em>The Jackbox Megapicker&nbsp;</em>is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2828500/The_Jackbox_Megapicker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">right now for free on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mini-motorways-dev-canceled-magic-school<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mini Motorways&nbsp;</em>developer Dinosaur Polo Club has released details about a canceled project called&nbsp;<em>Magic School</em>, calling the release of the information a chance to "celebrate what we learned along the way and the incredible work from our team".</p>
<p>In a press release, Dinosaur Polo Club says that telling its fans about&nbsp;<em>Magic School&nbsp;</em>could serve as a chance to "transparently discuss learnings" from the project, which hasn't resulted in any changes to the studio's staff numbers (something that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netherrealm-mobile-shut-down-rumor-layoffs">becoming increasingly rare</a> in the games industry).</p>
<p>As Dinosaur Polo Club tells it,&nbsp;<em>Magic School&nbsp;</em>would have been a chance to break out of the "minimalist simulation games" for which the studio is known and try something different.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-school-canceled-mini-motorways-courtyard.jpg?itok=Mvo25Lvw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-school-canceled-mini-motorways-courtyard.jpg?itok=Exh5gEBb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Magic School&nbsp;</em>would have been a break from tradition for&nbsp;<em>Mini Motorways&nbsp;</em>developer Dinosaur Polo Club.</figcaption></figure><p>Designer Zala Habib says the Dinosaur Polo Club team was "an absolutely incredible" and "driven" group of people, and that collaborating with the "talented" staff working on the game was a "joy".</p>
<p>Over time, Dinosaur Polo Club says that its work on <i>Magic School&nbsp;</i>made it clear that the vision for the game was leading the studio towards a project that required "a far larger team size than the studio could sustainably support".</p>
<p>The studio says that although its staff were excited by the "breadth of visual exploration and specific game systems",&nbsp;<em>Magic School</em>'s complexity was "at odds with the intuitive, quick-to-learn gameplay" for which Dinosaur Polo Club has become known.</p>
<p>CEO Amie Wolken says that the studio "simply did not see a path forward for <em>Magic School</em>", but that studios shouldn't be "shy" about sharing information regarding projects that didn't end up working for whatever reason.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-school-canceled-mini-motorways-art.jpg?itok=GpFk5y3L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-school-canceled-mini-motorways-art.jpg?itok=iSQv-TXP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dinosaur Polo Club wants the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Magic School&nbsp;</em>to be a learning experience.</figcaption></figure><p>Instead of working on&nbsp;<em>Magic School</em>, Dinosaur Polo Club says it'll redirect the staff who were working on the game to a new project "within their celebrated Mini series".</p>
<p>Looks like if you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mini-motorways-launches-september-19th-for-apple-arcade-pc-to-follow"><em>Mini Motorways</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Mini Metro</em>, then you're in luck. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Considering Astro's Playroom served as a brilliant (and free!) demonstration of the DualSense Controller's unique features, it feels rather fitting that PlayStation has unveiled the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Astro Bot Limited Edition DualSense Controller</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many video game stories basically boil down to being forced to do chores for strangers: all that world-saving, enemy-farming, <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Frying_Pan,_Spick_and_Span" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please-find-my-pan stuff</a> is pretty weird when you think about it. <a href="https://thankgoodness.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em></a>, out August 1 on PC, Switch, and PlayStation, highlights this absurdity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You play as a little salesman–small enough to fit down sink drains and chimneys–who comes to the Northern England town of Barnsworth to meet with the mayor. You immediately wander off into town, which is full of strange folks who all need a hand with something. They ask you to find their missing tools, fetch them meat for their pies, water their gardens, deal with their rat problems, help them with their shopping, and more.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Thank Goodness You're Here! – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W-Vyg4J6RBU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This is all done through light puzzles and basic platforming, which is appropriate since you only have two buttons: one to jump, and one to slap. Most things in the world are reactive to your slaps in some way, and it never got old to just stroll the town hitting things and people to see what would happen. Solving puzzles moves the story ahead and opens up new areas, and it was never too tough to figure out where I had to go next or to wander into a task’s solution.</p><p>This lets the game’s setting shine. Barnsworth is a ton of fun to explore, and each quest you’re sent on teaches you more about the town and the relationships between its people. You discover crushes and petty conflicts, fears and dreams, and a bunch of delightful weirdos who, in addition to being people, can also be flowers, rats, or worms. The town itself is full of texture and fun details, from commercials for local brands to funny signs and graffiti. Many seemingly offhand jokes recur and develop–an argument over a trash bin that blossoms into a relationship, a student driver moving around town–and situations change as you solve puzzles as well. All this makes Barnsworth feel active and lived-in, while still being grounded in the day-to-day of small town life.</p><p><em>Thank Goodness</em> is a comedy game, and while my only reference for the genres it’s drawing on is watching <em>Monty Python</em> as a kid, I admired how its absurdity never veered too far into nonsense. It’s also able to poke fun at its characters and their provincial ways without devolving into meanness or using them as punchlines. There’s a lot of love for its setting and inspirations, from the clever use of live-action stock footage of England to the ability to set the language to Northern English dialect. (There’s also a musical number, which I think should be a feature of… well, literally everything.)&nbsp;</p><p><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em> took me about two hours to complete, though locked Steam achievements and some new tasks I discovered poking back into it this morning suggest there’s more stuff to find off the beaten path. I love the quirky, big-hearted vibe of the game, and I'm excited for my friends better versed in its setting to explain all the very English jokes that went over my head. If you'd like to get a taste of the game before its release later this week, there's a demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366980/Thank_Goodness_Youre_Here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/29/24208726/astro-bot-limited-edition-ps5-dual-sense-controller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and Team Asobi — the developers behind the forthcoming <em>Astro Bot</em> — have teamed up to design and release <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller/">a limited edition<em> Astro Bot</em> DualSense controller</a>.</p></div><p>Just look at it. I <em>need</em> it.</p><p>The <em>Astro Bot </em>limited edition controller adds blue controller grips and sci-fi accents and features Astro’s signature pair of bright blue eyes on the touchpad that, based on the adorable trailer, appear to blink at you. (They better blink at you — what’s the point of the eyes if they don’t blink at you?)</p><p>Team Asobi has added a bunch of new interactions between DualSense controllers and the <em>Astro Bot</em> game, some of which I got to experience during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180304/summer-game-fest-2024-best-games">my demo of the game at Summer Game Fest</a>. The team has increased the number of textures you can feel through the controller like sand, glass, or metal. All of Astro’s new power-ups will have a distinct feel to them thanks to haptic feedback and the adaptive triggers. In the demo, there are little spark plugs you frequently have to pull out of the ground. The sound effects coming out of the controller combined with the slowly increasing resistance on the triggers made it actually feel like yanking on stubborn wires.</p><p>The controller will be available for preorder on August 9th in select countries, retailing for $79.99. Or you can try your luck buying it from select retailers worldwide on September 6th — the same day as <em>Astro Bot’s</em> launch. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Addam immediately pledges fealty to the Queen, who is stunned by him—Targaryens have long believed that they were the only House able to ride dragons. It’s this trait which makes them godly enough to rule the seven kingdoms. The apprehensive Queen invites Addam to Dragonstone. Addam conveniently leaves out his Velaryon parentage.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The rumor of a rider on Seasmoke has made it to King’s Landing and to the Master of Whispers, Larys. But the assumption that the rider is Rhaena makes Larys not believe it, so he shrugs it off and instead puts his efforts on Aegon and getting him well enough to walk.</p><p>Not everyone on Team Black is on-board with bastard dragonriders, but Mysaria’s guidance on the smallfolk (and the sheer number of Targaryen bastards in King’s Landing) leads Rhaenyra towards a whole new war strategy: “Let us raise an army of bastards.”</p><p>Addam gives Lord Corlys his two weeks’ notice on his shipmate job, avoiding the real conversation they should be having. And Corlys continues that avoidance by simply telling Addam, “Well done.” He is not beating the deadbeat dad allegations.<br></p><p>Daemon finally gets his comeuppance at Harrenhal in the form of the 14-year-old Lord Oscar Tullly. You see, Oscar did not forget Daemon’s subtle advice to kill his grandfather or his guidance to Lord Blackwood to wage horrific crimes against the Brackens. The gathering of all the Riverlords turns into a criminal court when Oscar boldly uses King Consort Daemon to dispense justice on his only ally, William Blackwood. Daemon finally sees the consequences to ruling with such violence. He further questions his ambitions when hallucinating an actively decaying Viserys who offers him the crown. We see Daemon hesitate in his thirst for power for the first time.<br></p><p>Elsewhere, Rhaena and the boy princes begin their journey from the Vale to Pentos, but she sneaks away in search of the dragon on the loose. </p><p>Throughout all the exciting developments in this episode, the writers have Alicent get so depressed she has to go camping. That’s it.<br></p><p>Jace confronts Rhaenyra about the dragonseed plot and gets out some of his own bastard-born issues. He doesn’t trust the lowborn, even though the original search for a dragonrider was his idea. If any low-blood/born Targaryen mounts a dragon and becomes a God, what’s there to say they won’t challenge Jace’s claim to the throne or Rhaenyra’s? </p><p>Alyn and Corlys have the yet another scene by the docks, where Alyn proclaims that he is “of salt and sea” and will not try to claim a dragon. But he does agree to play a part in the Team Black scheme to gather the King’s Landing bastards as a messenger.<br></p><p>The King’s Landing bastards all hear the rumors that Queen Rhaenyra is holding auditions for a dragonrider like she’s Simon Cowell and this is <em>The X Factor</em>. The local drunk, Ulf, who consistently brags about his connection to the Targaryens, needs to be hyped up by his friends in order to agree to go to Dragonstone. The blacksmith, Hugh, reveals his Targaryen heritage to his wife and seizes the opportunity to try his hand at dragon taming.<br></p><p>When the silver-haired smallfolk arrive at Dragonstone, the dragonkeepers do a company walkout. They refuse to help Rhaenyra use dragons as war playthings ridden by anyone regardless of status. Rhaenyra stays the course and lets her half-family know the risks of approaching a dragon.<br></p><p>The scene unfolds as expected, with Vermithor turning this audition into his private lunch. The dragonseeds attempt to escape. Hugh exhibits his pure heart by protecting a fellow dragonseed and going head to head with Vermithor, and this dragon likes the nice guys so he heels to Hugh.<br></p><p>Ulf escapes through the dragon caves until he comes upon Silverwing and I guess she has a thing for sloppy drunkards, because she lets him claim her.<br></p><p>The Green council meeting is interrupted when Ulf can’t resist riding Silverwing over King’s Landing to show the boys he got out of the hood. Aemond angrily runs to Vhagar and rides to Dragonstone, only to see Rhaenyra at the shore surrounded by dragons with riders. Aemond flees, outnumbered.</p><p>Team Black is up three, but will the dragonseeds keep their promises of loyalty? The dragon war begins next week on the second season finale.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=156085.101105873&amp;trid=1197689.218054&amp;foc=17&amp;fot=9999&amp;fos=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2Fshows%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon%2Fc68e69d7-9317-428a-a615-cdf8fe5a2e06&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=156085.101105873&amp;trid=1197689.218054&amp;foc=17&amp;fot=9999&amp;fos=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2Fshows%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon%2Fc68e69d7-9317-428a-a615-cdf8fe5a2e06" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a></span> is streaming now on Max.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA Sports has released its latest deep for EA Sports FC 25. The latest goes over the brand new game mode coming to the game this year, Rush.</p>



<p>Rush is a new 5v5 game mode played on a smaller field. The mode seemingly replaces the departing Volta mode from past games, expanding on the offerings.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 25 | Official Rush Deep Dive" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gd42YDR4ds8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-ea-sports-fc-25-rush-details">EA Sports FC 25 Rush Details</h2>



<p>Rush will be available for players throughout a number of modes and offer variety to players throughout.  Rush will be available within Football Ultimate Team, Clubs, Manager Career, and standard Kick-Off modes.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ultimate Team Rush:</strong> “Bring your favourite Player Item and team up with friends in locked-to-player 5v5 matches.”</li>



<li><strong>Clubs Rush: </strong>“Squad up with friends and take your Clubs experience to the Rush Pitch.”</li>



<li><strong>Manager Rush:</strong> “Get closer to your Youth Academy development throughout the season with new playable 5v5 Rush tournaments.”</li>



<li><strong>Kick-Off Rush:</strong> Choose any team from the available leagues to play in a Rush game.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-how-rush-works">How Rush Works</h3>



<p>Rush is played on a field that is about 41.5% the size of a traditional 11v11 field. The field sits at 63.7×46.6 meters with a goal to “encourage lateral passing and maintains adequate width that helps prevent the playing area from feeling too narrow.”</p>



<p>The game’s last seven minutes with no half time. The clock only stops when the ball goes out of play. Should a game be tied after seven minutes, a 2:20 golden-goal period will begin. Should it remained tied after that, penalty kicks will decide the winner.</p>



<p>Offside rules have been tweaked to be more similar to that of hockey, with a new dotted offside line.  A player can behind a defender and be considered onside if they aren’t in the attacking zone. Once in the zone, standard offside rules then apply.</p>



<p>Other Rush details include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Four cameras to choose from</li>



<li>Free kicks are always indirect</li>



<li>Two-player social celebrations</li>



<li>Tactical requests for positioning and playcalling</li>



<li>Corner Kicks and Throw-Ins done by the person closest to the ball when it goes out of bounds</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s even more to learn about the new game mode. You can read everything about Rush via the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/news/pitch-notes-fc-25-rush-deep-dive?utm_campaign=fc25_hd_ww_ic_soco_yt_fc-25-rush-deep-dive-pn-yt&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=80994&amp;ts=1722268661043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official EA FC 25 website</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill is the first player to be welcomed into Club 99 by Madden NFL 25. The honor means Hill has a 99 overall rating in the upcoming football game.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/EAMaddenNFL/status/1817906238958469479" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X/Twitter</a>, the official Madden NFL account shared a video of Hill receiving his Club 99 gifts and honor. Also known as "Cheetah," the wide receiver was surprised with a suitcase bearing gifts as well as a video message from former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning. "This is absolutely the greatest, or the second-greatest day of my life--well, actually the third greatest," Hill said.</p><p dir="ltr">It also means Hill is the top wide receiver for Madden NFL 25, after being listed as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-24-player-ratings-99-club-and-best-players-by-position/1100-6515843/" data-ref-id="1100-6515843">the second-best option at the launch of Madden NFL 24</a>. However, he was bumped to a 99 overall in last year's game as the season progressed and became the first Dolphins player ever to achieve that rating.</p><p dir="ltr">In college, Hill pled guilty to domestic violence against his pregnant girlfriend. Last year, there was a different assault charge that was eventually settled, with the NFL ultimately taking no action. </p><p dir="ltr">Last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-25-gameplay-deep-dive-shows-off-new-physics-and-here-comes-the-boom/1100-6525245/" data-ref-id="1100-6525245">Madden NFL 25 showed off a redesigned tackling system as part of a deep dive gameplay trailer</a>. The Hit Stick is also getting updated with this year's game, which will be the 20th anniversary of the feature's inclusion in the football franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">EA will undoubtedly unveil more of the Club 99 members (Patrick Mahomes is a given, for instance) for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-25-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6524523/" data-ref-id="1100-6524523">Madden NFL 25 as we get closer and closer to the game's release date</a> on August 16.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> House Of The Dragon Star Abubakar Salim Was ADDICTED To WoW</p>
      </div>
<p>According to Salim, Kingdom Hearts' "earnestness" and focus on sincere friendship has been a powerful force in his life. He told host Lucy James that the game has influenced not only his work, but "everything [he does.]"</p><p>"Honestly this had such an impact on me," Salim said. "It's so influential. It's so emotional... Darkness comes and takes them away and he just wants his friends back. It was really really magical and it will always stay with me. I think it will always influence any the work I do--everything I do. There's just an earnestness to it. An honestly to it. An authenticity."</p><p>He also opened up about his love of World of Warcraft, creating his own game studio, how he finds time to game as a new parent, and how his favorite game of all time, Golden Sun, desperately needs the remake treatment--and for the record, we agree.</p><p>Salim is the latest star to join GameSpot for its newest show, Star Players. The biweekly program offers a "deep dive into the personal gaming journey of celebrities, musicians, television and movie stars," and has featured Jackass' Steve-O, Lord of the Rings' Dominic Monaghan, Archer's Aisha Tyler, and RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars winner Monét X Change.</p>

		<p>Sony are ramping up the marketing for the cute as buttons <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astro-bot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Bot </a>with the announcement of a custom PS5 DualSense controller.</p>
<p><iframe title="Astro Bot DualSense Controller Reveal | PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GaElJ75QQJQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p>Starting Friday, August 9 at 7am PT in the U.S. and 10am local time in the U.K., France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Austria, and Portugal, players will be able to pre-order the DualSense wireless controller – Astro Bot Limited Edition through direct.playstation.com, as well as from select retailers. Pre-orders will also be available through select retailers in other global markets on the same day.

<p>Videos of the game from the Chinajoy event are also appearing online, sadly the sound isn’t great but check them out.<br>

<p>More than 50 worlds will feature in Astro Bot, and just as with Astro’s Playroom – the game bundled with every PS5 – there will be plenty of gameplay variety. We saw flying sequences, sponge abilities, space battles, punching and grappling and more, in addition to returning abilities from Playroom.</p>
<p>There’s also plenty of new PlayStation game references, such as Journey, Parappa the Rapper, Kratos and others.</p>

<p>It looks like a lot of fun, and we can’t wait.</p>
<p>Astro’s Playroom was a simple bundle of joy for pretty much every PS5 owner. “Astro cements himself as the PlayStation 5’s mascot,” I said in 2020, “with a celebration of all things PlayStation that also showcases the full potential of the immersive new DualSense controller. Astro’s Playroom is the first thing you should play on PlayStation 5.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-new-publisher<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Skydance Games has announced a publishing partnership with Plaion Games for upcoming superhero action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em>.</p>
<p>The agreement will see the two studios teaming up to publish&nbsp;<em>Rise of Hydra&nbsp;</em>around the world <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-led-by-amy-hennig-revealed-with-amazing-visuals-and-2025">next year</a>, in what Skydance co-president Julian Beak describes as a "multiplatform, worldwide release".</p>
<p>Beak describes&nbsp;<em>Rise of Hydra</em>, which is Skydance's first game, as "an original Marvel story directed by Amy Hennig", calling Plaion the "perfect publishing partner" to team up with Skydance and realize its "ambitious vision" for the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-nanali.jpeg?itok=pVDcV9vj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-nanali.jpeg?itok=9JkTxvUU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra&nbsp;</em>has itself a new publisher.</figcaption></figure><p>For his part, Plaion CEO&nbsp;Klemens Kundratitz calls the team-up a "partnership between two ambitious independent companies", describing&nbsp;<em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra&nbsp;</em>"one of the most anticipated AAA games currently in development". It's hard to disagree with him on that one.</p>
<p>Marvel Games head Haluk Mentes describes&nbsp;<em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra&nbsp;</em>as "exquisite and bold take on some of our most beloved and timeless characters" and suggests that the partnership between Plaion and Skydance will help the studios to realize the "massive promise" the game has.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</em>, it's an action-adventure game that features a number of Marvel heroes with whom you might be familiar, as well as a couple of fresher faces.</p>

<p><em>Rise of Hydra&nbsp;</em>tells the story of Captain America, the Black Panther Azzuri, the Howling Commandos' Gabriel Jones, and Wakandan spy Nanali, who's embedded in Nazi-occupied Paris.</p>
<p>We don't know too much about the game in terms of gameplay just yet, but given that development is being led by&nbsp;<em>Uncharted&nbsp;</em>lead Amy Hennig, you can likely expect a similar mixture of cinematic action and cutscene-led storytelling.</p>
<p>This is just one of the games on Skydance's slate; the company is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-star-wars-game-coming-from-skydance-new-media">working on a game set in the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>universe</a>, as well as the VR adventure&nbsp;<em>Skydance's Behemoth</em>, which is set to launch in fall. You can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skydances-behemoth-preview">check out our preview of that game</a> if you want to know what else Skydance is up to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/29/24208757/dinosaur-polo-club-canceled-game-magic-school<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Canceled video games are typically shrouded in secrecy, the kind of thing we only learn about via leaks well after the fact. But Dinosaur Polo Club, the indie studio behind the minimalist strategy games <em>Mini Metro</em> and <em>Mini Motorways</em>, has revealed a recently canceled project in a refreshing bout of transparency.</p><p>The game was codenamed <em>Magic School</em>, and it was an attempt for the studio to branch out from the clean, streamlined experiences it has become known for. The problem? As the concept grew in scope, it became clear to the studio that a much bigger team would be needed, which led them to abandon it.</p><p>You can get a sense of what it would’ve been like in the footage above as well as from the concept images in the gallery below. (There’s even more <a href="https://www.artstation.com/dinopoloclub">over on ArtStation</a>.)</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->7</p><p><cite>Image: Dinosaur Polo Club</cite></p></div><p>“Ultimately, we simply did not see a path forward for <em>Magic School</em>,”<em> </em>studio CEO Amie Wolken said in a statement. “However, we still wanted to share the amazing work the team had produced over the course of prototyping.”</p><p>One silver lining: none of the team members working on the game are being let go. Instead, the studio says that the plan is “to redirect their skills to the new projects within their celebrated <em>Mini</em> series.”</p><p>While it may be disappointing that <em>Magic School</em> won’t ever launch — it sure sounds cool to me — it’s wonderful to see a studio be so open in such a tight-lipped industry. And for those who worked on the game, it’s a big bonus to be able to actually share the work they did on it, even if there’s no final product for people to play.</p><p>“So much great game development never sees the light of day because studios are often shy about sharing when things don’t go as planned,” added Wolken. “Instead, we are choosing to celebrate what we learned along the way and the incredible work from our team.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The TL:DR version? Almost everyone hated it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company sought to explore how SBMM impacts players in a variety of ways, which led to it running a 'Deprioritize Skill Test' in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> earlier this year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The experiment saw the studio leverage its A/B test framework to loosen constraints on skill in matchmaking. It ran the 2024 test in North America and established a treatment group comprising 50 percent of the population. The other half of players were left unaffected.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Returning player rates went down when skill-based matchmaking was loosened">Returning player rates went down when skill-based matchmaking was loosened</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those who unknowingly experienced a reduction in SBMM weren't happy. After a month of running the test, Activision categorized the treatment population into 10 equally sized groups—sorted by skill. With SBMM deprioritized, returning player rates were down significantly for 90 percent of players. Only the 10 percent most skilled players came back in increased numbers, but on an aggregate level Activision Blizzard saw "meaningfully fewer players coming back to the game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This effect may appear small, but this change was observable within the duration of the test. This will compound over time, just like interest, and will have a meaningful impact on our player population. This is a concern for all players, including the top 10 percent, as if this pattern is allowed to continue, players will exit the game in increased numbers," explained the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Eventually a top 10 percent player will become a top 20 percent player, and eventually a top 30 percent player, until only the very best players remain playing the game. Those original top players will become increasingly likely to not return to the game. Ultimately, this will result in a worse experience for all players, as there will be fewer and fewer players available to play with. Also, as noted above, this test only deprioritized skill in the matching rules. If it were completely removed we would expect to see the player population erode rapidly in the span of a few months."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players impacted by the Deprioritized Skill Test were also more likely to jump ship mid-game, with Activision Blizzard explaining the quit rate "significantly" increased across 80 percent of players. Only the top 10 percent of players saw a meaningful decrease in quit rates, but Activision Blizzard noted that upside would be fleeting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As the accelerated departure of players in the lower skill brackets takes hold, top 10 percent players will eventually drift down the skill distribution (as originally top 10 percent players will make up a larger and larger portion of the player base)," it said. "As a result, we expect to see once top 10 percent players quit games at increasing rates as they become a 50th percentile player after much of the lower skill population has left the game."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Team Death match saw more blowouts">Team Death match saw more blowouts</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The number of 'Blowouts' in Team Death Match (TDM) also increased. Activision Blizzard explained a blowout is when a team in a lobby "wins with a score delta greater than 30," meaning they have absolutely battered the opposition. It said the number of blowouts increased for all Deprioritized Skill Test players in TDM lobbies, which means everyone was likely having less fun. "We see similar results in other game modes," it added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tracking other metrics such as Kills Per Minute (KPM) and Score Per Minute (SPM) across lobbies impacted by the experiment showed that lower skilled players generally performed worse across the board, while the top 10 percent were able to "dominate."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Kills Per Minute is down significantly for the bottom 20-30 percent of players. The next 60 percent of players have no significant change, and the top 10 percent see significantly higher KPM," stated Activision Blizzard. "Like KPM, SPM follows a similar trend. The low-skill players perform worse, while the top 10 percent can dominate. As with KPM, we expect to see players shift to the left on this distribution over time, as low-skill players return to the game at lower rates.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The use of killstreaks and increased KPM and SPM shows that the wider lobby skill percentile disparity is disproportionality leveraged by the top 10 percent of players. Unfortunately, this increased performance comes at the cost of much greater impact to the much larger 30 percent of the population toward the bottom of the skill distribution."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Weighing in more broadly, Activision Blizzard said its latest test and historical experiments shows a clear link between SBMM and player retention.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can see that loosening skill negatively impacts our ability to keep players interested in our game," it said. "In a test similar to the Deprioritized Skill Test discussed above, we were able to see a significant decrease in the number of players playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (2019) and an increase in the overall match quit rate, when treated with a looser skill matching. Subsequent attempts to protect only the bottom 25 percent of players and allow for looser matchmaking for the remaining 75 percent of players also had clear negative indicators of self-reported 'fun.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/CallofDuty_Matchmaking_Series_2.pdf">You can read the full white paper on the Activision Blizzard website</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>Grasshopper Manufacture is set to run its second annual showcase later this week on 31st July.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grasshopper-direct-gave-us-the-briefest-of-peeks-at-suda51s-next-game">Just like last year's presentation</a>, Grasshopper Direct 2024 will hopefully give us a glimpse of what's next from renowned game maker Suda51, whose prior work includes Killer7, the No More Heroes series, Lollipop Chainsaw, and Shadows of the Damned.</p>

<p>As yet there's been no hints at what's to come, but the team says it's currently "working our asses off" to ensure this year's direct goes off without a hitch. Last year's direct aired a good hour or so after the planned window, which is probably why Grasshopper hasn't yet shared a time for the presentation.</p>
<p>"We're currently working our asses off on getting it ready *ON TIME* this time, and we don't want to screw this one up so stay tuned for further updates on the exact time!" the team said via a post to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.</p> <div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/psvr-2-headset-gets-200-price-cut/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/psvr-2-headset-gets-200-price-cut/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PSVR 2 headset was released in 2023, but compared to other VR headsets, it hasn't had as many purchases as other headsets. Additionally, the PSVR 2 headset was recently made compatible with PC, requiring owners to purchase an adapter that will connect the headset to the PC, costing $60 in addition to the already very pricey headset.</p>
<p>However, across all major retailers, the PSVR 2 has received a huge discount, going from $549.99 to $349.99, making it a lot more reasonable of a purchase for some consumers. As a result of this discount, it is now more cost-effective to purchase the PSVR 2 than it is to purchase the Meta Quest headset, which is significantly more popular, despite the prices starting at $449.99.</p>
<p>Sony is currently trying to shift as much PSVR 2 stock as possible, as it didn't sell very well upon release compared to other VR headsets. For those considering getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/psvr2-hardware-authentication-has-been-cracked-on-pc/">this headset for PC</a>, the adapter will not be available until August 2024, meaning your headset might start collecting dust if you don't own a PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Consumers had a lot of negative reviews for this headset on release, and especially after the first year. Not only was there a significant lack of games available to use the headset with but there was no backward compatibility. Despite the lack of games available, the piece of hardware itself received positive reviews, especially for how crisp and clean the graphics were and the brightness and contrast of the colors through the lenses.</p>
<p>If you're interested in snagging the PSVR 2 headset, it will be available until August 6, before the discount disappears. In addition, there is the option to purchase the PSVR 2 headset in a bundle with Horizon: Call of the Mountain if you want to pick up a game alongside the headset. The bundle will cost $399.99.</p>
<p>In June 2024, Sony decided to cut all future funding and development time for the PSVR 2, meaning this headset will no longer have ongoing support for future games. As it stands, there are still plenty of games that the PSVR 2 headset is compatible with. In addition, it's unlikely that you'll be able to get any technical support for the PSVR 2, with any and all support being cut by Sony.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-no-longer-cares-about-the-psvr-2-and-you-shouldnt-either" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report with Android Central</a>, sources have said that Sony is making "deep cuts to funding for VR games" and that there will be "very few opportunities for VR game development going forward."</p>
<p>At the moment, it seems uncertain how much support consumers will get with the release of the PSVR 2 adapter for PC, whether players can contact Sony regarding their purchase, or whether future games will even be compatible with the device.</p>

It was so good that Warner Bros. decided to make an entire TV series featuring Oz Cobb’s rise to power as drug wars rip Gotham apart.

That chapter will kick off with Robert Downey Jr. returning, but as Dr. Doom this time around instead of Iron Man. It’s unclear if Tony Stark is back and hatching some secret plan or this is an alternate-universe version of one or both characters, since Stark died at the end of <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>.</p><p><em>Doomsday</em>, which is essentially<em> Avengers 5</em>, is planned for 2026, followed by <em>Secret Wars </em>as early as 2027. The <em>Fantastic Four</em>, who have their own movie coming up, will also be featured in both. RDJ jumpstarted the most lucrative franchise in Hollywood history. We’ll see if he can bring it back to life after a series of misfires and duds, or if comic book superhero fatigue is terminal.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Hopes of Doom joining the cinematic universe grew with the announcement of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-mcu-1851256106&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-mcu-1851256106">F<em>antastic Four</em> movie</a></span> back in 2019 (that we know now is titled <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>). While we don’t know if RDJ will make his debut as Doom in that movie (though it wouldn’t be surprising), we do know that he’ll be in future movies, like the <em>Avengers Doomsday</em>, set to release in May 2026.it looks like RDJ’s Doom will be that flick’s main villain. </p><p>The return of RDJ and the long-awaited debut of one of Marvel’s greatest baddies is an incredibly exciting announcement and it’s garnered praise from some fans. Just listen to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/marvelstudios/status/1817385874554077285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/marvelstudios/status/1817385874554077285" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crowd erupt</a></span> in cheers when RDJ takes off the mask during the panel. For some, the wild casting may be just wild enough to work. Some believe that ever since RDJ left the MCU following 2019’s <em>Avengers Endgame</em>, the franchise has struggled to find an actor with as much star power who can draw audiences to theaters with their name alone. Bringing him back is a solid tactic to win back lapsed fans, and fresh off an Oscar win for <em>Oppenheimer</em>, we know RDJ can bring a powerhouse performance worthy of Doom — though his long tenure as Iron Man was already enough to prove that. Though the lack of RDJ isn’t the only reason the MCU may be struggling of late.</p><p>As with anything Marvel related, there are also <em>a lot</em> of people, including myself, who feel this casting choice makes no sense and speaks to how desperate Marvel is right now. After the Avengers defeated Thanos in <em>Endgame</em>, the franchise has been in desperate need of a new overarching villain to face off against, which was supposed to be Kang the Conqueror, played by Jonathan Majors. That plan went up in flames after Majors was arrested, and later <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.npr.org/2024/04/08/1243372706/jonathan-majors-domestic-violence&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/08/1243372706/jonathan-majors-domestic-violence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">convicted</a></span>, on domestic violence charges, after which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2023/12/jonathan-majors-marvel-fired-guilty-verdict-1235671790/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2023/12/jonathan-majors-marvel-fired-guilty-verdict-1235671790/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disney fired him</a></span>. And with middling responses to the recent film and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-marvel-tv-shows-disney-netflix-mcu-1851173236&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-marvel-tv-shows-disney-netflix-mcu-1851173236">television projects</a></span> that have followed <em>Avengers Endgame</em>, Marvel is in urgent need of a big win. What better way to do that then bring back everyone’s favorite MCU star?</p><p>There are even more layers to why RDJ’s casting as Doom feels like a wasted opportunity. We already gave RDJ two decades of incredible films across the MCU. Iron Man was the heart of the Infinity Saga, which spanned from 2008 to 2019, and it sent him out on a perfect note. Bringing RDJ back feels like a move made solely out of desperation on the part of Marvel. </p><p>Doom is one of the most beloved villains in Marvel’s repertoire and many believe he’s been reduced to a victim of stunt casting. There are so many actors out there who haven’t starred in the MCU that could have made an incredible impact on the franchise. Bringing in Doom as a last-minute replacement for Kang could potentially rob the character of a more thought out story arc like we saw with Thanos. Doom has never appeared in an MCU project and at the earliest he will first appear in 2025’s <em>Fantastic Four</em>. With <em>Avengers Doomsday </em>releasing in 2026 and <em>Avengers Secret Wars</em> (which will likely adapt the Doom-centric 2015 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Wars_(2015_comic_book)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Wars_(2015_comic_book)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comic arc</a></span>) releasing one year after that, it all feels rushed. Whether it’s the right or wrong decision, it puts the future of the MCU squarely back on RDJ’s shoulders. All this to say, a lot of people aren’t happy with the SDCC announcement. Though, as always, only time will tell how Marvel’s gamble will work out. </p><p>Whether you like or hate the casting news one thing remains constant: jokes. Yes fans are taking the RDJ as Doom announcement to make as many memes as they can. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
