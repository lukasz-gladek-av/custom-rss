		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/06/the-division-heartland-announced-standalone-free-to-play-game-coming-out-in-2021-22/">The Division Heartland</a> has been cancelled by Ubisoft, with the publisher confirming the news in a statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">IGN</a>. The major reason for the cancellation is that Ubisoft will be redeploying its resources to focus on other projects like xDefiant and Rainbow Six. The team at Red Storm Entertainment, the developers of The Division Heartland, will be redeployed to the other projects.</p>

<p>In the statement, Ubisoft said, <em>“After careful consideration, we have made the tough call to halt development on Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland, effective immediately. Our priority now is to support the talented team members at our Red Storm Entertainment studio, who will be transitioning to new projects within our company, including XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”</em></p>
<p>The Division Heartland was announced in May 2021 and was targeting a 2021 or 2022 release. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/11/the-division-heartland-closed-test/">Closed beta test sign ups were opened in September 2022,</a> but impressions were that Ubisoft’s free to play game still needed work and tweaking before it would be ready for release. Ubisoft has decided the time and cost to do that just would not be worth the return on the investment, it seems.</p>

<p>The Division: Heartland was going to take players outside of the cities of New York and Washington DC, to the small town of Silver Creek instead. The description said, <em>“This standalone free-to-play The Division game introduces new playable characters in a rural setting, far from the events in New York and Washington D.C. Silver Creek was once a pleasant town in the American Midwest, but it was left in ruins following the spread of the Dollar Flu. Players will take on the role of loyal Division agents from across the nation responding to a call for help. Fighting alongside and against other trained agents, players will explore the secrets of Silver Creek and provide hope to what remains of small-town America.”</em></p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has cancelled its upcoming free-to-play shooter The Division Heartland, as it moves to refocus its resources on "bigger opportunities".
</p>
<p>
The Division Heartland <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-the-division-free-to-play-spin-off-heartland">was announced for PC and consoles</a> back in May 2021, when it was original set to launch within a vague "2021-22" release window. Since then, it's resurfaced intermittently, and an open beta last summer - followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-heartland-has-been-rated-in-taiwan-hinting-that-a-release-could-be-imminent">Taiwanese ratings board sighting</a> - seemed to suggest a launch was finally drawing near.
</p>
<p>
However, three years after Heartland's unveiling, Ubisoft has now officially called time on the project. "After careful consideration, we have made the tough call to halt development on Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland, effective immediately," the publisher wrote in a statement announcing the news (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">IGN</a>).

<p>
"Our priority now is to support the talented team members at our Red Storm Entertainment studio," it continued, "who will be transitioning to new projects within our company, including XDefiant and Rainbow Six." In a note in its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/AwOkNohhzmR1qBmQ4Nj4h/096beaa470c05f39f77417742e4d25b8/Ubisoft_FY24_Earnings_PR_English_final.pdf">2023-2024 earnings report</a> released today, Ubisoft offered a little context for the cancellation, calling XDefiant and Rainbow Six "bigger opportunities" for the company.
</p>
<p>
The decision to halt development on Heartland is just the latest in a long line of recent cancellations at Ubisoft. Last July it was confirmed an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortals-fenyx-rising-not-so-immortal-as-ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-sequel">Immortals Fenyx Rising sequel had been canned</a>, after the publisher's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-project-q-cancelled">mysterious PvP battle arena game Project Q</a>, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-again">three unannounced games</a>, all got the chop. Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-vr-and-ghost-recon-frontline-cancelled">cancelled</a> Splinter Cell VR, Ghost Recon Frontline, and two other unannounced titles a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
Those cancellations - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-montreal-latest-studio-struck-by-layoffs">subsequent layoffs</a> - came amid <a href="https://staticctf.akamaized.net/8aefmxkxpxwl/3nCTlhd4Dke8pe308etZ6e/b11d0bfe9c5094f0eecd44541c6ba0b8/Ubisoft_update_January_23_English_Final.pdf">disappointing financial results</a> for Ubisoft, with the publisher last year admitting it was facing "major challenges as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and long-lasting titles".

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-the-latest-aaa-free-to-play-game-casualty.872217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157512/tom-clancys-division-heartland-canceled-ubisoft<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="s5fGkJ">Ubisoft has ended development of <em>The Division Heartland</em>, the free-to-play game set in the universe of Tom Clancy’s The Division, the company announced Wednesday. The game was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22423089/ubisoft-announces-new-free-to-play-game-the-division-heartland">announced in 2021</a>. The publisher said it will divert resources elsewhere, specifically to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23680459/xdefiant-preview-release-date-tom-clancy-ubisoft"><em>XDefiant</em></a> and the Rainbow Six franchise.</p>
<p id="qcEr7D"><em>The Division Heartland</em> was set in the wake of a devastating pandemic that ravaged the fictional flyover town of Silver Creek. In the multiplayer game, developed by Red Storm Entertainment, players would have to cope with an ever-changing contamination, new survival obligations, and a deadly nighttime cycle in the free-to-play spinoff of The Division franchise. Ubisoft made a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23690197/ubisoft-the-division-day-heartland-mobile-resurgence-tom-clancy">big showing of <em>Heartland</em> at its Division Day event</a> last year, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23346149/the-division-heartland-test-registration-closed-alpha-sign-up">conducted closed playtests</a> of the game. But it appears that the publisher is following the direction of many other publishers who are canceling in-development projects or giving up on free-to-play live-service games.</p>
<p id="5r6mLd">In recent months, multiple AAA publishers and studios have canceled their in-development live-service games. That includes the long-in-development <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24002161/the-last-of-us-online-canceled-naughty-dog-tlou2-multiplayer"><em>The Last of Us Online</em> at Naughty Dog</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24050326/blizzard-survival-game-canceled-allen-adham-mike-ybarra">Blizzard Entertainment’s untitled fantasy survival game</a>. And just last week, Microsoft ended further development on <em>Redfall</em> inline with the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151045/microsoft-xbox-studio-closures-tango-gameworks-arkane-austin-redfall">closure of Arkane Austin</a>.</p>
<p id="ErNWmj">Still, <em>The Division Heartland</em>’s cancellation stands out, considering the publisher’s commitment to troubled projects like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24071025/skull-and-bones-open-beta-impressions-combat-quests"><em>Skull and Bones</em></a> — which had a decade-long development cycle — and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23736045/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-reboot"><em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</em> remake</a>. But diverting more resources to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22583452/ubisoft-tom-clancy-xdefiance-trailer-announcement-release-date"><em>XDefiant</em></a> may be just what that delayed, substantially reworked Tom Clancy game needs.</p>
<p id="VIwGzl">Ubisoft has two other announced The Division projects in the works: <em>The Division Resurgence</em>, a free-to-play multiplayer third-person shooter mobile game, and <em>The Division 3</em>, which Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/3QaNOAmSlbUJw2XbwsUk9x/3b4f38c22c0eafdffe10d14ae50a31a4/JG_Appointed_Executive_Producer_for_The_Division_Brand_FINAL.pdf">confirmed</a> was in the works last September.</p>
<p id="iJVLBQ"><em>The Division Heartland</em> is one of many cancellations Ubisoft has confirmed in recent years. In 2023, the company canceled three unannounced titles alongside <em>Immortals Fenyx Rising 2</em>. The year prior, it slashed four in-development projects that weren’t publicly announced.</p>
<p id="HeHQxL">Ubisoft’s lineup for the next year now includes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156633/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-release-date-codename-red"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> (officially revealed earlier today), <em>Rainbow Six Mobile</em>, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>The Division Resurgence</em>, and <em>XDefiant</em>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-helltide-works-in-diablo-4-season-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-helltide-works-in-diablo-4-season-4.872214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-helltide-works-in-diablo-4-season-4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>One of the most significant and exciting changes made in Diablo 4 Season 4 is the ability for anyone, even a low-level player, to join a Helltide. You must, of course, complete the campaign beforehand. But once that requirement is out of the way, you can harm the demons of hell without faltering. Here is how Helltides work in Diablo 4 Season 4!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-the-helltide-event-works-in-diablo-4-season-4">How the Helltide Event Works in Diablo 4 Season 4</h2>



<p>As mentioned, you must complete the game’s story mode before delving into the Helltide event in Diablo 4 Season 4. If you have previously completed the campaign and create a seasonal character, you’ll have a chance to endure the chaos of Helltides from the get-go. That’s right; you can join a Helltide from World Tier 1 if you want to farm experience points and level quickly this season. It’s no longer locked behind World Tier 4, as previously.</p>



<p>To participate in the actual event mechanics, wander the zone and clear the various objectives, like demonic structures and ritual sites. Eventually, you’ll collect enough <strong>Aberrant Cinders</strong> to unlock <strong>Tortured Gifts</strong>, the chests scattered throughout the Helltide.</p>



<p>Aberrant Cinders are a Helltide-specific currency only usable within the event zone to unlock the aforementioned Tortured Gifts chests. If you die in a Helltide, you lose half of your Aberrant Cinders. Once the event concludes, you’ll lose all of your acquired Cinders in your inventory. It’s best to use them on a chest before the timer runs out.</p>



<p>You should know that a <strong>Helltide lasts for 55 minutes and then enters a cooldown period of five minutes before infecting a new zone on the hour</strong>.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you slay monsters and unlock chests, you’ll acquire Helltide Threat, which you’ll note is in the top-right corner of your HUD next to the map and below your Aberrant Cinders counter. The higher your threat level, the more enemies will spawn around you and attack. Eventually, you’ll deal with a Hellborn—a challenging boss-type enemy surrounded by low-level mobs—that drops a <strong>Baneful Heart</strong>. Once you have three Baneful Hearts, you can summon the <strong>Blood Maiden</strong>.</p>



<p>Trust me when I say you want to farm Baneful Hearts to defeat the Blood Maiden, as she’ll drop some of the best loot in Helltides and Exquisite Blood!</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-helltide">Where to Find Helltide</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you open up your map and scan Sanctuary, <strong>you’ll note one region covered in a red hue with brilliant red icons dotting the landscape. This is the Helltide area</strong>, similar to the vampiric Blood Harvest event from Season 2. </p>



<p>Once you enter the zone, you’ll encounter hordes of demons, blood raining from the sky, and the occasional demonic worm emerging from the ground to spew a bloody mess and a handful of enemies on your position.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-join-a-helltide-event">How to Join a Helltide Event</h2>



<p>To join a Helltide, wait for the zone to appear on the map, then <strong>walk, ride, or teleport to the area. Once you enter, you’re part of the event.</strong> You can tackle most of the objectives solo, especially at World Tier 1 or 2 difficulty. Still, it’s faster to farm enemies and events with a group—even one additional player helps!</p>

<p>How much time will you spend farming Helltide in Diablo 4? While you wait for the next spawn, Insider Gaming has a few hot articles for you to check out:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Best Trick-Taking Games (2024)]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trick-taking-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-trick-taking-games-2024.872211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trick-taking-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Trick-taking, where a hand of cards progresses by one player leading a suit and others following, matching that suit if they can, is so old that its origins are lost. The earliest one we have records for in Europe is called Karnöffel, and it dates from 15th century Germany, but playing cards generally are far older and were developed in the far east. Such is the popularity of this mechanism that it’s still with us, and has blossomed into thousands of different forms, many of which you can enjoy with a standard deck of playing cards.</p><p>Needless to say, such a popular method of play has also made its way into any number of more modern, more specialized and more strategically rich games, and it’s those we’ll be focusing on to pick out the best. Designers have been able to adapt it into myriad forms, across competitive and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> play, and by marrying it with other mechanics to create longer games. But the real trick of trick-taking is that it’s so familiar that almost anyone can pick up and play these games with ease.</p><h2>Wizard</h2><div id="200655"><p><h3>Wizard Card Game</h3></p></div><p>Trick-taking is an old concept that dates back to playing card games, so it makes sense to start with this relatively old game that mostly uses a deck of standard playing cards. The magic comes from eight extra cards, four wizards and four jesters. The first wizard played always wins a trick, while jesters are the lowest value and are beaten by all other cards. While that not sound much like sorcery, Wizard also uses another common feature of trick-taking games: before each round you must bid the number of tricks you think you’ll win, and must match that number to score. The wizard and jester combo make this notoriously hard to predict, but also leaves you with the strategic flexibility to play defensively or offensively in attempts to shore up your score, or push for a sudden, thrilling win.</p><h2>Skull King</h2><div id="200656"><p><h3>Skull King Card Game</h3></p></div><p>Pirate-themed Skull King is the captain of the bidding game ship. There are three normal suits alongside a trump suit and, as usual, the highest card wins a trick. You start each hand looking at your cards and predicting how many tricks you’re going to win, scoring points if you hit the target but losing them otherwise, ensuring each hand comes down to a thrilling climax. But the deck is full of special cards to give the game some serious spice: pirates always win a trick, escape cards always lose and the terrible skull king himself lords it over everything, gaining a bonus if he scoops up any pirates. They’re easy enough concepts to learn, but fill the game with more than enough variety to ensure there’s lots of skill in making your bids.</p><h2>Sail</h2><div id="198567"><p><h3>Sail</h3></p></div><p>Staying with the nautical theme, Sail sees two of you working together to steer a ship across a course of islands while being chased by a ferocious kraken. It’s notoriously hard for trick-taking games to work as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player games</a>, but Sail’s ingenious ruleset not only manages it, but ensures a white-knuckle ride on every game. Each card has not only a suite and a value but also a symbol, and the pairing of symbols determines what your ship does that round, whether that’s moving, firing on the kraken or taking a smash from one of the thing’s tentacles. The round ends when one player wins five tricks, meaning you’ve got to balance the load while still taking the right action pairings, a task made doubly difficult by a ban on communication. Every attempt is an edge-of-the-seat challenge across six scenarios.</p><h2>The Crew: Mission Deep Sea</h2><div id="157130"><p><h3>The Crew: Mission Deep Sea</h3></p></div><p>If you want a cooperative trick-taker for more than two (this one ended up on our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">best four-player board games</a> as well), then it’s time to venture into the depths of the ocean as you attempt to keep your team alive in The Crew. The game plays through a long sequence of narrative scenarios of increasing difficulty, giving you more and more tasks to complete from a random and imaginatively varied selection. The basic formula is that a given player has to win a trick containing a particular card, but the concept blossoms into all kinds of demanding challenges, for example winning or not winning particular suits or numbers of tricks. This would be easy if you could share what’s in your hand, but that’s not allowed: you can only offer elusive hints. Success is thus a matter of tracking plays and trying to engineer situations where you can complete your assigned tasks. It’s harder than it sounds, highly addictive, and its cooperative nature makes it superb for family play.</p><h2>Brian Boru: High King of Ireland</h2><div id="154466"><p><h3>Brian Boru: High King of Ireland</h3></p></div><p>Most of the games on this list are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">fast-playing games</a>, but Brian Boru is a rare instance of a much deeper strategy affair that uses trick-taking. Players are competing to become the next King of medieval Ireland by controlling towns on the map, but control of any given town is decided by playing cards from your hand, which you’ll have picked via drafting at the game start. As usual the highest card value wins, from the suit matching that of the town you’re vying over, but there are some cool wrinkles. First, there’s a wild white suit that matches any color. Second, the lower value the card, the better rewards you get whether you win the trick or lose. This spatial control element married to those cunning inverse rewards give this a unique and engrossing strategic feel, while trick-winning is full of tension.</p><h2>Cat in the Box</h2><div id="200657"><p><h3>Cat in the Box Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Bidding games don’t come much more bizarre than this beauty, inspired by Schrödinger’s famous feline thought experiment. On the face of it, it’s a normal trick-taking game where you follow a color suit, one color is a trump, and the highest-value card wins. The twist is that the cards are not colored: you decide what color a card is as you play it. That pairing is then crossed off a grid because, after all, you can’t have two cards of the same color and value, right? You can even decide, at any point, that your hand is completely out of a particular color, allowing you to sneak in a trump, but you’ll never be able to play that color again! This can lead to paradoxes where you’re left with unplayable cards, and you lose points. But win or lose, the sheer, head-spinning innovation of this game will take your breath away.</p><h2>Ghosts of Christmas</h2><div id="200658"><p><h3>Ghosts of Christmas Board Game </h3></p></div><p>Another cleverly peculiar bidding game, this time inspired by Dickens’ famous Yuletide yarn "A Christmas Carol," Ghosts of Christmas lets you hedge your bets and bid numbers for tricks you think you might win, for a points penalty. But that isn’t its secret sauce. Rather, this is a game where you play hands at once, represented by the multiple time periods of the titular ghosts: past, present and future. Once a given time has a card lead in it, it’s fixed to that for the rest of the hand, so everyone gets a chance to lead, and the unfolding play sees you juggling strategy across several hands from the same pool of cards. Even Scrooge himself might have trouble doing that kind of accounting, although the result is no humbug but a top class, challenging title.</p><h2>Jekyll vs Hyde</h2><div id="200659"><p><h3>Jekyll vs. Hyde</h3></p></div><p>Another trick-taker for two, even if you are representing personalities in the same body as per the classic tale of gothic horror, Jekyll vs. Hyde manages to bring some thematic class to the genre. Each suit represents a negative character trait and, unusually, they’re ranked in the order of which they get played each round and, if a player can’t follow suit, a higher-ranked card will beat a lower-ranked one, a deliciously devious strategic flair. You can also dump out potion cards, which have unexpected effects depending on the suit it's paired with, resetting the ranks, swapping cards or even stealing a trick from your opponent. But winning isn’t always the point: at the end of a hand, you work out the difference between the two tricks and Hyde advance that many spaces toward his transformation, and victory. If he can’t manage it within three hands, good wins and Jekyll keeps his self-control, but you’ll have a fun time either way.  </p><h2>Inside Job</h2><div id="200660"><p><h3>Inside Job</h3></p></div><p>Imagine a cooperative trick-taking game like The Crew, but with slightly simpler missions and a time limit. Might not sound terribly appealing, but there’s a big surprise waiting in each game of Inside Job: one of the players is a traitor, trying to sabotage the group’s spy missions. Each trick won earns the winner an intel token, and if the traitor gets enough of these, they win instantly. The rest of the agents win if they clear a threshold of successful missions in time. Should neither happen, it comes down to a vote, with the agents winning if they can successfully identify the insider, or losing if not. Blending the best of trick-taking and hidden role games in an easy to learn package, this is genre blending at its most fun.</p><h2>The Fox in the Forest</h2><div id="162172"><p><h3>The Fox in the Forest</h3></p></div><p>Our final specialist two-player pick, The Fox in the Forest is a standard, simple trick-taker with one glorious twist that makes it stand out: you get points for winning either very few or slightly above average tricks, rather than sweeping the board. This necessitates a complete rethink of how you approach the game, as you’re no longer leading to win every time. Instead, you’ve got to consider what your opponent might be holding and mix things up so that you can win the requisite number of tricks to net the big points. To further mix things up, all the odd-numbered cards have special powers like changing the trump suit or the win conditions for a given hand, ensuring this is a game where you always have to think on your feet as you field the constant curveballs that it throws you.</p><h2>Seas of Strife</h2><div id="200661"><p><h3>Seas of Strife</h3></p></div><p>As you’ve probably noticed, many trick-taking games take the basic formula and succeed by making a small twist - that’s how addictive the basic recipe is. Seas of Strife, which unusually has different numbers across all its suits, has two. Firstly, you win by losing: that is, collecting as few tricks as possible. Second, if you can’t follow suit and have to dump a card, that card’s suit not only becomes valid but can win the trick if it’s the most common suit played. This makes the obvious tactic of dumping high cards extremely dangerous, and ensures that every hand has the unexpected in store right until the final card is played. At the same time it’s super-easy to pick up, and great fun for all ages.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance board game and video game writer for IGN.

                <p>Ubisoft has revealed that XDefiant will not have skill-based matchmaking in its casual play mode. Instead, the game will have different matchmaking factors depending on each playlist. XDefiant is considered Ubisoft's answer to Call of Duty, and its development is being led by longtime CoD boss Mark Rubin. CoD famously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-your-call-of-duty-matchmaking-conspiracy-theory-isnt-true-activision-insists/1100-6520677/" data-ref-id="1100-6520677">uses SBMM</a>, much to the chagrin of some players, so this move by Ubisoft could win over some fans.</p><p>According to a new <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/xdefiant/news/73QFbfzYxQbbL4ua8DValH/matchmaking-in-xdefiant" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post from Ubisoft on its website</a>, Casual Play prioritizes fast connection times and will try to match latency and regions where possible. Ubisoft's reasoning for not implementing SBMM for Casual Play is that the matches will be a more fun and varied experience in the long-term. The development team states that having SBMM makes matches repetitive and stressful.</p><p>For those who do want a competitive experience, Ranked Play will be added in a future season. The mode is segmented by rank levels and will only matchmake players within a rank range.</p><p>When it comes to balancing teams, they are balanced based on players' skill rating. Casual Play doesn't use skill ratings to determine who gets into the game, but once everyone enters and the lobby is full, the teams will be balanced. Lobbies in Casual Play also persist between matches, so subsequent matches will often include the same players from the previous match. However, teams are still shuffled between them.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-call-of-duty-competitor-xdefiant-launches-on-may-21/1100-6523136/" data-ref-id="1100-6523136">XDefiant launches on May 21</a> for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S as a free-to-play game.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisofts-reports-record-bookings-for-2023.872202/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisofts-reports-record-bookings-for-2023<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Performance was driven by R6 Siege and AC, publisher reveals Assassin's Creed Shadows, set to launch in November</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Assassin's Creed maker Ubisoft has released its 2023 fiscal year report, which says its sales grew by 27% to hit €2.3 billion ($2.5 billion).</p>
<p>Here's what you need to know for the 12-month period that ended on March 31, 2024.</p>
<h3>The Numbers:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sales:</strong> €2.3 billion ($2.5 billion), an increase of 27% year-over-year</li>
<li><strong>Net bookings:</strong> €2.32 billion ($2.52 billion), an increase of 34% year-over-year</li>
<li><strong>Operating income:</strong> €313.6 million ($341 million), compared to a loss of €586 million ($638 million) profit the previous year.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Highlights:</h3>
<p>Ubisoft's year-end report was headlined by record annual and Q4 net bookings, with the company citing particularly strong performances from the Rainbow Six and Assassin's Creed franchises.</p>
<p>Digital revenue for the year hit €2 billion ($2.2 billion), an increase of 34% compared to last year.</p>
<p>During the 12 months, its back catalog generated €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) in revenue, a 49% year-on-year growth.</p>
<p>Ubisoft said its back catalog numbers were driven by a "stellar" performance from Rainbow Six Siege, which boasted "excellent results" in acquisition, activity, viewership, and monetization.</p>
<p>Additionally, its Assassin's Creed series performed well during Q4. This was attributed to the effect of the third quarter launch of Assassin's Creed Mirage and the inclusion of Assassin's Creed Valhalla on Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>The publisher said that its unique active users for PC/console grew by 4% year-over-year to 138 million.</p>
<p>Regarding Ubisoft's overall performance for the year, CEO Yves Guillemot said that the results "confirm that Ubisoft is back on track on its profitable growth trajectory."</p>
<p>"This year marked a pivotal first step in our turnaround, showcasing solid performance and the first benefits of our transformation toward a more balanced and recurring business model, one supported by multiple revenue streams," he said.</p>
<p>"The year also demonstrated the strength and value of our key assets, including our talented global teams, a diversified portfolio of high-quality franchises that drove our back-catalog revenues to all-time highs, passionate communities of fans across franchises, cutting-edge proprietary technologies, and a unique position in the gaming industry that enabled us to sign profitable partnerships."</p>
<p>The company noted that its strategy is now focused on two core verticals: open-world adventure and games as a service (GaaS)-native experiences.</p>
<p>Open-world adventure includes titles such as Far Cry and Assassin's Creed. Ubisoft categorizes games such as X-Defiant and The Division under the GaaS label.</p>
<p>As to why it chose those segments, the report said it was to "capitalize on our brands, secure strategic territories, and grow with multiplayer and mobile. Build and grow recurrence through social driven communities."</p>
<p>As part of its ongoing cost reduction plans, Ubisoft has halted the development of The Division Heartland and reallocated resources to XDefiant and Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>Additionally, as of March 31, 2024, Ubisoft's employee headcount is 19,011. The workforce figure represents a decrease of 1,700 staffers across 18 months, but Ubisoft added that employee retention has improved over that time.</p>
<p>"The cost reduction plan is well on track, with the FY 2023-24 fixed cost base standing at around €1.6 billion. This represents a year-on-year reduction of around €150 million, including a favorable foreign exchange impact," said the publisher.</p>

<h3>Looking ahead:</h3>
<p>Ubisoft projects that net bookings for Q1 of its 2025 fiscal year will hit approximately €275 million ($299 million), which would be up about 3% year-over-year.</p>
<p>It also noted the upcoming release of Star Wars Outlaws on August 30.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the newly announced Assassin's Creed Shadows, an action title set in feudal Japan, will be launch on November 15. It will star dual protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ubisoft will launch the "preseason" of free-to-play title XDefiant on May 21.</p>

			<p>Sony has announced the latest lineup of games coming to their <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS Plus Extra and Premium tiers</a> this May. The headliner is definitely Rockstar’s blockbuster Red Dead Redemption 2, but some other solid additions, including Deceive Inc. and Stranded: Alien Dawn are also on the way. Meanwhile, Premium subscribers have some deep cuts coming, including snowboarding game 2Xtreme and a Worms pinball game I’ve never heard of.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpsplus24.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Here are your <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/15/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-may-red-dead-redemption-2-deceive-inc-crime-boss-rockay-city-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS Plus Extra headliners for May</a>…</p>
<p><em><strong>Red Dead Redemption 2 </strong>(PS4)</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftech’s review – “Red Dead Redemption 2 may not be perfect, but its minor shortcomings are tiny blemishes on a stunningly beautiful face. In a way, they only serve as a reminder of how this world isn't made for perfection. Every single aspect of the game will put you into the very shoes of an outlaw roaming America with his gang as they try to escape the law long enough to make the money needed to disappear for good. It's an epic, memorable and engrossing tale which also elevates the open world genre to new heights with the brand new interaction system, a cast of unforgettable characters and a ton of high-quality content to play for a long time.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Deceive Inc.&nbsp; </strong>(PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>“Go undercover as the world’s greatest secret agents in this multiplayer game of social stealth and subterfuge. Disguise yourself as anyone to blend into the crowd, deploy high-tech gadgets to gain the upper hand, and extract the package before the competition takes it for themselves! No trick is too dirty when you work for Deceive Inc. Pick your play style with a roster of diverse agents, each with their own customizable weapon and skillset. From world-renowned burglars to up-and-coming espionage sensations, Deceive Inc. prides itself on being an equal-opportunity employer.”</em></p>
<p>Here are the other games available to PS Plus Extra subscribers this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Sims 4 City Living DLC </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Crime Boss: Rockay City </strong>(PS5)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The Settlers: New Allies </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Stranded: Alien Dawn </strong>(PS4, PS5)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Cat Quest </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Cat Quest II </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Watch Dogs </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, here are your PS Plus Premium Classics:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>2Xtreme </strong>(PS4, PS5)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>G-Police </strong>(PS4, PS5)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Worms Pinball </strong>(PS4, PS5)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Sony now offers three tiers of PS Plus – Essential, Extra, and Premium.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-prices-increasing-all-tiers-september-2023-ps-plus-essential-saints-row/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The price for all three tiers have gone up</a>&nbsp;for those subscribing for a year, but the monthly cost hasn’t changed. You can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explore the games available via each tier and sign up here</a>.</p>
<p>The new PS Plus Extra/Premium games get added to the collection on May 21. What PS Plus games are you planning to play this month?</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24157535/playstation-plus-may-catalog-red-dead-redemption-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-2-returns-to-playstation-plus-in-may-offerings.872163/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157535/playstation-plus-may-catalog-red-dead-redemption-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2ZOLZ0">PlayStation Plus is Sony’s equivalent of Xbox’s Game Pass service, and games come and go from the catalog over time. While not every game is on the service, and some rotate out, it’s still an excellent way to play a selection of great games from the last decade. For instance, Rockstar’s epic cowboy saga <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> will soon be available on PlayStation Plus after a long absence, along with a handful of other intriguing titles.</p>
<p id="C3SH3n">The May lineup for PlayStation Plus’ game catalog (arriving May 21) includes <em>Red Dead</em>, as well as the spy vs spy royale<em> Deceive Inc.</em>, co-op crime heister <em>Crime Boss: Rockay City</em>, adorable cat-themed classic RPGs <em>Cat Quest</em> and <em>Cat Quest 2</em>, and survival simulator <em>Stranded: Alien Dawn</em>. That’s a smorgasbord of well-received games that can be sampled, which is a nice perk of PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p id="ddPU8v"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> has a long campaign, but one that’s well worth exploring. The story of Arthur Morgan and the van der Linde gang is a slow motion trainwreck, with their criminal camaraderie slowly cracking under the pressure of the encroaching civilization and law that comes with it. In addition, <em>Red Dead Online</em> is a fun cowboy sandbox with a much more light-hearted tone, and it comes as part of the package with <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (though it’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23333281/red-dead-online-2022-updates-content-expansion-pc-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x">no longer being updated</a>).</p>
<p id="SGmWPb">When the PlayStation Plus content library is refreshed, players lose access to titles that have been removed from the service. So if you’re playing <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> or another title set to be removed through PlayStation Plus, you have until May 21 to wrap up. There’s a section marked “last chance to play” under the Collections page on the PlayStation 5, or the Games Catalog page on the PlayStation 4. </p>

Next year, in 2013, <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> (aka the really good pirate one) launched in 2013 on those previously mentioned platforms, but also arrived on the then-new PS4 and Xbox One. </p><p>So it seems reasonable to think that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-iii-the-kotaku-review-5957510&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-iii-the-kotaku-review-5957510"><em>ACIII</em></a></span> was the last time the franchise didn’t arrive on PS4 and Xbox One. But no, that’s incorrect! Weirdly, in 2014, we got two<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> games: <em>Unity</em> and <em>Rogue</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-unity-just-doesnt-run-very-well-on-ps-1657617530&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-unity-just-doesnt-run-very-well-on-ps-1657617530"><em>Unity </em>infamously</a></span> launched with a ton of bugs on PS4 and Xbox One. But <em>Rogue </em>only arrived on PS3 and Xbox 360, a sort of final farewell to those aging platforms. </p><p>Since then, for the last decade now, every major <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game has been released on PS4 and Xbox One. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175">Even last year’s fantastic <em>Mirage</em></a></span><em> </em>launched on PS4 and Xbox One, consoles that are now over 10 years old. </p><p>However, this streak ends this November with the launch of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, which is only being developed for PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, and Mac. While I’m happy to see the franchise move on and expand beyond what was possible on those older platforms, it’s a bit sad to see the end of an era. </p><h2 id="h19419"><a id=""></a>The OG <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>and <em>Shadows</em> have this in common</h2><p>And yes, before you yell at me online, I know that (almost) all the main <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games eventually ended up on PS4 via remasters and re-releases. I know! But oddly, that leads to one last fact: <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will soon be just one of two main entries in the franchise to not be playable on PS4. </p><p>The other one? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/assassin-s-creed&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/assassin-s-creed">The very first <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>game</a></span> released back in 2007. </p><p>The game that started it all has never been remastered, remade, or even ported to any platforms beyond PS3, Xbox 360, and PC. Technically, the 360 version is playable on Xbox One and Series consoles. But to this day, the only way to play it on a PlayStation console is to dust off your PS3, ignore the loud fan, and boot it up there. </p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> launches on November 15 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Mac, and Amazon’s Luna streaming service. (Don’t laugh, it’s a thing.) </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is based on my own experience getting started in just the past few months, so rest assured this advice isn’t coming from a seasoned vet who may miss the forest for the trees a bit.<br></p><p>So grab your favorite robot/ninja/frog-person and let’s get started. Well, I’ll help you with that part too.</p><h2 id="h32281"><a id=""></a>The stakes are refreshingly low</h2><figure id="" data-id="f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-recommend-id="image://f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A space-ninja-like figure leaps at an enemy, blades drawn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A space-ninja-like figure leaps at an enemy, blades drawn." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-recommend-id="image://f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A space-ninja-like figure leaps at an enemy, blades drawn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Before anything else, it’s important to frame the experience appropriately so you don’t immediately drown. Free-to-play games can be pretty meta-heavy, and if you start reading about <em>Warframe</em> or even playing it blind, you may find that there’s way too much information coming from multiple angles all at once. If nothing else, take this from me here: you don’t need to give a shit about anything to enjoy <em>Warframe</em>.</p><p>The whole game is basically a series of missions in which you go out to a stage, beat the stuffing out of bad guys, pick up all the junk they vomit, then go home and make your robot ninja frog’s numbers go up. There isn’t really an important PVP element at all, and the ranking system is entirely tied to your personal progress. The best way to enjoy <em>Warframe</em> is to take your time and just do whatever looks interesting. The appeal is in doing cool video game stuff, and all the metrics and stats and other nonsense is secondary. If you gel with the basic combat mechanics, that’s the whole point!</p><h2 id="h32282"><a id=""></a>Which Warframe should you pick? How about weapons?</h2><figure id="" data-id="7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-recommend-id="image://7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="894" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A figure appears to bow or crouch low before gun-toting guards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A figure appears to bow or crouch low before gun-toting guards." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-recommend-id="image://7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="894" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A figure appears to bow or crouch low before gun-toting guards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>First things first, you gotta pick your freebies. There are tons of different Warframes and weapons to collect, which involves either lots of farming (do this) or spending real money (don’t do this). But as is the case with these kinds of games, you get some starting equipment for free.</p><p>You can pick one of three starting Warframes:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Mag</li><li>Volt</li><li>Excalibur</li></ul><p>I picked Excalibur, because it’s a generic sword man. Not lots of thinking involved with this one. Many players swear by Mag though, because it has easy-to-use abilities that will draw enemies right to you in clumps, stun them, and let you bonk them to death with little resistance.</p><p>Nobody really cares about Volt, apparently.</p><p>Weapons come in three categories: primary, secondary, and melee. You can choose between two options in each category.</p><p><strong>Primary</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Mk-1 Braton - assault rifle</li><li>Paris - bow</li></ul><p><strong>Secondary</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Lato - pistol</li><li>Kunai - uh, kunai</li></ul><p><strong>Melee</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Skana - sword</li><li>MK-1 Bo - staff</li></ul><p>Generally speaking, it’s a good idea to pick the assault rifle over the bow, unless you’re one of those bow sickos who thrived back in the 2010s when every FPS suddenly had one. The secondary weapon doesn’t make as much of an impact, but it’s worth noting the kunai are good for not tripping alarms if you care about being sneaky.</p><p>Finally, if you’re playing as Excalibur, it only makes sense to pick the sword. But otherwise the staff is really good, especially when it comes to hitting multiple targets with regular attacks. And if you’re Mag, using its powers to bunch enemies together and pull them in makes the staff an incredible tool.</p><h2 id="h32283"><a id=""></a>Fill out the Star Chart</h2><figure id="" data-id="5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-recommend-id="image://5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows various planets and other locales in space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map shows various planets and other locales in space." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-recommend-id="image://5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows various planets and other locales in space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The worst part of information overload in <em>Warframe </em>is simply not knowing what to do. A lot of different routes are open to you from the beginning, and it’s easy to get distracted with each new thing you unlock and get lost. Instead, try and put the blinders on and focus on simply playing all the stages in each planet. That’s the Star Chart, which is basically a map of all the planets you can visit with points of interest all over it.</p><p>As you fill in the Star Chart you’ll find, more or less, an organic path through the game. Paths to other planets are big milestones that double as barriers with specific requirements, but especially early on you’ll likely obtain what you need well before you clear all the levels. Try to hold off on actually leaving Earth if you’re feeling overwhelmed, and take each planet one at a time.</p><h2 id="h32284"><a id=""></a>Modding is The Thing, forever</h2><figure id="" data-id="692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-recommend-id="image://692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen has the text UPGRADES: UNRANKED MAG near the top and shows an assortment of potential upgrades with names like Dead Eye, EMP Aura, and Enemy Radar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen has the text UPGRADES: UNRANKED MAG near the top and shows an assortment of potential upgrades with names like Dead Eye, EMP Aura, and Enemy Radar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-recommend-id="image://692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen has the text UPGRADES: UNRANKED MAG near the top and shows an assortment of potential upgrades with names like Dead Eye, EMP Aura, and Enemy Radar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The biggest part of <em>Warframe</em>’s progression, and perhaps one of the most intimidating, is modding. As you play the game, you’ll earn these cards that fill up your modding inventory, and each one offers some kind of stat bump. You get mods for your Warframe and each weapon, and things like pets down the road. Try not to overthink this stuff at first, and simply equip what you have the capacity for as you go.</p><p>The effects of mods range from obvious (bumps to health, damage, armor, etc.) to more complex (status conditions, elemental damage/resistance, etc.). And as you dive in more, you’ll get to things like upgrading individual mods and upgrading your capacity so you can actually make space for upgraded mods. But this is the long game. Don’t get caught up in trying to maximize this part.<br></p><p>Most importantly, don’t sell mods for credits! Choose the other currency instead, which is explicitly for upgrading mods and is much harder to come by.</p><h2 id="h32285"><a id=""></a>Try the Duviri Paradox</h2><figure id="" data-id="60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-recommend-id="image://60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="625" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Figures ride horse-like creatures, framed within the larger image of a face with eyes of pure white." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Figures ride horse-like creatures, framed within the larger image of a face with eyes of pure white." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Illustration<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-recommend-id="image://60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="625" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Figures ride horse-like creatures, framed within the larger image of a face with eyes of pure white." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you want something a little more streamlined to ease you into <em>Warframe</em> from a gameplay perspective, you can try the Duviri Paradox. This is a separate mode that’s kind of roguelike-y, and has its own self-contained story and reward systems. It’s also one of several options to check out if you simply need a break from the regular grind!</p><h2 id="h32286"><a id=""></a>Lore comes later</h2><figure id="" data-id="3d87c40b9facf0cc017e4f9568654f7e" data-recommend-id="image://3d87c40b9facf0cc017e4f9568654f7e" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman in futuristic gear reclines against a motorcycle.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One thing you hear a lot from the <em>Warframe</em> community (and other online game communities, shout out to the <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> kids) is how awesome the story is. And when you jump into the game and are mostly met with a bunch of loot grinding and menus to drown in, the whiplash is understandable. The answer, as in other cases, is to stick it out a while because the story starts much later.</p><p>If you’re really curious but disappointed that things aren’t popping off right at the start, the unfortunate reality is that you’re playing a game that evolved over the course of a decade into what it is today. And you gotta get through the onboarding before you get to the stuff that came after <em>Warframe</em> became a big deal. So if you’re vibing with the combat and loot loop, your patience will be rewarded with more lore and storytelling moving to the foreground. But don’t stress yourself out trying to find it. The story will come to you as you keep playing and progressing.</p><h2 id="h32287"><a id=""></a>Keep the Wiki on standby</h2><figure id="" data-id="e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-recommend-id="image://e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="837" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Warframe Wiki, showing categories like Warframes, Weapons, Equipment, and so on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Warframe Wiki, showing categories like Warframes, Weapons, Equipment, and so on." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fandom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-recommend-id="image://e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="837" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Warframe Wiki, showing categories like Warframes, Weapons, Equipment, and so on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I tend to hate this advice, but I want to stress how unnecessary it is while you’re still getting your robo-froggy feet wet. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/WARFRAME_Wiki&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/WARFRAME_Wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Warframe wiki</a></span> is a tremendous community resource that will be your best source of information for anything going on under the hood. If you have questions about how something works, or some other minutia to optimize your build, hit the wiki. But until that point, don’t worry about it too much. Just know it’s there, waiting for you, when you need it.</p><p>Hopefully this helped! It’s admittedly easy to feel intimidated by <em>Warframe</em> at first, as fun as it looks. Heck, I tried two or three times and bounced off before the stars aligned and it clicked. Now I’m having a blast, and all it took was thinking about the approach a little differently. Remember, there’s no actual pressure to do everything and perfectly engage with the <em>Warframe</em> meta. This isn’t a competitive game by most accounts. Instead, pick stuff that looks cool and fits how you like to play action games, make your way through the story and decide what you think of the game on your own terms. It’s much less stressful that way. Before long you’ll be playing “Fashionframe” with all the other vets.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was revealed by Ubisoft today, with a gorgeous trailer being released to showcase the next major iteration in the legendary series. It’s officially hitting the market on November 15, and the most die-hard of fans will be eagerly securing the best edition of the game possible. Ubisoft has gone above and beyond with the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Collector’s Edition – it’s one of the most ambitious bundles in franchise history.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-collector-s-edition-is-insane">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Collector’s Edition is Insane</h2>



<p>Ubisoft just lifted the lid on one of the cleanest and most valuable Collector’s Editions in the history of Assassin’s Creed. In November, players will be able to get their hands on this top-tier edition of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but it costs a pretty penny – $239.99 to be precise.</p>



<p>But what does the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Collector’s Edition come with?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>At the centre of the bundle is an incredible 40cm statue of Naoe and Yasuke, the game’s protagonist duo. This hand-painted statue is the crown jewel of the Collector’s Edition, but it’s only the start in terms of the full package.</p>



<p>Alongside the statue sits an exclusive steelbook case, a collector’s artbook with stunning lithographic prints, a life-size katana ‘tsuba’ (hand guard) with a display stand, a gorgeous world map, and a ‘meticulously crafted’ Japanese wall scroll measuring 70x30cm. It all comes packaged in a box that’s a collector’s item in itself, and as standard, the edition comes with the Ultimate Edition of the game.</p>



<p>For a true fan, it’s well worth the expense. It’s arguably the biggest and boldest Collector’s Edition in series history.</p>

Despite fairly positive reviews upon release, player sentiment on Diablo 4 took a downturn by the time the game's first season came out, with players criticizing how its gear progression worked and its lack of endgame content. While new seasons did introduce changes alongside various new systems and mechanics, they still left players underwhelmed. When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-coming-to-steam-in-time-for-season-2/1100-6518140/" data-ref-id="1100-6518140">Diablo 4 launched on Steam in October 2023</a>, it quickly found itself with a "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mixed" average user review rating</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 | Loot Reborn | Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">That doesn't appear to be the case with Season 4, which dramatically reworked the game's loot to make it more powerful, upgradable, and easier to acquire and customize than ever before. The result is praise on places like Reddit and "Mostly Positive" recent reviews on Steam, which was not the case for previous season launches.</p><p dir="ltr">"They did it, they fixed the game," user Frockyyy <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Frockyyy/recommended/2344520/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in their positive Steam review posted after the Season 4 update.</p><p dir="ltr">Many on Reddit seem to agree, with users praising the new season for its improvements to Helltides, which are now playable at lower World Tiers and much more lucrative, and how its various itemization updates have removed much of the inventory "hassle" that previously took up too much of Diablo 4 players' time. One user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cs29tf/best_season_start_so_far_thanks_blizzard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it's the "best season start so far" and is "Diablo 4 as it should have originally been released." Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cs6tv4/diablo_4_is_so_much_better_now/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stated</a> the game in Season 4 is "hardly recognizable" compared to launch, and that they are "having a lot more fun."</p><p dir="ltr">Part of the positive reception may be the fact that Season 4 was the first Diablo 4 season to be extensively playtested by the community on the game's on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-ever-public-test-realm-is-live-now/1100-6522348/" data-ref-id="1100-6522348">public test realm</a>, something that is used in other Blizzard games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a> but wasn't used for Diablo 4 in previous seasons. That feedback then made its way into Season 4 from the start as opposed to weeks later like in previous seasons. Despite the positive effect the PTR seems to have had, Blizzard stated in a recent interview with GameSpot that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/" data-ref-id="1100-6523061">doesn't have concrete plans to do PTR testing for every future season</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That being said, players do have a few complaints. The first is that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1cs999o/does_the_game_feel_way_easier_after_patch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some think the game is too easy</a> at lower levels post-Season 4 update. Others are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1csidra/very_awesome_season_but_lets_make_temper_manuals/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointing out</a> that new Tempering recipes, used to add affixes to gear, can be easily missed once they drop on the ground and should be more visible. Another complaint is that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-community-warns-that-latest-patch-changed-how-item-salvaging-works/1100-6523489/" data-ref-id="1100-6523489">Salvage button now salvages all items</a>, including Legendaries and Uniques, which wasn't the case before. That means more than a few players have likely been burned and lost some powerful items before learning about the change.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the complaints, it does seem that Diablo 4's latest season is a major step forward. As Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1csjrc3/s4_feels_like_it_is_exactly_the_direction_this/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Netsuko puts it</a>, "S4 feels like it is exactly the direction this game needs to be taken," and that it makes them "hopeful for the expansion."</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time an entry in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-3-went-from-disastrous-launch-to-a-hell-of-a-good-time/1100-6503426/" data-ref-id="1100-6503426">Diablo franchise has seen a dramatic overhaul</a>. Diablo 3's launch was a disaster, plagued by technical issues and complaints about its real-money auction house. It would take years for player sentiment to turn around following major updates and the release of Diablo 3's first and only expansion, Reaper of Souls.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-coming-to-game-pass-on-march-28/1100-6521127/" data-ref-id="1100-6521127">Diablo 4 recently released on Game Pass.</a> It's first expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-expansion-vessel-of-hatred-coming-late-2024/1100-6518910/" data-ref-id="1100-6518910">Vessel of Hatred, is slated to release in late 2024</a>. </p>

Despite the successful Kickstarter and a number of grant applications, and positive fan reception online and at events, "no amount of legitimacy we built has culminated in a deal."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a bid to make sure at least some part of the game makes it to the hands of players, Fighting Chance Games is releasing a "Failure to Launch" edition for free on Steam. It will only feature three of the seven playable queens who had granted permission to use their likenesses.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why couldn't a drag-themed game get funding?">Why couldn't a drag-themed game get funding?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The cancellation is surprising because the game was featured prominently in the Day of the Devs events at the 2023 Game Awards and 2024 Game Developers Conference. It's worrisome that even with such support, a studio might need to shut down its game before launching.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But what's also disheartening is that a game designed to be a "killer piece of gay media" couldn't find funding in an era where its subject, drag queens, is growing more popular each year.

<p data-characters="285" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Everyone knows by now how problematic the year of <em>Lightfall</em> has been for <em>Destiny 2</em> and Bungie at large. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lets-look-at-the-biggest-destiny-2-lightfall-issues-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The DLC itself</a>, for sure, was an issue, but <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-season-of-the-wish-opinion-send-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the final season of the year</a> was disappointing and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungies-recent-destiny-2-state-of-the-game-is-one-of-its-most-disastrous/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mounting number of real-world concerns</a> didn’t stop coming. Until now, that is.</p> <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">I’m something of a <em>Destiny</em> expatriate, you see. For the years between <em>Forsaken</em> and <em>Lightfall</em>, Bungie’s seminal franchise was <em>the</em> go-to game for me, from the lore books to day one raiding, I was all over everything related to <em>Destiny </em>at large. It wasn’t perfect much of the time, it goes without saying, but releases such as <em>Witch Queen</em> and a solid raiding/endgame friend group meant there was always, <em>always</em> something good for us to engage with. And, so we did. Until we stopped.</p>
 <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">Now, I’m not saying that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-may-have-just-received-a-blow-it-cant-recover-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the questionable quality of <em>Lightfall</em> and its subsequent seasonal offerings</a> was what put many of us off, necessarily, but it sure didn’t help. My playgroup simply fell off the live-service wagon that <em>Destiny</em>‘s been dragging behind it forever now, and getting back onto it wasn’t an option. Around the time of this taking place, the <em>Destiny</em> community was up in arms over a variety of things:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-game-director-joe-blackburn-leaving-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Director Joe Blackburn up and left Bungie early in 2024</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-enables-classic-pvp-mode-after-new-experiment-flunks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The PvP modes were in shambles</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-confirms-delay-for-destiny-2-the-final-shape-announces-new-content-for-april/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The <em>Final Shape</em> DLC was delayed</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">And that’s a very non-exhaustive list of issues that cropped up for <em>Destiny 2</em> on top of all the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-may-have-just-received-a-blow-it-cant-recover-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other, more serious problems</a> that it had been dragging along from the months prior. This is relevant because as I fell off the daily <em>Destiny </em>grind, so too did I stop checking in with the community, which became more and more unhappy with the state of the game as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-says-they-missed-the-mark-on-parts-of-destiny-2s-lightfall-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie encountered problems</a> all of its own. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-lays-off-staff-and-delays-destiny-2-the-final-shape-and-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The subsequent layoffs</a> made things worse still, leading to an overall air of unease that became associated with <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-stage-is-set-for-destiny-2-the-final-shape" data-injectable="false">The stage is set for Destiny 2: The Final Shape</h2> <p data-characters="561" data-current-count="861" data-injectable="true">It was strange and impressive in equal parts, then, when I checked back in with <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s biggest subreddit following the release of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-content-update-and-four-streams-completely-turned-the-destiny-2-community-around/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Into the Light</a></em>. This free DLC release marked a major push onward, as far as Bungie’s attempts to turn things back around go. And now, with <em>Into the Light</em> in tow, the actual events of the game and its balancing are the main topics once again, betraying a sense of normalcy. Something that you wouldn’t necessarily expect, considering what Bungie and <em>Destiny 2</em> have been going through since <em>Lightfall</em> came out.</p>
 <p data-characters="148" data-current-count="148" data-injectable="false">Just months ago, it was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-bungie-trying-to-regain-ground-with-destiny-2-players-before-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">virtually unthinkable that Bungie would successfully turn things around for <em>Destiny 2</em></a> in such short order. Yet, here we are.</p> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">To be perfectly fair, this doesn’t mean that <em>The Final Shape</em> will be selling gangbusters. I’d be hard-pressed to expect this DLC to perform as well as <em>Lightfall </em>did, though I’m almost positive it’ll be a fair bit better in the end. That’s because <em>Lightfall</em> enjoyed the windfall delivered by the amazing <em>Witch Queen</em> DLC, while <em>The Final Shape</em> is bound to rile up negative attention thanks to <em>Ligthfall</em>‘s failures.</p>
 <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">Yet, the sense of excited normalcy is pervasive on the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r/destinythegame subreddit</a>. The most popular topics as of mid-May discuss <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1crqpvk/the_class_i_use_is_bad_at_everything_the_other/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game balancing</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cs4jhi/thunderlord_is_a_2_phase_with_platinum_for_rhulk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent Pantheon combat strategies</a>, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1crx5tw/new_titan_exotic_showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Final Shape</em> content</a>, and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1cs5l3p/bungie_seriously_if_youre_going_to_put_cats_in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-game cats</a>. This is in no particular order, mind: just to give you a general sense of how things have settled down, now that we’re <em>less than a month</em> away from what is, in effect, the most important <em>Destiny</em> <em>2</em> DLC we’ve had yet.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-can-bungie-deliver-once-again" data-injectable="false">Can Bungie deliver, once again?</h2> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is due to release on June 4, and the simple fact of the matter is that <em>Destiny</em> fans do have a lot to be excited about. The sheer presence of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/we-now-know-all-of-destiny-2s-prismatic-subclass-abilities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Prismatic subclass</a>, for one, is unprecedented on its own, to the point that it’s easy to forget what else we’re getting with the DLC. A whole new <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-showcases-dread-forces-ahead-of-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Darkness faction</a>? A reworked <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-the-power-system-is-changing-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">power system</a>? The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-can-you-get-your-old-sunset-guns-back-after-the-final-shape-comes-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">un-sunsetting of items</a> that were out of the rotation since <em>Beyond Light</em>?</p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">Honestly, it’s like someone’s taken the generalized community content wishlist for <em>Destiny 2</em> and went ham on it. This stuff is so interesting that it’s completely overshadowed <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/most-destiny-2-into-the-light-will-sunset-with-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie’s propensity to sunset a fair chunk of <em>Into the Light</em></a> once <em>Final Shape</em> comes out, but that’s a story for some other day.</p> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">Back to the topic at hand, it was virtually unthinkable just months ago that the <em>Destiny</em> community would be back to its usual self ahead of <em>The Final Shape</em>. Against all odds, though, Bungie succeeded in balancing things out, and if <em>The Final Shape</em> delivers out of the gate, it may well end up being just the type of thing this franchise needs to maintain its momentum.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">All of this is to say that, as it currently stands, things are looking nice and calm in the <em>Destiny</em> corner of the world. This isn’t a given that everything will be hunky-dory once <em>The Final Shape</em> comes out, naturally, but it does give us an idea that the community is ready for Bungie to deliver something that’s in line with the franchise’s pedigree.</p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">It’s still entirely possible that this extremely hyped-up DLC will flunk. Or, as was the case with <em>Lightfall</em>, that it’ll do well early on, only to fall apart under further scrutiny and a continuously unremarkable post-DLC content schedule. Remember: we’ve got absolutely no idea how <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s ‘Episodes’ will function. </p> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="806" data-injectable="true">Bungie is making a deliberate delineation between Episodes and Seasons as they were up until now, and there is <em>potentially</em> a fair bit less content planned for 2024 and beyond. Remember: we’re only getting <em>three</em> Episodes during the year of <em>The Final Shape</em>, compared to the <em>Lightfall</em>‘s four Seasons. The Episodes’ act-based structure and content formatting may pan out, but we just don’t have enough information to go on.</p>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">So Bungie is about to make a huge gamble with <em>The Final Shape</em>. The team’s done well over the past couple of months, which resulted in possibly the best pre-DLC situation they could’ve wished for. The community is extremely receptive as it now stands, too, and the stage is set. As for what comes next… we’ve got just a few short weeks to go before we find out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Neopets Tabletop RPG Announced by Geekify]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/neopets-tabletop-rpg-announced-by-geekify.872118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/neopets-tabletop-rpg-announced-by-geekify<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For Millennials, the <em>Neopets</em> franchise is one drenched in nostalgia. The novelty virtual pet game let players adopt, customize, and interact with the titular creatures in an online virtual world. In celebration of the series' 25th anniversary, a <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> is coming to store shelves.</p>
<h2>The <em>Neopets</em> <em>Tabletop RPG</em> Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG </em>is being developed by Geekify. This is the studio behind dedicated <em>Neopets</em> merchandise, including calendars, enamel pins, and keychains.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neopets-character-artwork.jpg?itok=s3iCeaZJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neopets-character-artwork.jpg?itok=_e9ZqIwW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Millennials, enjoy the nostalgia blast.</figcaption></figure><p>This tabletop adaptation has been in development for two years. The game will be a dice-driven, d20-based adventuring system. It will feature a class-less, feat-oriented skill system designed for accessibility for new players while scaling to advanced players.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> will be set within the series' unique setting of Neopia, showcasing the series' fun and goofy tone through game mechanics. Lastly, Geekify confirmed that several campaign modules are in development, starting with <em>The Fall of Faerieland</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets</em> craze started back in 1999. It was one of the earliest examples of a free-to-play experience. Players could earn two kinds of virtual currency, which could be spent on customizing their Neopet. One was earned in-game, and the other bought with real-world money. At its peak, the game sported more than 35 million players.</p>
<p>The series has changed hands across multiple platforms and publishers. In 2005, Neopets Inc. was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-jun-21-fi-neopets21-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">purchased by Viacom</a> for $160 million. In 2014, Jumpstart Games purchased the property from Viacom. In 2017, Chinese company NetDragon purchased Jumpstart Games. The franchise seemingly died under this stewardship; the servers shut down June 2023.</p>
<p>Across this storied history, <em>Neopets</em> continued to grow and expand. It introduced unique characters, storylines, and more sophisticated customization options for their players. It also introduced some moments of embarrassment like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/neopets-data-breach-leaks-your-childhood-account-information">data leaks</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2023/03/22/remember-neopets-this-hong-kong-company-is-trying-to-revitalize-the-nostalgic-game-with-web3-technology/?sh=670cc60ce9ef" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NFT drama</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> is part of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/03/neopets-plans-comeback-in-a-vastly-different-era-of-gaming.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a franchise revival</a>, courtesy of a management buyout by the aptly named World of Neopia.</p>
<p>The <em>Neopets Tabletop RPG</em> will be <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/geekifyinc/neopets-official-tabletop-roleplaying-game-ttrpg">coming to Kickstarter May 31</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24157286/ppsspp-playstation-portable-psp-emulator-ios-app-store-iphone-ipad-apple<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s the PlayStation Portable’s turn to get an emulator on the iOS App Store thanks to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fppsspp-psp-emulator%2Fid6496972903">PPSSPP</a>, which just went live today. This emulator, from developer Henrik Rydgård, has been in development for more than a decade, and it’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fppsspp-psp-emulator%2Fid6496972903">free to download</a> for the iPhone and iPad.</p><p>Rydgård <a href="https://www.ppsspp.org/news/live-on-app-store/">says in a blog post</a> that the version approved this morning has some limitations versus previous builds of the app that were available through various exploits and <a href="https://suyogya.link/installing-sidestore-and-ppsspp-on-ios/">workarounds</a>. The biggest is that Apple doesn’t allow Just-in-Time recompilers that retranslate code for the OS and can lead to smoother performance. (It’s why we <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137369/dolphinios-emulator-apple-app-store-jit">might never see</a> a GameCube / Wii emulator.) “Fortunately,” he writes, “iOS devices are generally fast enough” for almost all PSP games.</p><p>Besides that, Rydgård said iPad Magic Keyboard support had to be removed because “the old method was using an undocumented API” but that the feature will return. The emulator’s RetroAchievements feature is disabled, too. Rydgård didn’t explain why but says it’ll be back later “with a better login UI.” The same goes for Vulkan graphics API support, which he says will also come back, possibly with “a native Metal backend.”</p><p>I never owned Sony’s first handheld PSP, but I polled <em>Verge </em>staffers and was told <em>Valkyria Chronicles II</em>, <em>Patapon,</em> <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, </em>and <em>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII</em> are all excellent reasons to check out PPSSPP. <em>Lumines</em> deserves a mention, too. Most of those games were released on other consoles later, of course, but they do represent the kinds of experiences that were available on the system.</p><p>PPSSPP works on iOS 12 and up, iPadOS 12 and up, and can also be played on the Vision Pro. Though the app is free, Rydgård’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fppsspp-gold-psp-emulator%2Fid6502287918">paid version</a> is coming soon for $4.99, he told <em>The Verge</em> via email. Assuming it’s like the $5 <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dorg.ppsspp.ppssppgold%26hl%3Den_US%26gl%3DUS">Android version</a>, it may not be functionally different from the free app — it’s there to support Rydgård’s efforts.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

His placeable shield was more flexible than Reinhardt or Orisa’s, and his primary rock-throwing weapon did can do damage and disrupt in equal measure. On top of this, his ultimate ability, Gravitic Flux, which lifts enemies within its radius off the ground, slams them down, and cuts their health by half its base health, is still one of the most powerful ones in the game. For some reason, with <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mid-season patch</a></span>, Blizzard decided that Sigma’s ultimate needed a huge buff. Naturally, it’s now very broken.</p><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,192616" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Gravitic Flux is an area-of-effect ability signified by a dark circle on the ground that appears as its cast. There’s a darker center within this circle, and before this patch, a character had to be in the circle’s line of sight to be caught in the telekinetic slam. This is why characters like Mei or Lifeweaver were able to counter this ultimate by building an Ice Wall or Tree of Life that blocked teammates from being caught in the attack. This new patch removes that requirement, so now, if you’re in the circle at all, Sigma is giving you uppies. However, as some players have discovered, taking out the line of sight requirement means it can work through walls, even if Sigma can’t see those enemies.</p><p>Blizzard explicitly notes that this change was made because there’s a lot of counterplay against the Gravitic Flux, so perhaps this was the intention. But now all I can think about is how Sigma’s suddenly made for stealthy plays. Is your enemy team sitting on the payload in Dorado? Go into one of the buildings surrounding it and cast Gravitic Flux just on the edge of the room. You’re bound to catch at least one of them by surprise. This shit’s busted.</p><p>The full patch notes for <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s mid-season update are as follows:</p><h4 id="h32790"><a id=""></a><strong>COMPETITIVE PLAY UPDATES</strong></h4><p><strong>Demotion Protection Modifier</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The Demotion Protection modifier has been moved from below the Rank Progress bar into the bar itself to improve visibility when a player is in a Demotion Protection state.</li><li>When Demotion Protection occurs, you will not be told when your progress is below that skill division’s range.

Competitive Play already calculates this Modifier to your Skill Rank adjustment, but it wasn’t visible until now. Very high or very low-ranked players will see this Modifier after every match while they continue to maintain a Rank at the outer limits of the ranked spectrum. Climbing to the highest skill tiers like Grand Masters or Champions is not intended to be easy, and overcoming Pressure to reach the top is no longer a hidden challenge that players must face.</p><p><strong>Grouping Restrictions</strong></p><p>The Skill Tier legend was updated to show the changes to grouping restrictions that were applied in a previous update. The grouping restriction changes we applied are the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Grand Master can now group within 3 divisions to be considered a narrow group.</li><li>Champion can now group within 1 division to be considered a narrow group.</li></ul><p>Developer comment: While the Season 10 changes to grouping up with friends have contributed to a large improvement in match quality for most players, we’re still looking to reduce queue times for players and groups, especially for higher ranks.</p><p><strong>MATCHMAKING UPDATES</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>When a player is currently on a loss streak, the matchmaker will try to avoid putting the player on a team that is statistically calculated to have a lower chance of winning.</li></ul><p>Developer comments: Loss streaks never feel good. Before each match, we make a prediction about which team will win the game, based on the information we have about the players on both teams. This is how modifiers such as Consolation, Reversal, Uphill Battle, and Expected give or take additional Rank Progress after each Competitive Play match. Since most matches will have a team that has a slightly higher chance of winning, placing a player on the team with the higher chance who is currently on a losing streak is aimed at helping them have a fair chance of breaking that streak. While this won’t guarantee they’ll win, it does provide a helping advantage.</p><h4 id="h32791"><a id=""></a><strong>HERO UPDATES</strong></h4><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Armor health has been reverted to provide a flat damage reduction of 5 per projectile, up to a maximum of 50% damage reduction.</li><li>Out-of-combat health regeneration changed from 20 health per second to 10 health per second + 5% of maximum health.</li></ul><p>Developer comment: Armor is being reverted to its original functionality to better resistance rapid fire damage and shotgun-type weapons. Out- of- combat health regeneration has been a positive but subtle addition to the game, but had a much smaller impact for tank heroes due to their massive health pools, so we’re adjusting it to heal for a percentage of maximum health.</p><h4 id="h32792"><a id=""></a><strong>TANKS</strong></h4><p>Role Passive</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Tanks now have 25% damage reduction against critical headshot damage.</li><li>Knockback resistance increased from 30% to 50%</li></ul><p>Developer Comment: Although armor health will now be more effective in some of the more difficult matchups, it will also be losing potency against the typically slower, higher damage instances. To help reduce the feeling of tanks being taken out too quickly by high bursts of damage, the role-wide passive now provides improved defense against critical headshot damage.</p><h4 id="h32793"><a id=""></a><strong>JUNKER QUEEN</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: Junker Queen being able to activate Commanding Shout while swinging her axe or during her Ultimate ability will make it more responsive for when an additional burst of health or movement speed is needed.</p><p><strong>Commanding Shout</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Can now be activated while using other abilities.</li><li>Cooldown reduced from 14 to 12 seconds.</li></ul><h4 id="h32794"><a id=""></a><strong>SIGMA</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: Similar to how Graviton Surge functions, Gravitic Flux no longer needs line of sight to affect enemy targets in its area. There are a fair amount of counterplay options to deal with this ultimate so we’re making it more reliable to grab enemy targets within its area of effect.</p><p><strong>Gravitic Flux</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>No longer requires line of sight to the center of the effect.</li></ul><h3 id="h32795"><a id=""></a>WRECKING BALL</h3><p>Developer Comment: Wrecking Ball has been performing much better after his recent update and these tuning changes will help his abilities feel more impactful.</p><p><strong>Grappling Claw</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Impact damage increased from 50 to 60.</li></ul><p><strong>Piledriver</strong><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Movement lockout duration for enemies increased from 0.5 to 0.75 seconds.</li></ul><p><strong>Minefield</strong><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Damage increased from 130 to 165.</li><li>Explosion knockback increased from 5 to 10.</li></ul><h4 id="h32796"><a id=""></a><strong>ZARYA</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: We have been increasing the value of some tank ultimate abilities to account for the increased health pools and it helps to make the decision of when to counter-swap more of an interesting tradeoff. Graviton Surge was still very useful to set up combos with other ultimate abilities but we want to makes sure it’s powerful enough on its own.</p><p><strong>Graviton Surge</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Radius increased from 6 to 7 meters.</li><li>Duration increased from 3.5 to 4 seconds</li></ul><h4 id="h32797"><a id=""></a><strong>DAMAGE</strong></h4><h4 id="h32798"><a id=""></a><strong>JUNKRAT</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: Junkrat’s weapon has great damage output but is unreliable outside of close range due to its slow projectile speed, which is an intended drawback to its high output. The Season 9 health changes affected Junkrat more than most other heroes since it now requires one more shot to secure an elimination. We’re increasing the damage on direct impacts to return to 2 direct hits for an elimination, without making his combo with Concussion Mine as deadly as before since that one is much easier to execute.</p><p><strong>Frag Launcher</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Impact damage increased from 40 to 45 (Total damage increased from 120 to 125).</li></ul><h4 id="h32799"><a id=""></a><strong>ECHO</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: While the main benefit of Duplicate is a second health pool and the utility of another hero’s abilities, it was often too difficult to charge an ultimate in the Duplicate time limit so we’re increasing the bonus multiplier slightly.</p><p><strong>Duplicate</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Ultimate gain multiplier while transformed increased from 4 to 4.5.</li></ul><h4 id="h32800"><a id=""></a><strong>HANZO</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: The Dragonstrike ultimate hasn’t been very effective outside of being used in a combo with other abilities that restrict enemy movement, so we’re increasing its speed to help position it as less of a zoning tool and more likely to deal some damage.</p><p>Speed increased from 12 to 15 meters per second.</p><p><strong>Dragonstrike</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Speed increased from 12 to 15 meters per second.</li></ul><h4 id="h32801"><a id=""></a><strong>SUPPORT</strong></h4><h4 id="h32802"><a id=""></a><strong>BRIGITTE</strong></h4><p>Developer Comment: Resetting the Shield Bash cooldown on ultimate activation was too much potential burst damage for Brigitte when the average maximum health of everyone was lower, but it’s much more reasonable now that it won’t be as lethal.</p><p><strong>Rally</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Now resets Shield Bash cooldown upon activation.</li></ul><h4 id="h32803"><a id=""></a><strong>BUG FIXES</strong></h4><p><strong>GENERAL</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed a bug with Mirrorwatch not generating stats in Game Reports.</li><li>Fixed a bug with Competitive Progress not incrementing correctly.</li></ul><p><strong>MAPS</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>General bug fixes and improvements were performed on multiple maps.</li></ul><p>Eichenwalde</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed an area that could cause players to temporarily become stuck.</li></ul><p>Samoa</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed a spot on the map that players could become temporarily stuck in.</li></ul><p>Shambali</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed a location where players could become stuck for a period of time.</li></ul><p><strong>HEROES</strong></p><p>Mercy</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Vengeance Skin - Fixed a bug with the feathers on the skin not being properly aligned.</li></ul><p>Venture</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed a bug with Tectonic Shock that counted turrets and other non-player targets as valid for the Excavation Annihilation challenge.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could occur with Burrow where Venture could remain burrowed above the ground.</li></ul></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Diablo 4's recent Loot Reborn update made a variety of changes to the game, but it seems that one tiny shift in particular might cause you a big headache if you aren't familiar with it. In short, the "Salvage All Items" function does just that: It salvages all your items, including your legendaries and uniques, so make sure you know that before you press it.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1csjgu7/psa_salvage_all_items_means_all_items_now/" rel="nofollow ">a post</a> on the Diablo subreddit, Salvage All Items used to ignore your uniques and legendaries, apparently assuming that you would want to keep these high-value items. The button will no longer make such distinctions, which at least one member of the community learned the hard way. Consider this your warning. The good news is that you can double-tap the mark-as-junk button in order to mark each of these items as your "favorites," which will make Salvage All Items avoid them again.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 | Loot Reborn | Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-massive-loot-reborn-update-is-live-now-read-the-full-season-4-patch-notes/1100-6523441/">Loot Reborn</a> update made the biggest changes that the game has seen yet, focusing on retooling its core mechanics and gameplay to improve the experience. For example, it totally changed the way item rolls work, with more-potent affixes across the board. It also added two new ways of upgrading a weapon: Tempering, which adds another affix from a Tempering Recipe, and Masterworking, which boosts all of the affixes to make the weapon more powerful.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a>'s biggest update since launch is finally here, bringing loads of new quality-of-life features to the game, from new visual performance settings to the ability to tweak combat difficulty and ship cargo space.</p><p dir="ltr">First <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-biggest-update-since-launch-arrives-on-may-15/1100-6523100/">announced earlier this month</a>, Starfield's May Update (as Bethesda calls it) includes new ways for players to tweak the game to their liking. Players who are struggling with interstellar dogfights but finding ground combat too easy can now tweak those combat difficulty settings individually, making space combat easier and ground combat harder, or vice versa. Additionally, players who find the "Very Hard" difficulty level too easy and are hungry for a more intense combat experience can try out the new "Extreme" difficulty mode instead, which promises a high-octane challenge.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Starfield May Update</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The May Update also includes <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/article/174M0cdUyxhn9mI0AvkcN9/starfield-update-1-11-36-may-15-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new performance options</a> for players who are exploring the stars via an Xbox Series X. Series X can now choose between 30fps 40fps, 60fps, or an uncapped frame rate, provided they have a Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) display running 120hz. But all is not lost for those without a VRR display--players with lower-quality displayers will still be able to select either 30fps or 60fps, and all Series X players now have access to a setting that allows them to prioritize visual performance over gameplay performance, and vice versa. A large number of bugs--especially those affecting the game's many quests--have also been addressed via the new update.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the May Update doesn't include vehicles for quicker groundside travel, Bethesda confirmed earlier this month that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/land-vehicles-are-finally-coming-to-starfield-but-we-dont-know-when-theyll-arrive/1100-6523105/">ground vehicles are indeed in the works</a>, but the developer declined to share information regarding when those vehicles will become available to players. It's possible the new ground vehicles will launch around the same time as Starfield's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-coming-this-fall-ship-building-update-later-this-week/1100-6523051/">Shattered Space expansion</a>, which is set to arrive sometime this fall.</p><p dir="ltr">For a closer look at everything Starfield's massive May Update has to offer, check out the full patch notes below.</p><h2 id="PATCH_NOTES">PATCH NOTES</h2><div

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/behind-the-gdc-scenes-with-beth-elderkin-and-sam-warnke-game-developer-podcast-ep-43<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Music by Mike Meehan. Produced by Jordan Mallory.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It may only take a week to hold the annual Game Developer Conference in San Francisco every spring, but the actual work of planning, orchestrating, and marketing the convention is a year-round process. It’s a job performed by far fewer people than you might think, and is one that requires a lot of spreadsheets, even more Post-It notes, and as many hours as it takes to sort through literally hundreds of panel submissions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To shine a light on this Herculean endeavor, editor-in-chief Danielle Riendeau talks to GDC content marketing manager Beth Elderkin, as well as conference producer Sam Warnke, for a thoroughly illuminating discussion on this month’s episode of the Game Developer Podcast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, how many people does it take to organize those hundreds of discrete events into one contiguous, coherent week’s worth of systematized programming? Far fewer than most would guess.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I have no idea how the programming team does it,” Elderkin says of Warnke’s unit. “There’s hundreds of talks, between 600 and 1,000 talks, and they curate through all of them and guide the speakers and guide the advisors through the process.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“When you're looking at each day of GDC,” she continues, “one person is in charge of organizing two of those days, and two people are in charge of organizing three of those days.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I oversee the Summits program and I am much more of a spreadsheet girly,” Warnke says. “Whereas on the Core Concept side, my colleague Kysa Korosi oversees that and she and Ashley Corrigan, also on our team, they use a physical board and move things around with magnets. I've seen pictures of this magnet board and it's a beast, and props to them because putting together the Wednesday through Friday program physically in that way—I can’t wrap my brain around it.”&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Scheduling isn’t the only hurdle that needs clearing, of course, in order for GDC to happen the way that it does. There’s also the work of liaising with the myriad publishers, developers and organizations that might want to be a part of the show, such as this year’s collaboration with the Video Game History Foundation to produce the Game History Gallery.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“It was so incredible to see these physical artifacts of games from the past, and also playable games that just don't technically exist anymore,” Warnke says. “It's really heartbreaking how much hard work is lost, and how many nostalgic pieces of people's lives just become unusable, or things that they can't revisit, they’re worlds that they can't revisit, and it's vitally important that we do continue this work of game preservation and continue to support foundations like the Video Game History Foundation.”</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon. She’s also a lecturer in game design at the Berklee College of Music, and a hobbyist game developer in her spare time.</span></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-cancels-development-on-the-division-heartland.872100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-cancels-development-on-the-division-heartland/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ubisoft-cancels-development-on-the-division-heartland<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="141" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As Ubisoft looks forward to its 2025 fiscal year, the company has decided to cancel its free-to-play <em>Division</em> game, <em>The Division Heartland</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true"><em>Heartland </em>was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-announces-free-to-play-the-division-heartland/">announced back in 2021</a>, with Ubisoft aiming to have the game in players’ hands by 2022. The planned release window didn’t work out, but in September 2022 we <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/free-to-play-division-heartland-resurgence-gameplay/">got another look at <em>Heartland</em></a>, and the game appeared to have everything you’d expect from a free-to-play multiplayer shooter. The game mixed in survival elements, pitting players against enemies swarming the fictional midwestern town of Silver Creek.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">In Ubisoft’s <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/AwOkNohhzmR1qBmQ4Nj4h/096beaa470c05f39f77417742e4d25b8/Ubisoft_FY24_Earnings_PR_English_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fiscal earnings</a> earlier today, mixed in with all the numbers and projections, was the <em>Heartland</em> news. The company wrote, “In line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on <em>The Division Heartland</em> and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as <em>XDefiant </em>and <em>Rainbow Six</em>.”</p> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">Ubisoft’s road ahead seems to be focusing on only the biggest money makers. Last year fans were disappointed when the company <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-immortals-fenyx-rising-sequel/">canceled plans for an <em>Immortal Fenyx Rising </em>sequel</a>, and of course, the company followed general industry trends by <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-sees-layoffs-amid-year-full-of-them/">laying off employees</a>. According to the earnings report, Ubisoft cut 1,700 jobs over the course of just 18 months. </p>
 <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Interestingly, Ubisoft’s back catalog seems to have been one of its most reliable streams of revenue. The report specifically calls out <em>Rainbow Six Siege </em>as being a huge boon to the company, and unsurprisingly the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise also helped grease the wheels. Hopefully that will encourage Ubisoft to reexamine its decision to revoke digital licenses for old games <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fans-are-incredibly-unhappy-about-ubisoft-revoking-licenses-and-game-files-for-the-crew-following-server-shutdown/">like it did with <em>The Crew</em></a> just last month.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">The world wasn’t exactly dying for another free-to-play shooter, but it’s still disappointing to see a game that devs worked on for years suddenly get the ax. Maybe Ubisoft was hoping to avoid <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-in-progress-skull-and-bones/">another release like <em>Skull and Bones</em></a>, while also drawing attention to its bigger upcoming releases like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and <em>XDefiant</em>.</p>

This is great news for retro gaming fans with iPhones because it can emulate a truly eye-crossing number of retro consoles once installed.</p><p>In fact, there are too many to list here. But some notable emulation cores — the actual separately developed emulation software — included in this version of RetroArch are the NEC PC Engine, Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance, Virtual Boy, Neo Geo Pocket, and even the PSP (using the same core that drives the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fppsspp-psp-emulator%2Fid6496972903">PPSSPP app</a> that went up today). You can see the list in full by clicking “more” on RetroArch’s description in its <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fretroarch%2Fid6499539433">App Store listing</a>.</p><div><figcaption><em>Just look at this glorious list of emulator cores.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screen recording: RetroArch</cite></p></div><p>Strictly speaking, RetroArch isn’t an emulator but, rather, a front end that you can drop emulator cores into. So when you want to play a game, you need to load that game’s core first (although if you try to load a game with the wrong core, it will try to suggest the proper one for you). The app also has features like online gameplay, remapping buttons or keys per emulation core or per game, fast-forward and rewind, and gyro control. </p><p>You’ll need to be on iOS / iPadOS 14.2 to run the new version of RetroArch or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24063353/could-emulators-be-great-in-the-vision-pro">own a Vision Pro</a>. It’s not available on the Mac version of the App Store, but that’s not a problem since there’s a macOS version (and versions for other operating systems as well) that you can <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms">easily download from the RetroArch website</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Update  May 15th, 2024, 3:14PM ET: </strong>Added images and more detail.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We’re just a couple of days away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-comes-to-pc-in-may">Ghost of Tsushima’s PC release date</a>, as the former PlayStation exclusive prepares to drop its Director's Cut - including its expansion and multiplayer DLC - on Steam. Having recently cleared up the question around whether you’ll need to sign in with a PSN account after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-soon-need-to-link-their-steam-accounts-to-playstation-network">the Helldivers 2 debacle</a> - yes, if you want to play the co-op mode - developers Nixxes and Sucker Punch have now revealed that the login requirement will mean multiplayer won’t work on Steam Deck.</p>

<p>The devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-wont-need-a-psn-account-to-play-ghost-of-tsushima-single-player-devs-reassure-after-helldivers-2-fallout">confirmed last week</a> that we won’t need to create or sign in with a PlayStation Network account to play Ghost of Tsushima’s single-player campaign or the Iki Island expansion, looking to seemingly quell the risk of a backlash similar to that suffered by Arrowhead after announcing a mandatory PSN login for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> (which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">later dropped</a> - and then turned into a tongue-in-cheek cape - due to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-has-received-100000-negative-reviews-since-announcing-players-must-link-steam-to-a-psn-account">the sheer shitstorm of complaints</a>).</p>
<p>A sign-in will be needed for the co-op Legends mode, which was originally released as free DLC for the PlayStation 4 game, though: and therein lies the rub. While Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut will be technically supported by the Steam Deck - at least if you’re looking to play the main game in bed/on the bus/on the toilet - its developers confirmed that it’ll appear as “Unsupported” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/">on Steam</a> due to multiplayer being unable to work as the result of the PSN integration.</p>
<p>“You may notice that Steam marks the game as 'Unsupported' for Steam Deck. This is due to the Legends co-op multiplayer mode requiring Windows to access PlayStation Network integrated features,” Nixxes and Sucker Punch explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/collection/featured/?emclan=103582791474434698&amp;emgid=4188987871078331985">blog post</a> announcing the game’s pre-load going live.</p>

<p>It’s hard to imagine that that many people would consider a portable handheld to really be the best way to play an online multiplayer mode, but it’s still frustrating to see the restriction - especially as the much-bemoaned PSN login requirement appears to be directly to blame.</p>
<p>That’s also despite one of the arguably positive features of the PSN connection - cross-play between PlayStation and PC users - only being available in a ‘beta’ form at launch, with the devs saying it’ll be functional but won’t automatically match users on different platforms to begin with. You’ll have to invite your friends to make the most of it - which is probably the best way to play Legends regardless, but not ideal if you’re flying solo and looking to hop into a game as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that all of this follows the news that Ghost of Tsushima’s PC port <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-no-longer-available-on-steam-in-almost-180-countries-due-to-psn-requirement">won’t be sold on Steam in nearly 180 countries</a> - including Japan, <em>the very country in which the game is set</em> - due to the PSN login requirement for Legends. (Helldivers 2 was similarly pulled from sale in dozens of countries, including those where PSN accounts can’t even be created.)</p>
<p>Y’know, I’m really starting to question whether forcing a separate login for PlayStation Network on top of these games is all it’s cracked up to be.</p>

For those who likely don’t understand the significance of the move, this is the <em>very </em>first gun that players would’ve picked up and fired in the tutorial of the first <em>Destiny </em>way back in 2014.</p><p>Though the Khvostov auto-rifle you picked up just outside of Old Russia was a piece of shit that most players probably scrapped as soon as they could, this iteration of it is sure to be no joke. The Khvostov 7G-0X looks mostly the same—though it now boasts the paint job of one of its ornaments from the first <em>Destiny</em> as the base appearance—but it has a new Exotic perk that makes every seventh round fired ricochet between enemies. Seeing as how auto-rifles tend to feature magazines in the mid-20s, that’s a few guaranteed ricochets per reload, which might prove handy for clearing mobs of enemies when players undoubtedly take this weapon into endgame content.</p><p>Crucially, this isn’t the first time Bungie has re-released this weapon and made it into an Exotic. The first <em>Destiny</em>’s <em>Rise of Iron </em>expansion <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.destinypedia.com/Khvostov_7G-0X&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.destinypedia.com/Khvostov_7G-0X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also featured the Khvostov 7G-0X</a></span>, which was obtainable via an Exotic quest, though that version of the gun was entirely different. It lacked an Exotic perk that gave it a unique ability, but what made the <em>Rise of Iron </em>Khvostov significant was that it was highly customizable; it had upwards of 100 possible perk combinations that made it highly malleable to any kind of gameplay, whether it was PvE or PvP.</p><p><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is (sorry) <em>shaping </em>up to be a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-story-witness-traveler-ending-1850705113&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-story-witness-traveler-ending-1850705113">huge final chapter</a></span> for the franchise’s ten-year history, and what better way to do so then by honoring the past with the very first weapon players ever used. A lot of <em>The Final Shape</em> seems to be leaning into nostalgia, considering the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-exotics-trailer-release-date-1850762166&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-exotics-trailer-release-date-1850762166">Pale Heart setting</a></span> will apparently resemble locales that players have visited before. Not to mention, Nathan Fillion is returning to <em>Destiny 2 </em>to reprise his role as the jokester Hunter, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-cayde-6-trailer-1851428894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-cayde-6-trailer-1851428894">Cayde-6</a></span>, who has been dead since 2018’s acclaimed <em>Forsaken </em>expansion. I’d wager Bungie isn’t done bringing back beloved artifacts of <em>Destiny</em>’s past as it closes the book on this arc of the series, but I guess we’ll know more once <em>The Final Shape </em>launches in a few short weeks. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game will put players into the shoes of both a shinobi and a samurai in feudal Japan. While much of Assassin's Creed Shadows will sound familiar to fans--parkour, a large open world to explore, stealth assassinations, melee combat--there are some notable changes, particularly when it comes to filling out the game's map.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In the past, these have been done via synchronization points. These points are usually atop tall buildings or towers. Traditionally, synchronizing sees the camera slowly rotate in a panoramic view of the surrounding area, before marking all nearby points of interest on the in-game map.</p><p dir="ltr">That won't be the case in Assassin's Creed Shadows. There will be no spinning panoramic views in the upcoming title when synchronizing, nor will synchronizing automatically reveal nearby points of interest. Instead, players will need to survey the area and manually highlight areas of potential interest before investigating them further once back on the ground. Synchronization points will, however, still allow for players to fast travel between them.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a small, but significant change, as synchronization points, including their stylish, slow camera pan of the surrounding area, have largely worked the same for much of the franchise's long history. Other changes in Assassin's Creed Shadows include the lack of a bird that can be used to mark enemies, though players will still have access to Eagle Vision to track nearby foes. Light sources, shadows, and the weather will also play an important role in gameplay.

The company's full-year 2023-2024 financial results stated that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Division Heartland</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was canceled as part of its "cost reduction" plan, and resources from that game will be distributed to develop the upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>XDefiant</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and upcoming Rainbow Six Projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">No other information was offered on the cancellation. The game was in development at Ubisoft's North Carolina-based branch Red Storm Entertainment. This would be the fourth project Ubisoft has publicly canceled since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-amidst-sales-slump">the beginning of 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Division Heartland</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was meant to bring the looting-and-shooting of the Division franchise to a games-as-a-service (GaaS) model. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Division 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is arguably already a "live service" game, with frequent content updates and microtransactions but players who want to jump in have to pay $40 for the base game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="No faith in the heartland">No faith in the heartland</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft had begun promoting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Division Heartland</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2023, and the game was on track to launch in 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/FwHDePlekCw?si=SdLc_B0njc_CUAfW"> promotional video from 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> showed gameplay that seemed similar to both prior games in The Division series. The major difference was that instead of being set inside a major metropolitan area, players would explore an American small town neglected in the wake of the massive pandemic that kicked off the series' story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Ubisoft says "GaaS" games are a core pillar of its business model, why was the game canceled? It's possible development wasn't proceeding as smoothly as hoped, but it's not unlikely that Ubisoft was not projecting strong revenue or monthly average users for the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Live service games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-the-heck-is-happening-with-live-service-games-">took a pounding in 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with many publishers retreating from efforts to expand their franchises on mobile devices, and experienced studios like Bungie and Epic Games seeing declines on popular titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
