            <p>
Having shot up the near-future in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, DICE and EA are using a modern-day setting with the next instalment of their military <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> series. According to EA studios group general manager and Respawn chief Vince Zampella, the new, currently untitled shooter will be one of those "back to basics" sequels that tries to rebottle the lightning of Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 - these being the "peak" Battlefield games, in Zampella's view.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
All this comes care of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">an interview with IGN</a>, who have also bagged the first piece of concept art, above. Good job, Ian Games! The artwork shows an urban riverside landscape covered in explosions, streaking missile smoke and raging wildfires. We can see helicopters and warships in the river, and the whole thing sports an orangey-dark colour scheme which, as IGN notes, recalls the key art for Battlefields 3 and 4. 
</p>
<p>
"I mean, if you look back to the peak or the pinnacle of Battlefield, it's that Battlefield 3... Battlefield 4 era where everything was modern," Zampella commented in the piece. "And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we'll see where it goes from there. But I think for me, it's that peak of Battlefield-ness is in that Battlefield 3 and 4 days. So I think it's nostalgic for players, for me, for the teams even. Those are kind of the heyday... although I would say [Battlefield] 1942 also."
</p>
<p>
The ungenerous reading here is that "getting back to the core" is marketing speak for "getting the hell away from Battlefield 2042", which has gone down poorly with players for a host of reasons ranging from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-removed-its-128-player-breakthrough-mode-but-is-still-advertising-it">its 128-player engagements being unfocused</a>, to its "specialist" system being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-will-revive-its-old-class-system-next-week">an ill-advised leap into customisable hero shooter territory</a>. It's been heavily revised and updated since its 2021 launch, but has yet to enjoy any kind of serious resurgence. In the interview, Zampella defended the work of the Battlefield 2042 team while acknowledging a few of the complaints.
</p>
<p>

"Yeah, the 128 player, did it make it more fun?" he said. "Like... doing the number for the sake of the number doesn't make any sense. We're testing everything around what's the most fun. So like you said, the maps, once they get to a certain scale, become different. It's a different play space, and I think you have to design around that. So we are designing something that is more akin to previous Battlefields. I'd rather have nice, dense, really nice, well-designed play spaces."
</p>
<p>
Battlefield has always fetishised big-team PvP, and it's always interesting to see the developers come and go about how many players is too many players. I haven't played enough to comment as regards Battlefield 2042, however. I only ever played the Xbox One version, which had some genuinely fascinating technical limitations, with sandy skyscraper maps that looked like they were made of beige packing foam.
</p>
<p>
As for Specialists, Zampella commented that: "I wasn't there for 2042. I don't know what the rationale was, but for me, it's like the team tried something new. You have to applaud that effort. Not everybody liked it, but you got to try things. It didn't work. It didn't fit. Specialist will not be coming back. So classes are kind of at the core of Battlefield, and we're going back to that."
</p>
<p>
The new Battlefield is the work of several EA studios - DICE, Motive, Ripple Effect and Need For Speed developers Criterion (a small "core group" of Criterion devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-majority-of-need-for-speed-dev-criterion-are-shifting-to-battlefield">are still working on Need For Speed</a>). Ridgeline Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefields-next-campaign-being-developed-by-halo-co-creators-new-studio">were also briefly involved</a> before they got shuttered. As Matt Jarvis (RPS in peace) reported in May, it'll be another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/next-battlefield-game-will-have-connected-multiplayer-and-single-player-offerings-made-by-series-biggest-team-yet">live service affair</a> - Zampella doesn't mention single player in the IGN chat.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the interview is mostly just paeans to those terrible furies, "the fans". Zampella mentions the importance of "expanding out and getting more players into the universe and seeing what we can do, so when you want a different experience, you don't have to leave Battlefield", which sounds like groundwork for some cross-media announcements of some kind. There's also the obligatory question about ancient rival Call Of Duty (Zampella co-founded Infinity Ward and worked on the earlier Modern Warfare games before jumping ship to launch Respawn). "We're not looking to take down Call of Duty," Zampella told IGN. "We're making something that's different and we're making something that's us. But yeah, it definitely has the possibility."
</p>
<p>
We can expect more concrete details about the new Battlefield next year. "We have a program that we're going to announce next year around getting more community in, because that's kind of the core of what we have to do - get the community back on our side, get that trust back," Zampella told IGN. "So I think we're in a really good place. Is it challenging? Of course, but it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't." 

</p>
<p>I haven't felt the urge to play Battlefield in a long while but I will always cherish the experience of being pinned down near an objective in Battlefield 3, with the combined ordnance of the entire enemy team concentrated on the top of my head. I hope the next game rediscovers a bit of that, erm, magic.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nvidia boss Jensen Huang has discussed the advantages of AI, and said it was now a key component for the advancement of graphical capabilities.
</p>
<p>
"We can't do computer graphics anymore without artificial intelligence," Huang said, speaking recently at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference (via <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4720501-nvidia-corporation-nvda-ceo-jensen-huang-presents-goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology">SeekingAlpha</a>). 
</p>
<p>
"We compute one pixel, we infer the other 32. I mean, it's incredible," Huang continued. "And so we hallucinate, if you will, the other 32, and it looks temporally stable, it looks photorealistic, and the image quality is incredible, the performance is incredible."
</p>
<p>
While the energy costs of using AI are often highlighted as one of its various downsides, Huang argued that using it to compute parts of an image was instead saving power versus creating the image directly.
</p>
<p>
"The amount of energy we save - computing one pixel takes a lot of energy," Huang added. "That's computation. Inferencing the other 32 takes very little energy, and you can do it incredibly fast."
</p>
<p>Nvidia uses AI generation in its powerful DLSS technology, which boosts performance by AI-generating additional frames. Last week, we learned more about how Sony was implementing a similar idea with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-ps5-pros-pssr-ai-upscaling-could-be-a-game-changer">PSSR AI upscaling in the freshly-unveiled PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>
AI is frequently criticised for its planet-melting energy costs, particularly in the growing usage of publicly available large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot. Still, Huang said the "productivity gains" from using these to generate code were "just incredible".
</p>
<p>
"There's not one software engineer in our company today who doesn't use code generators," Huang said. "The days of every line of code being written by software engineers, those are completely over. And the idea that every one of our software engineers would essentially have companion digital engineers working with them 24/7, that's the future. 
</p>
<p>
"The way I look at Nvidia, we have 32,000 employees. Those 32,000 employees are surrounded by hopefully 100x more digital engineers."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, Eurogamer took a deep dive into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">how AI is changing video game development forever</a>, with various companies now dabbling in its usage for artwork and coding, and even scriptwriting and voice acting - to a decidedly mixed response. Regardless, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">AI is already used by 62 percent of game development studios</a>, a Unity report has claimed, with animation its top usage case.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’</a>s Eternal War was always going to be a little out of place compared to the game’s stellar campaign and online co-op Operations. One of the major ways the game has evolved since THQ’s 2011 original is the emphasis on dynamic melee combat that rewards well-timed parries and dodges, all while gunning down waves of swarming enemies, but Eternal War is a mode with its heavily armoured foot stuck in the past.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Extended Multiplayer Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/moaWKtTq1zc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Eternal War isn’t a score chase to see who can kill the most Tyranids: it’s a small spread of PvP modes that put two teams of six players in direct opposition, the God Emperor’s elite warriors going up against their Chaos-tainted brethren. Space Marine 2 offers a trio of game modes including Annihilation, Seize Ground, and Capture &amp; Control. In Call of Duty speak, that’s Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint.</p>
<p>If you’ve spent hours Chainswording your way through Tyranids, Space Marine 2’s PvP gameplay will give you a bit of a shock. Despite being clad in Ceramite Power Armour, Space Marines are surprisingly squishy when caught in the crosshairs of their fellow superhuman soldiers and in those first few matches you’ll no doubt find yourself obliterated within seconds of entering a firefight. The TTK (time to kill) will feel jarring at first, though the more time you spend in Space Marine 2’s competitive multiplayer, the more it makes sense. It forces strategic play through cunning ambushes and tactical retreats, preventing teams from locking down areas of a map for too long.</p>


<p>Much like Operations mode, Eternal War offers six playable classes. Each has their own unique ability, weapon loadout, and armour stats with bulkier, less mobile Space Marine archetypes being tougher to kill. The abilities attached to each class aren’t quite as powerful or disruptive as ultimates are in Overwatch, but they can help turn the tables if used effectively while also giving each class their own distinct flavour. For example, the shield-wielding Bulwark can jab a Chapter Banner in the ground that restores the armour of nearby comrades, while the Assault class can unleash hell from above using their Jump Packs.</p>
<p>As you play Eternal War, you’ll level up and unlock new weapons, giving you more ways to play though – for the sake of balance – these don’t have a natural upper hand on the starter guns available. Additional customisation and appearance options are also unlocked over time, with some pretty gnarly armour sets up for grabs as well as an extensive palette of Chapter colour schemes.</p>

<p>Space Marine 2’s PvP completes a pretty stellar all-round package that, while not as flashy as the other modes, has kept us coming back match after match. There’s a tempo and simplicity, akin to multiplayer experiences like the original Gears of War and Halo, that meshes well with Eternal War’s class-based antics. However, a sparse handful of maps and cookie cutter game modes won’t be enough to keep players fixated for long – it’s a good thing that a batch of free Eternal War content is planned for season 3 in early 2025…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-adds-casual-mode-that-makes-dragonsplague-less-devastating<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Capcom has released a chunky update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-guides-tips-tricks-9422">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, which adds a number of features, including a new casual mode.</p>
<p>This casual mode has reduced inn fees and also cut the cost of Ferrystones, while players will now expend less stamina when dashing outside of battle. Also, a notable boon: when playing in casual mode, Pawns will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2s-dragonsplague-pawn-affliction-can-wipe-out-an-entire-town">recover from the dreaded Dragonsplague</a> without <em>that </em>devastating calamity occurring. This is even if a Pawn's symptoms progress to a terminal stage, Capcom said.</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition to the casual mode, Capcom has also added a number of adjustments to Dragon's Dogma 2's Vocations. For example, Capcom has increased Strength for all Fighter weapons and has reduced weight of the Archer items such as Explosive Arrow, Drenching Arrow, Tarring Arrow, and Blighting Arrow.</p>
<p>There are also a large number of fixes across the board for the player, NPCs, Pawns, enemies, quests, equipment and more. Now, players should no longer notice their leg armour stretching "unnaturally" (which I can't say ever happened to me, but kind of curious now).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Capcom noted this patch makes further fixes to issues around CPU overload in certain situations. This means frame rates in areas with a lot of NPCs bustling about, such as town centres, should be improved.</p>
<p>This Dragon's Dogma 2 update is available now across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam. You can check out the <a href="https://www.dragonsdogma.com/2/en-us/topics/update/">full patch notes via Capcom here</a>.</p>

<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 has been a hit for Capcom, with the game selling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-sells-25m-as-fixed-frame-rate-arrives">2.5m copies in under two weeks after its release</a>. Back in April, the company actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-success-boosts-capcoms-expected-profits">revised its full-year earnings forecast</a> following this success, combined with the success of its other popular releases over the last year.</p>
<p>The game is "a huge improvement over the original, and a captivating journey from beginning to end," reads Eurogamer's five star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-review">Dragon's Dogma 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is one of the already announced games set to receive a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-listed">PS5 Pro Enhanced patch upgrade</a>, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PlayStation 5 Pro makes its debut this November</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>EA has confirmed that the next Battlefield will be returning to a modern day setting, returning to the still popular themes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/10/31/battlefield-3-multiplayer-console-review/">Battlefield 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/11/04/battlefield-4-review/">Battlefield 4</a> after games that explored <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/17/battlefield-1-review/">WWI</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/13/battlefield-v-review/">WWII</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/15/battlefield-2042-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-ps4-pc/">the near future</a>. They’ve also released the first concept art for this game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">Speaking to IGN</a>, Head of Respawn &amp; Group GM for EA Studios Organization Vince Zampella said, “If you look back to the peak or the pinnacle of Battlefield, it’s that Battlefield 3… Battlefield 4 era where everything was modern. And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we’ll see where it goes from there.”</p>



<p>Battlefield 2042 had some ambitious goals to push the series forward in a number of ways. The game at launch featured huge maps aiming to cater to a new 128 player maximum game size, as well as distinct characters as a hero shooter spin on the series’ traditional class system.</p>
<p>Zampella said, “128 player, did it make it more fun? Like…doing the number for the sake of the number doesn’t make any sense. We’re testing everything around what’s the most fun. So like you said, the maps, once they get to a certain scale, become different. It’s a different play space, and I think you have to design around that. So we are designing something that is more akin to previous Battlefields.”</p>

<p>Both 128 players and characters proved to be major sticking points for fans, with the map sizes leading to even more unfocused battles, and over the course of numerous game updates, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/19/battlefield-2042-update-4-1-ditches-128-player-breakthrough-patch-notes-server-maintenance/">DICE rolled things back to supporting 64 players on map</a> and restoring a class system more in keeping with previous games. Of course, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/23/battlefield-2042-patch-notes-hovercraft-nerf-debuff-rebalance/">they also had to deal with myriad other problems and deficiencies</a>, such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/08/battlefield-2042-update-3-3-scoreboard-patch-notes-voip-in-april/">not featuring a classic score board at launch</a>.</p>
<p>With DICE having already rolled these elements back in BF2042, it makes sense that the next Battlefield has these core principles being baked in from the off.</p>
<p>One of the most important factors for Zampella is getting the fans on side again, “We have to have the core,” he says. “The core Battlefield players know what they want. They’ve been with us forever, they’ve been amazing supporters. We need to earn their trust back and get them back on our side. And then it’s expanding out and getting more players into the universe and seeing what we can do, so when you want a different experience, you don’t have to leave Battlefield. You can experience more things within the Battlefield universe. So we’re expanding the offerings that we’re giving.”</p>
<p>EA are putting a huge amount of resources behind this,&nbsp;with four studios involved – DICE, Motive, Ripple Effect, and Criterion – and EA CEO Andrew Wilson claiming it’s one of the “most ambitious projects in [EA’s] history.”</p>
<p>Sounds like Battlefield: Bad Company 3 is going to be great, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>I can dream…</p>
<p>Looking back at the launch of BF 2042, I said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/15/battlefield-2042-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-ps4-pc/">our review</a>, “There’s a good game to be found within the Battlefield 2042 and fun to be had as the spectacle of Battlefield’s signature gameplay is taken to new, more expansive heights, but it’s marred by a handful of unsuccessful gameplay design changes, hurriedly implemented features and bugs at launch.”</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> producer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has asked fans to not mod "anything offensive or inappropriate" into the PC release of the game.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/final-fantasy-16-director-naoki-yoshida-asks-that-modders-please-dont-run-amok-with-offensive-or-inappropriate-shenanigans-now-the-games-on-pc/">PC Gamer</a>, Final Fantasy 16 director Hiroshi Takai was asked about goofy mods he'd like to see in the game, but Yoshida stepped in to answer instead. And it's clear he's protective of the team's work.</p>
<p>"If we said 'It'd be great if someone made xyz', it might come across as a request, so I'll avoid mentioning any specifics here!" he said. "The only thing I will say is that we definitely don't want to say anything offensive or inappropriate, so please don't make or install anything like that."</p>

<p>Now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">Yoshida does have a particularly good relationship with Final Fantasy players</a>, but surely this comment will spur modders on further? The likes of Ifrit as a giant Shrek, voice actor Ben Starr's meme-glowing face on Clive, or Thomas the Tank Engine making an appearance absolutely anywhere was always going to happen, and fans won't want Yoshida spoiling the fun.</p>
<p>Equally, Yoshida was probably referring indirectly to some of the more serious scenes in the game that include nudity. Just, don't go there.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that Yoshida isn't a fan of mods. They're banned from MMORPG Final Fantasy 14, for instance, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-extremely-disappointed-in-final-fantasy-14-mod-use">Yoshida stated he was "extremely disappointed"</a> when in 2023 a Japanese raid team successfully beat a challenge while secretly using mods.</p>
<p>Still, the mod scene is at this point simply a part of the PC games community. And with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's multiplatform strategy</a>, we can perhaps expect more Final Fantasy mods in future.</p>
<p>Indeed, the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pc-gamers-are-already-modding-final-fantasy-7-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake on PC brought plenty of mods</a>. Eurogamer's VR expert <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/midgar-feels-real-thanks-to-this-new-vr-mod-for-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Ian Higton even tried it out in VR</a>.</p>
<p>By contrast, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> recently added official modding capabilities in its latest update, with Larian CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-is-pretty-big-says-baldurs-gate-3-director-as-over-1m-mods-are-installed-in-less-than-24-hours">Swen Vincke noting "modding is pretty big</a> - we had more than a million mods installed in less than 24 hours".</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 16 releases on PC today, following its PS5 console-exclusive release last year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Bethesda has released a deep dive video for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/starfield">Starfield</a>: Shattered Space, the first big expansion for their interstellar RPG. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/starfield-shattered-space-dlc-revealed-coming-to-xbox-and-pc-later-this-year/">Launching on 30th September</a>, the DLC will take up the dangled threads of House Va’ruun and explore a new, and rather broken, corner of space.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield: Shattered Space - Deep Dive ????" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ushbHxFtKqk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The deep dive explores the brand new, handcrafted world of Va’ruun’kai, the homeworld of House Va’ruun. This secretive faction has been conducting strange experiments in the name of their otherworldly snake god, that have broken through the boundaries of space in a completely new way. The expansion’s story takes place entirely on this world, a planet that is bathed in dark reds, blues and purple lights.</p>
<p>Their home planet and the city of Dazra (where most of the population has taken shelter) has been deeply affected by these experiments, both with the physical changes that have created pockets of low gravity, and the invasion of mysterious negative creatures, and on the political side of things, as a power vacuum in the absence of Ernasco Va’ruun leads lesser factions to scrabble and vie for control over House Va’ruun’s future.</p>
<p>The deep dive leans into the horror vibes at times, but also emphasises a shift in tone to the combat. Zero-G will be a recurring factor in battle, but Bethesda is also shifting the combat style of the enemies to push and rush towards you more, forcing you to evade and escape their reach.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/27/starfield-shattered-space-preview-getting-back-to-what-bethesda-does-best/">previewed Starfield: Shattered Space</a> back at Gamescom, with our early look at the above deep dive, saying “With the galaxy of systems and planets already generated, Bethesda’s expansions to Starfield can take on a much more hand-crafted approach. Shattered Space is the first fruits of this labour, building within this established framework to expand the universe narrative and make this a game worth revisiting.”</p>

<p>The first thing that surprised me here was how action-y the combat is. Swordplay is a simplified version of the directional slashy-draggy you’d find in a<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chivalry-2"> Chivalry 2</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance">Kingdom Come Deliverance</a>, and defense has you target your opponent’s weapon with your cursor for more effective blocks. It strikes a good balance between slapstick floppiness and tactical dueling, with a stamina bar keeping you from getting too gung-ho about it all. I immediately get the feeling I’m very bad at it.</p>
<p>I win my starting duel, then I'm thrown into a many-bastard melee in which I bravely hover around the edges, picking out hapless chumps that are already engaged with at least two of my allies so I can chop their legs off. The floppy physics really shines during limb lopping, where injured opponents will ragdoll to the floor in comic shrouds of gore. My favourite thing to do is to clumsily lob rocks at people, which you do by dropping your weapon at the end of an attack animation. About three quarters of the weapons I throw land uselessly at my feet, and I’m having the best time. Wait! This one hit! I’m doing it! I’m the best gladiator!</p>
<p>The actual management of it all, at least early on, is mainly about spending your winnings on better gear. You’ll also be trying to impress various patrons as you fight, which can affect things like payouts and story events between matches. You can also train, heal, and promote yourself for more fame bonuses to unlock better equipment. It’s all nice stuff to have, but the main draw here are the fights, which I’m looking forward to spending more time with, if only to awkwardly lob more rocks at the backs of heads. Here’s some headlines from those patch notes:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>MAJOR new content &amp; features</strong></li>
<li>New: Character Traits</li>
<li>New: over 50 random Character Traits</li>
<li>Added in-run trait rewards (Gained by winning Elite Fights and Tournaments)</li>
<li>Added Character Trait Overview panel</li>
<li>Added a Character Trait Trophy system to track your completion progress</li>
<li><strong>New: Player Weight System</strong></li>
<li>New Weight and Armor UI panel</li>
<li>Added Player Weight system</li>
<li>Added Light Weight class</li>
<li>Added Heavy Weight class</li>

<li><strong>New: Bonus Skills</strong></li>
<li>Added the concept of Bonus Skills: these allow you to go over 100 with any skill (all the way to 125)</li>
<li>Added Base and Bonus skill overview panel</li>
<li>New: item Traits: several item traits that give various Bonus Skill modifiers</li>
<li><strong>New: Features and Content</strong></li>
<li>New feature: Timeline panel, shows upcoming rare events</li>
<li>Added new Map: The City Market</li>
<li>Added new Map: The City Slums</li>
<li>New feature: Ambushes (dialog event that sends you into combat defending against bandits)</li>
<li>Added many map areas and alleys for Ambush</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Do let me know if you’ve spend much time with this one since early access launch, and how you’re getting on with it. I'd quite like to find out whether it's worth sticking with for the long haul, although I do feel it might lose a little of its charm as soon as I reach basic competency.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-asks-pc-users-to-not-go-too-far-with-mods/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy XVI launches later today on PC, around fifteen months after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its debut on PlayStation 5</a>. With every successful PC release, there's a solid chance users will create all sorts of mods, which is generally a great thing. However, a small portion of those mods may be distasteful, particularly to the game's creators.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/final-fantasy-16-director-naoki-yoshida-asks-that-modders-please-dont-run-amok-with-offensive-or-inappropriate-shenanigans-now-the-games-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to PC Gamer</a>, Final Fantasy XVI Producer Naoki Yoshida asked users to avoid making or installing mods that are offensive or inappropriate.</p>
<p><em>If we said 'It'd be great if someone made xyz,' it might come across as a request, so I'll avoid mentioning any specifics here! The only thing I will say is that we definitely don't want to see anything offensive or inappropriate, so please don't make or install anything like that.</em></p>
<p>It is unlikely that Yoshida-san's request will be fully welcomed by the entire user base, but perhaps it will help minimize the diffusion of any offensive mods.</p>
<p>Looking back at the most recent Final Fantasy games released on PC, Final Fantasy VII Remake fostered a big modding community with 1,416 mods listed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7remake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nexus</a> that were downloaded 7.6 million times. By comparison, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy XV</a> has 'only' 237 mods downloaded less than 500K times. Final Fantasy XVI sold even less than XV so far, though, so we'd wager on the modding scene being less than explosive.</p>
<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-comes-to-pc-september-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a PC demo</a> that gives you a taste of the game and, most importantly, allows you to see how it would run on your rig. If your PC is not powerful enough to get a smooth experience in Final Fantasy XVI, NVIDIA's GeForce NOW platform<a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-september-games-list-revealed-final-fantasy-xvi-age-of-mythology-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> lets you play it</a> via the cloud as long as you have a decent Internet connection.</p>
<p>NVIDIA users (including GFN subscribers) will be able to take advantage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technologies like DLSS 3, DLAA, and Reflex</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ECHOSTASIS">ECHOSTASIS</a> is the third entry in Enigma’s Studio’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> trilogy, and it’s one of the more interesting games I’ve played this year. There’s a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1558000/ECHOSTASIS/">on Steam</a>, and you should grab it if you're interested, since everything I have to say about it is going to be a spoiler of some kind. I’ll attempt a brief description below, but a lot of the fun here is discovering how all its parts fit together, and how even its more prosaic game conventions are defamiliarised through a spooky, static-drenched ensorcellment.</p>

<p>You’re thrown into the game’s opening after you’ve entered your name in a purgatorial terminal, and it immediately feels a little like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>’s Yharnam might if Sony trolled the world by releasing it not for modern PCs, but for a consumer grade PC prototype left to marinate in embalming fluid for several decades. It takes an effort just to exist in this place - exploration drains away a resource named resolve. Even moving your head to look around is costly, as if  perception itself were some exhausting act of will.</p>
<p>That’s the vibes, and what vibes they are - there’s a depth and stark beauty to the image manipulation that elevates it far above the ‘we’ll bung some scanlines and RGB manipulation on it and call it a day” you sometimes get with retro homages. The game itself is part text<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games"> adventure</a>, part <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>, and part exploration <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a>. You’ll quickly fall into a rhythm of discrete runs that have you trying to unlock shortcuts and other permanent progress points before your resolve runs dry.</p>

<figcaption>Hey! It's me! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Enigma Studio/Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To begin with, you’re helplessly at the mercy of shambling pink ghouls and floating, orb-flinging phantasms, but progress far enough in a given stage, and you’ll usually find yourself a very nice shotgun. Kill enemies, get resolve bonuses. It feels like a joke, almost. To leave you grasping for something tangible amongst clattering sideshows of disparate images and haunted mazes, and then give you little ‘+5!’ time bonuses for gibbing bad dudes with a boomstick. But it also fits into the game's whole personality: a disorientating nightmare infused with a sense of traditional adventure and optimism - and both a love letter to, and deconstruction of, familiar tropes.</p>
<p>It’s that hidden optimism - a pinprick-thin beam of natural light at the end of a twisting maze of simulacra and vaguely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soma">SOMA</a>-ish sci-fi despair - that resonated most with me here. It’s absent the post-squared irony you might typically associate with the vaporwave beach loading screens and accompanying reverb-soaked elevator muzak. The writing feels open and authentic; the mysteries worth unraveling. This aside, there’s a palpable horror tension to the almost masocore, trial-and-terror game loop that props it all up very sturdily. Usually, horror games giving me a shotgun just make me scared for what’s about to pop out. Here, I’ve never been so happy to see one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>What do you get when you mix snowboarding, arcade racing, and animals? You get Slopecrashers, and it feels like a mix of SSX and Mario Kart. Developed by byteparrot, Slopecrashers has a mix of events to play through including races, time trials, slaloms, and boss battles. On top of that each character has their own ratings for things like speed and stunts. The demo I played also showed that there a ruthless and tough snowboarding game to be found beneath the friendly exterior.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slopecrashers Summer 2024 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OxxQvqvdXEg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Slopecrashers demo, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1967270/Slopecrashers_Demo/">available on Steam</a>, is quite generous. There is the tutorial which gives you the basics, a short campaign, and an arcade mode that lets you race on the three courses that are unlocked, out of a total of seven by my count. The slopes available are Snowman Slope, Snowy Mountain, and Neon City.</p>


<p>Snowman Slope and Snowy Mountain feel pretty similar, while Neon City shows the glimpse of some of the more outlandish snowboarding locations you’ll visit, with this map having cars driving around that you can hit and the race taking place through a construction site and shopping centre. Already, I was looking out for the shortcuts that would get me ahead of my opponents, though only managed to access a couple.</p>


<p>Throughout the demo, Slopecrashers showcases a decent variety of activities to enjoy. Races can have items included or turned off, with items being weapons or boosts to help in classic kart racing fashion – fireworks to launch at opponents, balloons to lift opponents of the ground, and more. If you get caught by a balloon, there is a bit of button mashing to get free of them. Respawning back onto the track is similar too, and there are plenty of areas where you can fall of the edge.</p>
<p>The boosts include chillis and a rocket that help you speed up, but to really keep up with the pack you will need to hit the jumps and grinding bars to perform tricks, filling up your boost meter allowing you to speed up temporarily. Characters also come equipped with gliders as there are some big gaps to cross occasionally and trying to jump across will result in failure. Both boards and gliders have ratings similar to characters including speed and handling, so creating the perfect pair will be essential to success.</p>

<p>Time trials pit you against ghosts of other characters as you try to get from the start to the finish as quickly as possible, and you will really need to pay attention and be almost perfect to really reach for a gold. It appears the gold ghost knows all of the shortcuts on the tracks, and know when to boost so it will take time to challenge for that medal. &nbsp;Other events include the slalom, where you have to go weave through gates of alternating colours in an effort to keep your time down, a boost package event where you need to collect items to give boosts, and boss battles, such as where a giant snowman called Hamster is snowboarding, with your aim to get his health down before reaching the end of the course. It was very entertaining to play, as you have to juggle keeping your speed up, avoiding Hamster’s obstacles, performing tricks, and firing projectiles at him.</p>
<p>Though it’s been regularly updated by byteparrot, the Slopecrashers demo is an alpha preview of the game so there are some things that will likely be tightened up before a full release. While each character has their own handling rating, some turns do feel a bit too wide and slow, leading to you sliding off course edges. Additionally, there is one section in Neon City towards the end where you go down a large chute where the camera just spins and you cannot really get a sense of direction. The full release will have more characters, a Grand Prix mode, and both online and local multiplayer.</p>

<p>Slopecrashers does capture that feeling of arcade fun, with it’s array of animal characters, and variety of events and challenges, all of which is wrapped up in a colourful and friendly package. Underneath that is the potential of a challenging and versatile snowboarding game that could really see a casual competitive audience build up for it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-price-is-not-that-bad-says-zampella-youre-not-getting-the-same-performance-from-a-700-pc/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-price-is-not-that-bad-says-zampella-youre-not-getting-the-same-performance-from-a-700-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Vince Zampella (Head of Respawn&nbsp;<span>and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manager of the Battlefield franchise</a>) took the opportunity to discuss the recent announcement of the PS5 Pro in his interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vince-zampella-defends-the-ps5-pro-price-battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with IGN</a> about</span>&nbsp;the <a href="https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-confirms-next-battlefield-will-use-modern-setting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next Battlefield game</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of development, Zampella seems relatively indifferent to it, in the sense that it'll be another platform that can run games faster and probably allow some shiny new visual effects.</p>
<p><em>I mean, we're not out yet, so does it really help us? Not right now. Can we do cooler things on it? Sure. I guess we'll see. As we see what the adoption is, we'll see how much it really affects us. We have to make a game that runs on everything, so it'll just be like, what can we plus up on something like that, pun intended.</em></p>
<p>Zampella's thoughts on the pricing are much more interesting. The executive said that the PS5 Pro pricing, while shocking at first, ultimately makes sense.</p>
<p><em>I think it's expected, and anything that gets us better performance for the people that really love it. To me, it's an amazing thing. I was watching something on it where the price... where they look at is it the most expensive. And it really isn't. If you go back, some of the older consoles were just as expensive and probably adjusted for inflation were probably more. So it at first seemed a little shocking, but it's kind of like, it's actually not that bad. And if you get a $700 PC, you're not getting the same performance that you're getting out of it.</em></p>
<p><em>So I mean, it's a balance. Is it expensive for people? Absolutely. Not everybody will be able to afford it. Would it be better if it was cheaper? Sure. I want more people to have it. But it makes sense, really.</em></p>
<p>The console's pricing has been a hot topic ever since Sony announced the PS5 Pro last week. Fans have complained loudly against it, but analysts <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-at-700-is-for-superfans-could-sell-13-15-million-in-total-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believe</a> Sony can still achieve its goals of selling roughly the same ratio of PlayStation 5 Pro units as they did with the PS4 Pro during the last generation. Moreover, Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-like-pc-would-cost-a-fair-bit-more-says-df-rtx-4070-is-the-closest-gpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that a PC with comparable performance would cost more than the $700 Sony is asking for.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro is launching globally on November 7.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/meta-quest-3s-leak-battery-missing-port/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meta-quest-3s-leak-reveals-battery-capacity-and-missing-port.982788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/meta-quest-3s-leak-battery-missing-port/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Images of the upcoming Meta Quest 3S VR headset have leaked, revealing key details about the device. It’s not the first time Meta’s ‘more accessible’ version of the Meta Quest 3 has leaked, but this time around, we’ve got the first clear and complete images of the device.</p>



<p>From the pictures provided, it seems that the Meta Quest 3S is missing a port that has been present on every other Meta Quest VR headset.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-solution-is-needed">Another Solution is Needed</h2>



<p>If you’re used to running a headset that utilises a traditional 3.5mm audio input, you’ll be left wanting with the Meta Quest 3S. In the recently leaked images, it seems that the headset doesn’t have this port, and instead, users will need to adapt, opting for a USB-C headset that’ll negate any chances of charging the headset while using it.</p>



<p>The leaked images were <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/quest-3s-images-leak-reveal-battery-size-no-headphone-jack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first covered by UploadVR</a>, who also noted that the battery capacity of the Meta Quest 3S had been discovered. It’s a midpoint between the Quest 2 and the Quest 3, sitting at 16.7Wh, while the Quest 3 has an 18.9Wh battery and the Meta Quest Pro – the top-of-the-range device – has a 20.6Wh battery.</p>



<p>None of them is a patch on Apple Vision Pro’s 35.9Wh battery, but they’re a fraction of the price, so do with that what you will.</p>



<p>In the leaked images, we’re led to believe that the controllers for the Meta Quest 3S are the same as the Quest 3’s Touch Plus controllers, but most of the technology is comparable to the Quest 2, released back in 2020.</p>



<p>There’s a variation in the camera array on the visor of the Quest 3S, which contributes to the full-colour passthrough capabilities of the unit, and while it uses the same chipset as the Quest 3, it utilises ‘legacy’ fresnel lenses and the same panel as the Quest 2, which helps to bring the price point down.</p>



<p>It’ll be cheaper than the Quest 3, but as it’s more accessible, it’s also not <strong>as good</strong>, boasting a lower resolution but offering the same content and controllers as the Quest 3, which was released in October 2023.</p>



<p>Will the Meta Quest 3S be the headset that gets you into VR gaming?</p>

<p>Dragon’s Dogma 2 continues to be popular six months after release, and Capcom is still pumping the game with updates – including a recent patch that adds a new ‘casual mode’. The most recent major update for Dragon’s Dogma 2 promises to boost performance, tweak classes, and provide hundreds of bug fixes, per the patch notes.</p>



<p>Check out the full breakdown below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-for-the-casuals">For The Casuals</h2>



<p>The latest Dragon’s Dogma 2 update introduces a casual mode that can be switched on in the game’s settings menu. It was stressed that if you’re playing in casual mode, you’ll be unable to switch back to ‘normal mode’, and that some achievements will be locked – we’re yet to determine what they are.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2054970/view/6976727636231899159?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the patch notes</a> published by Capcom, it was revealed that casual mode will offer the following benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced inn fees for staying at an inn</li>



<li>Reduced price of Ferrystones</li>



<li>More difficult for weight carried to become “Heavy” or “Very Heavy”</li>



<li>Less Stamina expended when dashing outside of battle</li>



<li>Loss gauge will not increase when selecting “Load from Last Save” after the Arisen dies</li>



<li>Pawns will recover from dragonsplague without a “devastating calamity” occurring, even if the symptoms progress to a terminal stage</li>
</ul>



<p>The team also provided balances and tweaks for a wide array of vocations, such as increasing strength for Fighter weapons, adjusting some ability timings for Warrior, and boosting damage scaling for Archer attacks with a bow.</p>



<p>On PC, Capcom has ‘reduced the frequency of crashes’ and fixed some problems with CPU load.</p>



<p>On top of that, there are new animations, the display language setting has been updated to include Polish, and several hundred fixes and adjustments have been applied to NPCs, enemies, quests, UI, and more.</p>



<p>It’s a hefty update – is it enough to make you want to play Dragon’s Dogma 2 again <strong>or </strong>for the first time? Let us know on the Insider Gaming Forum.</p>

<p>Shattered Space is on the horizon, launching more than a year after Starfield was released to the world. In 2023, Bethesda Game Studios <strong>finally </strong>pushed Starfield out to the open market, being met with a mixed reception and some critical feedback that would come to shape the future of the ambitious space-based RPG.</p>



<p>Shattered Space is the first major expansion for Starfield, but it won’t be the last. Recently, Bethesda took a deep dive into the core gameplay mechanics centered around Shattered Space, stressing that the entire expansion unravels on a single planet.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-explore-every-nook-and-cranny">‘Explore Every Nook and Cranny’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-shattered-space-deep-dive-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent deep dive</a> published by Bethesda Game Studios, the foundational principles of Shattered Space were laid out. It was explained by BGS that the entire expansion takes place on Va’ruun’kai, the homeworld of House Va’ruun, an ‘isolationist’ society shrouded in mystery and intrigue.</p>



<p>In that, the team also confirmed that at no point does the DLC <strong>leave </strong>Va’ruun’kai:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>From the minute you arrive on Va’ruun’kai the story never sends you off planet. You’re free to leave at any time, but the story is fully centered around life on the Va’ruun home world.</p>



<p>We wanted to give you the opportunity to explore every nook and cranny of this location and find clues as to who these people really are and what happened to them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-expansion-shattered-space-never-sends-you-off-planet-bethesda-confirms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> for the quotes</em></p>



<p>Eagle-eyed users noted that the description for Shattered Space mentions that Va’ruun’kai is a ‘fully handcrafted’ location, which has filled the community with a sense of hope. One of the flaws of Starfield was that the promised ‘endless exploration’ opportunities turned out to be rinse-and-repeat caves, bases, and settlements with identical structures, layouts, and enemy positions.</p>



<p>If Va’ruun’kai has been designed from the ground up by hand, it should at least be a little more immersive and entertaining to explore.</p>



<p>Sadly, the faction element in Starfield was also underwhelming, with many players (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-one-month-later/">including myself</a>) coming away with no real sense of attachment to the factions. They weren’t memorable in the same way that the Dark Brotherhood from Elder Scrolls or the Brotherhood of Steel from Fallout are memorable, which is a shame.</p>



<p>Hopefully, Shattered Space can heal that flaw a little, as House Va’ruun is interesting enough on paper.</p>

<p>Recently, Sony unveiled the PlayStation 5 Pro, along with a hefty price tag that left many mouths agape in the wider gaming community. It’s a premium price point that floats around $700, which plenty consider ‘too much’ for a mid-gen upgrade. One notable voice that spoke out about the PS5 Pro pricing model was Respawn’s co-founder and studio head, Vince Zampella.</p>



<p>Zampella has been in the news most recently owing to his team’s involvement in the creation of the next Battlefield game. It was just yesterday that Electronic Arts lifted the lid on ‘Battlefield 6’, publishing some details and the first concept shot for the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-everybody-will-be-able-to-afford-it">‘Not Everybody Will Be Able to Afford It’</h2>



<p>Zampella’s team at Respawn is currently contributing to the development of Battlefield 6, one of the most highly anticipated games in the series thus far. It’s returning to a modern theatre of war, which is enough to have fans writhing in excitement. In the past, EA’s CEO has referred to Battlefield 6 as a ‘complete reimagining of the franchise’.</p>



<p>During a brief interview, Zampella spoke about using the power of the PS5 Pro to push the next Battlefield game as far as it can go:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re not out yet, so does it really help us? Not right now. Can we do cooler things on it? Sure. I guess we’ll see. As we see what the adoption is, we’ll see how much it really affects us. We have to make a game that runs on everything.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zampella, who was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vince-zampella-defends-the-ps5-pro-price-battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">speaking to IGN</a> at the time, defended the PS5 Pro price somewhat:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you go back, some of the older consoles were just as expensive and probably adjusted for inflation were probably more. So it at first seemed a little shocking, but it’s kind of like, it’s actually not that bad. And if you get a $700 PC, you’re not getting the same performance that you’re getting out of it.</p>



<p>It’s a balance. Is it expensive for people? Absolutely. Not everybody will be able to afford it. Would it be better if it was cheaper? Sure. I want more people to have it. But it makes sense, really.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been suggested that the PS5 Pro is being marketed mainly to PlayStation enthusiasts who simply <strong>must </strong>have the latest and greatest gaming technology. From what we’ve seen, the improvement is tangible, but is it enough to warrant a $700 price tag?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/unknown-9-awakening-preview-body-swapping-twist-on-stealth</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unknown-9-awakening-preview-%E2%80%93-a-body-swapping-twist-on-stealth.982692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/unknown-9-awakening-preview-body-swapping-twist-on-stealth<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I think of Bandai Namco games, titles like <em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> don't really come to mind first. They're like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/dark-pictures-anthology"><em>Dark Pictures Anthology</em></a> to me—known titles, but not immediately a "Bandai Namco game."</p>
<p>So I honestly didn't know what to expect with my preview of <em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em>, but after spending an hour with my hands on the controller, I was pleasantly surprised with what Reflector Entertainment is trying to do.</p>
<p>Starring Anya Chalotra, who you might know as Yennefer from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/witcher-netflix-more-game-adaptations"><em>The Witcher</em> Netflix series</a>, this ambitious game is the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-tells-first-of-many-spooky-stories">first step in a transmedia project</a>, involving comics, novels, and even a podcast series. But before we zoom out too far, is <em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> a good first step?</p>

<h2>A Story Full of Secrets</h2>
<p>As the first step in this larger story, there's a lot of worldbuilding and terminology to wrap your head around. It's a universe that blends real-world history, mythology, and conspiracy to create a unique narrative.</p>
<p>From what I could tell, a primary part of the plot involves the Fold, a parallel world that exists alongside ours that holds powerful secrets that could change the world. Our protagonist, Haroona, is a Quaestor, a chosen one who can see into and manipulate the Fold.</p>
<p>There's a larger context here involving secret societies (as you'd expect for conspiracies), but needless to say, if you're the kind of person that likes getting lost in fiction, <em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> is serving up a buffet.</p>

<p>In my hourlong demo, half of it was spent on the run in an Indian city in the late 19th century. A group called the Ascendants were looking for Haroona, and it created lots of opportunity for rooftop climbing, sneaky takedowns, and frantic chase scenes.</p>
<p>In the other half, I explored a jungle, which was crawling with enemy patrols still on the hunt for Haroona. Meanwhile, she was trying to find the location of some magic item, and an American gunslinger named Luther was trying to help her.</p>
<p>It reminded me a lot of games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/uncharted-4-thiefs-end"><em>Uncharted</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>—very narrative-driven, blockbuster-adjacent action.</p>

<h2>A Different Take on Stealth</h2>
<p>Where <em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> really set itself apart for me was the stealth-combat sequences. Between light platforming with some banter, I found myself in little arenas with enemies scattered around.</p>
<p>Haroona's ability to interact with the Fold really manifest during the gameplay here. She can go invisible for a few seconds and set off traps (read: red barrels) from afar. There's also a detective-vision mode to see enemies through walls.</p>
<p>The most interesting mechanic, however, was her ability to take over enemy bodies. This lets you control an enemy, stop time, move them freely, and even queue up one of their attacks.</p>

<p>For example, if an enemy wasn't close enough to a red barrel, I could make them walk over and smack it, leading to their untimely demise and lots of confusion. If two enemies were near an environmental pitfall, suddenly I could turn that into three.</p>
<p>This isn't a hardcore stealth game though—if you're caught, a fight breaks out, and Haroona can decently defend herself. Open combat wasn't too difficult to get ahold of, with your typical light/heavy attacks and dodges.</p>
<p>Plus, you can use your body-swapping powers during combat, opening up your options even more. I saw in the upgrade tree that I could invest in multiple body swaps too, opening the door for all sorts of elaborate setups.</p>
<p>Unlike other games, when stealth doesn't work, I didn't feel like I had to reset. Consistently, I felt like I was making choices, sometimes out of practicality, other times out of vanity. <em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> gives you lots of tools in these arenas, and it was up to me to find out how I wanted to express myself.</p>

<h2><em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> Has a Lot to Accomplish</h2>
<p>However, if the goal here is to start a larger franchise with novels and comics, <em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> (and its universe) will need more than exciting stealth combat.</p>
<p>All these fantastic factional fables about the Leap Year Society and the Ascendants are nice and all, but it's the character work that makes or breaks them for me. So far, my exposure to two major characters, Haroona and Luther, haven't moved me too much.</p>
<p>I found their banter to feel a little half-baked. Haroona's the stoic, focused one, while Luther is whimsical but definitely knows more than meets the eye. It didn't bother me, but it also didn't leave me wanting more from these characters. But to be fair, it might take more than an hourlong vertical slice to really let these characters marinate.</p>

<h2><em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Montreal-based Reflector Entertainment gave itself a tall order with its first game. It has to not only stand on its own legs, but also establish an entire transmedia franchise. While I'm hopeful the game will be a fun, serviceable adventure, it remains to be seen if I'll be hooked on some comics and novels.</p>
<p>But if I can keep forcing some schmucks to blow themselves up with red barrels, I'm pretty on board with seeing more of what the game has to offer. Luckily, it comes out soon on October 18 for PC and all consoles except the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"So I mean, it's a balance. Is it expensive for people? Absolutely. Not everybody will be able to afford it," Zampella said. "Would it be better if it was cheaper? Sure. I want more people to have it. But it makes sense, really."</p><p>As for what the PS5 Pro means for the next entry in the Battlefield series, Zampella said the team will need to wait and see. He continued on, saying that the overall adoption rate will affect what the team can do. In addition, since the next Battlefield will still have to run on the base PS5, the team will only be looking at what they can "plus up" for PS5 Pro owners.</p><p>EA hasn't announced when fans can expect the next Battlefield game, but the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/">PS5 Pro release</a> is just around the corner. While the $700 price has turned many away, anyone looking to play PS5 games at the best possible quality might still want to pick it up.</p>

            <p>
If (like me) you found developer Ironwood Studios' wonderfully weird four-wheeled survival game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> just a bit too exhausting when it launched earlier this year, now might be the time to go back: its new Drive Your Way update introduces a whole bunch of custom difficulty settings and presets to make things easier - or masochistically more difficult, if you prefer.
</p>
<p>
With Pacific Drive's new update installed, players can immediately <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1458140/view/7176011919745442295">choose from seven presets</a> enabling them to tweak the difficulty of their adventures across the Olympic Exclusion Zone. These range from the standard Pacific Drive experience to Joyride - which retains the same fundamental core but reduces gathering, crafting, and research requirements - to presets that lean hard in the other direction. Nuclear Journey, for instance, smears everything in lethal radiation, while Iron Wagon doesn't just make things tougher, it deletes your save if you fail.
</p>
<p>
However, it doesn't end there; the Drive Your Way update also makes it possible for players to create their own presets, with over 50 considerably more granular settings available - complete with tweakable value sliders for each - as detailed in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAMRq6zaE6g">video</a> below.
</p>

<p>
And given Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell called Pacific Drive a "series of cruel brutalisations" and "horrible pain" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pacific-drive-review">four star review</a>, that extra help might be appreciated.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the update, custom music can now be played from local storage on PC, bumpers and wheels are now paintable, and there are two new collectible cosmetics - an antenna topper and mirror hanger - out in the exclusion zone. Additionally, Ironwood has released the paid Anomalous Cosmetic Pack DLC, containing the Mailbox Bunny bobblehead, Sawblade hood ornament, Tourist shifter, Anchor steering wheel, Vacation sticker pack, and Anomaly decal kit.
</p>
<p>
Previously, Ironwood <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pacific-drives-four-wheeled-survival-nightmare-gets-free-update-dlc-and-2024-roadmap">revealed</a> this latest release would be the second of three updates planned for 2024. Summer brought a photo mode, new car and garage content, plus free (and paid) cosmetics - and following Pacific Drive's new autumn update, another is due this "winter". As to what it might contain, that's currently unclear, with its content only listed as "redacted".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wild-bastards-blue-manchu-fps-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I spent nearly the entire weekend playing <em>Wild Bastards</em>, a roguelike first-person shooter with some strategic elements sprinkled in. I had other things to do, and other things I had <em>meant </em>to do, like take my kids out, cut a tree down, wash my car, loads of stuff, but I did none of it, because I ended up playing <em>Wild Bastards </em>nearly the whole damn time.</p><p>If you played <em>Void Bastards</em>--the previous game from developers Blue Manchu, who by all accounts and despite their naming habits are lovely, and not bastards at all--you'll know a lot about what's up here. If not, just know that this is a bite-sized shooter where every shot you take is life-or-death. Large portions feel like <em>FTL </em>and smaller portions feel like Lucasarts' 1997 classic <em>Outlaws</em>.</p><p>Taking command of a gang of space cowboys, nearly all of whom are dead at the beginning of the game (and all of whom are cool as hell), your job is to scour the galaxy bringing each member back to life en route to reaching the fabled 'Homestead'. The crew chat between missions (and during them), have relationships you need to juggle and, most importantly, each have their own unique weapons and skills to bring to the shooting sections of the game.</p><p>Which you absolutely need to make note of, because <em>Wild Bastards</em> involves beaming teams of shooters down to the surface of planets and moving around a board game-like map, picking up perks, going shopping and fighting bad guys. When a fight is triggered, you jump from map view to FPS view, albeit very briefly; often you'll only have a handful of enemies to dispose of, and stages can last just seconds.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Wild Bastards - Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Ay2BzDEUAg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Which sounds quick and easy, and most of the time, it is! The catch is that you can only control two of your crew in a battle at a time. Remember how I said everyone has unique weapons and abilities? So do the dozens of different bad guys, so one space cowboy's weapon might be priceless in one fight and almost useless in the next.</p><p><em>Wild Bastards</em> hits every roguelike note it plays perfectly. You always feel in peril but never overwhelmed. There are always options available to you but you don't always get to use them. Sometimes you get to play as your favourite cowboy on your favourite type of stage and it's great! Other times people get hurt and tired, forcing you to use your least-favourite crew members, and you just need to make do.</p><p>What really makes it sing is the balance between all these disparate sections of the game. Normally I play these kinds of fragmented games in short bursts, a level or two then I'm out, but here one shootout blurred into another, the lure of fresh loot, cans of beans and new heroes to unlock keeping me going for hours at a time. The tension of the brief shootout levels--where damage can persist across whole planets--really does make them feel like...shootouts, where every shot counts and you've gotta be quick on the draw.</p><p>You know that joy you feel when a game you love is frictionless? When one idea blends into another, one system interlocks as perfectly with another as a Swiss watch, and you find yourself simply gliding through an entire video game? <em>Wild Bastards</em> made me feel that. I can talk about its parts all day, they're all good, but the real juice here is the sum of them.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/should-i-use-streamlabs-or-obs-for-streaming/</link>

<p>One of the biggest questions when beginning your streaming journey is whether or not you should you Streamlabs OBS or regular OBS. Both basically do the same thing in the end, but there are still a lot of different aspects that you may want to take into mind before choosing which one to start with.</p>



<p>So, which streaming software should you use? Streamlabs OBS or OBS?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-which-streaming-software-should-you-use-streamlabs-or-obs">Which Streaming Software Should You use? Streamlabs or OBS?</h2>



<p>It can be daunting when trying to choose what streaming software works best for you. While Streamlabs and OBS are two of the most popular softwares out there, there are plenty of options too that may make the decision-making even more difficult.</p>



<p>Well, Insider Gaming is here to give you some insight into what streaming software you should be using.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It is highly recommended to start out using Streamlabs OBS when streaming on Twitch, Kick, YouTube and other platforms. In fact, once you start with Streamlabs, you will probably never want to stop using it. Here is why.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-reasons-why-streamlabs-is-better-than-obs">Reasons Why Streamlabs is Better than OBS</h2>



<p>There are quite a few reasons as to why Streamlabs OBS is better than regular OBS. Sure, OBS was the first software out there to allow people to stream on Twitch and other sites, but it is incredibly outdated. </p>



<h4 id="h-reasons-why-you-should-stream-on-streamlabs">Reasons Why You Should Stream on Streamlabs:</h4>



<ul>
<li>User-friendly</li>



<li>Multiple presets</li>



<li>Has a paid subscription</li>



<li>Multi-stream</li>
</ul>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-user-friendly">User-Friendly</h2>



<p>To start out, Streamlabs OBS is incredibly user-friendly. Regular OBS is meant more for those who know how to start from scratch. Streamlabs really feels like it walks streamers through its interface, making it an incredibly smooth process to use.</p>



<p>While many of the settings are the same on both softwares, Streamlabs makes it much easier to understand everything you are looking at. It is great for those who are new to the streaming world and still just as good for those who are veterans.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-multiple-presets">Multiple Presets</h2>



<p>The fact that Streamlabs OBS has various FREE presets for users to choose from is a big reason why the software is much better than OBS. With OBS, you either have to hire someone to create designs for you or do it yourself.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Teenage gaming streamer playing video game in his room</figcaption></figure>







<p>With Streamlabs, you can choose from multiple different presets, decorating the look of your stream and more. These presets include Starting Soon Screens, Notifications (sounds and more), Layouts and more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-paid-subscription">Paid Subscription</h2>



<p>While many of the presets are free, Streamlabs also has a paid subscription that gives you access to thousands of presets and more. The subscription also gives users free editing tools, clipping parts of your stream and turning them into viral videos for you to post on TikTok, YouTube and more.</p>



<p>While it may be $19.99 USD a month, the paid subscription is definitely worth it for those looking to really amp up their stream. You can also multi-stream when using the paid version of Streamlabs OBS, allowing you to stream to Twitch, YouTube, TikTok and other platforms at the same time.</p>



<p>Overall, Streamlabs OBS is the definite pick for being a better streaming software. Will you be using it?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vince-zampella-confirms-next-battlefield-will-use-modern-setting.982638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-confirms-next-battlefield-will-use-modern-setting/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just before EA's Investor Day, EA revealed new details on the upcoming untitled <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-entry-dev-team-biggest-ever-dragon-age-2024/">Battlefield game</a> with some new concept art. This concept art was revealed exclusively to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>, and it was also confirmed that Battlefield will instead be coming to a modern setting after previous games took place in World War I and World War II.</p>
<p>At the moment, EA hasn't given too many specifics about where the game will take place and has declined to name what city it will take place in, but the concept art seems to suggest that it takes place somewhere in Europe. The game may be set somewhere like Italy or France, but right now, it's uncertain.</p>
<p>Looking at the concept art, it seems that ship-to-ship and helicopter combat will also be part of the new untitled Battlefield game, with natural disasters being a feature. The concept art shown off seems very similar to Battlefield 4 in terms of color scheme, an incredibly popular game.</p>
<p>This new game seems to be returning to basics for the upcoming Battlefield. In a discussion with Zampella, he spoke about his return to the modern era. "I mean, if you look back to the peak or the pinnacle of Battlefield, it's that Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4 era where everything was modern. And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we'll see where it goes from there." In this conversation, it seems that Zampella has a lot of nostalgia for Battlefields 3 and 4 but also feels some love and nostalgia for 1942.</p>
<p>By returning to the modern setting, it seems as if they are trying to correct the course of the franchise after Battlefield 2042. This game wasn't particularly well revered at first but was eventually enjoyed by many. However, Battlefield 2042 was rather different and felt more like a hero shooter, especially with the 128-player maps that were incredibly ambitious and unpopular with fans.</p>
<p>The Battlefield developers have a lot planned but are currently keeping their plans under wraps. "We have a program that we're going to announce next year around getting more community in because that's the core of what we have to do—get the community back on our side, get that trust back."</p>
<p>Once Battlefield is released, it'll be a huge test of whether the community trusts them to do the right thing with this game or whether they feel it isn't as successful as previous games. With Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 being released soon, they have a lot of competition to go up against, and it'll be interesting to see what further details are released about the upcoming Battlefield game.</p>

        <p>"I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
EA has shared early first details for the next instalment in its Battlefield series, confirming the multiplayer shooter will be returning to the modern era for its next outing, and that the unpopular Specialists system has been jettisoned for good in favour of more traditional classes.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Respawn head and Battlefield boss Vince Zampella who, in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">conversation with IGN</a>, teased a back-to-basics approach for the series' next outing following 2021's poorly received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. That starts with a return to the modern era, with Zampella explaining, "If you look back to the peak or the pinnacle of Battlefield, it's that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-3">Battlefield 3</a>... <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-4">Battlefield 4</a> era where everything was modern. And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we'll see where it goes from there."
</p>
<p>
Beyond the setting, Zampella hints the still-unnamed next Battlefield may ditch 2042's sprawling 128-player maps in favour of more focused matches. "Did [128 players] make it more fun?," he posits. "Doing the number for the sake of the number doesn't make any sense. We're testing everything around what's the most fun... The maps, once they get to a certain scale, become different... So we are designing something that is more akin to previous Battlefields. I'd rather have nice, dense, really nice, well-designed play spaces."

<p>
Unsurprisingly, given the system's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-overhauls-specialists-with-new-class-like-system">eventual removal</a> from Battlefield 2042, Specialists also won't be returning, with EA having this time opted for a more traditional class-based system. "It didn't work. It didn't fit," explains Zampella. "Specialist will not be coming back. So classes are kind of at the core of Battlefield, and we're going back to that".
</p>
<p>
Battlefield 2042's launch in 2021 was, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-2042s-disastrous-launch-what-next-for-battlefield">plagued with issues</a>, ranging from technical woes to questionable gameplay decisions, leading former Eurogamer editor-in-chief Martin Robison to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-review-dices-magic-fps-formula-gets-spread-too-thin">call it</a> "the weakest Battlefield in some time". Players apparently agreed, and it didn't take long for Battlefield 2042 to become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-is-now-one-of-steams-worst-reviewed-games-of-all-time">one of Steam's most negatively-reviewed games</a> of all time. The following February, 2042 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">officially declared a flop</a> as EA boss Andrew Wilson admitted it "did not meet expectations", and player numbers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-steam-concurrent-players-fall-below-1000-for-first-time">dwindled</a>, despite the publisher's best efforts to keep it afloat with sweeping changes to its core systems.

<p>
Zampella understandably hopes to avoid a similar fate for the next Battlefield, saying, "We want it to be good out of the gate." And to achieve that, there've been major changes to the series' development. Senior figures have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-creative-director-lars-gustavsson-leaving-dice-after-more-than-20-years">departed</a>, and EA has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-rethinking-battlefield-development-process-from-the-ground-up">rethought</a> development "from the ground up" - more recently saying it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-amassing-largest-battlefield-team-in-franchise-history-to-double-down-on-live-service-multiplayer">now amassed</a> its "largest Battlefield team in franchise history", with EA Motive, DICE, Criterion, and Ripple Effect all pitching in.
</p>
<p>
Alongside today's teases, EA has released a single bit of concept art (above) to spark imaginations. And while there's currently no release date for the new Battlefield, it sounds like the publisher wants to get players in early. "We have a program that we're going to announce next year around getting more community in," Zampella explains, "because that's kind of the core of what we have to do — get the community back on our side, get that trust back. So I think we're in a really good place. Is it challenging? Of course, but it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't."

One big question the PS5 Pro is facing is what it'll mean for big games releasing in the latter part of the generation, including EA's untitled Battlefield game.</p><p>Asked for his thoughts on the new console, Head of Respawn &amp; Group GM for EA Studios Organization Vince Zampella took a wait and see stance on Sony's new console.</p><p>"I mean, we're not out yet, so does it really help us? Not right now. Can we do cooler things on it? Sure. I guess we'll see. As we see what the adoption is, we'll see how much it really affects us. We have to make a game that runs on everything, so it'll just be like, what can we plus up on something like that, pun intended," Zampella said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While comparatively little is known about the new Battlefield, it's apt to be kind of game that pushes the capabilities of the PS5 Pro. EA DICE has long used the Battlefield series as a technical showcase for the Frostbite Engine, pushing advanced effects, environmental destruction, and more. The initial concept art, which you can see below, hints at what fans might be able to expect from the new release.</p><p>As for the price, which has generated a considerable amount of discourse among fans and in the media, Zampella called it a "balance."</p><p>"I mean, I think it's expected and anything that gets us better performance for the people that really love it. To me, it's an amazing thing. I was watching something on it where the price... where they look at is it the most expensive. And it really isn't," he said. "If you go back, some of the older consoles were just as expensive and probably adjusted for inflation were probably more. So it at first seemed a little shocking, but it's kind of like, it's actually not that bad. And if you get a $700 PC, you're not getting the same performance that you're getting out of it."</p><p>He continued, "So I mean, it's a balance. Is it expensive for people? Absolutely. Not everybody will be able to afford it. Would it be better if it was cheaper? Sure. I want more people to have it. But it makes sense, really."</p><p>The PS5 Pro has been debated heavily since being revealed last week, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/internet-reacts-to-ps5-pro-700-price-point-with-shock">fans</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-at-700-lack-of-competition-made-it-an-easier-decision-for-sony-to-run-with-a-higher-price">analysts</a>, and Game Awards founder <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1833893956582617293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geoff Keighley</a> all weighing in. An unscientific poll conducted by IGN showed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/polls-ps5-pro-price-reveal">only about 10 percent of respondents</a> were planning to pick up the mid-gen refresh, with most considering it too expensive. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/13/bf-ca-1726271105698.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The new Battlefield is apt to be the kind of technical showcase that pushes the PS5 Pro's capabilities. Image source: EA.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In arguing that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-700-ps5-pro-is-too-much-for-too-little">PS5 Pro is too much for too little</a>, IGN's Brian Altano argued, "Then, of course, there’s the serious hardcore aficionados who want their games to look incredible on their huge OLED TVs and high end gaming monitors. There will always be a place for people like that — myself included — but it’s hard to see if we’re a big enough audience to justify making and selling a $700 PS5 Pro four years after buying a PS5 during a console generation that hasn’t really found its footing yet."</p><p>One way or another, the PS5 Pro will be out on November 7, and you can find our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-game-enhanced-for-ps5-pro">list of enhanced games right here</a>.</p><p>As for Zampella, he talked to IGN about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">the future of Battlefield in an exclusive interview</a> in which he also confirmed that it will return to a modern setting.
