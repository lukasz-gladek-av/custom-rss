		<p>Treyarch have posted a video explaining the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Endgame content, and the short answer is “a lot.”</p>
<p>Once you have finished the main campaign, the entire Avalon map unlocks for 32-player PvE epilogue with new gamplay, and new intel. You can bring teammates into Endgame even if they have not completed the campaign themselves. You will play as either a character from the campaign or an entirely new combatant of your own making with unique abilities.</p>


<p>Black Ops 7 Endgame has four zones of difficulty and the map features landmarks and features from many older COD games, including Black Ops 2, Black Ops 4, and Black Ops 6. As you fight your combat rating will increase and at certain points you will be given the option to pick a new skill.</p>

<p>Recently the file size for the game has been revealed. The back of the physical box states the game requires 166GB, but a report from PlayStation Game Size, who dig about in the back end of the PSN, reveals that the main game is 96.677 GB, with the co-op campaign adding 15.594 GB and Warzone an additional 19.734 GB. There is no mention of Zombies, which may be part of the main file or an additional download that has yet to be listed.</p>

<p>The Xbox download size has not been revealed, but PC gamers are going to need a minimum of 116GB. By comparison, the rather good Arc Raiders is 16Gb on PlayStation 5.</p>

			<p>Almost every quest in The Outer Worlds 2 can be approached in different ways. You can talk your way into and out of situations, you can sneak around your enemies, or hack a computer to gain access to some secret information that gets you in or just opens a door that ought to be locked. There's rarely a quest that can only really be completed one way. The 'In Pursuit of Purloined Propaganda' quest, however, is one of those rare quests.</p>



<p>All it has you do is run around and find a few magazines. Well, more than a few, which is why this guide will help you find them all as quickly as possible so you can get back to the regular, more fun kind of adventuring that The Outer Worlds 2 is chock-full of.</p>



<p>That said, it's still worth your time running around to find all these magazines, especially if you're still in the early stages of your playthrough. It'll take you to far corners of the opening planet, Paradise, and unlock some key fast travel points along the way that can make future quests easier to complete.</p>

<h3 id="h-finding-redactor-quesnel">Finding Redactor Quesnel</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Redactor Quesnel in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To get this quest started, you'll have to find Redactor Quesnel and speak to her. You'll find her on her porch at her house just west of Fairfield, as shown on the map below.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Where to find Redactor Quesnel in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speak to her, and agree to help her find copies of the Science Adventures Quarterly, 'Featuring Commander Zane and Buddy and other Sensationalistic Space Stories.' Once you've agreed to the quest, she'll stay on her porch, so take the chance of her being outside her house to walk in and rob her of a few Bit Catridges and other resources scattered in her house. It's not much, but to not steal from her would be to go against one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/the-outer-worlds-2-tips-and-tricks-guide/">key things to know about playing The Outer Worlds 2: Always be Looting</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-finding-all-ten-science-adventure-magazines">Finding All Ten Science Adventure Magazines</h3>



<p>There are ten magazines to find in total, but you'll want to return to Redactor Quesnel after finding at least one. You'll gain some XP, some bits, and be sent back on your way. When you have another four, return to her again for more XP, bits, and a Pitchball Card that gives you a damage upgrade. </p>



<p>Return to her when you have the final five, and you'll get the full rewards of a Townie Clothing set and a bunch more XP.</p>



<p>Here's where to find each of the magazine issues, though not in order from one to ten, but rather in an order that I believe is the fastest way to find them all, starting from Redactor Quesnel's house.</p>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #5</strong> - You'll find this one just north of where Redactor Quesnel's home is, so it's an easy trod up the road to grab your first issue. It also makes it easy to grab it and head back to her for your first reward.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure>
<figure><figcaption><em>You'll find issue #5 in this house.</em></figcaption></figure>

</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #3 - </strong>Assuming you're following this guide to the letter, the next one to grab is the third issue, northwest of Redactor Quesnel's home. Simple directions to it would be to head north to where you found issue #5, then turn directly west. You'll find it on a table outside of a house with a malfunctioning door, which you can open if you have the right skills.</p>


<figure>

<figure><figcaption><em>You'll find issue #3 outside of a house with a broken door.</em></figcaption></figure>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #8 - </strong>From where you found issue #3, head as directly south as you can to find issue #8 on the coastline. You'll find it in a room on the second floor of the tower, though be warned that you'll likely have to deal with a few crabbles to grab it. There's also a safe and a bunch of loot behind a door you can pick the lock of on the first floor, if you have the right skills for it.</p>

					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #6 - </strong>Once you've grabbed issue #8, fast travel back to Fairfield. From there, head east along the coastline, and you'll find issue #6 in a fisherman's hut on a bed, with two fishermen working outside. Inside the hut, you'll also find an Advanced Decryption Key, so be sure not to miss that.</p>


<figure>

</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #2 - </strong>After finding issue #6, fast travel back to where you found issue #8 at the Crabble Tower. From there, follow the coastline all the way south, past the Mysterious Cave where you can stop and fight the Skeleton Crabble if you like, and head to the most southern point on the map.</p>



<p>You'll find issue #2 on a porch, outside of a sealed house. You will have to jump over the railing to get to it, though, where you'll find it on a table beside a couple of other resources.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #9 - </strong>If you've not yet completed the Perilous Journey to the Grove quest, then you've probably not gone up the cliff where the lift is, just west of where you'll find the fast travel point for Fairfield on the map. If you've fixed the lift (which you can do by having an Engineer level of three or higher), then just head up the lift and to the point on the map below. </p>



<p>If you don't have an Engineer skill of level three or higher, then there's a quick way to hop up the cliff. Look to the left of where the controls are to fix the lift, and you'll see a ramp leading up some boxes. Jump on the boxes, use them to jump onto the roof to your right, and use that to jump on to the cliff, so you can walk up to where the lift is stuck halfway down, jump across, and up to the top.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure>
<figure><figcaption><em>Head to the lift here, just west of the fast travel point for Fairfield.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>If you can't repair the lift at the control box on the right, use this ramp to go up the boxes and to the roof above you.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>From there, jump onto the side of the cliff, and use the broken lift to get across and up on the other side.</em></figcaption></figure>

<div>
				    		
				    		
					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Once you're at the top, however you've gotten there, head to the point on the map below. You'll find issue #9 in a building that's also a raptidon ambush trap. Once you open the door, you'll be ambushed by raptidons, so be prepared for that. After you've cleared them out, you'll find issue #9 on a bed in the house.</p>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #1</strong> - Getting to this issue is arguably the biggest trek you'll have to make if you've not already been out this way. If you've visited Westport already, then you can just fast-travel to it and head to the point on the map. If not, then starting from Fairfield, follow the tracks as far east as they'll go, and then turn north. You'll find issue #1 in a house defended by some large crabbles, so be prepared to either fight them or sneak around them.</p>

					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #4 - </strong>Even though you'll have seven out of ten magazine issues at this point, this is a sort of halfway point for the quest because the rest of the magazines, including issue #4, are found across the bridge that is guarded by the Protectorate, the same bridge you have to cross to get to the Vox Relay.</p>



<p>Whichever way you get to the Vox Relay is up to you. You can try storming the gates with other Auntie's Choice forces, you can agree to do something for the guard at the bridge that you'll get you across, you can try sneaking across. Once you're across, you can head east to the point on the map below, where you'll find magazine issue #4 at another fisherman's hut on a table along the coast.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure>
<figure><figcaption><em>You'll find issue #4 here, at this fisherman's hut along the coast.</em></figcaption></figure>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #7</strong> - Thankfully, issue #7 and issue #10 are close by to each other, making the last two pick-ups easy before heading back to Redactor Quesnel. In as straight a line as you can, head almost exactly northwest from where you find issue #4. That will lead you to the building where you'll find issue #7, as shown on the map below.</p>



<p>Fair warning, the small hut where you'll find issue #7 is inside a Protectorate-controlled farm, so you'll have to deal with those forces or sneak around them to get the magazine. Thankfully, neither option should give you much trouble.</p>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #10 - </strong>Head slightly northwest from where you found issue #7, and you'll find one final fisherman's hut along the shoreline, and just outside of the hut, on a table, is issue #10 and the final magazine needed to complete the quest. </p>



<p>Be warned though, you'll likely happen upon a group of Crabble and Raptidon's fighting, so you'll have to clear them away before you can grab the magazine.</p>

<h3 id="h-return-to-redactor-quesnel">Return to Redactor Quesnel</h3>



<p>Once you've found the remaining magazines and have collected all ten, return to Redactor Quesnel for a final time to receive the full rewards for the quest.</p>

            <p>
I am sure that, if I were a porter of any kind in the material world, I would find an exoskeleton quite helpful. Probably, anyway, I might also be too afraid that one would crush my bones, or fuse to my body in a horrendous accident that results in the government stealing me away to send me on top secret missions thanks to my strong part-robot body. None of that happened when I used an exoskeleton in both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> games, it was actually quite a useful thing to do. And now, apparently, I can try out what the experience of what using one is like, free of my silly little bits, with an - I kid you not - officially licensed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> exoskeleton.
</p>
<p>
I know, I know, that one isn't on PC yet! You and I both know it'll come this way eventually, and the first one is, and I just needed to write about this ridiculous piece of merchandise that surely spells out the death of capitalism, and so this is my justification, alright? Anyway! The <a href="https://dnsys.ai/pages/z1-exoskeleton-death-stranding2">official Death Stranding 2 exoskeleton</a> comes from a company called Dnsys which makes, well, exoskeletons.

<p>
It is apparently made in collaboration with Kojima Productions, and specifically co-designed with art director Yoji Shinkawa. The store page for it notes that it is the "first collaboration between the game developer and the exoskeleton manufacturer," a point that I don't think needed pointing out at all, and also raises several questions we won't get into right now.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what it actually does, it "extends hiking range by 15.5 miles, and vertical climbing by 9.3 miles," it offers 50% extra power to your steps (whatever that means) and knee pressure relief, can make you feel up to 44 pounds lighter, can adapt to all kinds of terrain, and lasts up to four hours of continuous use. Oh, and it has some fancy lights which look like the ones on the game's exoskeletons.

Right now there's no price attached to this thing, but I'm betting on it being expensive. A different model from the company that isn't themed after a video game (how boring, right?) will apparently cost $1500 when it launches, so you're looking at around that minimum, though likely more.
</p>
<p>
Truthfully, this just feels like the kind of thing a superfan would buy and perhaps use once for a Halloween costume only to put it back in its box and stuff it in the attic. I admit it does have a potentially useful purpose, that purpose just feels diminished by its luxury goods status. It just leaves me wondering where merchandise can go from here. Will Kojima try to flog an actual baby in a pod? Perhaps Labubu style in mystery boxes! I pray we never evolve into such a world.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/phasmophobia/" data-ref-id="5000-509328">Phasmophobia</a> first exploded onto the scene during the pandemic. The co-op ghost-hunting and investigation game was a hit when many people were spending more time at home but still seeking social experiences, and it's continued to grow and evolve in the years since. Its latest major update adds Nell's Diner, an Americana-infused map that pairs a desolate stretch of highway out front with an eerily familiar greasy-spoon setup inside. I recently took an early tour of the diner, and I was delighted to see how it hints at the future of what is surely one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-multiplayer-horror-games/2900-7149/" data-ref-id="2900-7149">best multiplayer horror games</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Nell's Diner, Phasmophobia art director Corey Dixon told me, is full of unique assets, many more interaction points than a typical map in the game, and several Easter eggs. Back when the game was developed by a single person, Daniel Knight, his expertise was in programming, not things like art direction, which is why today Phasmophobia still mostly uses some generic assets for things like furnishings, vehicles, and even the feared ghosts themselves. But as Phasmophobia turns a corner and heads toward its exit from 1.0, the team is looking to overhaul its visual identity. That's been the thinking behind recent map makeovers like the run-down Grafton Farmhouse or its more lavish cousin, the Bleasdale Farmhouse.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_z3_9n4YtU" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I_z3_9n4YtU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In the future, this also means things like character models are getting a re-do and a cosmetics shop is on the way, but before any of that comes Nell's Diner, a brand-new map that looks quite unlike anything else in the game. Out front, the neon sign hazily buzzes through the fog, luring passersby who might've pulled off the road amid a tiring trip. When ghost investigators in Phasmophobia arrive on the scene, it'll be after <em>something</em> has gone on, which Dixon said is intentionally left for players to determine. A police vehicle is left out front with its lights still spinning, and indoors, some kind of ruckus has clearly occurred, with stools overturned and the kitchen left in a messy state.</p><p dir="ltr">Things like the cash register, various cooking supplies such as a mixer, a whipped cream dispenser, a functioning TV that plays a John Denver movie, and a classic-looking jukebox by the front door all give off a distinctly different feel from places like the residential Tanglewood Drive or the decrepit Sunny Meadows asylum. For one, they're all interactable; in some cases, they do one thing when players toy with them and another when a ghost does. But they're also bespoke assets chosen for the diner map. No longer is the team relying on asset packs from webshops that could turn up in other games--which, I'd add, helps Phasmophobia stand above its many copycats. It's more colorful, and because of the divide between customer and employee, it displays a few looks depending on where you are in the building.</p><p dir="ltr">Though no timeline is ready for sharing, Dixon told me the team would like to one day rework all the old maps with a similar eye to how they tackled the two farmhouses: major visual overhauls with some added focus on remapping the space when gameplay reasons call for it. They want the maps to feel lived in and genuine, not something too video gamey. In the diner, this manifests as the team including a hiding space that amounts to tucking behind a vending machine that's been pulled away from the wall for repairs.</p><p dir="ltr">The team is also giving more attention to its lore, especially now that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-movie-coming-from-blumhouse-to-haunt-theaters/1100-6532047/" data-ref-id="1100-6532047">Phasmophobia movie is on the way</a>. Dixon told me that Kinetic Games has decided to make lore a focal point as of late.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've got a backstory that we're hoping to weave into the game in subtle ways--in Easter eggs for certain ghosts, and even hints about the company the ghost hunters themselves are working for. Some of the maps may take on additional meaning and significance, too." He added that, across the whole game, there's "more going on than it seems on the surface." Some of those Easter eggs are to be discovered on the Nell's Diner map, Dixon said. "We’re sure it won’t take players long to figure out where to look, and when they do, they’ll love the surprises that are in store."</p><p dir="ltr">We played three rounds on Nell's Diner, giving me a firsthand look at things like its manager's office, multiple arcade cabinets showing off clever in-universe video games, the walk-in freezer with its persistent cold temperatures acting as a red herring ready to fool any newcomer into thinking they've found some evidence of ghost activity, and several looping opportunities, including the interior itself basically being a big loop. It features doors on either end of the customer area leading to the employees-only section out back. I asked if Nell's Diner has any secrets for players to find, and though Dixon didn't want to spoil anything so openly, he did confirm a keen eye will be rewarded.</p><p dir="ltr">For players who love maps like Tanglewood and other residences, Nell's Diner offers a space similar in size but aesthetically unlike anything to date. It's a "small" map, according to the dev team's own designation, and though it's certainly a fair label compared to the game's more expansive settings, it does well to illustrate the big plans the team has for the future of Phasmophobia.</p><p dir="ltr">Nell's Diner launches soon in Phasmophobia, as part of a free update on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

It also shows one of the mission types and abilities players can expect to play in Black Ops 7's post-campaign content. Here is everything players need to know about how to unlock and play the campaign's endgame.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inK3eFlCIu4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/inK3eFlCIu4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch confirmed there are a total of 11 campaign missions, and there will be a conclusion to the story, but completion of the story unlocks a twelfth mission as "endgame content." This is designed to add replayability and post-launch story to Black Ops 7's campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">The endgame grants access to Black Ops 7's full Avalon map. This allows for open-world gameplay with up to 32 players dropping into PvE matches inspired by Modern Warfare 2's DMZ mode and Modern Warfare 3's Zombies mode.</p><p dir="ltr">The endgame can be played solo or in a squad of up to four players. Treyarch confirmed that only one player needs to beat the campaign to earn access to the content, and they can be the party host and invite others who haven't completed the campaign yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can choose one of the main characters from the Black Ops 7 campaign or select a completely different operator to customize. Players can customize their operator in the endgame with the skills and abilities featured in the campaign, such as grappling hooks and the cloaking ability of Active Camo. There are also unique abilities featured in endgame. In the video, Treyarch design director Kevin Drew discussed the endgame's Shadow Break ability, which allows the player to create an area-of-effect blast that warps nearby enemies into the sky and kills them. Players can combine the abilities with other tech and gear to create unique moments in the endgame.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4599924-bo7-endgame-004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599924" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4599924-bo7-endgame-004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599924"></a><figcaption>Endgame character customization</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4599924-bo7-endgame-004.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Avalon map includes several points of interest from the Black Ops 7 campaign, as well as locations from Black Ops 2, Black Ops 4, and last year's Black Ops 6. The map features areas with four tiers of difficulty, and players will need to level up and progress to become powerful enough to fight through the higher-tier zones of Avalon.</p><p dir="ltr">Similar to extraction shooters, the endgame is designed around high-risk and high-reward missions, and players will need to survive and successfully exfiltrate from Avalon at the end of a session. If a player dies, they lose everything and will need to start over.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the first time Call of Duty is launching a game with full progression, as endgame allows players to level up, earn unique camos, and make battle pass progression all while playing the game's campaign content.</p><p>Treyarch's recent Dev Talk video discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-highly-requested-changes-to-aim-assist-perks-and-movement/1100-6535601/">multiplayer changes players can expect at launch</a>, including adjustments to the game's movement, aim assist, and perks.

                <p>Three years after releasing in the West, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> is finally coming to China on December 12, but not without some noticeable visual changes that make Blizzard's ARPG less bloody and horrific than usual.</p><p dir="ltr">The game finally received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-release-in-a-new-massive-market-soon/1100-6533422/" data-ref-id="1100-6533422">approval</a> from China's National Press and Publication Administration earlier this year, and will now officially launch in December with a free trial and some unique cosmetics for those who pre-register. In order to launch in China, Blizzard has had to make some changes to the dark fantasy world of Sanctuary in order to abide by Chinese government regulations regarding the depiction of skeletons and blood.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering Diablo 4 is filled to the brim with blood, gore, and bones (including an entire Necromancer class that summons skeleton armies), Blizzard had its work cut out for it. Players in China are now beginning to participate in the game's beta, in the process revealing some of the creative solutions Blizzard has come up with in order to release Diablo 4 in the region.</p><p dir="ltr">As highlighted by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/diablo-4s-chinese-servers-will-have-some-cosmetic-differences-for-players-379189" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, blood in the Chinese version of Diablo 4 is instead depicted as a brown-orange mist that comes out of enemies when hit. For a game where massive groups of enemies explode in a cloud of red, having what looks like dust burst out from enemies instead is definitely a major difference that is noticeable from the game's opening moments.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4599928-diablo4wanderingdeathchina.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599928" data-ratio="0.76640625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4599928-diablo4wanderingdeathchina.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599928"></a><figcaption>Diablo 4's Wandering Death world boss looks a bit different in China (via Wowhead).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4599928-diablo4wanderingdeathchina.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While we don't yet know how Blizzard reimagined Necromancers' skeletal minions, one prominent skeleton enemy, the Wandering Death world boss, may offer a clue. Instead of a colossal-skeleton spirit, the Chinese version of Wandering Death is a giant collection of rocks that Western players would have a hard time guessing is even the same enemy. It remains to be seen if Blizzard has taken a similar rock approach to all skeletons in the game, but it certainly makes for a much different vibe.</p><p dir="ltr">Even some ability icons have been changed. The Rogue ability Penetrating Shot, which in the Western version of Diablo 4 uses an icon depicting an arrow passing through two skulls, is similar in the Chinese version but somehow more unsettling. Instead of skulls, the Chinese ability icon depicts two creepy masks skewered by an arrow.</p><p dir="ltr">There will no doubt be plenty other noticeable differences once the game is out in full. However, all the changes are expected to be cosmetic only, with the game playing the same as it currently does in all regions.</p><p dir="ltr">In the West, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-11-might-be-its-biggest-rework-yet/1100-6535476/" data-ref-id="1100-6535476">Diablo 4 Season 11</a> will launch on December 9, just a few days before the game's arrival in China. Season 11 will bring updates both big and small to the ARPG, including major changes to systems like Masterworking and Tempering as well as smaller quality-of-life tweaks like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-11-will-finally-unlock-waypoints-from-the-start/1100-6536097/" data-ref-id="1100-6536097">Waypoints being unlocked from the start</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The nominations list for the 2026 Grammy awards dropped recently, renewing the fierce yearly debates over what should win, what should lose, and what was snubbed entirely. In the gaming space, this is no different, as this year marks the fourth time soundtracks for video games and other interactive media are eligible for their own category. If you haven't seen the full list yet, here are this year's nominees.</p><ul><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/tripping-through-jungles">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> - Secrets of the Spires (composed by Pinar Toprak)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven">Helldivers 2</a> (composed by Wilbert Roget, II)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/worthy-of-a-museum">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> (composed by Gordy Haab)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-outlaws/transitional-open-world-approach">Star Wars Outlaws</a>: Wild Card &amp; A Pirate's Fortune (composed by Cody Matthew Johnson &amp; Wilbert Roget, II)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/sword-of-the-sea/beauty-for-the-sake-of-beauty">Sword of the Sea</a> (composed by Austin Wintory)</li></ul><p>If you've been paying attention to the games industry this year, there are a few elements of this list that feel off. The first is the release dates; three of the five games (namely Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Helldivers 2, and Star Wars Outlaws) fall squarely out of the typical nomination window, which includes releases between August 31, 2024 and August 30, 2025. The catch, however, is that Avatar and Star Wars games got nominations for their DLC packs, which were released more recently – each base game was already nominated last year. As for Helldivers II, a game released in February 2024, my guess is that it's eligible because of its Xbox port this past August.&nbsp;</p><p>These sorts of timeline shenanigans aren't unheard of with Grammys, even in major categories. For example, Wildflower by Billie Eilish was released on an album in May 2024, but because it was re-released as a single in February 2025, it's up for Record of the Year and Song of the Year at this year's awards.</p><p>The other way this feels off, however, is the relative impact of each soundtrack across video game culture. Star Wars and Avatar feel out of place in this regard as well, as both games are relatively well-regarded but didn't have the same impact among gamers, and that sentiment extends to their soundtracks. Neither was nominated for best music at last year's game awards, for example. But less egregious than their inclusion means the exclusion of other huge games, most notably Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. It's a big enough deal that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/awintory.bsky.social/post/3m52iiiczks2h">nominee Austin Wintory called it out on social media</a>, even offering to trade his place for the smash-hit RPG. While we do think it's an oversight, Wintory's inclusion is no surprise, as he's currently tied for the most nominations in the category since its first year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												
			<p>Elder Scrolls 6 release date</p>		</div><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bethesda Game Studio’s Todd Howard has stated that The Elder Scrolls 6 is &nbsp;“still a long way off” despite being announced at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/06/11/the-elder-scrolls-vi-and-starfield-announced-by-bethesda/">&nbsp;E3 2018</a>.&nbsp; Before that announcement <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/dont-expect-to-see-the-elder-scrolls-6-any-time-soon/">we noted that</a> “we probably won’t see a new Elder Scrolls until the 2020’s” which seemed outrageous at the time but now appears to be a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>“I’m preaching patience,” explains Todd, “I don’t want fans to feel anxious.”&nbsp; So there you go, do not get your hopes up for a good three or four years at least and you will be fine.&nbsp; “I think it’s good for an audience to have a break – The Elder Scroll<em>s</em> has been too long, let’s be clear,” he adds, “But we wanted to do something new with Starfield. We needed a creative reset.”</p>


<p>Todd also hinted that The Elder Scrolls 6 may arrive with no advertising or pre-sales. When asked about the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/22/the-elders-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-has-been-announced-and-its-out-today/"> surprise release of the Oblivion remaster</a> and if something similar could happen to The Elder Scrolls 6, Todd commented, “You might say that was a test run. It worked out well.”</p>
<p>When Microsoft bought Bethesda, a document leaked that showed that neither Starfield, Redfall, or The Elder Scrolls 6 would come to PlayStation. Despite Xbox juggernauts Forza and Halo landing on the Sony console, this image is still holds true with no sign of Starfield or Redfall on PS5. The remaster of Oblivion, a Bethesda game, did make it onto PlayStation 5, but that was developed outside of Bethesda’s main studio</p>


<p>No details for The Elder Scrolls 6 have been revealed, just the fancy and completely CGI trailer that probably won’t bare any resemblance to the game when it’s finally released near the end of this decade. Maybe. It’s quite nice to look at so maybe watch it one more time and then forget about it for a while.</p>

Reimagined is faithful in some respects, but <a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/DRAGON-QUEST-VII-REIMAGINED-A-BOLD-NEW-REMAKE-OF-THE-RPG-CLASSIC-LAUNC">Square Enix has been very clear</a> that it's meant to be a more streamlined way to play through the 100-plus-hour story of Dragon Quest VII, and it does so by streamlining the main scenario to take considerably less time to complete.&nbsp;</p><p>The team is also doing some interesting things in combat to bring the play clock down a bit, but for this feature, let's dive into how Square Enix is reshaping the story of Dragon Quest VII to be more digestible. Contrary to what you might think, the Reimagined team didn't start by figuring out what to cut.&nbsp;</p><h3>Streamlining</h3>

<p>"We didn't really have specific discussions about which parts we wanted to remove from the game," Reimagined lead scenario writer Sayaka Takagi tells me within Square Enix's Shibuya, Tokyo, offices, a day after I played through roughly two hours of this remake. "We actually never had any discussions, or like proactive discussions at least, about which parts we wanted to remove from the game, but we did have an extensive discussion about which parts we wanted to keep in the Reimagined version."</p><p>Takagi says one of the big themes of Dragon Quest VII's story is how it depicts these characters – like Hero, Prince Kiefer, Aishe, Maribel, Ruff, and Sir Mervyn – as facing significant adversity. "But another core theme of the story is that it also portrays the humanity of people in its characters, so with these two core elements in mind, we tried to understand all the essential stories of Dragon Quest VII that we wanted to keep."&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't played a Dragon Quest VII version before, the game certainly has an overarching story, but it's divided into subplots or arcs, if you will. Those "essential stories" Takagi is referring to are the game's various arcs and how they weave in and out of the main story. With this in mind, Takagi and the team asked other staff members developing the game and throughout Square Enix to lay out their ideas, favorite story moments, and more. "There were a lot of people saying, 'When I was playing this as a kid, I didn't really understand what the story was,' or, 'I don't really understand what the themes are, but for some reason, it's stuck in my head because it's very memorable,'" Takagi says. "So we laid out a lot of them, a lot of these story moments that fit this description, that criteria, and worked toward keeping those stories in the Reimagined version."</p>

<p>She adds that in this process, the team also identified many story moments that didn't align with Square Enix's vision for Reimagined. Narratively, that vision includes giving players some choice in determining how they tackle the story of Dragon Quest VII. In the original release, the island-hopping story is quite linear, but in Reimagined, players have some options to shape which direction they go.&nbsp;</p><p>"They get to choose which island they want to go to next, and in the original release, it wasn't really like that; the story moments were dependent on the order," Takagi adds. "[Because of the original's fixed story order], some of the story moments didn't make sense if we were to keep that in Reimagined [...] because in the Reimagined version, we allow players to choose which story they want to move forward with." Those story moments that didn't make sense were lowered in priority and eventually cut from Reimagined.&nbsp;</p><p>Players can actually see <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/11/04/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-have-a-new-never-before-seen-conclusion">a new, never-before-seen conclusion</a> as a result of these new choices present within Reimagined's scenario, too.&nbsp;</p><h3>Rebuilding</h3>

<p>All this said, Square Enix tells me the core of Dragon Quest VII's story remains intact in Reimagined. In fact, Takagi says the scenario is the one piece of Reimagined that wasn't built from the ground up.&nbsp;</p><p>"While our goal was to reimagine everything and revamp everything from the ground up, [...] it was never our intention to put forth significant changes to the story from the original work," she says. "Obviously, we wanted to respect and honor the original work, and we wanted to kind of maximize how amazing it was. So yeah, we remade everything from the ground up, but as for the story, it was more like rebuilding, taking it piece by piece. We never started from zero."&nbsp;</p><p>I ask if that means putting the original script on a desk and taking what the team likes and leaving behind what it doesn't, to which Takagi says no. "It wasn't really like putting the original dialogue or original scenario side-by-side and going off of that," she says. "What we did was we started with the overview of the plot – the shorter version of the entire scenario of Dragon Quest VII – and laid out some ideas of what we could do to make the story more interesting."</p><p>She says it was like creating a puzzle that the team then had to build, and it did so by switching up the order of story sequences, rewriting dialogue, reshaping plot points, and more. Each time it made a change —like switching the order of a story sequence — it required the team to examine how that affected dialogue and other aspects of the scenario, which led to cascading adjustments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I try throughout this conversation to get some specifics, but Square Enix largely keeps its cards close to its chest.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-team-behind-my-2021-game-of-the-year-is-back-and-i%E2%80%99m-conflicted.1349161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There aren’t many games I recommend as wholeheartedly as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/before-your-eyes-steam-sale-pc-psvr2-mobile-netflix-1851411401"><span>2021’s </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i></a><span>. GoodbyeWorld Games’ brisk, beautiful narrative adventure game is a devastating, cathartic, and clever project that rolls a lifetime’s worth of ups and downs into its quick 90-minute play time. Its eye-tracking control scheme is one of the most meaningfully frustrating ones I’ve experienced, as it skips through entire segments of its story every time your webcam sees you blink. </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>, the follow-up from Nice Dream Games, extrapolates this idea into a 3-and-a-half-hour experience, and it feels like turning a really tight Pixar short into a feature film, for good and ill.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>has the same sentimentality running through its veins that made </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>an incredibly heartwarming story despite the tragedy at its center, but it’s far less introspective. The new release</span> <span>is the story of a baby named Isaac who, somehow, has adult-level intelligence, though he can’t communicate that to his frazzled mother, spritely sister, and suspiciously chill father. But because he has an adult’s intuition, he can observe all the chaos of their lives and try his best to be a helpful son and brother. Sometimes that takes the form of just being a chill baby who isn’t causing trouble; at other times, he gets a bit more hands-on. What can a baby who can barely crawl do as his family navigates all their adult bullshit? A lot, actually, because Isaac has psychic powers.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642518" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642518"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642518">© Nice Dream Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Where </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>was entirely built around eye-tracking tech as a bit of narrative design, </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>’s implementation of a webcam is far more mechanical in the traditional sense. Blinking activates Isaac’s psychic abilities in a way that often changes depending on the situation. It can shut down machinery, help you clean up a mess in your bedroom, and if you close your eyes and turn your head, you can listen in on your family’s worried thoughts. In this game, blinking is basically an extra button that certainly still feels novel, but it’s not quite as effective in what it communicates. </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>made an entire mechanic out of “blink and you’ll miss it,” but when </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>uses the same webcam-based control scheme, it feels like something that could have just as easily been communicated by pressing a different button on your controller. In a way, it feels more like a reference to the team’s previous history than it does something truly integrated into everything </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>seeks to explore.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the later game sequences, in which </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>sheds some of its focus on its supernatural family story in favor of some surprisingly dark science fiction and espionage twists, have you blinking as Isaac navigates mazes of obstacles and threats to his safety, and the game registers these inputs based on where your cursor is if you’re playing with a mouse and keyboard. I played through all of </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>with headphones to listen in on my family’s thoughts and a webcam to blink my psychic will onto the world around me, but in its effort to stretch out </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>’ concise ideas into something longer,&nbsp; </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>fails to develop as strong of a grasp on why it’s implementing these ideas, beyond the team wanting this approach to gameplay to feel like a signature facet of their work.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642520" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642520"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642520">© Nice Dream Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I don’t want to keep comparing </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>to </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>, but the contrast between the two is one of the most interesting things about Isaac’s journey. It’s about twice as long, but doesn’t feel like it overstays its welcome, even if it’s lacking the same singular vision. The game’s psychic set pieces are more mechanical, but they’re doused in a childlike mischief and naivete that is delightful, and that makes the moments when reality intervenes as devastating as any slap on the wrist you received as a kid. Despite Isaac’s adult-level intellect and grown-ass voiceover from </span><i><span>Thunderbolts</span></i><span>*</span> <span>actor Lewis Pullman, </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>hits at childhood shame, embarrassment, and familial resentment like they’re all raw nerves. Then it gradually becomes about so many other things that even gesturing at its many twists and turns risks spoiling it entirely.</span></p> <p><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>runs with every idea it has with a childlike confidence, but it’s also such a different story by the end than it is at the start that I wouldn’t be surprised if people find that one half of its tale resonates with them, while the other falls flat. When it’s at its best, it feels like being cradled and read your favorite story; then come moments when it’s as if the reader got bored with one story and picked up an altogether different one. What it lacks in focus, it makes up for in a heartwarming message at the end, but it’s a bit of a rollercoaster getting there. At least it’s worth riding for the highs.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 9‘s Vivi Has Finally Been Banned From Magic: The Gathering]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/vivi-ornitier-cauldron-ban-mtg-final-fantasy-2000642504</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-9%E2%80%98s-vivi-has-finally-been-banned-from-magic-the-gathering.1349158/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Vivi is a small and unassuming Black Mage caught in an existential crisis in<em>&nbsp;Final Fantasy IX</em> and an absolute wrecking ball <a href="https://kotaku.com/even-more-gorgeous-final-fantasy-mtg-cards-are-coming-and-theyre-already-selling-out-again-2000630364">in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. The clever, lovable riff on a classic RPG archetype was responsible for what many considered the most busted deck in the card game’s current format. Fans have been waiting for him to be banned from Edge of Eternities Standard for months. Today, it finally happened.</p>

 <p>Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-november-10-2025">revealed</a> its updated banned and restricted list on November 10 as promised and, sure enough, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</a> was on it. The 0/3 Wizard gets a +1/+1 counter and deals 1 damage to each opponent every time you cast a noncreature spell, but that’s not all. Once per turn, players also get to use Vivi to generate red and blue mana equal to his power.</p>

 <p>At just three mana to play, Vivi’s a very powerful, very versatile card. Pair it with <a href="https://aetherhub.com/Metagame/Traditional-Standard/Deck/ur-soul-cauldron-1348701">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</a>, which stacks more +1/+1 counters and gives creatures access to all exiled creatures’ abilities, and you have a recipe for the most dominant and annoying deck of the year.</p>

 <p>“God, Vivi-Cauldron decks make for miserable games,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1nbwgh6/rant_god_vivicauldron_decks_make_for_miserable/">wrote</a> one player months ago. “The worst part are repetitive, monotonous play patterns and waiting for my opponent to take 5-minute turns when they had lethal on board after 30 seconds.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/uJVLmvNVp3">https://t.co/uJVLmvNVp3</a> <a href="https://t.co/bADvMaFx4u">pic.twitter.com/bADvMaFx4u</a></p> <p>— Dr. Perplexed (@drperplexed) <a href="https://twitter.com/drperplexed/status/1987959578399535473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As a result, Vivi Cauldron was dominating top-deck lists and driving up the prices of the relevant cards to ridiculous post-launch levels. Some players were looking at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1mj8va3/the_vivi_cauldron_deck_is_8001000_in_paper/">prices of over $400</a> to build competitive decks with Vivi Ornitier, only falling <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/631015/magic-final-fantasy-vivi-ornitier?srsltid=AfmBOooPpIF-JpPxhFkm4z1dPrbgI3gTepv91SKyFS8973Cjz2PhqdFp">below $30 apiece</a> once the autumn hit. Things got so bad in competitive <em>MtG </em>that Wizards of the Coast stepped in back in September to try and quell frustrations.</p>

 <p>“With the results of the latest Spotlight Series arriving on the heels of several high-profile Standard events, the conversation around the cards <span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Vivi Ornitier" data-card-identifier="vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Agatha's Soul Cauldron" data-card-identifier="agathas-soul-cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</span>, and speculations on ’emergency’&nbsp; bans in Standard, we thought now would be a good time to check in,” read a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/standard-and-moving-ban-announcement">blog post from September</a>.</p>

 <p>While Wizards didn’t act then, it took the unusual step of bumping up its normal ban date by two weeks and promised a stricter crackdown on broken cards in 2026. The saga of Vivi Ornitier, while great for <em>Final Fantasy</em> fans happy to see one of the series’ unsung heroes shine, reinforced skepticism that many <em>MtG</em> players have had for <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">the Beyond Universes sets,</a> which some feel prioritize flashy fan service at the expense of obvious power creep.</p> <p>“To open up the Standard format for innovation and a wider variety of decks, it’s clear we need to disrupt the <span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Vivi Ornitier" data-card-identifier="vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Agatha's Soul Cauldron" data-card-identifier="agathas-soul-cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</span> combo,” Wizards wrote in today’s banned card update. “That interaction is too much stronger than the rest of the format. We are opting to ban Vivi Ornitier as it is the card that’s more likely to create future balance problems if allowed to remain in the format. We believe Standard will be more fun and diverse without Vivi Ornitier in it.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new mode for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, called Endgame, has been revealed by Activision. The open-world mode, which will unlock after completing the campaign, furthers the multiplayer experience.</p>



<p>With Black Ops 7, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-trailer-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer is the main focus</a>. Its campaign, playable solo or co-op, does differ from previous entries, but it plans to expand on the narrative of Black Ops 2 and the Mason family. Despite returning to the somewhat-controversial futuristic settings of past games, it’s still poised to be one of 2025’s biggest titles. Ahead of its November 14th release, the team has revealed a new mode that plans to expand the narrative after the credits roll.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-s-endgame-mode-unlocks-after-campaign-goes-open-world">Black Ops 7’s Endgame Mode Unlocks After Campaign, Goes Open-World</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a Dev Talk, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-endgame#PvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as well as a blog</a>, Activision has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-details-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally announced</a> that a new launch mode will be available for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Titled Endgame, it’s unlocked after players complete the 11 main missions in the base campaign. In the mode, you and up to three other players will be dropped onto an island called Avalon and take on various objectives. </p>



<p>The mode will allow for up to 32 players on one map and will be divided into four sections, each with various recommended levels. You get to choose between four Operator classes and customize your loadout before dropping. In addition, progress in the mode contributes to your overall ranking, unifying all modes for a more cohesive experience. More details about the mode can be found on the blog, linked here.</p>



<p>An open-world style of gameplay was tried before in Call of Duty with 2023’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/review-modern-warfare-3-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a> to little praise. Still, it seems like the team is committed to delivering a great new experience for fans. If anything, it does encourage players to try out the campaign and get a cool reward for doing so. It’ll be interesting to see how it fares against the usual Multiplayer and Zombies modes and, if successful, return for future games.</p>



<p>What do you think about Endgame’s addition to Black Ops 7? Are you going to try it out at launch? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Seven Deadly Sins: Origin Preview: It's a Whole Vibe, and the Combat’s Not Bad, Either]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/seven-deadly-sins-origin-preview-its-a-whole-vibe-and-the-combats-not-bad-either</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seven-deadly-sins-origin-preview-its-a-whole-vibe-and-the-combat%E2%80%99s-not-bad-either.1349149/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, you go into a game not really knowing much about it. I knew exactly three things going into Seven Deadly Sins: Origin: one, it is based on the popular Seven Deadly Sins manga/anime; two, it is an action-RPG; and three, that I could play it on PC or PS5. I looked at it long enough to decide that it could be up my alley, and then dived into its closed beta test blind. And I’m happy I did. Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is an impressive game, even with its gacha mechanics, and I enjoyed hanging out in its world and spending time with its characters. Oh, and the combat? That’s not bad, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seven Deadly Sins: Origin follows Prince Tristan of Liones and Tioreh. After stumbling upon a strange cave inside a tree (that’s not a typo), our heroes discover a mysterious pendant called the Book of Stars that seems to have mystical powers neither of them fully understand. When they emerge from the cave after a knock-down, drag-out brawl against a surprisingly large and hostile golem, our heroes discover that the world is a little different than when they left it. The topography’s changed, creatures that are supposed to be extinct are running around in living color, and Hawk – everyone’s favorite flying ham – was being chased by a dragon. He’s not really sure how he ended up here – he could have sworn he was in Purgatory – but he’s down to clown with Tristan and Tioreh while they figure out what’s going on. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and this weird black corruption is springing up all over, long-dead heroes are showing up to cause problems, and there’s this mysterious scholar named Clotho who seems to know both everything about the Book of Stars, which can magically restore broken things, and where Tristan and Tioreh are going to be before they get there. Time travel shenanigans? Multiple timelines? Something funky’s going on, y’all, and our intrepid crew are going to get to the bottom of it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What sells The Vibe™ of Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is how it looks. It’s absolutely stunning.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The story here is fun (and very well-acted, though there was no English dub in the beta, so everything I heard was in Japanese), but what sells The Vibe™ of Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is how it looks. It’s absolutely stunning, but what impressed me most was how well-animated everything was. There’s a particularly great scene where Tristan is trying to hand over the Book of Stars, only to find it’s stuck to his hand, that had me rolling, but there’s a lot of really great moments here. Seven Deadly Sins: Origin has a story to tell, and you can tell its developers have taken that responsibility seriously.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s a solid action game here, too. Origin is an action-RPG at heart, and there’s meat on this combat’s bone. In addition to a standard defensive dash (the only way you’ll be blocking in Origin is with your face), each character comes with a standard combo, a couple of special attacks, and an ultimate that can range from calling in some fireballs to transforming into a demon. These distinctions are what gives each character flavor, and I really enjoyed playing around with them, whether I was buffing my standard fire attacks with Tioreh or using Howzer’s wind-based strikes, and everything in-between. And yes, characters like Diane are here, too. Just… smaller than you might figure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since each character’s abilities are associated with an element, it’s good to have a balanced team. You can have up to four characters traveling with you at once, and switch to them on the fly. Play your cards right, and they’ll even come in with an attack. The twist is that your whole team shares a health bar; there’s no switching characters when you’re running low on health to save the day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is about managing your cooldowns, landing hits when you can, and most importantly, not getting hit. Origin is kind enough to show you where large attacks are going to be ahead of time, and smaller hits generally have enough windup so that you can get out of the way if you’re paying attention and not just mashing buttons. This isn’t Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden, but there’s some juice here, and combat feels good.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This isn’t Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden, but there’s some juice here, and combat feels good.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s not all about hitting things with all manner of sharp and blunt objects. You can also collect materials in the world and use them to craft potions to keep you alive in a pinch, cook a delicious meal, or upgrade your characters with permanent stat buffs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a lot to explore. Soon after meeting Hawk, I could ride him around, and like seemingly every video game released since The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you can climb on objects in the environment if you’ve got the stamina for it, and glide down from high places. All of this is good because the world of Britannia is absolutely massive. You can teleport around if you activate the fancy fast-travel stones scattered around the environment, but that means you gotta find ‘em first. So, you know, be prepared to do a little walking. Or pig-riding.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But spending time in the world means you’ll get to do Origin’s sidequests. They’re simple stuff, and, as you’d expect, not nearly as well-produced as the story beats, but I enjoyed trying to help out a crying kid and got a kick out of a castle worker who was so lazy that I had to deliver food for her. Stuff like that makes the world feel more lived in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s one thing about Seven Deadly Sins: Origin that gives me pause, it’s the gacha-ness of it all. I’m inherently wary of gacha and other reward systems built on gambling, and Origin is one of those games. It seems fairly easy to get enough currency to roll the dice, but the beta throws currency at you, and it’s hard to get a sense of the economics of something when that happens. Whether or not that will be true in the full game remains to be seen. The UI also feels designed for a mouse and keyboard in a way that makes it awkward to navigate on a controller, especially when you’re managing a lot of gear. It’s not gamebreaking, but it’s something I wonder about when it comes to a full release.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I spent about five hours with Seven Deadly Sins: Origin, unlocking several characters, opening up the ability to party up with other players, and taking the main quest far enough that Tristan and Tioreh got to the point that they’d demonstrated enough skill to be trusted to head to the Fairy King Forest. That seemed like a natural place to stop, but before I did, I wanted to take on one of the beta’s optional bosses. In my case, it was a red demon who belched fire and had a thing for belly flops, and another weird looking thing with arms that were doubling as legs. I couldn’t beat either, mostly because I just wasn’t doing enough damage. My choices were clear: level up, get more gear, and play more gacha to Get My Numbers Up, but I opted out. I’d seen the fights, which were fun enough that I wanted to play them again if I jumped in at release, and I was tired of fiddling with the inventory screen. End on a high note.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, going into a game blind can be the best thing you can do for yourself. I enjoyed spending time in Seven Deadly Sins: Origin’s world, hanging out with its characters, and riding around a flying hog. And yeah, the fighting stuff part was pretty solid, too. I’m always wary of gacha elements in games, but the core of Seven Deadly Sins: Origin got my attention. The only question is whether it can hold it when it comes out next year. I wouldn’t mind a rematch with a couple of those bosses, but I’m not in a rush. They’ll be there when I return to Britannia.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/seven-deadly-sins-origin-preview-its-a-whole-vibe-and-the-combats-not-bad-either]]></content:encoded>

                <p>If there's a common complaint about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311" data-mce-href="/games/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, it's that the game can be punishingly hard at times. Team Cherry has previously shared a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577" data-mce-href="/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/">PC Patch to lower Silksong's difficulty</a>, but the game's newest update goes even further by nerfing the damned Muckmaggots that make things so difficult in Bilewater and the Putrified Ducts.</p><p>The Muckmaggots previously ate Hornet's silk with impunity, and even binding these creatures forced players to use what little silk they had to hold them back. The update makes it easier to clear out the Muckmaggots with the Wreath of Purity, which gives Hornet a chance to heal herself by using a second bind.</p><p>Silksong's Chinese translation has also been updated with fan-made translation by Team Cart Fit. Team Cherry <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/silksong-patch-4" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/silksong-patch-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">praised the new translation</a> by calling it "well-versed in the (quite dense) narrative and lore of both Hollow Knight games" and thanked the members of the team for letting the studio use it. The earlier Chinese translation drew criticisms from native Chinese speakers and led to the game being review-bombed.</p><p>Some of the other beneficial changes in the patch include the elimination of the same delivery in a row from couriers, as well as enabling rumble comparability with more controllers. However, the game is making Gurr the Outcast a little bit harder to fight by decreasing the time he stands unmoving.</p><p>The latest patch is currently only available for PC users, but Silksong players on consoles will get it in the near future. The complete patch notes are included below.</p><h2>Hollow Knight: Silksong Patch 4 (1.0.29242) Notes</h2><ul><li>Updated Simplified Chinese translation to use fan translation provided by Team Cart Fix.</li><li>Switched to Unity's Input System to improve overall controller support.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>ARC Raiders continues to hit new heights of success for developer and publisher Embark Studios, which has confirmed that over the past weekend, across all available platforms, ARC Raiders surpassed 700K concurrent players.</p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://steamdb.info/">SteamDB</a>, we can get a look at any game's concurrent players to help gauge how it is doing popularity-wise and, to a lesser extent, sales. But neither PlayStation nor Xbox shares player numbers in the same way, so the number of players on console remains a mystery, for the most part.</p>



<p>So while we can't know exactly how many players ARC Raiders had on PlayStation and Xbox consoles over the weekend, looking at the SteamDB page for the game, we can see that most of those 700K came from PC, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">a new peak of 462,488 players playing ARC Raiders on Steam alone just yesterday</a>.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Raiders!<br>It's been a little over one week since we opened up the tunnels for you to head Topside, and this past weekend we reached over 700,000 concurrent Raiders on the surface! 🥳<br>We're so happy to have you all here!<br>The many different ways you play and participate in ARC… <a href="https://t.co/Do6bAhWf4o">pic.twitter.com/Do6bAhWf4o</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1987930324156678210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's another milestone for the game, which has <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-2-5-million-copies-in-debut-week/">reportedly already surpassed 2.5 million copies sold</a> (most of those, unsurprisingly, coming from Steam), and has not fallen below 100K concurrent players on Steam since it launched on October 30, 2025.</p>



<p>Now that it has definitively had a strong launch, the question becomes whether Embark Studios can turn the strong launch into a strong month, into a strong first year, and beyond. For now, ARC Raiders is having its moment in the spotlight in the gaming industry, but that won't mean much if the game isn't around in a couple of years.</p>



<p>Not that it's likely to disappear anytime soon. Embark Studios has already proven it knows how to make a multiplayer game people want to play and keep it going with The Finals, and ARC Raiders is having a bigger launch than The Finals. </p>



<p>Either way, it'll be interesting to see how ARC Raiders continues to evolve. Embark <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/">currently has the game roadmapped for the rest of 2025</a>, though there's nothing publicly on the schedule yet for 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Company Used Fake Reddit Posts To Advertise Game, Then Deleted The Evidence]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/trap-plan-marketing-astroturf-warrobots-fake-reddit-accounts-posts-2000642503</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/company-used-fake-reddit-posts-to-advertise-game-then-deleted-the-evidence.1349122/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Trap Plan, a large video game marketing company, admitted that it used multiple fake Reddit accounts to help promote a game called <em>WarRobots: Frontiers</em>, pretending to be “authentic” fans and players who just happened to discover the mech game and wanted to share it with others. Trap Plan has since deleted the post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ot0nvg/game_dev_admits_to_large_astroturfing_campaign_on/">but not before folks on Reddit spotted it.</a></p>

 <p>On November 9, <a href="https://www.trapplan.com/about-us">Trap Plan</a> CEO and “marketing expert” Pavel Beresnev posted a short article to the agency’s official website. The post, titled “How we promote <em>WarRobots: Frontiers</em> on Reddit,” goes into detail about how the agency used multiple Reddit accounts to create over 40 posts across multiple subreddits, including r/pcmasterrace and r/PlayStation5, to create “a wave of organic visibility before the next Twitch activation.”</p>

 <p>“The content varied from short clips and GIFs to&nbsp;‘I found this game…’ discovery-style posts,&nbsp;screenshot threads, and&nbsp;light discussion prompts about tactical mech combat and movement mechanics,” explained the CEO. “We avoided direct promotion and focused on&nbsp;native conversation formats. Players discussed the game naturally — asking questions, comparing it to&nbsp;<em>Titanfall</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>MechWarrior</em>, and sharing opinions about tactical mechanics.”</p>

 <p>According to Beresnev, in order to make the posts feel “authentic,” the team played the game, recorded footage, and posted about what they had played. “This created a steady stream of credible, varied content that matched Reddit’s organic tone,” said Beresnev.&nbsp; After sharing some stats about the campaign’s effectiveness, the CEO concluded the post by saying, “Most players didn’t even realize they were part of a marketing effort.”</p>

 <p>At some point in the last 24 hours, the post was seemingly <a href="https://www.trapplan.com/studios-cases/promo-campaign-on-reddit-for-for-warrobots-frontier">deleted from Trap Plan’s website.</a> If you try to read the Reddit marketing article now, it just takes you to a 404 page. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251110014044/https://www.trapplan.com/studios-cases/promo-campaign-on-reddit-for-for-warrobots-frontier">However, it was saved by someone via the Internet Archive</a>, allowing us to see the post as it appeared on Sunday.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted both Trap Plan and <em>WarRobots</em> developer My.Games about the post and the Reddit marketing strategy.</p> <p>As many pointed out on Reddit, this is far from the first time we’ve heard about a marketing agency or publisher using fake accounts to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13ti3e/mowing_the_astroturf/">create an astroturf campaign for a video game</a>. But it is odd to see a marketing agency’s CEO so publicly and directly confirm what was done and how it was done. It makes you wonder how many social media posts on sites like Reddit and Twitter are actually written by real fans and how many were trying to trick you into becoming part of a larger marketing campaign.</p> <p><em><strong>Update; 11/10/2025, 3:00 p.m. ET:&nbsp;</strong></em>In an email to <em>Kotaku</em>, Trap Plan CEO Pavel Beresnev explained that while the company did work with My.Games on a marketing campaign, “any Reddit-related activities” were handled “independently” by the marketing agency without approval from My.Games.</p> <blockquote> <p>Our intention was to experiment with a more organic way of promoting games on Reddit — without using bots or fake accounts — and to build a new case study we could use in the future. Unfortunately, when publishing the case study on our website, we wrongfully mentioned MY.GAMES and <em>War Robots: Frontiers</em>, which created a misleading impression that these activities were done on their behalf.</p>  <p>This was entirely our initiative and not commissioned or endorsed by MY.GAMES in any way. We understand this was a mistake and have since removed the case study. We sincerely apologize to MY.GAMES and the<em> War Robots: Frontiers</em> team for the misunderstanding and any confusion it may have caused.</p> </blockquote>

<p>In Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, you have the next CoD game, but also the continuation of the Black Ops saga. It allows Treyarch to flex its muscles once more, and if you can’t wait to play Black Ops 7, knowing its launch times is the perfect weapon.</p>



<p>Between a plethora of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a> content, Black Ops 7’s fascinating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-details-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endgame</a> content, and the usual year-long multiplayer madness, you’ve got a lot to keep you busy in BLOPS 7. The title neatly wraps up this mini-chapter in Call of Duty history, which can lead to a nice break for Treyarch as it works on its next entry.</p>



<p>For now, let’s enjoy Black Ops 7 and find out its launch times.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-black-ops-7-live">When Is Black Ops 7 Live?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Do the robot! Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 7 first goes live at 9:00 PM PST on November 13.</strong></p>



<p>Whereas November 14 is considered the default release date for Black Ops 7, a small handful of areas technically get access on November 13—lucky you!</p>



<p>We know many of the launch times for key regions around the world. To make this easier, here’s a complete list showing you each highlighted region and what time and date Black Ops 7 is available there.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Timezone</th><th data-align="center">Black Ops 7 Launch Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">PST</td><td data-align="center">9:00 PM-November 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CST</td><td data-align="center">11:00 PM-November 13</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">EST</td><td data-align="center">12:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">BRT</td><td data-align="center">2:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GMT</td><td data-align="center">5:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CET</td><td data-align="center">6:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">SAST</td><td data-align="center">7:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GST</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">KST</td><td data-align="center">2:00 PM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">JST</td><td data-align="center">2:00 PM-November 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">AEDT</td><td data-align="center">4:00 PM-November 14</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-black-ops-7-early">Can You Play Black Ops 7 Early?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, there is no early access for the Campaign, Zombies, or Multiplayer this year in Black Ops 7.</strong></p>



<p>There’s not much to add. There was initial speculation that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-zombies-release-early-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Campaign and Zombies were set to release four days early.</a> However, while Activision didn’t address the speculation directly, the company covered the rumor by stating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-doesnt-have-early-access-activision-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 doesn’t have early access</a>—breaking all of our hearts in the process.</p>



<p>Still, there are only a few days to go now. As long as you have your referenced timezone on hand, you should know when the new Call of Duty goes live in your digital storefront. Furthermore, for more help on this, we also have an in-depth <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-preload-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 preload guide</a>, showing you how to set this up and enable you to play the second Black Ops 7 drops!</p>



<p>It also covers the game’s excessive file sizes across all formats. We hope this and our other CoD guides are answering your biggest questions about the latest CoD release.

How do we make that gamey? But it really did not resonate. It was also hard on our designers to write that way. Players want to role-play more and we had a voiced protagonist.

Skyrim is, “tonally and player agency-wise… really good,” Howard added, and I doubt anyone would argue with that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Those additional options should be welcome news for fans looking for new ways to play PC games of a certain era. The PC Gaming Wiki <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/List_of_Direct3D_2-7_games">lists over 400 titles</a> written with the D3D7 APIs, and while most of those games were released between 2000 and 2004, a handful of new D3D7 games have continued to be released through 2022.</p>
<p>The D3D7 games list predictably includes a lot of licensed shovelware, but there are also well-remembered games like <em>Escape from Monkey Island</em>, <em>Arx Fatalis</em>, and the original <em>Hitman: Codename 47</em>. WinterSnowfall writes that the project was inspired by a desire to play games like <em>Sacrifice</em> and <em>Disciples II</em> on top of the existing dxvk framework.</p>
<p>Despite some <a href="https://github.com/WinterSnowfall/d7vk/issues">known issues with certain D3D7 titles</a>, WinterSnowfall writes that recent tuning means “things are now anywhere between decent to stellar in most of the supported games.” Still, the project author warns that the project will likely never reach full compatibility since “D3D7 is a land of highly cursed API interoperability.”</p>
<p>Don’t expect this project to expand to include support for even older DirectX APIs, either, WinterSnowfall warns. “D3D7 is enough of a challenge and a mess as it is,” the author writes. “The further we stray from D3D9, the further we stray from the divine.”</p>

This was because discovering Waypoints and uncovering fog of war from the map was tied to Diablo 4's zone-based Renown system, which partially reset each season.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzBb0OsE0AY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fzBb0OsE0AY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Come Season 11, that will no longer be the case. In an interview with Diablo content creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzBb0OsE0AY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DuQ</a>, lead live game designer Colin Finer said players who skip the campaign at the start of a new season will have all Waypoints unlocked. Skipping the campaign requires players to have completed it once before.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big change that will make the start of each new season go significantly faster, as players will no longer need to mount up and manually travel to various locations, unlocking Waypoints along the way. Instead, Waypoints will be available from the start, letting players quickly and easily travel to wherever they need to go, which should substaintially speed up the start of each season.</p><p dir="ltr">The change goes hand-in-hand with one of Diablo 4's other big Season 11 changes, as the game will be removing the current Renown system that Waypoints are tied to in favor of a new Season Rank system. Many of the most important rewards from Renown, like additional skill and Paragon points, will instead be tied to completing seasonal objectives as part of Season Rank. Altars of Lilith, another aging piece of Diablo 4 that saw players exploring the map and was tied to the Renown system, are also seeing a big change. They are being reworked to no longer grant permanent stat boosts and will instead grant experience and other minor rewards when discovered.</p><p dir="ltr">Other huge system reworks coming in Season 11 include significant changes to how Masterworking and Tempering gear works, adjustments to defense and healing, updates to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-monsters-are-getting-deadlier-and-smarter-in-season-11/1100-6535477/" data-ref-id="1100-6535477">monsters smarter and more deadly</a>, and the reintroduction of leaderboards in the form of a new challenge dungeon called The Tower.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 11 is set to begin on December 9. Blizzard has not yet officially announced Diablo 4's second expansion, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">expected to arrive in 2026</a>, and just might introduce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evidence-of-a-diablo-4-paladin-class-may-have-just-leaked/1100-6533963/" data-ref-id="1100-6533963">Paladin class</a>.</p>

		<p>January is a month that most people don’t like. It is cold, dark, and wet. However, the plus side to January is that you can stay inside, get cosy, have a warm drink and relax. Coffee Beans is aiming to replicate some of that vibe with its cosy cafe sim Tailside, which has been given a release date of January 21st.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tailside: Cozy Cafe Sim - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zR9YeieTIj0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tailside will let you design your cafe, serve drinks to customers, and follow mini storylines. There are no time pressures to adhere to so players can take things at their own pace. As you make progress, new items and drinks will be unlocked, along with new visitors to the cafe. Tailside will also have a sandbox mode allowing players to decorate the cafe however they wish. Additionally, Tailside will allow players to import their own custom characters into the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2922570/Tailside_Cozy_Cafe_Sim/">A demo for Tailside</a> is currently available on Steam ahead of its January 21st release date.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/examining-generative-ais-usage-in-steam-next-fest-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-data-from-steam-next-fest-shows-how-generative-ai-is-used-in-games.1349056/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Generative AI is all over the place in games on Steam right now. That’s not going to change anytime soon, as our recent <a href="https://depositphotos.com/photo/sparkling-letters-surrounded-vibrant-network-various-digital-media-icons-complex-716371530.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Over 500 Steam Next Fest Demos Disclosed Generative AI Usage">Steam Next Fest report about 507 games</a> using it during the October 2025 event shows. With it being everywhere, however, it behooves us to ask: how is it being used?</p>

<p>Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve been looking at all the games that had disclosed generative AI usage and categorized them based on how they disclosed that they used it. This data isn’t perfect: it’s relying on self-reporting for a system that Valve doesn’t seem to be enforcing. However, it provides us with at least a chance of better understanding what developers are doing with generative AI, and some other information like who is using it.</p>

<h2>How was Generative AI Used During Steam Next Fest October 2025?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>To start with here, we have a chart showing how developers reported they were using generative AI. The graph is broken into 13 categories based with things like coding, writing, various art uses, audio, translation, and marketing (such as trailers or Steam store pages). It presents a very clear image about how the 507 developers made use of generative AI.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/next-fest-generative-ai-use-cleaner.jpg?itok=cZYdVK6V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/next-fest-generative-ai-use-cleaner.jpg?itok=ap79LUoT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Note: Of the 507 games, 25 of them were either so vague that we couldn’t categorize them, failed to have a disclosure despite having checked the Steam backend that they had used generative AI, or were using it in a way we didn’t track (such as fact checking in one case). One of the games was also removed from Steam.</p>

<p>We can see two areas particularly stand out in usage: in-game art and marketing.</p>

<p>Tackling marketing first, it was the second most common use case, often for capsule images or trailers. Over one quarter of the disclosed generative AI use was for marketing in a count of 136 (26.82%).&nbsp; Adding those that reported using AI just to localize their Steam page and no other marketing use adds another 12, taking it to 148 (29.20%). Of those titles, a bit under half made use of generative AI only for marketing (63 or 69 if including localization of the store page, either way coming out to 46% of marketing AI use titles).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>53% of developers used generative AI for only one category, 47% used it for two or more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, that is a bit less than the amount of games that used generative AI for only one of the above categories. That amount came to 273, or 53% of developers who used generative AI for just one thing. When it comes to using AI for in-game art, the most common use case for AI, 47% solely used generative AI for just art and nothing else.</p>

<p>Art was the major thing that developers turned to generative AI for. While in-game art made up a huge amount of that, we also counted 33 developers explicitly using it for concept or reference art (note this excludes cases where they say they then built on the art as that would become in-game art) and 20 who said it was for placeholders.</p>

<p>It is also worth reminding folks here that some developers may feel they don’t need to disclose their use in these cases, and that sometimes games have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-possible-generative-ai" rel="nofollow">AI art that slips into the final version like with 11 Bit’s </a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-possible-generative-ai" rel="nofollow">The Alters</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nearly two thirds of games that reported using generative AI used it for art.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most didn’t stop at that though and used the generative AI art as part of the final product directly in the game. Almost all of them would like to assure you that they are curated by humans and often refined by them too. 286 games out of the 507 (or 56.41%) made use of generative AI for in-game art in the final product – with the percentage jumping to 59.33% if you discount the 25 games we don’t know.</p>

<p>When you add the other uses of art which don’t overlap with in-game art (many of them did), you get 313 games or a total of 61.74%. When you remove the 25 we don’t know about, that number is approximately 65%, nearly reaching a total of 2/3rds of games using generative AI for art.</p>

<h2>How did games use Generative AI for art?</h2>

<p>Of course, given the sheer amount of games using generative AI for art, that prompted me to explore more.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/next-fest-gen-ai-art-cases_0.png?itok=Wq94NOLw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/next-fest-gen-ai-art-cases_0.png?itok=XG-BYkJQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><p>What jumps out immediately is that over half of the games reported use of generative AI art was unclear. That count of 145 includes 25 games where they were clear about some other aspect, leaving 120 completely ‘unclear’ games, making up 41% of the games using generative AI for art.</p>

<p>These types of games often stated something like “some 2D assets”, or “Art”, or “Drawing Work”, which is vague and doesn’t tell the player what is being drawn with generative AI. Still,&nbsp; 59% of games provided either partial or more detailed explanations of how they used generative AI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most common use of generative AI art was for background art.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most commonly reported use for generative AI art was background art. Given AI’s occasional difficulties with fine details, this makes sense, especially given that background art is generally just that: in the background. It is a secondary element for most developers although it is incredibly important to tone and world building. 65 of the games made use of generative AI to make background art, making up about 21.95% of the games that used generative AI art in-game.</p>

<p>After backgrounds, characters were the most common use case for generative AI art. Making general character or monster art was done in at least 38 cases. Generative AI was also used for for character portraits in 20 cases and for 3D models 10 times.</p>

<p>When you combine the categories for character art (removing double counts) we get a total of 62, which takes the percentage from 13.94% of just character art to 21.60% when you count all the different forms of depicting characters — not far off of background art. Adding the two together means over 43% of disclosed generative AI art usage was for backgrounds or character art.</p>

<p>Generative AI art for UI came in lower than expected but still had a high level of use, with 46 reported UI or icon use cases, making up 16% of generative AI art use.&nbsp;These art pieces often need fine detail and are quite small, which is probably why AI is used so much – additionally they are&nbsp;thought of as less artistic by many. While titles like<em> Persona 5</em> have shown how stylish UI can be and not get in the way, many titles prefer to go with relatively standard and safe iconography for their user interface.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>43% of generative AI art usage was for background or character art.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Textures was an area that saw a good amount of use, with 29 developers stating that they used generative AI to apply, resize, make or otherwise work with textures in some form or another. Most of those using generative AI with textures were using it in some other area as well (only 37% used it for textures alone in art), but there isn’t really any clear example of a regular partner for textures in their usage.</p>

<p>One area that surprised me was the category of 'Wall Art'. This is the term I gave to cases like posters and framed pictures that are often in the background. While sometimes mentioned by proponents of generative AI as an example of an area that generative AI could help with due to it being a lot of detail work with small impact, only 14 games said they were using generative AI art for this purpose.</p>

<h2>What Else Did Games Use Generative AI For?</h2>

<p>Outside of art and marketing, the next most prominent area was audio. A total of 121 games made use of generative AI for audio purposes in some form that was disclosed – a total of 25.1% out of those games where we were able to classify (23.86% out of the entire 507), putting it at 1 in 4 games using generative AI for audio. That also puts it at 4% of the total games in the Steam Next Fest for October 2025 having disclosed that they used generative AI Audio in some way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 in 4 games used generative AI for audio.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most common use case was for voice acting/voice overs. 61 Games disclosed that they used generative AI to get voice overs or voice acting for their games – sometimes for marketing purposes in trailers, but more often for characters in the game in general. Over 12% of games using generative AI were using it, at least in part to get voice acting, with 19 of the games exclusively using it for that purpose.</p>

<p>But it didn’t lead by much as generative AI music was disclosed to be used in 56 different games, with 10 games using generative AI for music creation exclusively. Next was a significant jump down to sound effects, which saw use in 33 games, and only 2 of those cases used generative AI exclusively for sound effects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coding is an area where I suspect that our numbers are very much under the reality, based on the fact that there is no way for anyone to identify ‘AI Code’ from a product they are an end user on really. Given the rapid use of generative AI in tech fields, the fact that it’s only been reported in 41 cases (8.09%) seems unlikely, but it is what we have as far as data goes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without a way for an end user to see if AI was used for coding purposes, the numbers are likely underreported.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a similar range we also have writing, with 44 developers saying they used generative AI to write for them some. Generally how they were used weren’t really communicated in the disclosures so there’s not too much more to say, beyond only 2 cases using generative AI for writing exclusively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Getting writing into other languages was about as popular with 43 reporting using generative AI for translation. When we add that to those whom disclosed localizing store pages with generative AI, we get a total of 54, for 10.65% of games using generative AI used for some form of translation. Of those games, 16 of them made use of generative AI exclusively for translation purposes.</p>

<p>One area that Valve is very concerned with based on their generative AI disclosure page is where the AI is used in real-time as players play the game. The nature of generative AI in this case means that no one has an opportunity to review the assets, and that games using AI in real-time need to implement guard rails to prevent inappropriate or illegal content<strong>, </strong>which also includes copyright violations.</p>

<p>Identified as ‘in-game calls’ on our chart, only 9 games in the Steam Next Fest used real-time generative AI, perhaps in part due to the cost of free users on a demo flooding the API and costing the developer money.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Who was using Generative AI at Steam Next Fest October 2025?</h2>

<p>While going through the various game pages I noticed a higher than normal amount of developers mentioning they were solo developers. So I went back through and noted those who identified as solo developers – typically in the AI disclosure. In some cases the use of first person led me to take a quick look at social media to check.</p>

<p>The term ‘solo dev’ is already somewhat loose in use and people mean different things with it, but over 6.5% of the developers reporting their use of AI identified themselves as such. 33 out of 507 isn’t a huge number, but it is a trend of note.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/game-developers-examining-art.jpg?itok=Z6gTV_uS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/game-developers-examining-art.jpg?itok=eQ8itx0d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Many of those developers were among those making speeches about why they were using AI. While some developers kept their disclosures incredibly short and vague, others took the time to write short treatises on the topic.</p>

<p>With the disclaimer that this is even more subjective than solo devs, I counted those who spent a sentence or more about why they had used generative AI in their game. The count came to 35, and it includes those just taking a sentence to say something like all work was reviewed and modified by humans, to two developers who actually had sites linked to explaining why they had used AI. That comes out to about 7% of developers taking time to at least address a bit of why they used generative AI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over 8% of the games using generative AI in the October Next Fest were adult only games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another aspect that quickly became apparent was that there were a lot of adult games in the data. Given the issues that have been with Steam and Adult Only games in the past, and most recently, this was a bit of a surprise.</p>

<p>Over 8% of the games using generative AI in the October Next Fest were adult only games. These 41 games almost all used it for in-game art, with at least 34 of them doing so. And one of the games marked "unclear" went with a very vague phrase – “some in game assets,” which almost certainly includes art.</p>

<p>Some publishers have also taken to using generative AI in a number of their titles. One publisher of particular note is PlayWay, publishers of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/house-flipper" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="House Flipper"><em>House Flipper</em>&nbsp;</a>and over 500 other games on Steam (many of them first person simulation games).</p>

<p>Examples during Next Fest include&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2007580/I_Am_Jesus_Christ_Demo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="I am Jesus Christ demo"><em>I am Jesus Christ</em></a>'s demo (the main page fails to disclose),&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3398110/The_Walking_Trade/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Walking Trade"><em>The Walking Trade</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3988670/Electronics_Store_Simulator/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Electronics Store Simulator"><em>Electronics Store Simulator</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>whose page has what is a common disclaimer for PlayWay games now of generative AI being used for "for store page capsule art and in-game character portrait art".</p>

<p>One problematic area for the AI disclosures regards accuracy and consistency.&nbsp;Some demos make use of a separate page from the game's main store page, while others don't, but not all of those demo pages were consistent or accurate with the information provided on the main page of the game.</p>

<p>At least 16 of the demo pages did not disclose their use of generative AI, while the main page did. The reverse also happened in several cases, with a demo disclosing AI use where the main page didn't, or had different content disclosed in a way that wasn't related to placeholders. Given the way that Steam Next Fest directs users to the demo pages if they are in existence for a game, players are uninformed in those cases.</p>

<p>Enduring consistency is also an issue. At least 7 games have removed their AI disclosures in the time since Steam Next Fest ended,&nbsp;but that still leaves them with a checkbox of Content Generative AI true on SteamDB’s backend. We also have notes on what some of them had before making that change.</p>

<p>This fits a problematic trend of games using generative AI in development and then failing to disclose its use even if the final assets used in-game are not generative AI. This withholds some information that some players may want to know when making purchasing decisions.</p>

<p>Games like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-possible-generative-ai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Alters Players Reckon They've Spotted Some Undisclosed Generative AI Work">The Alters</a> </em>are a clear example where there was generative AI used in the creation of the game without it being disclosed, and then some of it slipped through to the final release.</p>

<p>We reached out to Valve with several questions, including about games that had removed disclosures or demos that had not disclosed on all pages. They did not reply as of time of publication.</p>

<h2>Data Limitations</h2>

<p>There are a number of limitations in the data we gathered. First of all, all Generative AI Use disclosure is done by the developer. We have seen cases of developers not disclosing it and some games took down their disclosure during the period we were examining them.</p>

<p>Additionally, details on how they used generative AI in their game vary greatly from one case where they said every time it was used, to phrases like “some materials” or “some in-game assets” that don’t allow us to categorize the use cases. Out of the 507 games that had the listed state of AI, 37 had cases where at least some of the uses were unclear, making up over 7% of the titles.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, we relied on what the developer wrote and minimized how much inference was required, preferring to leave something noted as unclear rather than attempting to best fit to the categories.</p>
