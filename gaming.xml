            <p>The not-E3 week is about to begin as Sony readies a PlayStation State of Play broadcast for 10pm UK time (11pm CEST / 2pm PT / 5pm ET) tonight. We'll cover the broadcast live right here, reporting the major talking points in case you're out walking the dog or stuck somewhere else, and you can also - hi regulars! - assemble in the comments to watch along and chat with us.</p>
<p>What do we expect to see? Sony hasn't said much. We know the broadcast will be an enigmatic "40+" minutes long, but Sony hasn't mentioned anything about content beyond "the show highlights a selection of great games from creators across the globe", which isn't very helpful. But it does leave us free to speculate.</p>
<p>Fairly safe bets include seeing gameplay for the October-bound samurai sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, as well as something from Kojima's baby-powered walking game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, although note that there will be a separate Death Stranding 2 showcase this Sunday, 8th June.</p>
<p>We're hopeful of seeing more of the Wolverine game made by Spider-Man dev Insomniac, we've seen some rumours swirling about a possible 2.5D God of War game, and there are the perennial calls for a remake of Bloodborne. Will our dreams finally come true?</p>
<p>Also, Donlan would like a new Ape Escape game. Thanks.</p>
<p>Summer Games Fest gets into full swing as we approach the weekend. The opening broadcast will happen on Friday night and there's a busy weekend of shows to follow. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Games Fest 2025 hub</a> has all the times and dates you'll need.</p><figure>

			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-mmorpg-to-hold-limited-time-steam-cbt-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first PC Closed Beta Test</a> for the upcoming fantasy MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-dev-diary-provides-the-first-in-depth-look-at-its-features-and-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrono Odyssey</a>, we were able to send a few questions to Chrono Studio to learn a bit more about the game's features. You can read the entirety of the interview below. As a reminder, the CBT will take place later this month, and you can still sign up for it directly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2873440/Chrono_Odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>The game does not have a full release date yet, but we know it will be available on PC and consoles.</p>

<p><strong>As far as we can see, the game's main twist is the Chronotector. What can you tell us about its concept and usage in the game? Will it be available in PvP, too?</strong></p>
<p>The Chronotector allows players to manipulate time and space—slowing down enemies or reverting parts of the environment to a previous state. While its use is partially restricted in PvP to maintain fairness, it still plays a key role in strategic map control and as a tactical tool for escape or repositioning.</p>
<p><strong>Can you discuss character progression in Chrono Odyssey? Will there be skill trees, respeccing? What about multi-classing?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we offer a detailed skill tree along with the ability to respec skills. While Chrono Odyssey does not feature a full multiclass system, players can freely switch between various weapon types, each supporting distinct playstyles. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and personalization in how players approach combat.</p>
<p><strong>How many weapons will be available in the beta? And what about the final game? Are there any class restrictions?</strong></p>
<p>In the beta, three classes will be available, and each class can wield three different weapon types. Weapons are designed to be freely chosen by the player, allowing for the development of hybrid playstyles that suit individual preferences and strategies.</p>
<p><strong>What can you tell us about Chrono Odyssey's open world? Are there any dynamic events that will freshen up the experience?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. The world of Setera features dynamic weather, time-based events, and region-specific bosses that appear depending on player activity and the in-game time cycle. Even when exploring the same area, players will encounter different experiences depending on the circumstances, ensuring that the world always feels alive and ever-changing.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share how group dungeons and PvE raids will work in the game? Are these staples of your PvE endgame plan?</strong></p>
<p>Dungeons and raids are core components of Chrono Odyssey’s PvE content. Designed as endgame challenges, they feature intense boss battles and offer some of the most rewarding progression-based loot. These encounters demand strategic cooperation, making them a central part of the game's long-term experience.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of PvP content can players expect to see in Chrono Odyssey?</strong></p>
<p>In this CBT, the available PvP content will be limited to 1v1 duels initiated by player choice and open-field PvP between characters who have enabled PvP mode. However, we are actively developing additional PvP-focused features, including open conflict zones and PvPvE battlefield content where players will compete over specific objectives while also contending with environmental threats. We look forward to introducing these features through our official channels in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to have several Closed Beta Tests before the full launch? If so, will there be a long wait between CBTs?</strong></p>
<p>We plan to conduct multiple closed beta tests, with each CBT followed by meaningful improvements and content updates. Our goal is to gather valuable feedback at every stage and steadily refine the game to deliver the best possible experience at launch.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <p>A game that sees you forcibly kidnapped, smuggled aboard a mega yacht dubbed The Avarice, and made to play demon billionaires at lethal dice poker just got a new trailer, and it looks as funky as you’d expect. Dead Finger Dice: A Billionaire Killing Game is its uber-snappy name, and it’s coming to Steam this summer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spooky-cyberpunk-mystery-psychroma-looks-like-detention-meets-observer">Psychroma</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raptor-boyfriend-is-a-rare-coming-of-age-story-that-actually-respects-teenagers">Raptor Boyfriend</a> developers Rocket Adrift Games released a trailer for this roguelike dice builder as part of yesterday’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyRhu8kWv2E">The Mix showcase</a>, and as soon as I clapped my eyes on it, I was intrigued.</p>

<p>The big boat of these bad money creatures is rendered in a “grungy 1-bit aesthetic”. Aboard, you’ll be treated to an experience that looks quite <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>-ish except with dice instead of cards, and a lot more severing of fingers. Yep, you bet one of your digits each round, and if your five dice don’t boast the highest poker hand after three re-rolls, the demon billionaire you’re playing against gets to chuckle as you lose an appendage.</p>
<p>The first of you to be separated from all of your feelers loses the game and suffers a lethal punishment. In your case, being lobbed overboard in what’s a rather wet end to that particular run. Every failed run adds to the game’s “body count”, and you play as a new character every time, though with an option to pass useful items between runs via the “hidden compartment of your cell”.</p>
<p>You’ll need to craft custom dice with “demonically sealed special abilities” using your poker winnings as you strive to beat the game’s five bosses, as well as making use of charms and curses you unlock.</p>
<p>Also, Dead Finger Dice’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3512300/Dead_Finger_Dice_A_Billionaire_Killing_Game/">Steam page</a> notes that it features “class consciousness”, a “revolutionary body count”, and is “completely human-made” via its developers’ own fingers. Cool, the Che Guevara of deck builders that use dice. It’s got me convinced, even if I’ve spent about 6 million less hours with Balatro than most other people seem to have.</p>
<p>Hey, I’ve had fun with what I have played of it, don’t come for me joker mafia. Dead Finger Dice is set to drop on on Steam in Summer 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It seems like a significant improvement over the janky version currently playable on the OG Switch console. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,195207,196131" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-backwards-compatibility-list-start-up-issues-1851774297&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-backwards-compatibility-list-start-up-issues-1851774297">We’ve known for some time now</a></span> that Epic was working on a Switch 2 edition of <em>Fortnite</em>.

This is a big increase over the laggy 30 FPS on the older Switch. Epic also confirmed that <em>Fortnite</em> on Switch 2 will boast a higher resolution in both docked and undocked play, as well as a significantly improved draw distance, allowing players to see more detail from further away. And clothing will now have physics, something seen in the other versions of <em>Fortnite </em>on Xbox, PS5, and PC.</p><figure id="" data-id="042c57312168ce7f0b3d934a535bf03f" data-recommend-id="image://042c57312168ce7f0b3d934a535bf03f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fortnite running on a Switch 2.

Epic says if you do a console transfer from Switch to Switch 2, you’ll need to delete the old port of <em>Fortnite</em>, download the new version, and log in. Then all your skins and goodies should be waiting for you. </p><p>Epic also says that <em>Fortnite </em>will support mouse controls on Switch 2 via the console’s advanced Joy-Cons. All modes in <em>Fortnite</em>, including Battle Royale, will support mouse controls on Switch 2. The new port works with the Switch 2's capture button and GameChat system, letting you stream your game while chatting with friends.</p><p>And for you super nerds out there, like myself, Epic shared a few more techy details about the new port: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>For the hardcore tech folks: full “desktop” renderer, high-detail geometry, distance field ambient occlusion in docked mode, shadow casting point lights, high-quality effects.</p></blockquote><p>All in all, it seems like the Switch 2 port of <em>Fortnite </em>will be a comparable experience to playing on PS4 Pro or Xbox Series S, though it won’t be as graphically advanced as the PS5, PS5 Pro, PC, or Xbox Series X ports of the popular game. Still, it’s nice that Nintendo players will have a better way to play <em>Fortnite </em>in the near future, assuming they can get their hands on a Switch 2 when it launches on June 5. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Using the mouse controls, the standard analogue stick will be disabled as players use both joycons to play the game and navigate the UI. Players will be able to choose in the settings whether or not they prefer to use the left, right, or both Joycons to play via dedicated control schemes.</p>
<p>For those who log on to Fortnite on the Nintendo Switch 2 before 31st March, 2026, a free emote will be their prize. This Wishing Star emote is exclusive to Switch 2 players for now, though Epic does note that the emote may be sold in the store following the March 2026 cutoff.</p>
<p>Epic also confirms in a FAQ that the Nintendo Switch pro controller will be usable when playing Fortnite on the Switch 2, and those who already linked their Epic and Nintendo accounts will not have to redo the process on the new console.</p>
<p>As a final note, the Save The World game within Fortnite is the only unavailable experience on the Switch 2 version, everything else is playable. Save The World, for those unaware, is the PvE Co-Op building game that first came out in Early Access in 2017,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-save-the-world-mode-will-no-longer-go-free-to-play-this-year"> before getting a full release in 2020</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/corsair-void-wireless-v2-gaming-headset-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Corsair make a whole heap of peripherals. From PC cases with RGB lighting to keyboards with RGB lighting, and even headsets… with RGB lighting. What I’m saying is, they have a thing for rainbow light effects, and with their brand-new Void Wireless V2 headset, that trend is set to continue.</p>
<p>Corsair’s headsets have their own distinctive design language, eschewing ovals, circles and rectangles in favour of less regular rounded trapeziums. They could be inspired by sails, perhaps even by tricorn hats, either of which would make sense if you know anything about corsairs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing VOID WIRELESS v2 | An Icon, Reborn" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKxgnv79MVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here, that gives us a sleek black headset, which on first impression looks pretty understated, but when powered up they come alive thanks to two RGB strips down the side of each earpiece. It isn’t overpowering, especially compared to some other headsets, but it gives the Void Wireless V2 a unique look that’s well worth checking in for.</p>
<p>It’s also comfortable. Thanks to the Void V2’s mere 296g of weight, it goes very easy on your head and ears, helped by the plush fabric-covered ear cushions and thick padded headband. The only oddity for me was that its earcups don’t seem to want to fit entirely flat against the side of my head. I think this is partly because I have a slightly smaller head – and no hair to provide natural cushioning – and the feeling has lessened as I’ve spent longer using it, but it’s worth considering if you’ve got a smaller cranium. That also means there’s definitely more audio-bleed from outside, and the Void Wireless V2 has the lowest passive noise cancellation I’ve found in a while, whether the earpieces are entirely flat or not.</p>

<p>Connection comes via both Bluetooth and a sizeable 2.4Ghz USB-A wireless dongle, sticking way out of the front of your PS5 quite obviously if you’re not using a rear port. The advantage to that is it’s less likely to get lost, and since I’ve had various instances of wireless dongles disappearing, never to be found again, I’ll take it. The Void Wireless V2 doesn’t just work with PS5, as PC, Mac, PS4, Switch and Mobile are all covered by this pair of connection options.</p>

<p>The Void V2 opts for simplicity when it comes to controls, with a power button nestled next to the customisable multifunction button on the left earpiece. Over here, there’s also the volume toggle wheel, and it’s a slightly odd control, flicking up or down to change the volume, or pressing it in to alter the EQ setting. It’s solid enough, and the spring-loaded action makes using it feel suitably precise, but there’s something about it that I’m just not that keen on.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s the omnidirectional microphone arm, automatically muted when flipped up, and on when angled down. There’s a great level of customisation here, with a metallic boom arm that moves exactly where you want it to, contorting and angling as you’d hope. When so many manufacturers are opting for solid, one-piece mic arms, it’s a welcome inclusion.</p>
<p>Charging is via a USB-C port, and you won’t have to reach for the included 1.8m charging cable all that often, with a maximum of 65 hours of playtime, if you’re using the wireless dongle and you’ve turned the RGB off. Even with the RGB on, it sips away at the battery, and it’s almost a surprise when it runs out, making the Void V2 very easy to live with.</p>

<p>The Void Wireless V2’s 50mm drivers have plenty of oomph – that’s a technical term – and their ability to shift air around is probably more than most ears can take. The standard EQ setting is surprisingly flat, and I wasn’t expecting to find a more understated bass response compared to peers like the Turtle Beach Stealth 500, especially considering the larger drivers.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing a spot of Fragpunk on PS5, and here the Void Wireless V2 didn’t sell itself incredibly well, with the standard EQ settings making for gunplay which sounds indefinite and muddy. No matter which EQ setting you’re using, the out-of-the-box response is too heavy on the mids, making the overall experience woolly. There are 4 EQ presets to choose from, but outside of the top-end focused FPS mode, they all perform fairly similarly. It’s a real shame, but there is something you can do about it.</p>
<p>You’ll need to use the iCUE software to get the most out of the Void Wireless V2, but it’s only available for PC and Mac. If you’re a console player, then you’re going to have to live with the standard, out-of-the-box experience, which isn’t particularly strong.</p>

<p>Utilising iCUE, you get access to saved profiles, custom EQs and the ability to update and alter your headset’s microphone performance. If you’ve got a compatible Nvidia card, you can also add Nvidia Studio to help block out further unwanted background noise from your microphone, all of which makes for a really compelling package. There’s none of that if you’re playing on console, though.</p>
<p>With the ability to tweak your EQ, the Void Wireless V2 comes to life. There’s great incremental control via the 10-band EQ, and listening to some of my favourite music like Dinosaur Pile-up and Bring Me The Horizon showcases that the Void V2 can be a great-sounding headset.</p>
<p>Similarly, diving into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> on PC, the Void V2 proved thoroughly brilliant, with plenty of detail in the top end, and the epic soundtrack dispensed with a suitable level of drama. None of this exists in the out-of-the-box experience, and you can’t save your EQ settings to take back to console, with only lighting settings able to be carried over, which seems like a huge oversight.</p>
<p>At £99.99, the Void Wireless V2 enters a very competitive area, and I’d choose the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/02/nacon-rig-600-pro-hs-gaming-headset-review/">RIG 600 Pro HS</a> over this every day of the week, with similar high comfort levels, but a far better audio response across the board. The Turtle Beach Stealth 500 is also a stronger choice, with more subdued looks that won’t look too out of place if you leave the house.</p>

Jordan) return to their hometown in the Mississippi Delta with dreams of building a juke joint for all the sweaty late-night dancing, and revenue, that comes with it. Before a vampiric threat descends upon the tale, the early parts of the film show the brothers using their charm, guile, and gun-toting intimidation tactics to assemble a team to help build and run  the juke joint for one night. While the original film gives glimpses into its creation as Delta Slim (Delroy Lindo) extols the magic of the Blues, the deleted scene presents a streamlined, uninterrupted look at the juke joint’s construction.</p><p>Watching the joy on everyone’s faces as they toil away to build a utopia of their own in the middle of the racist South is bittersweet since that very juke joint is where most of them  lose their lives at the hands (and teeth) of the undead later that night. Just spending a little more time with these characters frying catfish, marveling at the possibilities of the gigantic structure, and helping one another makes you want to stay in that world a bit longer. It also makes you want a sequel that will likely never happen.</p><p>When a film is as big a cultural and box office success as <em>Sinners</em>, you expect fans and film studios to clamor for more.

                <p dir="ltr">When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a> arrives this August, it'll adopt a key aspect of College Football 25: its speed. Ask anyone who's played both of EA's American football games over the last year and they'll surely tell you College Football is much faster--they'll probably also tell you they preferred it over Madden's intentionally more sluggish gameplay. At the time, College Football was finding its old self, as the game was the first in EA's series in 11 years, and the entries of yesteryear tended to play faster and looser than Madden, too.</p><p dir="ltr">For the NFL sim, however, the slower gameplay was meant to differentiate it from College Football, and capture the way NFL players are on more even footing than their collegiate counterparts, where the delta between pro-bound elites and average student-athletes should and does feel vast. However, the Madden team has considered a great deal of community feedback and has decided to accelerate Madden 26, bringing it closer to the feel of the College Football series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZrgXXHSaBQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EZrgXXHSaBQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">EA Tiburon's Isaac Etheridge, also known as "Spade" from his days as a Madden content creator, spoke at length about the changes players can expect, specifically based on player feedback. He led with game speed, signaling just how much the team understands this was an area it had to focus on. "We believe the NFL is the home of the fastest, most explosive players on the planet, right?So we knew something had to change. We started to validate this, both internally and externally," Etheridge said, explaining how the team used a prospective build of a faster Madden to test its favorability with players.</p><p>"We took a build of Madden 25--a special build with different locomotion--and we sent that out, and we asked people some very direct questions: 'Do you feel like you have more control? Is this more fun?' We validated this, and we realized our players want more control. They want more speed. They want that explosion. It was an easy decision to make."</p><p dir="ltr">Etheridge explained that Madden 26 doesn't precisely port over College Football 25's exact locomotion. Instead, it features a merging of "the best tuning sets" from both the Madden and College Football 25 locomotion systems. "We don't want you to play one game and say, 'Okay, this feels fast,' and play another game and go, 'What happened? Same [player] ratings--what happened? Why is this guy not as fast?' So we put both games on parity with a new locomotion set that we believe is the best for both types."</p><p dir="ltr">Soon after Etheridge spoke, I got to play Madden 26 for the first time, and I could see what he meant. It's not exactly like College Football 25, which still feels looser and faster overall, but Madden 26 surely feels closer. Madden 25 was, in my estimation, the first "slow" Madden since Madden 22, with 21, 23, and 24 all feeling faster in recent years. As you can probably infer (if you don't already know personally), the Madden game speed problem has long been a frustrating variable. Some games feel right, others don't, but consistency was elusive. You couldn't get used to how Madden felt because that feeling wasn't long for this world. However, it now seems that player feedback has been overwhelmingly in favor of a faster football game, leading the Madden team to adopt this style well into the future.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506340-screenshot2025-06-03162412.png" data-ref-id="1300-4506340" data-ratio="0.59205426356589" data-width="1032" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506340-screenshot2025-06-03162412.png" data-ref-id="1300-4506340"></a><figcaption>Players like Xavier Worthy will feel more dangerous in Madden 26 thanks to its new locomotion system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506340-screenshot2025-06-03162412.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506341-m26_firstlook_saquonhurdle_cam_010_v5_nodefender_ps_v6_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506342-jefferson_vikingsrunout_v1_v07_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506343-051925_m26_bop_first_look_watt_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506344-051925_m26_bop_first_look_daniels_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506345-051925_m26_bop_first_look_coaches_1x1_logos.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4506341,1300-4506342,1300-4506343,1300-4506344,1300-4506345" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506341-m26_firstlook_saquonhurdle_cam_010_v5_nodefender_ps_v6_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506342-jefferson_vikingsrunout_v1_v07_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506343-051925_m26_bop_first_look_watt_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506344-051925_m26_bop_first_look_daniels_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4506345-051925_m26_bop_first_look_coaches_1x1_logos.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506341-m26_firstlook_saquonhurdle_cam_010_v5_nodefender_ps_v6_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506342-jefferson_vikingsrunout_v1_v07_1x1_1080x1080_watermarked.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506343-051925_m26_bop_first_look_watt_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506344-051925_m26_bop_first_look_daniels_1x1_logos.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4506345-051925_m26_bop_first_look_coaches_1x1_logos.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My hope is that the re-emergence of College Football as an annual series helps guide the Madden team to more wise decisions like this one. A faster Madden is a better Madden. As Etheridge said when presenting to me and a room of roughly 50 other sports nerds, "a 4.2 [40-yard dash time] should feel like a 4.2." That's true at any level, and it's good to see the Madden team has seemingly figured that out for good this time.</p><p dir="ltr">Madden 26 is faster, but I'm no longer worried about that attribute being a fleeting high note before it slows down considerably again in Madden 27 or 28. As long as college football continues to earn <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-and-ea-sports-college-football-25-hit-two-huge-us-sales-milestones/1100-6528544/">more money</a>, notch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-25-review-university-of-madden/1900-6418261/">higher review scores</a>, and total <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-25-hit-5-million-players-in-its-first-week/1100-6525421/">more hours played</a> than Madden, it will likely dictate, or at least strongly suggest, the direction of Madden in some key ways. Madden will continue to have plenty of ways to differentiate itself from its brandmate, but in this way, it's wise to play catch-up.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on this year's NFL, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/" data-ref-id="1100-6532037">how Madden 26 feels on Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-26-had-to-overhaul-several-in-game-mechanics-for-jaguars-rookie-travis-hunter/1100-6532039/" data-ref-id="1100-6532039">how the game was overhauled for one special player</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a> is coming this summer, and when it arrives, you'll find that the team at Tiburon has done something it hasn't done before: It's added a new player ability based on a rookie. The game's library of X-Factor and Superstar abilities is a lengthy one that gets new additions every year, but Travis Hunter is the first rookie to inspire the team to think up a new one.</p><p dir="ltr">The ability is called Iron Man, and it's designed to let Hunter play both sides of the ball more effectively. Hunter comes to Jacksonville with the bona fides to play both wide receiver and cornerback, and football experts everywhere are wondering if he can become the NFL's version of Shohei Ohtani: a two-way superstar the likes of whom only come around once in a generation, if that.</p><p dir="ltr">Madden developer Tiburon had to find a way to make this work in-game. Typically, a player who might play on both offense and special teams gets winded more easily, and a tired player is more likely to get hurt, commit penalties, or fumble if they're a ball carrier--not to mention slow down, of course. Because Hunter is expected to play both offense and defense, and has shown, at least in college, an ability to do this remarkably well, the Iron Man ability essentially rewrites his stamina drain. This allows him to fend off fatigue and the game's Wear and Tear injury system, which Madden 26 is adopting from College Football 25 and 26.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4505608-screenshot2025-06-02093046.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505608" data-ratio="0.5104" data-width="625" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4505608-screenshot2025-06-02093046.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505608"></a><figcaption>Saquon Barkley is on the cover on Madden this year, but it's probably not long before Travis Hunter lands on it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4505608-screenshot2025-06-02093046.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Similarly, a team's depth chart now allows for two-way players like Hunter. Before, if a player was starting on offense or defense, they could not start on the other side. The game wouldn't even populate those positions with most players; only a select few could be subbed in based on positional overlaps, like a safety playing in a linebacker spot in some defensive packages. Players who might appear in special formations--such as the Patriots' Marcus Jones, who can play returner, corner, and wide receiver--were given similar permissions in certain formations only. However, Hunter has forced a more pronounced change, and now players can be two-way players without these long-held restrictions--though that's not to say they'll be good at it.</p><p dir="ltr">At launch, Hunter will be something of a unicorn. However, players in Franchise mode who delve deeply into the player-regeneration system--Madden's method of populating future years with fake draft prospects--may find that more two-way players emerge. Finding them and the other new draft archetypes is meant to be like an Easter egg for players, Franchise lead Josh Looman told me. "We'll see people on Reddit be like, 'Hey, I found this one guy.' We have a good laugh about it," Looman continued, "but yeah, we've got a good chunk more [draft prospect archetypes] this year, and we'll continue to do that in the future."</p><p dir="ltr">For more on my time with EA's next NFL sim, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-madden-26-on-switch-2-and-it-didnt-suck/1100-6532037/" data-ref-id="1100-6532037">how Madden 26 performs on Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-26-best-feature-is-something-it-learned-from-college-football-25/1100-6532035/" data-ref-id="1100-6532035">how its biggest change is something it learned from College Football 25</a>.</p>

<p>Who doesn't love a bit of local love hidden inside video games. My mind immediately goes to Driver on the PS1, in which the developers hid a secret recreation of Newcastle in the UK. It remains true that the place in which a game is made can often seep inside the work of the creatives living there. A nice thought, especially for those from Regina. <a href="https://chl.ca/whl-pats/">Let's go Pats</a>!</p> <div>

<p>Balatro has proven exceptionally popular since its release back in February last year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-passes-5m-copies-sold-as-developer-implores-fans-to-play-more-indie-games">As of January 2025, it has surpassed 5m copies sold</a>, and was estimated to have generated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-has-made-almost-44m-from-its-mobile-release-alone">$4.4m two months after release on mobile alone</a>. </p>
<p>It's also proven itself to be an awards magnet, taking home multiple awards at the Game Developers Choice awards including  Game of the Year, Best Design, Best Debut, and Innovation Award. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-creator-impressed-onlookers-with-his-card-skills-at-public-event-without-being-recognised">Mr. Thunk even played the game at the conference while remaining totally anonymous</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Before the first reviews of the new console have appeared online, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pro-modding">YouTube channel ProModding</a> has already shared a 17-minute teardown video of the handheld that includes close-ups of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642793/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-support-nvidia-ray-tracing">custom Nvidia processor</a>.</p><p>Aside from Nintendo hiding a few screws and release latches beneath stickers on either side of the console, the teardown appears to be relatively straightforward if you already have the tools needed to carefully remove ribbon cables and other connectors and don’t care about voiding the Switch 2’s warranty.</p><p>The teardown doesn’t provide many new insights into the Switch 2’s internal hardware, but ProModding did share a few observations of the new console. The Joy-Con controllers do sit tighter when attached to the Switch 2 than they did on the original, but can still be wobbled. Nintendo appears to be using the same types of thermal paste it used on the first Switch, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVxMUmT11e0">some gamers have replaced</a> to improve performance and prolong the life of their consoles.</p><p>They also note that the folding support stand on the back of the Switch 2 is “too flimsy” and that there is a “high risk of breakage” when attempting to unfold it from only one side.</p><p>If you want to know how repairable the Switch 2 is, you might need to wait for iFixit’s teardown. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678622/ifixit-nerfs-nintendo-switch-repair-score-battery-drift">iFixit retroactively reduced the original Nintendo Switch’s repair score</a> from the 8 out of 10 it gave the console in 2017 to a 4 out of 10, based more on its battery setup and progress made by competitors like Valve’s Steam Deck than the finicky Joy-Con sticks.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You get a device in the mail, hook it up to your television, and then play a bunch of games on your own or, occasionally, with the small handful of other people who have one in for review. You have to quickly test everything you can think of, then race to get an article ready to publish ahead of launch to help readers understand what they’re getting into.</p><p>That’s how things went when Tom Warren and I covered the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review">Xbox Series X</a> in 2020.

Non-<em>Sonic </em>characters have appeared in previous <em>Sonic</em> racing games, including <em>Team Fortress 2</em> mercs and more.

That also explains why SpongeBob is using Sonic’s icon, and some of the missing audio and performance issues.  How Insider got their hands on it is unknown.</p><p>Of course, until Sega officially announces any of this, this could all still fall apart, or some of this content might not ever see the light of day. Still, the leaks seem to indicate that Sega is heavily invested in developing this crossover content. It seems very likely that in the near future, SpongeBob, Sonic, and Alex from <em>Minecraft</em> will be racing each other in the sewers of <em>TMNT</em>. Slowly, everything merges together as we march to our grey goo pop culture future. Exciting times. </p><p><em>Sonic Racing Crossworlds</em> is launching sometime later this year for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><strong>Update:</strong> CD Projekt have confirmed to RPS that it was Richard Hawley who played the merchant, whose name is Frewin, in The Witcher 4's tech demo. "As for the full game," they added, "we don’t have anything to share about any voice actors beyond the ones we’ve already confirmed."</p>
<p>Original story continues below:</p>
<p>Witcher fans have naturally been busy poring over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-shows-off-a-swanky-ue5-tech-demo-at-state-of-unreal-2025-with-ciri-hunting-monsters-and-visiting-circuses-in-kovir">tech demo</a> in search of interesting details beyond the big obvious teases. One group on Reddit reckon their ears picked up the voice of Witcher 3 actor Richard Hawley.</p>
<p>Hawley voiced a few characters in Gerry from the Riviera’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pc-mods-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">clash with the Wild Hunt</a>, with Caleb Menge, Francis Bedlam, and Redanian schemer Sigismund Dijkstra all boasting his dulcet tones. It’s that last one that’ll likely have lodged the actor’s voice into your brain.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It’s also the name that some Witcher fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1l2eys9/did_anyone_else_recognise_dijkstras_voice_actor/">Reddit</a> have admitted they shouted at the screen when Ciri chats to a bearded merchant about her current monster contract at around the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nthv4xF_zHU">ten minute mark</a>, after taking a walk through Valdrest. I’ve taken a listen to both the merchant and Dijikstra, and the two do sound a bit alike to me, especially when the merchant says certain phrases. I’ve also reached out to CD Projekt for confirmation.</p>
<p>As some of the fans in the Reddit thread have pointed out, if this is indeed Hawley, he’d be an interestingly fitting inclusion in this particular tech demo. In addition to those characters he voiced in The Witcher 3, Hawley also voiced a number in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings-enhanced-edition">The Witcher 2</a>. One of these is Carduin of Lan Exeter, a Koviri mage Geralt meets during the summit at Loc Muinne.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed from his name, this wizard is from the city that CD Projekt ended TW4’s tech demo by teasing via a shot of Ciri looking out at it nestled in the distance. Spoilers for The Witcher 3 and The Witcher 2 incoming, so skip the next couple of paragraphs if you want to miss them.</p>
<p>Carduin’s exact fate in the series so far is influenced by the choices you made at the conclusion of The Witcher 2, but it is possible to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWttKXXDVPY">run into him</a> in The Witcher 3 depending on what you picked.</p>
<p>If you do, he’ll be in Oxenfurt serving alongside Radovid of Redania, as a result of needing to avoid being burned at the stake, and to my knowledge isn’t confirmed as being killed alongside the ruler if you choose to aid in Radovid’s assassination. So, it seems possible he could show up in The Witcher 4, especially if the game’s story involves matters affecting Koviri politics or involving magic in the region, which seems a good shout if it's more than a brief stop in whatever journey Ciri’s on. I'd certainly be up for it, even if just to potentially see Esterad Thyssen in non-Gwent card form.</p>
<p>As it is, TW3 and TW2 had Hawley voicing multiple characters - ones who were all key figures in Novigrad in the case of the latter. If this tech demo merchant is played by him and ends up being in the final game, I’d wager there’s a good chance it’ll just be one of the times you hear his voice. For now, though, all any of us outside of CD Projekt can do is speculate.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-surpasses-elden-ring-nightreign-on-steams-top-sellers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> has surpassed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> on Steam's Top Sellers chart, one day before its early launch for Deluxe and Ultimate Edition owners. Only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a> seems able to keep the Survival MMO at bay.</p>
<p>The game previously hit a concurrent player peak of 37,889 during a closed weekend beta, initially limited to those invited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funcom-has-heard-your-feedback-and-opened-the-dune-awakening-beta-to-all-pre-orderers">but opened up to pre-orderers near the conclusion</a>. These folks were able to play through the same early portion as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">our lovely Bertie dived into in the Eurogamer preview</a>.</p>
<p>It has managed to slip past Elden Ring Nightreign, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-strong-start-on-steam-reaching-over-300k-concurrent-peak">which had a strong start on Steam</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">recently surpassing the 3.5m sales mark across all platforms</a>. It's worth noting of course that Nightreign came out last Friday, so it was bound to start trickling down the Top Sellers chart sooner or later.</p>

<p>Dune Awakening, the next big release from Funcom, releases for all players on 10th June, but those looking to hop in tomorrow will have to drop at least £58.50 / $69.99 / €69.99  for the Deluxe Edition. Obviously, there's no way to differentiate which version Steam users are buying to cause this surge up the store page, but it's certainly a good indicator for initial interest.</p>
<p>Recently, Funcom peeled back the curtain on the mid - end game experience in Dune Awakening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMpSKFSWjMM">in a lengthy live stream</a>, providing much-needed information on what those who sink dozens if not hundreds of hours into the game will actually be doing. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.vg247.com/">VG247</a> also <a href="https://www.vg247.com/dune-awakenings-creative-director-speaks-on-the-end-game-and-how-the-landsraad-will-give-key-roles-to-crafter-and-killer-alike">interviewed the creative director on the Landsraad system</a>, a rotating semi-randomised set of server wide tasks the Atreides and Harkonnen will be battling over.</p>
<p>For those unaware the game follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-devs-explain-their-alt-history-approach-to-the-vast-intricate-follow-up-to-conan-exiles">an alternate history of Frank Herbert's sci-fi series of novels</a>, though aesthetically more aligned with the recent films by Denis Villeneuve. Its creators at Funcom were responsible for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-secret-world-preview-2">The Secret World</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/anarchy-online">Anarchy Online.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
