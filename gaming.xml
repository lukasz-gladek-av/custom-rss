            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-hamlet-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.undiscoveredcountryfilm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em></a> is a documentary that follows two out-of-work actors, struggling during UK covid lockdowns, trying to stage a production of <em>Hamlet</em> in Rockstar’s online game. It tells a hilarious and earnestly moving story about trying to make art against the odds, where those odds are both real-world challenges and trying to keep the in-game actors alive long enough to finish the play. </p><p><em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em> stars Sam Crane and Mark Oosterveen who, while playing around in <em>GTA Online </em>in 2021, stumble across the game’s <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Vinewood_Bowl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vinewood Bowl </a>and playfully perform a Shakespeare monologue on its stage. They wonder if they could do an actual play in the arena, and the idea becomes an ambitious plan to hold auditions, have rehearsals, and mount a full production of <em>Hamlet</em> that takes place across Los Santos<em>. </em>They make a recruiting video and enlist Crane’s partner Pinny Grylls to film their efforts using in-game tools.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="GRAND THEFT HAMLET  | UK theatrical trailer | IN CINEMAS FRIDAY 6TH DECEMBER from TULL STORIES" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLpGIHjwhNE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There’s a lot of real emotion underneath this setup. The lockdowns are hard on all of them, especially Oosterveen, who struggles with loneliness and familial tragedy and sees value in <em>GTA Online</em> for being “whatever takes you away from the crushing inevitability of your pointless life.” At one point, he relatably rails against transit ads that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/12/ballet-dancer-could-reskill-with-job-in-cyber-security-suggests-uk-government-ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">encourage artists to learn to code</a>. In a Q&amp;A after my screening at New York’s IFC Center, Grylls, new to the game, noted how much NPCs cowering and fleeing reminded her of social distancing during the early days of covid; she likened the in-game feed that records player deaths to the updates of covid deaths happening in the real world at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>In light of the tragedy happening around them, <em>Hamlet </em>feels like the right play for the moment (in the Q&amp;A, Oosterveen noted that its “To be or not to be” speech is “about men being depressed and not knowing what to do”). And <em>GTA Online</em> is an unexpectedly fitting place to stage it: The grandeur of its nightclubs and mansions reflect the ostentation of Elsinore, and <em>GTA Online</em>’s violent premise and gruff emotes fit right in with a play where basically everyone dies. But all this appropriate violence is also in conflict with the group’s efforts to get anything done, as auditions, rehearsals, and even the most innocuous meetings devolve into chaos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, it simply never gets old to watch the actors get interrupted by a car chase, a gunfight, a plummeting plane, or a team of virtual cops. (At the screening, they wore tshirts that read “You can’t stop art, motherfuckers.”) And what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCUvXc5ESFo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starts</a> as a challenge soon becomes just another part of the production, the particular twist on <em>Hamlet</em> that every Shakespeare staging leans on to differentiate itself. In the Q&amp;A, Grylls noted that “We’re putting on a play inside a game, but the game is a kind of play, because we’re playing.” That playfulness shines through in how the cast interacts with the bloody reality of <em>GTA Online</em>; everyone faces things with good humor and shows remarkable fortitude.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="GRAND THEFT HAMLET | Official Trailer | Coming Soon" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OloHiBOMPm8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>And the challenge seems to bind the cast together. The audition scenes are particularly charming: someone identifying themselves as a literary agent who’s always wanted to act gets on her nephew’s account to try out, her voice incongruous against her shirtless male avatar. GTA roleplayers, real-life friends, and even <em>Overwatch</em> voice actor <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1788608/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jen Cohn</a> join the cast, each finding their own value in <em>Hamlet</em>, the game, and the support of their colleagues. A young trans woman early in transition relates to the play’s themes, seeing a connection between her real-life relationships and the way that Hamlet uncovers who his friends and family really are. The production also attracts hangers-on–a mysterious defacto stage manager, a player dressed as an alien who supports the project through to the end. “We just keep coming across these people who want to help us,” the filmmakers marvel.&nbsp;</p><p>But it’s not all fun, especially as real-life stresses intervene. Oosterveen becomes, as he said in the Q&amp;A, “more emotionally attached to the project than I realized.” Grylls and Crane argue over how the project is impacting their real-world relationship, at one point having an early morning spat as their in-game avatars before reminding each other that they’re sitting in the same house. There’s a broader question of how “real” the production is, whether it’s a legitimate theatrical project or just a silly diversion from the pain of the real world. It’s a question that might resonate with anyone who spends a lot of time in video games.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Q&amp;A, Oosterveen suggested that Shakespeare, now considered “high” art, <a href="https://www.seattleshakespeare.org/who-were-these-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t seen that way</a> in the playwright’s time, and the way many people might look down on video games today isn’t dissimilar to how they saw the theater back then. <em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em> feels like a celebration of both an under-looked side of Shakespeare productions and performances and a celebration of how weird video games can be, something broader audiences might not be familiar with. It made me both want to rewatch my <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116477/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorite <em>Hamlet</em></a>, and, maybe less wisely, check out <em>GTA Online</em>. <em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em> is playing now in <a href="https://www.undiscoveredcountryfilm.com/screenings-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">select theaters</a> and coming to streaming on <a href="https://mubi.com/en/us/films/grand-theft-hamlet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mubi</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-elon-musk-asmongold-twitch-path-of-exile"><h3>Elon Musk Has Once Again Revealed That He’s A Fraud, This Time By Beefing With A Twitch Streamer</h3></a><p>"He needs to believe, for his own sake, that it’s possible for him to jump into the deep end of anything and excel"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-executive-producer-job-description"><h3>A Video Game’s Executive Producer Is Just Trying To Make It All Work</h3></a><p>'Management is making stuff with other people, it's a creative problem'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/but-i-like-to-slide-the-joy-con"><h3>But I Like To Slide The Joy-Con</h3></a><p>The most fun part of the Switch</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>If you're looking for some scares to see you into the new year, there are plenty of great ones scattered throughout the next 12 months. Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we saw some fantastic horror games</a>, but this year also has a ton of potential if you're looking for multiplayer horror or single-player horror experiences.</p>
<p>Here's our shortlist for the five most anticipated horror games of 2025. All of them will be available on all main platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X), and they also share the trait of not having a fixed launch date yet.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a></em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Dying Light: The Beast</h2>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a bit more of a horror game compared to the survival elements of the previous iterations in the franchise. While they, too, had a slight horror vibe, it seems to be more of a focus in this game. You follow the story of Kyle Crane, who returns from the first entry, and the experiments that he underwent, which gave him significant strength and power. However, it comes at a cost. You have to work to keep the remaining survivors of Castor Woods safe while keeping your powers in check. While the signature parkour is still here, the ability to drive vehicles also returns from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-following-review-zombies-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Following</a>. Read <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our interview from Gamescom 2024</a> to learn even more about this standalone game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cronos-the-new-dawn-jco6q.jpg"></a></figure>


<h2>Cronos: The New Dawn</h2>
<p>This is the latest game from Bloober Team, a previously controversial developer <span>who became a superstar after the release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>. According to the Polish developers, it is&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-combat-will-lean-towards-resident-evil-dead-space-featuring-a-special-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired</a> by the survival mechanics of Resident Evil and Dead Space</span>. The story will see players traveling between past and future: in the past, they'll experience a world in the throes of The Change, a cataclysmic event that has changed humanity forever. In the future, which has become a ravaged wasteland, they'll fight for survival against dangerous abominations.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, the protagonist is a time traveler, an agent for the enigmatic Collective, tasked with scouring the wastelands of the future in search of specific time rifts that will transport them back to 1980s Poland. In the past, the mission is to locate key figures who perished in The Change, save them, and bring them into the future to change it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Little Nightmares 3</h2>
<p>Little Nightmares is a beloved franchise in the horror games community, and it's not hard to see why. On the surface level, it seems like a cutesy little puzzle game with horror sprinkled in, but it often tells a much more horrifying story in character design and environments. <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>, which was originally scheduled to launch in 2024, is the next game in the series and brings optional (you can also play with the AI) co-op multiplayer to the franchise, which is a massive step for the Little Nightmares games. We can only hope it won't be as damaging as it was for Dead Space, which also added co-op with its third installment.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>The Dark Pictures Anthology: Directive 8020</h2>
<p>For the most part, you can't go wrong with games in The Dark Pictures Anthology. The last game in The Dark Pictures Anthology was the spin-off VR-exclusive game named <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-dark-pictures-switchback-vr-qa-supermassive-talks-utilizing-ps-vr2s-fantastic-new-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switchback</a>. However, this is the first game in the second and final season of the horror series created by Supermassive Games.</p>
<p>The game stars actress Lashana Lynch as Brianna Young, an astronaut and pilot of a colony ship called Cassiopeia, which crash-lands on Tau Ceti f, a planet 12 light-years away, after setting out to find a new home to save humanity as Earth is dying. The game's creative director has described it as "The Thing in deep space," which is certainly an intriguing premise as far as horror games go.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Tormented Souls 2</h2>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tormented-souls-replicating-classics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tormented Souls</a> was a rather brilliant survival horror game for a first outing, and it is now getting a sequel. In this game, you reprise the role of Caroline Walker and get to explore brand-new horrifying locations that promise to keep you on edge the entire time. After the events of the first game, Caroline longs for a normal life with her younger sister, Anna. However, Anna suddenly falls ill due to a mysterious affliction against which conventional remedies prove futile. In a desperate attempt to save her sister, Caroline must turn to the supernatural again, heading to the remote and sinister Southern American town of Puerto Miller, where she'll be forced to explore eerie monasteries and other nightmarish locations to discover how to help Anna.</p>

Also, this week gave us our first glimpse of the next <em>Mario Kart</em>, and even though it was fleeting, eagle-eyed fans have still honed in on several details they think might reveal a thing or two about the game. We rounded those up as well. And the true ending of <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League </em>has emerged, and to say that it’s leaving players underwhelmed would be putting it mildly.

			<p>Work on the PlayStation 6 seems to be in a much more advanced stage than most people thought, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF Forums, well-known AMD leaker Kepler L2 commented on the next-generation system from Sony, revealing that its SoC is <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270022279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design complete</a> and is currently in pre-silicon validation already, with A0 tapeout scheduled for late this year. While this may mean little to most, this new information suggests that the console may not be too far from release, as Sony's usual cadence between A0 tapeout and the release of a system is <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270023151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 years</a>, meaning that, if this will be the same for the PlayStation 6, we could see the launch of the system in 2027.</p>
<p>The AMD leaker also provided some additional information on the PlayStation 6 GPU, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270022949" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealing</a> it is a fork of AMD gfx13, which was formerly known as RDNA 5 and is now known as UDNA. The leaker couldn't say how big it will be, but the fact that it will belong to the gfx13 will eventually provide some information on some of its features once AMD fully unveils the architecture.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the PlayStation 6 as of now besides the fact that it will once again be powered by AMD. This was revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year</a> in a report which confirmed that Intel lost the bid to produce the console to AMD due to a dispute over how much profit Intel would make from each chip sold to Sony which prevented the company from settling on a price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/maladum-review-taking-scenic-route<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Battle Systems is a company known for their immersive cardboard terrain, which we’ve reviewed multiple times on the site. But what happens when a company that takes such careful care to create lavish scenery tries their hand at tabletop gaming? The result is something truly immersive. We saw it with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/on-tabletop-core-space" rel="nofollow">Core Space</a>, which we reviewed way back in 2019, and now they’ve sent me their fantasy tabletop skirmish game, <i>Maladum</i>, to check out. Read on for my review!</p>

<h2>What is <i>Maladum</i>?</h2>

<p><i>Maladum </i>is a cooperative tabletop board game experience that combines skirmish wargaming with tabletop RPG elements to create a unique, ongoing story-driven game focused on bringing heroes through dungeons, finding artifacts and treasure, and getting out while the getting’s good.</p>

<p>In <i>Maladum</i>, players take on the role of Adventurers, who each come with their own statistics, special abilities, and starting equipment. In the game, you’ll play through scenarios in order starting from the very beginning of your questing, and whether you win or fail at said scenario will determine the next scenario you play in.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/maladum-overhead-shot.jpeg?itok=p4FDwYis 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/maladum-overhead-shot.jpeg?itok=QVsz1GQp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look at this beautiful, modularly set up board!</figcaption></figure><h2>What’s the <i>Maladum</i> Setting?</h2>

<p>The world of <i>Maladum</i> is set in the same world as <i>Core Space</i>, their sci-fi themed game that follows a similar structure. <i>Maladum </i>still takes place in that far-flung future, but so much time has passed that the world resembles something akin to a dark ages setting (it’s giving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_to_Be_a_God_(2013_film)" rel="nofollow"><i>Hard to be a God</i></a>). Technology, once developed, honed, and understood, now feels more like magic - and your Adventurers know nothing of the greater universe beyond their squalid little planet.</p>

<h2>How does <i>Maladum</i> Play?</h2>

<p>But all this is simply trappings and background noise for a game that truly does feel wonderfully medieval and fantastical. In the game, you’ll use actions to move around the board - which is brilliantly decorated with Battle Systems one-of-a-kind cardboard 3D terrain - to defeat monsters by using weapons and rolling dice.</p>

<p>But the coolest part of <i>Maladum</i>, in my opinion, is the way treasure is looted in this game. Each treasure is represented by a little cardboard chit, which you’ll put into a drawstring bag. At the start of each adventure, you (without looking) fill 3D cardboard treasure chests with those tokens.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/maladum-treasure-chest.jpeg?itok=rqnXW-MD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/maladum-treasure-chest.jpeg?itok=NvEYQh5R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This treasure chest is full of actual loot tokens that you add to your character's game board!</figcaption></figure><p>When your hero opens a chest, you’ll gain all the tokens you have room to carry (there’s a psychical slot on your board used to hold tokens), and you may also accidentally draw trap tokens which dish out nasty damage.</p>

<p>The story moves along at a nice clip, seeing your heroes going off on branching quests based on whether you succeed or fail at a mission (and based on <i>how well</i> you succeed). From humble beginnings to powerful end-game encounters, your heroes will need to find excellent gear, level up, and keep striving.</p>

<h2><i>Maladum </i>Requires Patience</h2>

<p>While the gameplay is clean and easy to grasp, and the board always looks incredible, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the cost that such a decked out board requires: time. You’ll need patience to properly set up a board, snapping together the right walls, gathering the correct treasure tokens, and getting everything into place.</p>

<p>You don’t get a game as engrossing as this without putting in extra work, but set-up is not very speedy. And as with a long plane ride home from vacation, the break down of the game after a fun, lengthy session is more exhausting than the exciting set up.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/maladum-corridor-shot.jpeg?itok=R028IAv_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/maladum-corridor-shot.jpeg?itok=6ziriNZt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The scenery is incredible but does require setting up and breaking down in between each scenario</figcaption></figure><p>And look, I know using a word like “exhausting” is a bit dramatic - we’re not mining coal here - but I think it’s really important to highlight that you’ll either need space to store everything built out, or you’ll need the patience required to build and break down each time you play. This is easier if everyone at the table chips in, of course, but for solo players you’ll be doing a lot of scenery snapping.</p>

<p>Luckily, the quality of the materials - even though they’re cardboard - are the same quality we’ve come to expect and respect from Battle Systems. Everything is sturdy, gloriously illustrated, and snaps together the way it’s intended to (though guides for building everything are not included in the box, you’ll have to watch YouTube videos from Battle Systems for the trickier bits).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/maladum-player-trays.jpeg?itok=FNTfnD2j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/maladum-player-trays.jpeg?itok=ImDvrV8s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Player trays and pegs track your character's progress, with a custom slot to hold inventory!</figcaption></figure><h2><i>Maladum </i>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>All that grumbling aside, I still think <i>Maladum</i> shines head and shoulders above many other similar games. The gameplay loop is exciting, it’s really thrilling to open up a treasure chest and see what you’ve found, and it feels especially rewarding to sink your teeth into the story.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to get absolutely lost in a cooperative fantasy game, you’ll find a lot to love about <i>Maladum</i>, with each new quest beckoning you to heed its call!</p>

			<p>Having a good headset is an increasingly important part of modern gaming, whether it’s helping you communicate with your teammates, immersing you in the audio design of your game, or helping to create a buffer between your gaming and the rest of your household. The range and breadth of options can be dizzying, though, especially if you want to get the best value for money. Cheaper options will do a job but can be unreliable, uncomfortable, or lacking in features, whilst the big hitters can cost almost as much as the consoles themselves! This makes the mid-range perhaps the most competitive area to shop in, and it is here that the SoundMagic P58BT ANC is placed. Available for around £70 – £80 from the usual online stores, this wireless headset has become my daily go-to for music and media, whilst also proving to be a solid option for gaming.</p>
<p>The P58BT are well packaged and come with a carry pouch and a USB-C cable for charging. The carry pouch does feel a little cheap though and is a little disappointing compared to the solid hard cases that other headsets provide – even ones at lower price points. It will keep your headphones free from crumbs and fluff in your bag but offers no impact protection whatsoever – obviously, this is only an issue if you plan to take them out and about. The packaging is pretty massive too and I was surprised how light the actual headset was once I opened it up. This is a good thing in my opinion, as I find some headphones uncomfortably heavy for wearing around and about, although I can appreciate the benefits of more sturdy ones for gaming purposes.</p>



<p>In terms of performance, I have been using the P58BT for a few weeks now and have had very few issues – aside from the couple of times that I forgot to charge them up and had to plug in a 3.5mm cable. The fact that you can do this is a real positive though as this isn’t a universally available feature. Being able to use such a cable also means that you can use the P58BT with Sony and Microsoft consoles for audio, but the microphone isn’t compatible for voice chat this way. It works fine for voice calls on phone and through Bluetooth on PC, and while it does benefit from CVC noise reduction, the end result isn’t as clear as a wired alternative. Audio quality is good with the 40mm dynamic driver unit offering a decent range and effective soundstage for positional audio when gaming.</p>
<p>The main connection is with Bluetooth 5.3, and this works as reliably as you’d hope. There is the option to connect to multiple devices simultaneously which is a welcome feature, so you can stay connected to both your PC/Switch and your phone if you want to. The active noise cancellation is solid enough and works well at cutting out the sound of your family in the background or the roar of traffic when sat on the bus. There is also an ambient sound mode which probably won’t be used whilst gaming, but is useful when out and about to keep you aware of your surroundings. Finally, there is an ultra-low latency gaming mode to help ensure a smooth experience in games.</p>


<p>In addition to being lightweight, the P58BT ANC are sturdily designed and comfortable to wear, with silicone earmuffs and headband, making them water and sweat-proof and promising more durability than the cheap faux–leather that is often used. The earmuffs have a decent amount of swivel to fit your head snugly and prevent sound leaking. The battery life is excellent too, with up to 60 hours depending on whether you are using ANC or not.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best feature of all, though, is the set of minimalist, but intuitive controls. There is a tactile button for power on and off which also switches between the ANC profiles, while a double press turning gaming mode on and off and a triple press to activate pairing. For general use, however, it is the touch control pad on the left earcup that is super easy to use. Volume controls just need a quick swipe up and down with track selection being mapped to left and right. Where touch controls can be a bit flaky on other headphones – even premium models like Sony’s earlier 1000XM series – it’s nice and reliable here, always registering my swipes as intended.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The SoundMagic P58BT ANC Headset is a good mid-range option for PC and mobile gaming, but is best suited as a general purpose Bluetooth headphones. Mic quality is not as good as competitors with physical booms but is good enough in a pinch. They’ve become my daily drivers for use with Switch and phone, but I’ve reverted to a wired set working through my DAC on PC.	</p></div>

Nintendo finally showed off the device (and what seems to be a new <em>Mario Kart</em>) in a sleek new trailer, and though we’ll seemingly have to wait until early April to get much in the way of concrete details, there’s plenty to pore over and speculate about here. </p><p>Also, the development of acclaimed Steam shooter <em>Fortune’s Run </em>is on hold as the developer revealed she has to serve time in prison. Meanwhile, Elon Musk and YouTuber Asmongold have clashed after Asmongold was among those calling out Elon’s lack of prowess at <em>Path of Exile 2 </em>after the billionaire claimed to be one of the top-ranked players in the world.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> developer Mob Entertainment is suing Google for failing to remove "scam" apps from the Google Play store.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-pirated-poppy.pdf">legal papers</a> filed on Wednesday (thanks, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/poppy-playtime-sues-google-for-failing-to-remove-copyright-infringing-scam-apps-250116/">TorrentFreak</a>), Poppy Playtime's creators accuse Daigo Game 2020 Inc. of releasing "scam" apps intentionally advertised with names like Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3 and Poppy Playtime: Chapter 4 well before the instalments had been officially released for mobile devices.</p>

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As well as blatantly using Poppy Playtime's name, promotional art also clearly uses Poppy Playtime's characters and screenshots from the authentic game's second chapter.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Mob contacted Google numerous times over several months, but each time an erroneous app is removed, it simply pops back up again a day or two later.</p>
<p>The apps reportedly don't even download a copycat or derivative game, either.</p>
<p>"Mob Entertainment's trademarks and copyrighted material to trick consumers into spending up to $95 for a game prior to its release on Google Play. Instead, it asks users to pay $30 to $95 for the 'Guide wuggy playtime mod'," the complaint added.</p><p>"Google receives a direct financial benefit from the infringement by the users at least because users with devices containing the application are given an offer to purchase the Guide wuggy playtime mod for up to $95. If they make the purchase, Google then receives 15-30 percent of the proceeds."</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the scam game is still available to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PoPPyPlaytimeKing.BuggyChapterPlaytimeMOPckapter3&amp;hl=en">view</a>, and install, on the Google Play store. Unless players know, explicitly, who publishes the game, there's absolutely no way of telling them apart, particularly as it doesn't list a user score or link to user reviews.</p>
<p>Whilst the real game is a premium product and listed as having 10K+ downloads, the fake app has been downloaded over a million times.</p>

<p>"Google forfeited the benefits of the DMCA's safe harbour provision for its infringement of Mob Entertainment's copyrighted works contained in the unauthorised 'Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3' and 'Poppy Playtime Chapter 4' applications," the court filing said.</p>
<p>"The unauthorised Poppy Playtime applications have tarnished Mob Entertainment’s Poppy Playtime [copyright] mark by associating it with poor quality applications that are nothing but bait-and-switch scams.</p>
<p>"Google's illegal, unfair, and fraudulent business acts and practices have caused Mob Entertainment to spend copious amounts of resources, including its employees' time, in a fruitless effort to attempt to get Google to remove applications committing copyright infringement, trademark infringement, fraud, and other unlawful and unfair business acts and practices."</p><p>Mob Entertainment seeks "actual damages in an amount to be determined in excess of $75,000", all of Daigo and Google's profits from the scam apps, court costs, and $150,000 in damages per work infringed. It is also hoping for an injunction to prevent Google and Daigo violating its trademark in the future.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a line of game developers who have called out digital game stores for not promptly dealing with intentionally misleading or copyright-infringing games.</p>
<p>Just last month, the creative director of indie hit Unpacking, Wren Brier, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-developer-calls-out-nintendo-after-reporting-cheap-fakes-on-its-eshop">called out Nintendo due to the prominence of copycat games on its Switch eShop</a>, and days later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-black-myth-wukong-copycat-games-are-popping-up-on-nintendo-eshop">fans spotted Black Myth: Wukong imitations, too</a>. The 2D platformer's gameplay and presentation are markedly different, but its promotional art and title could easily be confused with that of Game Science's blockbuster.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Silver Tempest is in a unique position right now, with single card prices soaring and stock set to run out by the end of 2025. It's also one of the cheapest sets to collect right now, with Elite Trainer Boxes dipping just <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q41Pm4?object_uuid=2204cbc4-1662-4060-95a2-3685c5b1d5c1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">below £40 at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/a0nJ0A?object_uuid=2204cbc4-1662-4060-95a2-3685c5b1d5c1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zavvi</a>.

Whilst being playable to quickly get through a deck, this is one for the collectors. Lugia V Alt Art is starting to climb in value, from around £150 on the secondary market at the end of 2024 to around the £230 mark at the time of writing. There's every chance to still pull one of these bad boys in Silver Tempest products on store shelves right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rayquaza VMAX TG20/TG30 (Trainer Gallery)</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/18/untitled-design-38-1737199148668.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company / Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Honourable Silver Tempest Mentions</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">- Lugia VSTAR 202/195 (Rainbow Rare)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Unown V 177/195 (Alt Art)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Regidrago V 184/195 (Alt Art)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Trainer Gallery Cards, the artwork is stunning on them all</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trainer Gallery cards are still very cheap for the most part (usually under £5), so I'd highly recommend picking them up. They're stunning, and their value will only climb as time goes on. Plus, they're so fun to collect. Rayquaza Vmax is stunning, rocking its Dragon Clan routes whilst considering how massive this Pokémon is. This card has nearly tripled in value from the back end of 2024, with sold listings from December going for as low as £25. Most recent sales are going for between £60 to £80, and I don't see that price getting any cheaper as 2025 progresses.</p><p id="pokemon-tcg-sword-shield-12-silve"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield 12 Silve">Pokemon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield 12 Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="fd330157-bb0b-4b85-8799-f783a6c351cf" id="214259"><div id="214259" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Sword &amp; Shield—Silver Tempest Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">8 booster packs of Silver Tempest, Alolan Vulpix sleeves, dice, damage counters, and a cool box to store your bulk are a solid deal for £39.99.

It's also probably a good idea to keep one sealed if you're a collector; the value for these will certainly rise as stock runs out in stores.</p></div><p id="pokmon-sword-shieldsilver-tempe"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield—Silver Tempe"> Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield—Silver Tempest Build &amp; Battle Stadium </h2></p><div catalogid="fd330157-bb0b-4b85-8799-f783a6c351cf" id="214260"><div id="214260" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield—Silver Tempest Build &amp; Battle Stadium </h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For an extra £20 over the Silver Tempest ETB, trainers can snag 12 booster packs, two 40-card build and battle decks, extra energy cards, damage counter dice, coins, and status markers.

            <p>Nintendo believes that "the best direction" for Switch 2 is to ensure players are "able to play their already purchased Nintendo Switch software on the successor".</p>
<p>In the absence of any other studio coming forward to confirm they were developing games for Switch 2, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/my-kids-first-meeting-with-nintendo?open=false#%C2%A7item-some-switch-notes-a-day-after-the-big-announcement">Game File</a> asked Nintendo to expand on what third-party developers it was working with. The reply didn't really address the question at hand, but did provide a little insight into Nintendo's view of backwards compatibility.</p>

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Nintendo Switch is played by many consumers, and we decided that the best direction to take would be for consumers to be able to play their already purchased Nintendo Switch software on the successor to Nintendo Switch," the company said.</p>
<p>"As a result of that thinking, Nintendo Switch 2 plays Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games, as well as both physical and digital Nintendo Switch games.</p>
<p>"Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2. Details will be shared on the Nintendo website at a later date."</p>
<p>It's still not yet clear what "may not be fully compatible" means or what games won't make the cut. But the statement does, at least, intimate that Nintendo is acutely cognisant of the importance of backwards compatibility for players moving between Switch and Switch 2. Whilst Switch was not backwards compatible with Wii or Wii U, Wii U <em>was</em> backwards compatible with Wii games, just as the Nintendo 3DS was also able to run DS cartridges.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Here's everything we know so far about Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24344598/antonblast-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Antonblast</em> is kind of like playing a zany Saturday morning cartoon. It’s brash, maximalist, and often, you’ll feel like you don’t actually understand what’s happening. Somehow, that chaos gels into something that actually makes sense — and, at times, is even calming.</p><p><em>Antonblast</em> just launched in 2024, but it looks like a long-lost side-scrolling platformer from the 16-bit era of the SNES or Sega Genesis. That’s not just due to the fantastic pixel art. There are fun touches like delightfully ’90s-era character designs and Mode 7-like effects, such as your character splatting against the screen when you die, that really make it feel like a missing classic of the era.</p><p>Summitsphere, <em>Antonblast</em>’s developer, describes the game as a “fast-paced explosive action platformer,” and that’s a good way to summarize how it actually feels to play. It’s sort of what would happen if you put <em>Wario</em>, <em>Sonic,</em> <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, <em>The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</em>, and <em>Rocko’s Modern Life</em> into a blender.</p><div><figcaption><em>Yes, there is grinding.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Summitsphere</cite></p></div><p>As Anton or Annie, you’ll charge through various enemies and obstacles in your path, sometimes turning into a literal tornado of chaos, to retrieve Spirits (as in drinks) from a villainous Satan, who has stolen and scattered them throughout 12 different levels.</p><p>The levels usually have some kind of gimmick or theme that is explored with an almost Nintendo-like degree of precision. One level frequently turns your character into a pinball. Another features sections where you transform into a bouncing, explosive bomb. One of my favorites was a maze-like bathhouse that, compared to the rest of the game, was eerily quiet. And at the end of nearly every level, you’ll activate a switch that starts a timer and begins a frantic and thrilling run back to the entrance.</p><p>For the most part, <em>Antonblast</em> encourages you to build momentum, like a classic <em>Sonic</em> game. It’s easy to get into a flow state of surging forward, even when things can feel out of control because of how fast you’re going or the amount of stuff onscreen. As I got better at the game, I actually started to feel more chill when things got out of hand. The game was usually leading me in the right direction, and I learned to just accept that things were happening as they should.</p><div><figcaption><em>The boss fights are pretty wild.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Summitsphere</cite></p></div><p>Occasionally, the game would have some tough platforming or annoyingly placed checkpoints that could take me out of the flow state — also like <em>Sonic</em>. Some of the bosses, which were often epic, screen-filling spectacles, could be frustratingly difficult. Fortunately, though, reloads are quick, which makes those frustrations a bit easier to deal with. The final level and boss are particularly challenging, but if you do get that far, trust me when I tell you that the payoff for seeing them through is worth it.</p><p>Like the ’90s-era cartoons that are its obvious inspirations, <em>Antonblast</em> can be a little loud and immature. There’s literally a button you can press just to have your character scream. But like the best of those shows, its creators clearly had fun making an over-the-top world, and they made it damn fun to play — even when I didn’t know what was going on.</p><p><small>Antonblast<em> is available now on Nintendo Switch and Steam.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
