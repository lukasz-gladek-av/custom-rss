			<p>Black Myth Wukong, the popular action RPG developed by Game Science, is still indefinitely delayed on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S due to a memory leak issue.</p>
<p>As reported by the reliable <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exstas1s</a>, the game by Game Science released last week on PC and PlayStation 5 is still delayed indefinitely on Microsoft's consoles due to a memory leak error, which causes crashes and apparently affects the consoles as well. As such, the game still hasn't passed certification. The studio, however, is working hard to solve the issue and obtain certification, but sadly, it is not yet known when the issues will be fixed. The game is reportedly ready, so once the issue is fixed, the release shouldn't be too far off.</p>
<p>It is a shame Xbox players still cannot enjoy Black Myth Wukong, as it is an extremely solid title that is more than worthy of anyone's time. You can learn more about what makes the game one of the strongest debuts we have seen in recent times in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. It will launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on a yet to be confirmed date.</p>

			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator has been making some incredible progress in the past few days, and it is now capable of running Bloodborne at high frame rates and higher resolutions than the base release.</p>
<p>As showcased in a couple of videos shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a>, the PlayStation 4 emulator can run what is one of the console's most popular exclusive games at 1800p resolution and at high framerates, such as 120 and 144 FPS. Emulation is clearly far from being accurate, as visuals are still not rendered properly in some instances, but considering how the emulator was only able to boot the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-shadps4-bloodborne/">a few weeks ago</a>, this is incredible progress. The day Bloodborne will be fully playable on PC doesn't seem too far off in the future now.</p>

<p>ShadPS4 emulating Bloodborne properly is only the first step, as a known Souls series modder confirmed earlier this month that they are working on a remaster featuring upscaled textures, dynamic shadows, better reflections, and more. As such, PC players are still getting that coveted remaster that Sony doesn't seem interested in releasing in the near future.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/why-warframe-1999-might-be-the-games-most-important-update-in-13-years/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/why-warframe-1999-might-be-the-games-most-important-update-in-13-years/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>“You get a motorcycle!” There’s a gleam in Rebecca Ford’s eye as she recounts one of the key new elements in Warframe 1999, and one which already has players clamouring for this update to arrive. As Creative Director for Warframe, and having worked on the game for the past 13 years, you might think that this would lessen the joy of a further step on the game’s impressive roadmap, but there’s no sign of that here.</p>
<p>Perhaps it helps that the marketing for Warframe 1999 has been utterly on point for the reveal trailer, with the Nine Inch Nails-backed announcement sending collective shivers down Warframe’s immense fanbase’s spines. She tells us, “This is the wild and weird content update; our biggest in many, many, many years”. Wild and weird sounds right, and when you see that motorbike riding across the alien landscapes we’re used to seeing from Warframe, there’s a dissonance that’s both completely off-kilter, and also completely Warframe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warframe: 1999 Official Trailer | TennoCon 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ugGHOKOA9p0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It definitely doesn’t end there. “It has boy bands, motorcycles, music – the boy band are also monsters.” Rebecca adds as an aside, her smile widening further. “Warframe is like this faceless hero game, but back in 1999 there’s these humans that have come across a pretty tragic fate where they’re turning into Warframes. So you, as a character in the future, have to go back and help them and figure out what’s going on.”</p>
<p>It sounds immediately exciting, not least because of the new-old setting. When asked what came first, the narrative or the 90s, Rebecca laughs, “The 90s! We had the style, and then we had the immediate plan right away. It was like a perfect storm, 22 atoms hitting each other with great force, then this was born!”</p>

<p>Style is obviously important to Warframe, particularly with their free to play business model being built on selling additional skins to their most committed players. Warframe 1999 changes things up by being the first time we can see character’s faces, and it’s a huge thing that may or may not sit completely at ease with the current player base, though the team have an answer for that, “These are skins that transform, so if you prefer playing as a voiceless, faceless character, you can stay that way, or you can transform and become one of the human frames, and that will give you the ability to banter with each other”</p>

<p>It’s clear that 1999 is allowing the team to really flex their creative muscles, with Rebecca continuing, “It’s been a lot of fun, because we’ve never done it before. It’s just a little bit more, it’s for different people, right? Who knows if people will love it – maybe, maybe not – but we’re working with really cool actors like Ben Starr from Final Fantasy, Alpha Takashi from Cyberpunk and Amelia Tyler from Baldur’s Gate 3.”</p>
<p>Warframe 1999 is pretty deeply set within Warframe’s narrative, but Digital Extremes are working on an all-new onboarding experience for incoming players in an effort to better deal with all the new players that this update is liable to bring. “We’re updating the beginning with this new player experience – we’re happy to announce that it’s called Koumei and the Five Fates.” Rebecca continues, “This is a Japanese-inspired update that’s going to fit early in the game, and it’s going to have some truly inspirational visuals.” Fans won’t have to wait too long to see this in action, as the team will be revealing more at this year’s Tokyo Game Show in September.</p>
<p>The team aren’t unaware that this is a big change for Warframe, but they’re hoping it hits home with fans, with Rebecca telling us, “It was very risky, because the biggest risk is this – players who’ve spent 12 years, or even only a short time with their favourite characters, don’t want them to have faces, or talk. But, they’re optional characters, and though that was the risk, the reaction to them has been great.”</p>

<p>They’re doubling down on the risk though, “I think the most surprising thing is we’re actually making them dateable. So, there’s this romance system. Back in the 90s, you had your AOL, your instant messengers, and in our game we’re doing a fully functional chat room that you can build romances with these character and have romantic optional content.” Once again, this doesn’t sound like Warframe, and yet, it does.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Digital Extremes are having a lot of fun with the 1999 update, and that even 13 years into Warframe’s journey, there’s still new and exciting ways to reinvigorate the formula. Whether you’re a committed player, a lapsed fan, or a newcomer, Warframe 1999 looks like an essential experience, and one which we can’t wait for. Heck, we’re so excited we’re going to tell all our AOL friends about it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - The First Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview.963483/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Few games truly deserve the remake treatment as much as Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Arguably the best stealth-action game of its generation, back in 2004 it pushed the PlayStation 2 to its very limits – so much so that the hardware occasionally weighed down its ambitions. Twenty years later, a complete remake from Konami using the power of modern consoles has the potential to unlock the full, uncompromised vision of the game’s original creators. Instead, this new, Kojima-less Metal Gear Solid Delta seems more like a very shiny HD remaster than the elegant remake it could have been. It’s an admittedly beautiful nostalgia trip, but almost faithful to a fault.</p><p>In a recent hands-on demonstration I was able to play through Metal Gear Solid Delta’s Virtuous Mission; a complete recreation of MGS3’s prologue built in Unreal Engine 5. It looks every bit as fantastic as you’d hope, particularly when it comes to character models – faces and clothing are a real highlight. The jungle is the true star of the show, though, with modern lighting techniques helping showcase the graphical overhaul to every blade of grass, every pool of mud, and every writhing python. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater screenshots</h3></div></output><p>If you’re a Metal Gear veteran, you’ll know that the roughly 90-minute duration of the Virtuous Mission is dominated by cutscenes and codec calls. It’s not the ideal section to test drive any changes Konami has made (visuals aside) particularly since Delta uses the same dialogue audio as the original Snake Eater and thus all cinematics are frame-for-frame and line-for-line identical. But, if this slice is anything to go by, any gameplay changes are minimal. Delta appears to be a painstaking recreation of Metal Gear Solid 3 down to the millimetre. Trees stand exactly where they originally stood. The same enemies patrol the same routes. And frustratingly frequent load screens once again divide the jungle into small, self-contained maps. </p><p>This structure, perfectly preserved from the 2004 original, makes Metal Gear Solid Delta feel so much older than its new high-definition visuals. The jungle is small and claustrophobic, not because of its imposing canopy but because of its limited playspaces. The loading screens act as hard barriers, meaning what happens in one zone doesn’t impact another – alerted guards can’t chase you into a different map, for instance. This lack of continuity between each segment limits your creativity; there’s seemingly no way to cause distractions that fool enemies into investigating beyond a loading screen boundary, or line up a perfect shot across the stitching between zones. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Frustratingly frequent load screens once again divide the jungle into small, self-contained maps. </p></div><p>All of this, of course, was not just forgivable back in 2004 but expected. The PS2 simply couldn’t render an entire seamless playspace this detailed. But in 2024 the freedom of Metal Gear Solid 5’s sprawling maps, which would be perfectly at home retrofitted into Snake Eater’s Soviet wilderness, is sorely missing here. I’m reminded of Capcom’s Resident Evil 2 remake, which eliminated the original game’s iconic door-opening loading screens in favour of a more immersive, completely seamless police station. Without a similar approach, I worry that the overall play experience of MGS Delta won’t be significantly different enough from the Snake Eater HD remaster available as part of last year’s Master Collection Vol. 1 – a game with a much lower price point <em>and </em>packaged with two other truly excellent games. </p><p>After playing the demo I had the chance to talk with producer Noriaki Okamura and I asked why the team didn’t opt to bring MGS3’s map design up to date. “We did debate about this internally,” he told me. “Maybe we should reskin the game into the current open-world type map? But after thinking about this, we would definitely have to basically remake the game from scratch, and by doing so it could alter other things about the game, and we decided that’s not the direction we really wanted to take.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While the playspace of the Virtuous Mission is exactly what you remember, Konami has made some smart changes that incontestably make Delta more comfortable to play than its parent. The most important is a modernised control scheme that works in tandem with over-the-shoulder aiming, a feature pulled from the 3DS version of MGS3. This setup is practically revolutionary. The original Snake Eater used inputs that had their roots in the comparatively basic MGS1, but the increasingly complex and ambitious boss battles demanded a level of fine control that the scheme simply couldn’t keep up with. Thankfully the old, fiddly aim mechanics are now gone, replaced with contemporary trigger-based gun control that allows for easy, precise headshots. There’s nothing in the Virtuous Mission that really challenged my marksmanship, but I’m really looking forward to battling The Fury; a boss whose speed and attack patterns were an uncomfortable fit for the original game’s clunky controls.</p><p>Other welcome enhancements are a quick-dial system for your codec, allowing you to access vital functions like saving the game by tapping down on the d-pad, while the up button opens a quick-select for your camouflage. The two remaining d-pad buttons cycle through your equipment, which is a minor but solid improvement over the original scheme. </p><p>More essential is the fact that Snake can now crouch walk (another feature first included in the 3DS version), which practically feels like a necessity in a stealth game. Combined with the refreshed aiming system and modern 3D camera, Snake Eater now plays much more intuitively. However, I will caveat that by saying it does still feel like a game from a prior generation; Snake unfortunately does not move with the fluidity of his MGS5 counterpart. Again, it feels like Konami has missed a clear opportunity to bring modern enhancements to MGS Delta.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are smart changes that incontestably make Delta more comfortable to play than its parent.</p></div><p>Provided the entire game follows suit with this demo, I think your feelings on Delta are going to depend on just how faithful you want this remake to be. If you’re a purist, then you’re in luck: the new MGS team at Konami clearly sees the original Snake Eater as something of a religious text. But it means Delta’s creative vision is held prisoner by the early 2000s. Even the cutscenes feature the same fade-to-black loading between scenes as the original – something surely cinephile Kojima would have exorcised if only he’d had access to SSDs back in the day. </p><p>Beyond the updated graphics and controls, there’s nothing surprising, refreshing, or dare I say exciting about MGS Delta, at least in this demo. The only significant change we did find was that shooting Ocelot did not trigger the time paradox game over screen. It’s not clear if this omission is simply because the demo is not pulled from the final version of the game, but such a famous Kojima-ism being missing from the first press showing of Delta did raise a concerned eyebrow. Hopefully it makes it into the full release. </p><p>Okamura told me that he “wanted to avoid a situation where this series will be forgotten in time,” and that the goal of Delta was to “make sure we deliver the game as faithfully as possible so it doesn’t take away from the nostalgic aspect.” That’s a noble goal, but I can’t help but feel that was the job of the Master Collection. I had hoped Delta would have seen the team upgrade and enhance Snake Eater with ideas from The Phantom Pain and beyond, offering the same story and objectives but in a more modern, more flexible, and more reactive stealth hunting ground. That could have made it the remake to topple Resident Evil 2 from its perch. Instead, Metal Gear Solid Delta is shaping up to be little more than a prettier, more intuitive version of 2004’s most essential stealth game.</p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-gets-hour-long-new-4k-gameplay-footage-showing-off-three-different-archetypes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a> to February 18, 2025, Obsidian Entertainment continues to show off more of its upcoming game, Avowed. We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-possible-endings-now-reach-into-double-digits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> that the number of endings is double-digit, and the studio also <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-developers-confirm-30-fps-was-the-target/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the frame rate target of 30 frames per second on Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>Now, YouTuber Enfant Terrible has posted over an hour of new gameplay footage (available in gorgeous 4K resolution) that shows off three different archetypes players will find in Avowed: Blood Mage, Barbarian, and Ranger. The action RPG set in Eora, the world of Pillars of Eternity, has a classless system. As such, players will be free to customize their main character however they like, but specific playstyle can still be achieved.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, Obsidian was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxBL4jTHs5w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> by the Iron Lords Podcast. Here, Art Director Matt Hansen and Production Director Ryan Warden explained one of the less talked about systems featured in Avowed: the radial wheel, which allows players to stop time and think strategically about what they're doing next, and how companions factor in.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ryan</strong> <strong>Warden:</strong> We also have those abilities that are available to bind to the d-pad, so if you want to quickfire one of those abilities, no problem, and if you want to have a little bit more momentum in your combat experience, no problem, just quick bind that too to the d-pad. If you want Kai to come in with Fire and Ire, which is one of his abilities where he kind of draws aggro on enemies to act a little bit more as a tank, no problem, you can do that. Just quickfire that from the d-pad. Each companion has four active abilities. You're going to have to make some choices because there's only so many buttons, but you get to remap them to your heart's content.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Matt</strong> <strong>Hansen:</strong> To add on to that a little bit, each of those abilities also has a series of upgrades that you can get that can very fundamentally change how that ability works. There's lots of different ways you can build your companions and combine them, too. Kai and Marius have different ways of synergizing than Giatta and Yatzli. So much of the game is about this idea that you're stronger together with your companions.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="AVOWED Exclusive Open World Demo | The Next Big RPG like SKYRIM in Unreal Engine 5 coming in 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NCYN-HBDpA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the release date of Avowed is now set for mid-February on PC and Xbox Series S|X. However, with Microsoft already <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirming</a> the PlayStation 5 launch window of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, it's looking increasingly likely that the game may be released there at some point in the future.</p>
<p>PCs will likely offer the best experience anyway. Obsidian has&nbsp;partnered with NVIDIA to support NVIDIA DLSS 3 and ray tracing, although we don't know yet which effects will be enhanced by&nbsp;ray tracing.</p>

<p>The Esports World Cup Foundation has confirmed that the monumental competitive event will return in 2025. This was almost considered inevitable following this first iteration’s stellar success, which laid the groundwork for an annual series. We caught up with the Esports World Cup Foundation’s CEO, Ralf Reichert, and he suggested that this would be a yearly affair.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-things-in-store">Big Things In Store</h2>



<p>Saudi Arabia has plans to welcome the esports and gaming industry with open arms as it develops a ‘city’ to accommodate these super-sized tournaments. There’s a vast desire to bring publishers and developers into Riyadh, as well as stand up or host esports organisations that want to call the region home.</p>



<p>This is all part of a mission to make Saudi Arabia a leading player in these industries by 2030.</p>



<p>Here’s what CEO Ralf Reichert had to say <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-ralf-reichert-esports-world-cup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when we interviewed him last month</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In the planning process, we debated all sorts of formats for the Esports World Cup. But while we took inspiration from top international sporting events, we felt that the EWC was best as an annual event, as the world of video games and the digital age overall work on an accelerated timeline compared to others.</p>



<p>We want to build the best platform to crown the best esports Clubs each calendar year, creating a prestigious moment for players and fans to aspire to attend. No format is set in stone, but we’re happy with the way the EWC is currently unfolding.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From July to August 2025, the Esports World Cup will unravel once more, and fans are eager to learn how it’ll go bigger and better than the inaugural event. This year’s EWC saw a $60 million prize pool up for grabs, as well as an ostentatious trophy system and some of the grandest stages and ceremonies in esports.</p>



<p>It’ll be hard to top that next year, but the Esports World Cup Foundation is eager to try.</p>



<p>Now that the sun has set on this year’s event, we can look back and remember the fond memories. What was your favourite game at this year’s EWC?</p>

<section><p>Hands-On with Konami’s reverent remake of Big Boss’s debut</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">In 2016, Konami released a pachinko machine based on Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater that featured remakes of the game's iconic cutscenes. For series fans that had been hoping for full remakes of the classics--especially in a post-Kojima Konami--this amounted to a gut punch. It was the slightest hint of what a modern take on Snake Eater could look like, but to see it you'd have to be seated in a pachinko parlor instead of getting the lengthy, cinematic Metal Gear Solid experience we had come to expect.</p><p dir="ltr">Eight years later, the dream of a proper remake is being realized with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. Announced via a 2023 Playstation Showcase, questions immediately arose about what we could expect from this update. Hideo Kojima has long been absent from anything Metal Gear, and his signature style of storytelling and game direction is perhaps the series' defining feature. This first glimpse lacked the humor, flavor, and "Kojima factor" that fans expected from MGS trailers. Was Delta destined to be a soulless corporate remake of the 2004 classic?</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake Stays True To The Original</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">After playing the entire Virtuous Mission (essentially the game's prologue) at a recent Konami event in London, I'm happy to report that all signs point to Delta being the Snake Eater remake that fans have wanted for years. Unlike the polarizing Twin Snakes remake of the original Metal Gear Solid--which featured fully re-recorded VO and an egregious amount of "artistic license"--Delta seems far more interested in preserving and updating your memories of Snake Eater rather than presenting its own dramatically altered version of it.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite Hideo Kojima's messy divorce from Konami, Delta doesn't shy away from his name and direction. His credit appears numerous times before Naked Snake completes the world's first HALO jump. Yoji Shinkawa's character art shows up in character vignettes and establishing cutscenes. It's clear from the opening minutes that there is a reverence for the original work that hasn't been evident in other post-Kojima projects like the baffling Metal Gear Survive and the bare-bones Master Collection. Every cutscene feels indiscernible from the original game's, barring the dramatically improved visuals and occasional stock footage that has been replaced for copyright reasons. Even little details like holding R1 to look through Snake's eyes are perfectly replicated down to the timing of the button prompts.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you gain control of Snake (which takes a while--this is a Metal Gear game, after all), numerous welcome gameplay updates become apparent. The older MGS games always had inventory and weapon selection relegated to the trigger buttons, but by utilizing left and right on the D-pad, Delta's modernized controls share more in common with Metal Gear Solid V. A handy update allows you to swap your camo on the fly by holding up on the D-pad to quickly access the camo menu. Holding down, meanwhile, gives you quick access to your codec contacts. Your health, stamina, and camo index are now displayed in the lower middle of the screen rather than the upper corners.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the touted gameplay features of the original game was its CQC (close quarters combat) system. It allowed for a lot more than just snapping the necks of guards: You could interrogate them, slit their throats, toss them to the ground, or use them as a human shield. While it allowed for more variety, it was easy to perform unintended actions thanks to its specific required inputs and utilization of the PS2's pressure-sensitive face buttons. You'll no longer need to whip out a manual, do a Google search, or call The Boss to remind you of "the basics of CQC" thanks to Delta's useful tooltip system. Just grab a hold of an enemy with the right trigger and all of your options will be handily laid out onscreen for you.</p><p dir="ltr">This system will also remind you of Snake's potential actions in various combat scenarios. As I dangled off a bridge to avoid detection, I forgot that Snake could aim and shoot with one hand. Thanks to the tooltip, I pulled out my tranquilizer pistol and neutralized the approaching guard before he had a chance to discover me. While Snake always had these abilities, the quality-of-life updates in Delta reminded me of them and I wound up using them more as a result.</p><p dir="ltr">With modern action games eschewing frequent load times, it's natural to wonder if Delta's gameplay zones would remain cordoned off into their own sections or if they'd be stitched together into a larger contiguous world. As is the case with most aspects of this remake, the developers have chosen to remain true to the flow of the original. You won't encounter any real load times when moving between areas, but the screen still fades to black and comes back in displaying the name of the new area just like in the original. This adherence to the experience of the original applies to most aspects of the gameplay. It's not like this is suddenly Breath of the Wild and Snake can climb every tree and scale rock faces. He's still limited to climbing the same ivy-covered trees that were there in 2004re.</p><p dir="ltr">Personality hasn't been sacrificed in the pursuit of realism. Giant anacondas will still become neatly packaged in to-go boxes upon their death. Guards flail and sprint away like cartoon characters when you shoot down a beehive in their vicinity. You'll still be alerted that you've created a time paradox when you die. Naked Snake still dons a Raiden mask if you select "I like MGS2!" at the outset of your mission. I wasn't greeted with an Old Snake mask when I selected "I like MGS4!" however, so it remains to be seen what the other game selections do.</p><p dir="ltr">One of my few complaints about the original game was the cumbersome Survival Viewer and curing system. When Snake took damage, you'd frequently have to go into a menu to perform a series of actions to repair his various wounds. There's a world where this could have been cool. After all, Rambo was pretty badass when he cauterized his wound by packing it with gunpowder and lighting it. In this case, selecting numerous styptics and suture kits from a menu wasn't exactly an immersive experience. It remains to be seen if this system will be as intrusive in Delta, as it isn't introduced until just after the Virtuous Mission in the original game. That said, I did see a grayed-out "Cure" option in the Survival Viewer menu, so it's likely back in some form.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of truly new content, I did discover a bit during my 90 minutes with the game. Snake's initial bag of gear grants you a compass that presents cardinal directions as well as an objective indicator in the lower left corner of the screen. Rolling is given its own dedicated button (Triangle), and you can now dive to the ground from a standing position. On top of the returning Kerotan frogs, I encountered one camouflaged GA-KO duck. It was draped in what appeared to be a ghillie suit, which went up in flames when I shot it and caused the duck to start hopping and quacking. It's unclear at this point what this accomplishes or if they're just a bonus collectible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356825-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356825" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356825-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356825"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356825-3.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356833-knm_mgs_delta_collectable_ga-ko.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356834-knm_mgs_delta_cutscene_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356835-knm_mgs_delta_cutscene_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356836-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356837-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356838-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356839-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356840-knm_mgs_delta_radio.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356841-knm_mgs_delta_ui_shortcutmenu_camouflage.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356842-knm_mgs_delta_ui_shortcutmenu_radio.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356833,1300-4356834,1300-4356835,1300-4356836,1300-4356837,1300-4356838,1300-4356839,1300-4356840,1300-4356841,1300-4356842" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356833-knm_mgs_delta_collectable_ga-ko.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356834-knm_mgs_delta_cutscene_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356835-knm_mgs_delta_cutscene_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356836-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356837-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356838-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356839-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356840-knm_mgs_delta_radio.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356841-knm_mgs_delta_ui_shortcutmenu_camouflage.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4356842-knm_mgs_delta_ui_shortcutmenu_radio.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356833-knm_mgs_delta_collectable_ga-ko.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356834-knm_mgs_delta_cutscene_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356835-knm_mgs_delta_cutscene_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356836-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356837-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356838-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356839-knm_mgs_delta_gameplay_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356840-knm_mgs_delta_radio.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356841-knm_mgs_delta_ui_shortcutmenu_camouflage.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4356842-knm_mgs_delta_ui_shortcutmenu_radio.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Of course, the most obvious upgrade is the visual presentation. Delta does not disappoint in this area. The lush jungle features far more detail than before, with additional ambient wildlife and tons of little details like Snake trudging through the mud and leaving a distinct trail. As Snake takes damage over time, it will be permanently reflected on his body and clothing during gameplay and cutscenes. All of the characters look fantastic and true to the original designs too. Volgin's scars are deep and detailed, The End's eye pop is unsettling, and The Sorrow's blood rain is much more pronounced. My demo was locked to a 30fps fidelity mode, but the final release promises a 60fps performance option.</p><p dir="ltr">On the remake spectrum, Delta's ambitions fall somewhere between the enhanced visuals and quality-of-life upgrades of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD and the substantial Resident Evil reimaginings in recent years. It certainly isn't attempting to change things up as much as the newer Final Fantasy VII titles. This is a relatively straightforward, modernized remake of the original, which is in no way a complaint. Snake Eater has such a distinct personality that to make too many tweaks would risk losing much of what made it special. Delta's dev team is walking a tightrope with such a beloved title, and everything I saw during my return to the Virtuous Mission has me confident that they're handling this with a deft hand.</p>

			<p>Monster Trucks are absolute beasts. Take El Toro as an example – who is a literal beast, being custom clad in a raging bull motif – who weighs in at a bonkers 12,000 pounds, yet has enough bull-power to go from zero to thirty miles per hour in only 1.52 seconds. Then there’s Megalodon, who, despite have a non-aerodynamic, extremely enormous blue shark stuffed on its chassis, can reach top speeds of 70mph. Just the tyres of these things alone is awe-inspiring – an immense 66 inches tall and 44 inches wide – yet somehow significantly less-inflated than the tires of my humble Nissan Micra. Apparently, it’s all to do with truck bounce.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Jam Showdown Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dDOSzKd-mX4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Considering all these admirable qualities, it’s a shame that the monster trucks of the brand-new official Monster Jam game offer an absolutely pathetic driving experience. They handle like lubed up bricks, have the consistency of paper mâché, ignore physics – not in a fun way – and go about as fast as me in my Micra up a hill on a windy day.</p>


<p>Perhaps I’m getting ahead of myself, Monster Jam: Showdown is the latest game featuring vehicles from the world-leading Monster Truck league. This outing has been developed by racing game specialists Milestone; so, it’s understandable that expectations are high. From a looks point-of-view, Monster Jam Showdown certainly delivers.</p>
<p>The 40 unlockable Monster Trucks you’ll find all look resplendent, rendered to an exhausting level of detail in Unreal Engine 5. All the crowd favourites are ultimately available to race; including, Grave Digger, MAX-D, and Zombie. Thing is, most of them are hidden behind a tedious check list of challenges that you must tick off. Unlike the Monster Jam Steel Titans series, there are no puzzles to solve to find new trucks. Instead, you’ll engage in thrilling activities, such as… do the same race several times. As such, unlocking new trucks to gawp at is quite the chore.</p>


<p>Amazingly, even more uninspiring is the actual racing. The AI trucks are likely the most boring opponents you could ask for. Despite looking exiting and dangerous, they drive like a learner on test day. Each truck ambles along on its prescribed racing line and never alters from its intended route. Heck, you can ram an AI truck, and it will shrug you off and dawdle along as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>Matters are made worse by the nonsensical physics. Hit an AI truck at full speed and it will no-sell your attack like the Undertaker in his WWE hey-day, whilst your vehicle will crumple like a paper aeroplane and launch itself into a series of impossible flips – forcing a likely race-losing respawn. The same is true of hitting any object in the environment; with the terrible collision detection regularly trapping your truck against the invisible wall surrounding rocks, trees and roadside debris – again forcing a respawn.</p>
<p>No matter how you tinker with the settings, the controls are abominable. Either your truck just drives itself, or it skids around aimlessly as soon as you even think about touching a thumb stick. The best way to win a race is simply to drive unbelievably slowly and cautiously, edging around a corner like you are driving in a blizzard. This, of course, robs the game of any of the obvious enjoyment that should come with zooming around in a humongous Monster Truck at the national speed limit. Stunt races, where you rack up points performing outrageous manoeuvres like backflips and barrel rolls, are marginally more enjoyable. Yet they still suffer from the nonsensical controls as well as point allocation that appears entirely random.</p>

<p>Online and split-screen multiplayer are rather more fun, simply because other players drive in a far more interesting manner than the dull as dish-water AI. But still the confounding controls and tediously slow gameplay ultimately rob the experience of any enjoyment it might have had.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		A game about racing massive trucks that look like dinosaurs should not be boring, and yet Monster Jam: Showdown achieves the seemingly impossible; this game is an absolutely slog of an experience. Best avoided, even for Monster Truck loving aficionados.	</p></div>

			<p>Steam's concurrent player record has been broken again. The newest data shows that the platform managed to attract over 37 million users over the weekend, breaking the previous record of 36 million users <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-another-record-with-36-million-concurrent-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set </a>five months ago. It's no surprise that Steam has had such huge activity recently, given the hype in the gaming industry following Gamescom 2024 and the release of the highly anticipated Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p>New <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/">data from SteamDB</a> shows that the platform has now seen a peak concurrent player count of 37.2 million, breaking its previous record. Steam has seen massive growth over a matter of days in player count, and we all know the reason behind this is the release of the iconic Black Myth: Wukong, which has managed to break all industry records when it comes to single-player titles since the game is now second only to PUBG regarding concurrent users peak.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Just recently, we reported on how Black Myth: Wukong has <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sells-a-whopping-10-million-copies-in-just-three-days-surpassing-industry-records/">sold 10 million copies in just three days</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring/">hit 2.3 million concurrent players on Steam</a>, that too in quite a short time span. For those unaware of why Black Myth: Wukong is such a huge success, the title's rich storytelling, stunning visuals, and unique take on the action RPG formula have attracted the attention of several gamers.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The title's close attachment to Chinese cultures and traditions is one of the main reasons why there have been a massive number of players from China, nearly accounting for 80% of the total user base. The title has also surpassed its expectations and received massive hype at launch, which is why it has been a huge success in the markets.</p>
<p>Since it was Black Myth: Wukong's first weekend, we expected records to be broken. Moving into the future, the title will surely be remembered as one of the most successful in the industry.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/concord-update-matchmaking-rivalry-ps5-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/firewalk-studios">Firewalk Studios</a> have released a new <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> update for PlayStation 5 and PC (Steam and Epic). The new patch – showing as version 01.003.006 on PS5- is now available to download and includes a small number of fixes. Note that you will need to install this new Concord update in order to play the game and access online features.</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Launch Trailer I PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQB_2FF2G1o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With the game having only officially launched a couple of days ago, this patch is aimed at fixing smaller issues flagged by the player community. The big one here is the option to requeue after a match is finished should now be visible to players, allowing them to hop back into matchmaking quicker.</p>
<p>Firewalk has also lowered the level requirement needed to access Concord’s “Rivalry” game mode playlist. This includes Cargo Run and Clash Point which can both be considered more advanced, competitive modes played across multiple rounds with no respawns. Keeping greenhorn Freegunners away from these modes makes sense though, as a result, it’s likely that queue times for Rivalry are suffering as a result.</p>
<p>Our Concord review will be dropping later this week though our initial feedback is positive. Gunplay and player movement are satisfyingly smooth with enough depth to the hero roster to keep matches feeling dynamic. With that said, sentiment surrounding the game has continued to be negative since it was properly showcase for the first time earlier this year by Sony. If you want to read more, we’ve written a short analysis on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/24/why-do-gamers-want-concord-to-fail/">why gamers want Concord to fail</a>.</p>

<h3>Concord Update 01.003.006 Patch Notes</h3>
<p><strong>Gameplay Changes &amp; Tuning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made changes to Rivalry modes – Reduced level for entry and added bonus XP rewards.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In-game Issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Issues seen with the Requeue option not being available should be resolved.</li>
<li>Inconsistency in Business Card Stats should be resolved.</li>
<li>General performance optimizations and minor fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with Time Trial Leaderboards not showing appropriate data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Concord is available now on PlayStation 5 and PC (via Steam and Epic). The game has a launch price tag of £34.99 and doesn’t feature F2P monetisation features such as loot boxes or battle passes.</p>

<p>The Esports World Cup 2024 has officially come to an end, and one of its biggest games, Rocket League, helped close out the Sunday ceremony with its Grand Finals. With some of the biggest names competing this last week for the first-place victory, the Rocket League competition was nothing short of astounding.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-team-bds-wins-grand-finals-at-the-esports-world-cup">Team BDS Wins Grand Finals At The Esports World Cup</h2>



<p>In a best-of-seven competition, Team BDS managed to walk away with first place during the Esports World Cup 2024. The popular team faced off against Team Falcons, winning 4-2. While Team BDS might have won quite easily in the Grand Finals, it was a tough road to make it there. </p>



<p>The team had barely made it out of the Quarter Finals, defeating Spacestation Gaming by only one game, where they then won against Gen.G Gaming during the Semi-Finals by two games.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Regardless, the team had a hard-fought victory against Team Falcons, certifying themselves as the Rocket League Esports World Cup 2024 champions. </p>



<p>The team took home a whopping $200,000 in prizing, proving to the world that they are the best when it comes to Rocket League.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-team-bds-wins-first-major-title-since-2022-rlcs-world-championship">Team BDS Wins First Major Title Since 2022 RLCS World Championship</h2>



<p>The popular Rocket League team has struggled over the past few years to take home any first-place titles, with them not making it out of the Semi-Finals during last year’s Gamers8 tournament. </p>



<p>The team, though, decided that enough was enough. With their last first-place title for a major tournament being back in 2022 during the RLCS World Championship, the Swiss esports team made it clear to the world that they are not to be trifled with.</p>



<p>Now, the question stands, will Team BDS be able to hold onto this momentum going into next year?</p>

<p>After a week of heavy competition, Soniqs has officially come in first at the PUBG: Battlegrounds Esports World Cup 2024. The American esports team walked out with the first-place trophy, only having a four-point lead ahead of Petrichor Road, the Chinese esports team.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-soniqs-dominates-pubg-battlegrounds-esports-world-cup">Soniqs Dominates PUBG: Battlegrounds Esports World Cup</h2>



<p>The 2024 Esports World Cup has officially come to an end, and the PUBG: Battlegrounds tournament portion did not lack any heat. With some of the best teams in PUBG history competing against one another, fans were able to experience one of the biggest Battle Royale tournaments of all time.</p>



<p>And it would seem like Soniqs was ready to cement their name in PUBG history. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The popular American esports team started out somewhat weak, placing 20th in their first game. In rounds 2-6, though, the team found themselves within the top 10 in each game. In fact, they even won Round 6. </p>



<p>This momentum was handled well, as Soniqs continued to dominate throughout the rest of the tournament. The team finished with 113 points, played over 12 games, and walked away with $700,000 in prize earnings.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-petrichor-road-struggles-to-grab-first-with-faze-clan-falling-behind-in-third">Petrichor Road Struggles To Grab First, With FaZe Clan Falling Behind In Third</h2>



<p>With some huge teams competing in the PUBG: Battlegrounds Esports World Cup 2024, many organizations struggled to keep up with the likes of Soniqs. A few teams, though, that did stay at the top of the leaderboard, were Petrichor Road and FaZe Clan.</p>



<p>Petrichor Road fell behind first by only four points and FaZe Clan dropped behind second by only five points. TSM even took home fourth place, scoring only six points lower than FaZe. However, KWANGDONG FREECS placed fifth in the tournament, 12 points behind TSM.</p>



<p>While the points margin drastically changed going down the leaderboards, the top teams were still able to keep in close quarters with each other, making the Grand Finals incredibly competitive.</p>

<p>What a wonderful day for esports. Popular Valorant team, Edward Gaming, has officially won the Valorant Champions 2024 tour, placing first during the championship against Team Heretics. Both teams have been battling it out through a bracket in South Korea since the beginning of August, with today marking the official Championship. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-edward-gaming-defeats-team-heretics-to-win-valorant-champions-2024">Edward Gaming Defeats Team Heretics To Win Valorant Champions 2024</h2>



<p>Not only did Edward Gaming win first place, but the team based out of Shanghai, China, also walked away with a whopping $1 million. The team closed out the month-long tournament series with a 3-2 win against Team Heretics, making their victory dangerously close to being a loss. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>But regardless of how close the matches were, Edward Gaming still managed to hold onto that momentum that had already gotten them so far within the series. Cementing themselves in esports history, Edward Gaming now has their first Valorant Champions victory, while still qualifying for the series during the 2022 and 2023 events.</p>



<p>The team is also the first Chinese esports organization to reach $1 million in earnings, putting them above all other teams in their nation.</p>



<h4 id="h-edward-gaming-s-current-valorant-roster">Edward Gaming’s Current Valorant Roster:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Shou “Aqua” Wenjun</li>



<li>Tang “Muggle” Shijun</li>



<li>Chu “Ed Chu” Aide</li>



<li>Xu “Xiaoxu” Yilai</li>



<li>Li “JuiceFlip” Junsheng</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-team-heretics-falls-short-of-victory-in-valorant-champions-2024">Team Heretics Falls Short Of Victory In Valorant Champions 2024</h2>



<p>While Team Heretics may not have walked out in first place, the team still had quite a victorious season this year. The team also placed second back in June at the VCT 2024: Masters Shanghai event, winning $200,000.</p>



<p>Their second place during the final Valorant Champions 2024 event awarded them $400,000, which is still a massive amount of cash to walk away with.</p>



<p>With star players such as Benjyfishy and Wo0t on their roster, Team Heretics already has a solid chance at breaking out of that second-place curse next year. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-black-myth-wukong-dnc-content-creators<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why can’t people just play a game, say it’s fine, and move on anymore? Why does everything – whether it’s a finite single-player experience like <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> or a <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-controversy-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stab at live-service immortality</a> like <em>Helldivers 2</em> – <a href="https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-to-know-how-many-people-are-playing-a-singleplayer-video-game-nobody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devolve into a numbers-driven culture war battleground</a>? On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about how fandom has skewed people’s understanding of why we engage with works in the first place.</p><p>Before we get to that, though, we’re joined by Wired’s Makena Kelly to discuss <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dnc-influencer-convention/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content creators at the Democratic National Convention</a> (a topic I’ll be covering in more depth next week). Was it a savvy move on Democrats’ part to give them press access? Did they do a better job of shining light on protesters and their causes than traditional press? And what was the deal with all the rumblings of conflict between creators and journalists?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, a Chinese action-RPG that’s taken Steam by storm, but not without its fair share of controversy. After much ado about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexist undercurrents</a> at the studio that made it and <a href="https://aftermath.site/black-myth-wukong-feminist-propaganda-politics-twitch-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">streaming restrictions</a> that asked content creators not to talk about “feminist propaganda,” the game is, like so many others at the heart of endless culture wars… fine. Then we wrap up by figuring out popular video game characters’ political affiliations (Sonic is an anarchist, Mario is center-right, and Zelda has probably overseen at least a handful of drone bombings).&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can grow large enough that somebody will one day wage a culture war over <em>our </em>concurrent player count.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The reason why people care so much about concurrent players – even though it makes no sense in the context of a single-player game – is because it’s one of the few metrics people can point to and say “Look, we’re winning the culture war. Here’s a number that says we’re winning. Number goes up or number goes down, and – you can do this in either direction, since numbers are never entirely steady – you can say “Ah, our side is winning.”</p><p>I’ve seen this a lot with smaller games that come from indie developers – that are focused on more diverse casts and things like that. There’s the new game from Red Thread, the company headed up by Ragnar Tornquist, who made <em>Longest Journey</em> back in the day. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/721180/Dustborn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dustborn</em></a>, is what it’s called. It has a diverse cast and tries to deal with a lot of serious issues. But it hasn’t performed that well on Steam, so people are saying “Nobody wants these games. They’re doing badly. They’re made by bad people. This validates our stance in the culture war.” Even though single-player games that are made by relatively small teams are not gonna attract millions of players or hundreds of thousands of players – and in fact can sell slowly over time and recoup their costs. It’s a different scale of production.&nbsp;</p><p>But it doesn’t matter to any of these people. They’re all using the same standard of judgment and saying that if you’re not hitting massive triple-A numbers or live service numbers, then you’re nothing, and that proves that you don’t matter, nobody cares, and actually every game should be the same game about the same white guy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Bleeding Cool or Comic Book Resource or whatever don’t need to be reporting on box office numbers while a movie is only three days old or rating single episodes of a TV series while it’s still running. It’s a series that’s got an overarching story to tell. We don’t need to be breaking everything down into numbers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I did actually calculate the gross for an internship once. That was my job. I worked at ThinkFilm for a minute in film school, and they were like “Here are all the ticket stubs. Here are all the takes from these things.” In retrospect, I don’t think I should have been doing that. I think that’s not something you want to trust your intern to do.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> Well that’s part of why [I said what I said earlier]. I’m definitely guilty of having done this in the past. We all would be to some degree. The need to constantly be posting and providing fresh stories and fresh SEO hits for a modern media website has you looking at those numbers and thinking they’re news.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> For multiplayer games, they’re also germane. With <a href="https://aftermath.site/savetf2-you-can-finally-play-team-fortress-2-again-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Team Fortress</em> thing</a>, I think it’s important to be like “How many people here are bots?”</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> Yeah, because a multiplayer game is reliant on the size of the player base to an extent.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Even then, though, that can be germane, but you’ve gotta contextualize it, and you’ve really gotta work to do that, because people will look at a game like <em>Helldivers 2</em> and say it’s a failure because of bad updates. Meanwhile, it still gets up to 50,000 concurrent players sometimes. That’s more players than most games!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s made its money. They’re good for a very long time. I will say for me, though, there’s this element of, every time I see somebody who gets that way about box office stuff, I’m like “Do you own stock? Are you a shareholder?” Because if not, I don’t see why you fucking care.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Did you like the movie or not, man? That’s all that should matter to you.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> If you do [own stock], I get it. If you put all your money into Tencent, and you want to be like “Oh, the numbers,” then sure.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it’s a byproduct of the fact that people in many ways feel powerless to express themselves and their values beyond consumption. And so they’re like “I’m gonna be the ultimate consumer. I’m gonna show that the things I consume are more right and just than the things other people consume, and that bears itself out in the number of people consuming them. If my thing is more popular, then my views are better and more popular. I’m the best and the most normal.”</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I just thought of the term “emotional shareholder” for fandom.
