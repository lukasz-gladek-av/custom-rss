            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-be-even-better-than-tsushima-says-shuhei-yoshida/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In late April, Sucker Punch <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the release date of Ghost of Yōtei. The sequel to 2020's Ghost of Tsushima will be released on October 2, 2025, for Sony's PlayStation 5 console.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that it's one of the most anticipated games of the year. After all, its predecessor was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an excellent action/adventure game</a> that also set a new sales record for PlayStation 4's first-party debut. The superb reception pushed Sony to fast-track not only a sequel but also a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-in-production-to-be-directed-by-john-wicks-chad-stahelski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movie adaptation</a> that will be directed by John Wick's Chad Stahelski.</p>
<p>Can Ghost of Yōtei meet&nbsp;<span>fans' lofty expectations, though?&nbsp;<a href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to the French website PlayStation Inside</a>, former head of PlayStation Studios Shuhei Yoshida revealed that he played the game, and fans can be assured that </span>it'll be even better than the first installment.</p>
<p><em>In the case of Ghost of Tsushima, Sucker Punch worked extensively with a Japanese producer at SIE, as well as colleagues at Japan Studio. This was a great help to the studio because the developers could show them their ideas and these Japanese people would tell them internally whether or not they were respectful of Japan and correct. The teams also visited Tsushima Island and made a real effort to immerse themselves in its history and traditions. They managed to capture the island’s unique atmosphere, which can be felt in the game, for example in the wind system, and I think that’s why it’s so successful. The game has even boosted tourism on Tsushima Island, which says a lot.</em></p>
<p><em>So, if you want to sell well in Japan, especially when you’re making a game about Japan, it’s important to have a development process that seeks to understand the country throughout. Ghost of Tsushima felt incredible to play, and having played Ghost of Yotei at several stages of its development, I can assure you that it will be even better and that Sucker Punch has done it again!</em></p>
<p>Shortly after the launch date news, Sucker Punch <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-ghost-of-yotei-details-from-sucker-punch-dig-into-yoteis-non-linear-campaign-story-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> new details about this new game. The developers said this is their biggest world with the greatest amount of player freedom. The campaign where protagonist Atsu seeks her revenge will be non-linear, meaning that players can take on the Yōtei Six (who killed Atsu's family) in any order.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/new-ecco-the-dolphin-game-on-the-way-reviving-the-mega-drive-icon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new Ecco the Dolphin game is in development, alongside remasters of the original two Mega Drive games.</p>
<p>The new game will have "contemporary play and GPU sensibilities" and has been revealed alongside a new countdown on the <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">game's website</a>. It's unclear if this is counting to a final release date or further news, but either way it's currently 8510 hours away - that's 354 days and 14 hours from now, which points to 25th April 2026.</p>
<p>News of a new entry was confirmed by series creator Ed Annunziata in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">Xbox Wire</a>, as part of a celebration of Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.</p>

</figure>
<p>Annunziata and the entire original team are behind both the remasters and the new project.</p>
<p>Ecco the Dolphin was first released in 1992 for the Mega Drive and was followed by a sequel, The Tides of Time, in 1994.</p>
<p>Both games are 2D side-scrollers focused on the titular Ecco, who explores vibrant ocean environments with his sonar abilities. I still have my copy of the first game from when I was a kid: its shimmering oceans are gorgeous, but the puzzle gameplay gets very hard very quickly - not to mention its incredibly weird, alien story.</p>
<p>It's unknown yet if the new game will be 2D or 3D, but the original games were followed by the 3D Defender of the Future on the Dreamcast, though Annunziata wasn't involved with this one.</p>
<p>That game is not as well regarded and its proposed sequel was cancelled due to declining sales of the Dreamcast. Annunziata attempted to raise a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ecco-the-dolphin-creator-launches-kickstarter-for-spiritual-successor-the-big-blue">Kickstarter for a spiritual successor back in 2013</a>, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Speaking to Xbox Wire, Annunziata discussed the role of the gaming community in raising awareness about global issues.</p>
<p>"I feel gamers possess a higher than average IQ than the average human," he said. "Not only because they are frequently fully engaged and challenged mentally with real-time systems and information technology, but they are highly socially connected as well. Like the ocean, a gaming community is an ecosystem – games like Ecco can and should be a conduit to join these realms.</p>
<p>"I have high expectations of gamers for all the above-stated reasons. But there is something else gamers possess that can make the difference, and that is love. A universal love of games and gaming gives us all something we all share, when games like Ecco reach the hearts of gaming communities, that love can really make things happen in the real world."</p>
<p>Back in January of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/freshly-filed-sega-trademarks-hint-at-the-return-of-another-classic-series-25-years-after-its-last-entry">Sega filed a new trademark for Ecco the Dolphin</a>, hinting a new project was on the way.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I once got in a heated debate with Graham over whether the chest-high walls in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war">Gears Of War</a> series could accurately be called 'massive'. The Gears men are massive, I argued. So it stands to reason that any wall that could provide adequate bullet cover to a massive man must itself be a massive wall. No, said Graham. They're famously normal size walls, hence why the massive men have to squat down like they've just had a bowling ball lobbed at their kidneys. Well, we can finally examine the true scale of these walls - in 4K no less - with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-reloaded">Gears Of War: Reloaded</a>. A "faithfully remastered" version of the 2006 large man <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a>, coming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523720/Gears_of_War_Reloaded/">to Steam on August 26th</a> this year.</p>
<p>I couldn't find a trailer so enjoy this extremely old one and just imagine it looks nicer. Bit nicer. Little bit nicer. That's it, now you're thinking like a customer!</p>

<p>The announcement was announced by the announcement professionals at <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/">Xbox Wire</a>. It'll be $40 to buy, and also available on that game subscription service you<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections"> may or may not want to support right now</a>. The blog mentions "split screen" although doesn't use the words "local co-op" specifically. Reloaded has "the full breadth of content from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a>", itself a remaster with some added bonuses, namely the five extra chapters previously exclusive to the original Windows release. Here are some Gamer Stats for you, gamer:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>4K resolution</li>
<li>60 FPS in Campaign</li>
<li>120 FPS in Multiplayer</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</li>
<li>Dolby Vision &amp; 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos</li>
<li>7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio</li>
<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</li>
<li>4K assets and remastered textures</li>
<li>Enhanced post-processing visual effects</li>
<li>Improved shadows and reflections</li>
<li>Super resolution with improved anti-aliasing</li>
<li>Zero loading screens during Campaign</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>My claim to fame is that I'm one of the seven people in the world that had played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Switch_(video_game)#Legacy">Kill Switch</a> prior to the original Gears. That's the 2003 PS2 game that effectively invented the contemporary cover shooter, complete with blindfire. If anything needed a modern remaster, that feels like the far more important project to me, essential piece of gaming history that it is. It's <a href="https://www.myabandonware.com/game/kill-switch-e3s">currently available as abandonware</a> if you're curious.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Another one of Microsoft's key franchises will arrive on PlayStation this year, via a revamped edition of the original Gears of War game.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded's announcement comes almost 20 years since the series first made its Xbox debut.</p>
<p>This modernised version of the original Gears of War will launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th August. It will cost $40, and also be available via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has been developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief. It will feature faster frame rates and "deeper visual fidelity", with the studios promising "clarity, smoothness, and immersion that matches the power of today's hardware", Microsoft has said.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/">laid out in an Xbox post</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded players can expect the following enhancements on the game's release this summer:</p>
<ul>
<li>4K resolution</li>
<li>60 FPS in Campaign</li>
<li>120 FPS in Multiplayer</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</li>
<li>Dolby Vision &amp; 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos</li>
<li>7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio</li>
<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</li>
<li>4K assets and remastered textures</li>
<li>Enhanced post-processing visual effects</li>
<li>Improved shadows and reflections</li>
<li>Super resolution with improved anti-aliasing</li>
<li>Zero loading screens during Campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>Reloaded will also boast some platform specific features, and support cross-play and cross-progression.</p>

<p>Those who already own the digital version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a> will receive a free upgrade to Gears of War: Reloaded, but only if they purchased the game prior to this announcement. So, if you decide to plump for Gears of War: Ultimate Edition on Xbox now, you will not be eligible for that free upgrade when Reloaded releases.</p>
<p>"As we approach the 20th anniversary of Gears of War in 2026, we're reflecting on what this franchise means. It's about the stories we've told, the friendships we've built, and the unforgettable moments we've shared together," The Coalition studio head Mike Crump said yesterday. </p>
<p>"With Gears of War: Reloaded, we're opening that door to more players than ever."</p>

Gears of War: E-Day is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-studio-confirms-project-maverick-is-a-gears-of-war-game">being co-developed with People Can Fly</a>. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-doesn%E2%80%99t-mandate-generative-ai-usage-for-its-gaming-studios-confirms-south-of-midnight-developer.1181736/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-doesnt-mandate-generative-ai-usage-for-its-gaming-studios-confirms-south-of-midnight-developer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's no secret that Microsoft has been betting heavily on generative AI ever since its early investments in OpenAI. Even on the gaming front, they've <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-blows-up-at-gdc-2024-between-ubisofts-neo-npcs-xboxs-narrative-graph-tool-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with Inworld AI</a> to create a generative AI powered game development tool called Narrative Graph.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/compulsion-games-boss-says-internal-xbox-studios-aren-t-facing-generative-ai-mandate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speaking to Game Developer</a> during the recent Gamescom LATAM, Compulsion Games founder and studio head Guillaume Provost revealed that Microsoft is not forcing its usage on Xbox Game Studios.</p>
<p><em>I can absolutely guarantee that generative AI usage is not mandated. You're talking to the studio that literally builds shit by hand. In the DNA of the studio that we have, we're very craft oriented. We're very art oriented. Just based on the types of games that we make, I would say we are probably not the studio that will use AI the most, and I don't think that bothers anything at Microsoft. The DNA of our studio is to handcraft things and to make them feel handcrafted, and that involves a lot of manual labor.</em></p>
<p>Provost later admitted that generative AI could still prove useful even for Compulsion's approach to development.</p>
<p><em>I think there are a lot of cases where it could be helpful in pre-production for us to do things like spitting out storyboards for us to see whether it makes sense or not— not really stuff that we use in production, but stuff that we want to accelerate.</em></p>
<p>Compulsion Games recently released the&nbsp;<span>single-player action/adventure game South of Midnight. In another interview&nbsp;<a href="https://gamerant.com/south-midnight-sales-milestone-1-million-players-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Game Rant</a>, Provost confirmed that the game had already reached over a million players. Granted, its availability on the Microsoft owned subscription service Game Pass certainly helped a great deal</span>. However, it's still a fairly important milestone for the Montreal-based developer previously known for Contrast and We Happy Few.</p>
<p>South of Midnight received a 7/10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> written by David Carcasole:</p>
<p><em>Overall, South of Midnight has excellent storytelling, excellent artistic and visual design, a wonderful cast of characters and voice actors, and an original soundtrack that punctuates each big narrative beat in a way that will stay with you long after you put the controller down. Unfortunately, the same creativity that went into the rest of the game is missing in its combat and platforming, and Compulsion Games does itself no favors by launching you into the same boring combat scenarios again and again in each level.</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roaring-kitty-is-apparently-back-to-his-gamestop-pumping-ways/">GameStop</a> has sold its Canadian branch, GameStop Canada, to French-Canadian entrepreneur and McFarlane Toys co-owner Stephan Tetrault, who has also confirmed that the retailer will re-launch as Electronics Boutique Canada Inc., or EB Games Canada.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer of GameStop, Ryan Cohen, <a href="https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1891884823465103698">announced back in February</a> that he was looking to sell the Canadian division of the company, telling interested parties to email GameStop's mergers and acquisitions division, saying "<em>High taxes, Liberalism, Socialism, Progressivism, Wokeness and DEI included at no additional cost if you buy today!</em>"</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stephan-tetrault-acquires-gamestop-canada-302446106.html">press release</a> regarding the acquisition, Tetrault says, "<em>This isn't just a business decision - it's about bringing something back that Canadians truly loved. We're going to build something special here, with community, nostalgia, and innovation at its heart</em>."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a report from <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gamestop-selling-canadian-assets-ceo-wokeness-dei-1.7462542">The Canadian Press</a> put the number of Canadian GameStop stores at 203, though that was before GameStop <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/03/26/gamestop-close-significant-number-locations-report/">confirmed it would be shutting down</a> more of its locations worldwide, Canada included. The press release for today's acquisition puts the current number at "<em>over 185</em>" locations.</p>
<p>"<em>We want EB Games Canada to be more than a store,</em>" adds GameStop Canada president Jim Tyo. "<em>We want it to be the hub for gaming and fandom culture across Canada. This is about passion, and that's what's going to drive every decision we make</em>."</p>
<p>The transition from GameStop Canada to EB Games Canada will begin across the country in the coming months, including new store signage, a new website, and new branding across all social platforms. Canadians will surely have whiplash over the change since many remember that it wasn't too long ago that <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8066111/gamestop-eb-games-canada-rebrand/">GameStop sunsetted&nbsp;the EB Games branding in Canada</a>, with every EB Games becoming a GameStop.</p>
<p>Gamers have been lamenting the poor practices that GameStop perpetuates and how the stores have begun to sell more toys and Pop Funkos than games. It'll be interesting to see how Tetrault tries to turn things around, and if he can bring more gamers back to the retail store after many have turned their backs on buying from GameStop for years.</p>

It looks like Christopher McQuarrie, who directed <em>Rogue Nation</em> and <em>Fallout</em> as well, had entire portions of the sub’s interior recreated for the scenes. Hopefully, in addition to whatever new ways Cruise finds to make his insurance agents squirm, the sequence doesn’t lean on post-production special effects to make an impact. </p><p>This isn’t <em>Mission: Impossible</em>’s first major water stunt. <em>Rogue Nation</em> saw Cruise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-tom-cruise-underwater-filmed-how/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-tom-cruise-underwater-filmed-how/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hold his breath for 6 minutes</a></span> in a scene where his character, Ethan Hunt, had to unlock a hatch while swirling around a giant server-cooling tank. And that scene only came about after Cruise filmed <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, for which McQuarrie helped write the script, which ends with his character diving underwater beneath the Louvre Pyramid in Paris to kill a giant alien.</p><p><em>The Final Reckoning </em>hits theaters in just a few weeks on May 23, and brings with it a lot of questions beyond whether Cruise and the franchise still have new tricks up their sleeves. For one, there’s the question of how the movie will make good on the many callbacks to earlier entries in the franchise teased in the trailers, and what it will tell us about how Hunt came to join the IMF in the first place, a plot thread hinted at in <em>Dead Reckoning</em>. The biggest question of all, though, is whether this will be Cruise’s last<em> Mission: Impossible</em> movie. Given his obsession with movies, Hollywood, and his own legacy at the box office, I somehow doubt it. At least as long as<em> Final Reckoning </em>does better than its predecessor. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yeah, weird stuff. The game got a sequel in 1994, which (spoilers) ended with Ecco getting access to a time machine and leaving for some unknown point in history. While the games were odd, they had a lot of fans and now the creator behind them, Ed Annunziata, has shared that remasters of those games are on the way, along with a new sequel. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a May 5 interview with Xbox</a></span>, Annunziata talked about his inspiration for creating Ecco and then gave a small tease for the future of the franchise, telling fans to “stay tuned” and further explaining: “Me and the entire original team are going to remaster the original <em>Ecco the Dolphin </em>and <em>Tides of Time</em> games.

You might be expecting a teaser or perhaps a bit more info about these upcoming remasters and the next game in the <em>Ecco</em> series. Well,  there’s nothing like that on the site. Instead, if you head over there you’ll be greeted by a countdown clock that won’t hit 0 for another 8,528 hours or about 355 days, also known as basically a full year. </p><p>I’ve seen video game marketing countdown clocks before, but usually they’re for a week or two at the most. More often it’s just for a few days. The idea of doing a one-year countdown clock for remasters of <em>Ecco the Dolphin</em> is wild. I mean, I guess it worked because you’re reading a blog about the countdown clock and the remasters right now. But I’m not sure this fanbase has the energy to be excited for a year. Anyway, hopefully I’ll be back in 350 days or so to share  a cool trailer for <em>Ecco The Dolphin Remastered</em>. See you then! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ecco-the-dolphin-and-ecco-the-tides-of-time-remasters-and-a-new-third-ecco-game-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ecco the Dolphin creator Ed Annunziata announced in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">Xbox Wire</a> that remasters of Ecco the Dolphin and Ecco: The Tides of Time are on their way. Once those are complete, Annunziata and the rest of the original development team will work on a brand-new third Ecco game for modern players.</p>
<p>The full Xbox Wire post focused more on celebrating Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, and games made by Asian and Pacific Islander creators, with a short but impactful spotlight at the end where Annunziata answered a few questions.</p>
<p>When asked about what the future holds for Ecco, Annunziata did not mince words, saying, "<em>Me and the entire original team are going to Remaster the original Ecco the Dolphin and Tides of Time games. Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities.</em>"</p>
<p>Annunziata ended off by telling players to keep their eyes on <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">eccothedolphin.com</a>, which takes you to a landing page with a countdown that will end on&nbsp;<strong>April 25, 2026, at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm BT.&nbsp;</strong>Annunziata did not elaborate further as to whether that will be when the remasters release, or if it'll just be when we get our first look at Ecco's upcoming return.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1878873951344185652">Gematsu</a> spotted trademark filings from SEGA for "<em>Ecco</em>" and "<em>Ecco the Dolphin,</em>" which we now know were due to the series being brought back to life, and not just your bog-standard filing to keep the trademark.</p>
<p>Ecco the Dolphin has <a href="https://wccftech.com/ecco-metroid-orphan-of-the-machine-xbox-series-x-fall2020/">inspired</a> a number of games since its original release in 1992, with its focus on ocean conservation and marine life, and its meticulous and difficult brand of 2D side-scrolling. It'll be interesting to see how Annunziata and the team approach a remaster, if it'll be something akin to what Virtuos did for<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/"> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, with a big graphical overhaul while keeping the underlying game the same, or if it'll be more like a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-thing-remastered-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-from-nightdive/">Nightdive Studios</a> remaster, that keeps the original look and feel of the game intact, while adding a few quality-of-life improvements so it runs as smooth as possible on modern hardware.</p>
<p>If it's the former of the two, then that will also likely inform what Annunziata means when he talks about making a third game with "<em>contemporary play and GPU sensibilities.</em>"</p>

Bungie’s extraction shooter didn’t really win me over, but each time I booted it up I was greeted by a PlayStation Studios logo, as the former <em>Halo </em>maker is now owned by PlayStation. This was odd to see on my Xbox, but it didn’t stand out too much. But <em>Gears of War </em>on PlayStation is so bizarre. It’s one of Xbox’s big three:<em> Forza, Halo, Gears</em>. Now only one of them remains truly Xbox only. </p><p><em>Gears </em>on PS5 is the kind of weird idea that, a decade ago or more, you’d hear someone suggest and you’d laugh at. Like some random, clueless analyst pondering when Mario will arrive on Xbox. Never gonna happen dude, don’t you know anything? I remember being a younger lad and being one of the few people at my middle school to own an Xbox. They all had PlayStation 3s. They all were jealous of <em>Gears of War</em>. Some of them would tell me that <em>Gears </em>was coming to PS3 one day. And <em>Halo</em>. I’d shake my head. I knew better. I read all the gaming magazines of the day. I scrolled through gaming forums and consumed <em>GameSpot </em>articles. They were wrong. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-ps3-version-of-gears-of-war-3-is-now-available-1846937357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-ps3-version-of-gears-of-war-3-is-now-available-1846937357"><em>Gears of War</em> would <em><strong>never </strong></em>be on a PlayStation console</a></span>. Well, turns out they were right, they were just about 18 years ahead of the schedule.</p><p> So while I understand the business reasons for <em>Gears </em>coming to PlayStation and I’ve seen plenty of other Xbox-published games arrive on non-Xbox consoles, it’s all still very weird for me to watch. I’ll probably have to sit down when I see the news of <em>Halo </em>on PS5. At least more people will now have access to more games. That’s cool, even if younger me would never have believed any of this was possible. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At least, they’re hoping so.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197551" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Minecraft Movie Song Sets Record as Shortest Track Ever on Billboard Hot 100" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="197551,197550,197547" data-current="197551"><div><p>Minecraft Movie Song Sets Record as Shortest Track Ever on Billboard Hot 100</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23075.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Shimmer is Ellie’s horse in <em>The Last of Us</em>, both in the show and in <em>Part II </em>of the game. The trusty steed helps get our heroine from the small town of Jackson to the warzone of Seattle. However, in one of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s most shocking moments, while on horseback the player is forced to accidentally trigger an explosive barricade set up by the W.L.F. A member of the militia is kind enough to put her out of her misery after the blast, but then captures Ellie for questioning. It’s a brutal scene, and it’s even worse when you don’t know it’s coming.</p><p>As such, people watching the <em>Last of Us </em>show after playing the game have been bracing themselves for this week’s episode, as this would have been the one in which Shimmer kicked the bucket in a more faithful retelling.

Homegirl is living her best life free of worry. So is Shimmer safe from the horrors of Ellie’s revenge tour? A lot can happen in the three episodes left of the season, but fans are crossing all their fingers and toes.</p><p>It’s probably not gonna undo the collective trauma of watching Pedro Pascal get murdered via golf club, but hey, we take the wins where we can get them. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the dead of night, the company updated the store's top games chart, and now displays games ranked by "highest sales for the past few days" and not "most downloads for the past two weeks." It wasn't until </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/3X6nDoGNfPc?si=xUNgqoJokQsQI9uq">YouTuber GVG</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> happened to spot the change that anyone took notice, and developers who've spent years building audiences on the eShop scrambled to understand how it would impact their game. Storefront visibility is a key driver of financial success in the digital age, and the quirks of every different platform from Steam, to PlayStation, to the Nintendo eShop all have developers trying different sales strategies at different times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 only a month away, it's notable that Nintendo would shake up how it displays games to players. Developers are counting on the new console to not only </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2s-dlss-support-to-be-a-big-part-of-future-nintendo-games">deliver better performance</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> but to also serve as a gateway for players to jump from first-party to third-party titles.

Nintendo needs to balance its promise that most Nintendo Switch games will be compatible with the Switch 2 while avoiding overpromoting what may be perceived as "low quality" games.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2-shows-nintendo-s-strategy-for-a-social-future" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo Switch 2 shows Nintendo's strategy for an online social future</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Changing the eShop ranking criteria from sales volumes to revenue will stop much of this content from surfacing on Switch 2, where Nintendo has already set in place measures—including the platform-wide "Switch 2 Edition" program—to favor positioning of higher-value Switch 2-branded content," he said. "The knock-on impact is going to be [fewer] opportunities for developers of lower-priced software to reach players."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He pointed to "breakout" Switch games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Exit 8</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Suika Games</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thief Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as games that may not rank as high under this new system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">GameDiscoverCo founder (and former Game Developer publisher) Simon Carless offered a similar outlook, saying the change will stop a lot of the eShop "slop" that's released on sale at 90 percent off from dominating the charts. He called this "good," but added "it'll also be trickier for cheaper games to get high up the charts."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers and publishers behind cheaper games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>might</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> stand a chance of ranking high if they can still move high volumes of units, but as No More Robots publisher Mike Rose told Game Developer, that may favor companies with the ability to do "huge short-term marketing blasts, the size we can't compete with."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/-redesigned-from-the-ground-up-the-nintendo-switch-2-will-launch-on-june-5" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Redesigned from the ground up:' The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on June 5 for $449</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's decent reason for small developers to worry, but with other discoverability options on the way, Rose said he's waiting to pass judgment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bitcraft-online-sandbox-mmo-to-launch-on-june-20-in-early-access-will-be-open-source/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, San Francisco based independent developer Clockwork Labs announced that their sandbox MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/bitcraft-is-a-community-sandbox-mmorpg-with-a-fully-editable-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcraft Online</a> will launch on June 20 in early access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3454650/BitCraft_Online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a>. Moreover, the game's code will be open source, allowing any user to contribute.</p>
<p>Tyler Cloutier, co-founder of Clockwork Labs, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>The ethos behind BitCraft Online has always been about one core principle: collaboration. This is a massive in-game ecosystem, where we encourage players to work together to build towns, cities, or even empires. So to truly empower our community, it was important to ensure that the game would be open-source, allowing players to express themselves in their own unique way. We want to give our community not only the toolset to play within our world, but to participate in building it. Open-sourcing is more than just a technical decision—it's a philosophical one.</em></p>
<p>The game is set in a single procedural world, meaning that all players will play together, unlike in most MMORPGs. They'll join others to form communities, build cities and structures, and discover beautiful biomes.</p>
<p>The world terrain can be modified, too, allowing players to carve mountains and build their own legacy with a tangible impact on the land. As in any good sandbox game, Bitcraft Online promises multiple valid playstyles, from crafter and trader to explorer and monster hunter, or any such combination. Surviving and gathering resources are the keys to success. The economy is entirely player-driven, so the best merchants will thrive.</p>

The real surprise is definitely<a href="https://zdcs.link/av4eXq?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> the Jar Jar Binks figure</a>. Love him or hate him, there's no denying that this Jar Jar looks like he walked right off the screen. He's even got seamless arm joints and two swappable face sculpts for recreating all those wacky poses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot Toys is also filling a glaring hole in the Sequel Trilogy lineup by finally releasing <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXO73?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a Poe Dameron figure</a>. Fittingly, Poe is wearing his Resistance X-Wing jumpsuit. We're also getting another of the fan-favorite Republic Commandos in the form of Clone Commando Boss, and the company's new Star Wars Rebels-inspired line of animated figures is getting <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqw2Xq?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a Darth Vader</a> to accompany the previously announced Stormtrooper figures.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hasbro's Star Wars Toys</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hasbro's Star Wars Day 2025 Figures - Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro revealed a number of new figures in both the 6-inch Black Series line and 3 3/4-inch Vintage Collection line. Hasbro continues to capitalize on the 20th anniversary of Revenge of the Sith by releasing new Black Series figures in packaging based on the classic RotS toy line. Next up are Aayla Secura and a Magnaguard droid. Black Series collectors can also augment their Imperial trooper collections with a Rogue One-themed 2-pack that includes both a Shoretrooper and a Death Trooper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the Vintage Collection front, Hasbro has a couple very interesting multi-pack releases in the works. The "Stormtroopers of the Empire 3-Pack" features a Snowtrooper, Scouttrooper and a Sandtrooper. The "Cantina Adventure 4-Pack" includes four aliens from the iconic Mos Eisley sequence, including Hammerhead, Walrus Man, Greedo, and Snaggletooth. It should go great with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hasbro-reveals-massive-mos-eisley-cantina-playset-for-hardcore-collectors">Hasbro's crowdfunded Mos Eisley Cantina playset</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Star Wars prop collectors will be happy to know that a new ForceFX Elite lightsaber based on the weapon used by Rebels' star Ezra Bridger is in the works. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sideshow's Star Wars Figures and Posters</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sideshow Collectibles' Star Wars Day 2025 Reveals - Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not to be outdone,. Sideshow Collectibles had a wide lineup of figures, statues, and art prints to reveal. Undoubtedly the showpiece of their Star Wars Day lineup is <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbMOG?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Luke Skywalker: Red Five, Standing By Premium Format Figure</a>. This massive 1:4 scale, mixed media statue features Luke decked out in his X-Wing jumpsuit and climbing up the ladder to his trusty ship. What really makes this piece special (and especially expensive) is that Sideshow went to the trouble of actually sculpting a portion of the X-Wing so that it hangs in mid-air.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sideshow is also continuing to release 1:6 scale figures alongside distributing Hot Toys' releases. Sideshow is focusing on its "Scum and Villainy" line, which highlights the many aliens and creatures that don't necessarily receive attention from Hot Toys. The second wave of Scum and Villainy figures is focused on characters from Jabba's Palace in Return of the Jedi, like Bib Fortuna, Klaatu, and Vizam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Sideshow showed off the latest 1:10 statue from Iron Studios, which happens to be <a href="https://zdcs.link/akK2Rg?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a shrunken-down version of their 1:4 scale Darth Vader statue</a>. This Empire Strikes Back-inspired piece still looks mighty cool in the new, smaller scale. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let us know in the comments below what your favorite Star Wars Day 2025 reveal was, and why it's Hot Toys Jar Jar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more Star Wars collecting fun, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-action-figure-buying-guide">our ultimate guide to Star Wars figures</a>, and check out <a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/star-wars-collection?srsltid=AfmBOoq2K47zHS8E-dixwmL2QU3V17lhK9-dv5HG8_tj5Haha876zuN-" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the many Star Wars Collectibles available on the IGN Store</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.
