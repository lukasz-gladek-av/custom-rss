			<p>Bethesda's next major internal project for the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Fallout series</strong> is reportedly the long-rumored Fallout 3 remaster, a title that has been a sort of open secret since internal documents leaked in 2023.</p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">In a new interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview">GQ magazine</a>, <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Todd Howard, Bethesda's Director and Executive Producer, discussed the need for a&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"creative reset"</em>&nbsp;in the</span> The Elder Scrolls and </span>Fallout series. While the next entry in The Elder Scrolls series was formally announced years ago (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">though it is still a long way off</a>), the next Fallout game has yet to be confirmed.</p>



<p>Still, the franchise is very much alive. <em>"Hundreds"</em> of people at Bethesda are working on Fallout right now, and some of them are working on "some other things", according to Todd Howard.<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/7-years-after-it-was-announced-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/"> As reported by VGC</a>, one of these other things is a Fallout 3 remaster, similar to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-3-remastered-a-project-long-in-the-works">Fallout 3 Remastered: A Project Long in the Works</h2>



<p>Although a Fallout 3 remaster has never been officially announced, we have known for quite some time that it is in development. In September 2023, files attached to an FTC investigational hearing held remotely with Phil Spencer were leaked online,<a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/"> revealing Bethesda's internal plans from 2020 to 2024</a>. Among the projects listed for a tentative release from April 2024 to March 2025 was a remaster of Fallout 3. </p>



<p>As this scheduled predated the COVID-19 pandemic, plans significantly shifted, and most of the projects such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> released later than originall intended, so it's no surprise that even the remaster of the third entry in the post-apcalpytic series has yet to be released.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-new-coat-of-paint">A New Coat of Paint</h2>



<p>As the Fallout 3 remaster is reportedly similar to this year's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, it will likely utilize the Unreal Engine 5 for rendering and the original engine for gameplay, a trend that has become increasingly common in both remasters and remakes such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-campaign-evolved-comparison-massive-visual-improvements/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>. If this is indeed the case, the gameplay of the remaster will be virtually left untouched, which should make those looking for an authentic recreation of the now-classic role-playing game happy.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dont-buy-your-ipad-at-an-apple-store-amazon-just-dropped-the-base-wifi-model-to-pocket-change-2000642394</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-buy-your-ipad-at-an-apple-store-amazon-just-dropped-the-base-wifi-model-to-pocket-change.1348903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tablets have become essential tools for everything from streaming shows to taking notes in meetings but finding one that delivers premium performance without premium pricing remains a challenge. Apple dominates the tablet market because of the tight ecosystem integration and refined hardware; the 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip is the most affordable entry point into that experience. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">Currently priced at $299 on Amazon after its standard $349 retail price, this 2025 WiFi 128GB model</a> delivers the core iPad experience at the lowest this configuration has ever reached<strong>. Apple’s own website still sells this exact model at full price</strong>, which makes Amazon’s discount genuinely noteworthy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>The Sweet Spot for Most Users</h2>
<p>The A16 chip powering this iPad comes straight from Apple’s iPhone lineage and brings smartphone-class efficiency and processing power to tablet computing. This processor nudges along multiple running apps with ease: You seamlessly flip between Safari tabs, respond to messages, edit photos, and stream video without the sluggish performance that plagues cheaper Android tablets. The neural engine within the A16 Bionic greatly accelerates machine learning tasks, including photo recognition, voice processing and augmented reality applications.</p>



<p>The 11-inch Liquid Retina display strikes an ideal balance between portability and usable screen space. The 2360 x 1640 resolution delivers sharp text that remains readable even at smaller font sizes, making this iPad viable for extended reading sessions or document work. <strong>True Tone technology automatically adjusts the color temperature in the display based on the surrounding light</strong>&nbsp;and reduces eye strain when you move from bright outdoor environments into warm indoor lighting.</p>
<p>The <strong>camera system is actually far better than what most would expect from tablet cameras</strong>: The 12MP rear camera captures surprisingly good photos and 4K video, making this iPad capable of documenting events, scanning documents, or recording video content when your phone isn’t handy. The front 12MP camera, finally situated in a landscape orientation, puts the lens where it should be for video calls, centering you in frame when the iPad sits naturally on a desk or in a stand.</p>



<p>The 128GB of storage handles normal use patterns without requiring constant file management. You can have a good library of Netflix shows downloaded for offline viewing, store thousands of photos, install dozens of apps, and keep important documents locally accessible. Of course, cloud storage integration through iCloud allows you to easily expand beyond local storage for files you don’t need immediate access to. Having 128GB on board eliminates the anxiety that comes with 64GB models, which fill up frustratingly fast. This capacity hits that sweet spot whereby most users never feel constrained but aren’t paying extra for storage they’ll never use.</p>
<p>WiFi 6 connectivity itself offers faster wireless speeds and better performance in crowded networks compared with older WiFi standards which makes a noticeable difference when you download large files, stream high-resolution video, or use the iPad in environments with many competing devices on the same network. Furthermore, the increased efficiency means better battery life on network-intensive tasks as the WiFi 6 radio can transmit data faster and return to low-power states more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>The iPad is better integrated into the ecosystem of Apple devices</strong>, and creates great continuity between them. You can start typing something in an email on your iPad and then just finish it on your iPhone or Mac. Or copy text or an image on one and paste it into another using Universal Clipboard, start something on one device and pick it up where you left off with Handoff. It works so transparently that you stop thinking about which device you’re using and focus instead on what you’re trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>A rating of <strong>4.8 out of 5 stars based on over 12,000 reviews</strong> shows real end-user satisfaction in this iPad’s performance and reliability. That feedback comes from real buyers who use the device daily, providing confidence that the experience matches Apple’s promises.</p>
<p>At $299, this is Apple’s most accessible premium tablet offering to date, and bringss the iPad experience within reach of buyers who previously considered it too expensive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you were hoping for a release of The Elder Scrolls 6 anytime soon, you may want to sit down for this one. According to Bethesda’s Todd Howard, the latest game in the franchise is still “a long way off”.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GQ</a> to talk about Fallout 4’s 10th anniversary and other Bethesda happenings, Howard admitted that the game isn’t close to being ready for players.</p>



<p><strong>“I’m preaching patience,”</strong> he said. <strong>“I don’t want fans to feel anxious.”</strong></p>



<p>Howard said after raising money for Make-A-Wish that would see a character made in The Elder Scrolls 6, they had a three-hour play test of the game. He wanted to make clear though, that it wasn’t to signal that anything was close and that, if he has it his way, the announcement strategy would be a bit different.</p>



<p><strong>“I like to just announce stuff and release it,”</strong> Howard said. <strong>“My perfect version –&nbsp;and I’m not saying this is going to happen – is that it’s going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear.”</strong></p>



<p>When asked if he wanted it to be like The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remaster where it was shadow dropped in April, Howard didn’t rule it out.</p>



<p><strong>“You might say that was a test run,”</strong> he said. <strong>“It worked out well.”</strong></p>



<p>When do you think fans will get to play The Elder Scrolls 6, and do you think they would do a shadow drop release for such a highly anticipated game?

<p>Strongman Ultra is a gym-based simulation experience on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-invincible-showdown-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>. To build a more muscular and toned avatar, you’ll need to lift weights, boost your cardiovascular fitness, and perform various exercises. Energy is the core resource that powers the gameplay. It determines how much your avatar can lift and how long they can keep training. Instead of grinding for hours to unlock new gym areas, you can easily redeem active codes to claim free Energy and Energy Potions. Use these rewards, hit the gym, and turn your gym rat into a full-fledged gym monster. &nbsp;<br></p>

<p>They say all roads lead to Rome, and that is certainly the case as anticipation for the release date of Anno 117: Pax Romana rapidly approaches, and we’ve got all the important timings you need to dive in.</p>



<p>The first entry in the long-running series in six years, Anno 117: Pax Romana is deploying as the latest city-building simulator, thrusting you in control of a crucial point of history, and excitement for the title continues to rise.</p>



<p>Release dates and start times vary, so it’s worth noting exactly when Anno 117: Pax Romana is available in your region.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-anno-117-pax-romana-coming-out">When is Anno 117: Pax Romana Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>All roads lead to Rome. Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Anno 117: Pax Romana is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on November 13, and will also be available as part of a Ubisoft+ subscription.</strong></p>



<p>The eighth instalment in the Anno series, and the first since Anno 1800 in 2019, Anno 117: Pax Romana continues the trend started by its predecessor of releasing on consoles—with the last release being the first time that has occurred in the main series.</p>



<p>Excitement for the title rose during the Steam Next Fest, when a demo of the game was available to play, and there isn’t too much longer to wait until the full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-anno-117-pax-romana-start-time">Do We Know The Anno 117: Pax Romana Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Anno 117: Pax Romana’s start times have been confirmed by Ubisoft, though the exact timing depends on your location in the world and your platform.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S have a staggered global release, becoming available to play from 12 AM local time, while PC has a global release at 3 PM PT on November 12—which means, for some players, the actual release date will be a day earlier than advertised.</p>



<p>The table below shows the start time on PC and consoles for Anno 117: Pax Romana in major time zones across the world.</p>

As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> continues its journey toward its massively anticipated release, it's been confirmed some key <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> development talent has made the jump to CD Projekt and Ciri's new adventure.
</p>
<p>
Karel Kolmann announced his move to the famed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and Witcher studio in a message <a href="https://x.com/Kadlosaurus/status/1987792793477976342?s=20">shared on social media</a>, appending it with a simple, "Things are happening!". Kolmann, if the name isn't immediately familiar, was part of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 studio Warhorse for eight years, where he variously served as writer, scripter, and senior game designer.
</p>
<p>
More recently, Kolmann took on the role of lead gameplay designer for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's Hardcore mode, which arrived back in April as part of a free post-launch update. As for what Kolmann is doing at CD Projekt, he'll be working as a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7392266619995189252/">senior quest designer on The Witcher 4</a>.

<p>
Work on CD Projekt's latest Witcher instalment was confirmed to have begun back in 2022, but it wasn't until last November that it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">officially entered "full-scale production"</a>. Since then, a smattering of details have emerged, including confirmation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Ciri is taking over from Geralt of Rivia as the game's protagonist</a> (although Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle has hinted his character will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">be "part of" the new game</a>), and we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">got a small taste of its action</a> earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
The bad news for Witcher fans, though, is there's still a long wait until its eventual arrival. CD Projekt previously confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">won't be launching until after the end of 2026</a>, suggesting it might even be a next-gen game.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/survival-game-enshrouded-gets-its-biggest-update-yet-wake-of-the-water-update-now-out-on-pc.1348873/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Enshrouded, the popular survival game currently available on PC in early access, has just received its biggest update yet ahead of its 1.0 release due to arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2026. It's latest Wake of the Water update is available now, and adds highly requested features like voxel-based, dynamic water, a new biome, balance tweaks to combat, and more.</p>



<p>Developer and publisher Keen Games debuted two new trailers alongside today's update, one that's more of a cinematic showcase for the new Wake of the Water update, and another that goes into more detail about what's coming in this new update.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Enshrouded - Wake of the Water | Official Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KEYXq29Nj0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Some of the key features Wake of the Water adds is a whole new water biome with full underwater exploration and dynamic voxel water, which has been one of the most-requested features from players that Keen Games is finally making good on.</p>



<p>The new update also adds new bosses and enemies for players to face, an overhaul to combat with balance tweaks, the introduction of greatswords, new weapon skills, and armor sets. The new update also adds fishing as an activity for players to catch food and adds a new layer to the survival mechanics in Enshrouded, and several more quality-of-life improvements.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Wake of the Water is Enshrouded's seventh major update during the game's early access period and is the latest showcase for just how much the game has changed and evolved since its initial early access launch in January 2024.</p>



<p>In its initial four days in early access, Enshrouded <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-reaches-over-a-million-players-after-four-days-on-steam-early-access/">was able to reach one million players</a>.  It reached <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-hits-30-million-players-since-january/">three million players by August 2024</a>, and in April 2025, i<a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-shows-off-new-thralls-of-twilight-update-as-it-celebrates-surpassing-4-million-players/">t celebrated over four million players</a>. The growth Enshrouded has had since its launch is incredibly impressive, and it'll be interesting to see if it can continue the momentum it has seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-celebrates-1-year-of-early-access-confirms-1-0-launch-in-spring-2026/">early access through to its 1.0 launch next year</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Despite <span>being largely an interview about Fallout 4 (the </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Anniversary Editio</span>n</a>, which celebrates the game's tenth birthday, launches today), the article published today&nbsp;on GQ,&nbsp;featuring a conversation with Todd Howard, actually begins with The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>



<p>The game designer obviously knew that questions about the most anticipated game in Bethesda's pipeline would abound and prefaces the whole interview with the notion that the next iteration in The Elder Scrolls franchise is 'still a long way off', before adding that he's preaching patience to fans. Howard then admits that it's been too long since Skyrim, which launched in November 2011, but adds that the team as a whole needed a 'creative reset', which they tried to accomplish with Starfield and its different setting.</p>



<p>Later in the interview, after talking a bit about Fallout and the upcoming second season of the Amazon Prime Video TV series, Howard returns to TES VI. Apparently, there was a large playtest session just yesterday at Bethesda Game Studios:</p>



<p><em>We did a big play test yesterday for The Elder Scrolls VI, and you have to really look at the screen and say, “What is this? What does this need? Where are we at?” Great games are played, not made. The screen doesn’t lie.</em></p>



<p>Apparently, the team showed The Elder Scrolls VI to some fans who pulled funds via Make-A-Wish to commemorate a friend of theirs in the upcoming game. It's not the first time Bethesda has done something like this: they also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/uesp-wiki-met-bethesda-design-character-the-elder-scrolls-vi-excited/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed the game to some folks from the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages</a>, who left excited about the upcoming title.</p>



<p>In the GQ interview, Howard then says his perfect way to release the massively anticipated roleplaying game would be that, after 'a while', the game 'just appears'. He doesn't guarantee it will go this way, but when asked about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow-drop of Oblivion Remastered</a>, the developer remarks:</p>



<p><em>You might say that was a test run. It worked out well.</em></p>



<p>Honestly, though, I doubt that will be the case. Microsoft will likely want to give the game, which was formally announced at E3 2018 alongside Starfield, at least some lead time. More likely is a scenario akin to Fallout 4, where Howard unveiled the game at E3 2015 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-4-review-a-welcoming-wasteland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released it</a> five months later on November 10, 2015. That would still be a relatively short lead time for a triple-A game of this hype.</p>



<p>Our best estimate at this point puts the game in a tentative late 2027 launch window at the earliest, although the first half of 2028 is even more likely. It wouldn't be the first time for an Elder Scrolls launch, either, as Oblivion was released in March 2006. Meanwhile, we'll report on any noteworthy The Elder Scrolls VI rumors.</p>

            <p>Sit down. "I’m preaching patience." Stay calm. "I don’t want fans to feel anxious." There's no need to hide underneath a chest of drawers. Some of those are things I've had to tell my firework-averse cat around Bonfire Night time here in the UK. Some of them are things Todd Howard has said about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> in a fresh interview that's also about Bethesda's imminently to be released again radioactive golden goose, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Elder Scrolls 6 is "still a long way off", according to the Bethesda bossman, speaking to <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview">GQ</a> from an office that has shelves (ooh, fancy). "I like to just announce stuff and release it," he added. "My perfect version – and I’m not saying this is going to happen – is that it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear."</p>
<p>I mean, technically it would be reappearing, given we all famously saw some its hills, ruins, and shrubbery <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-announced">back in 2018</a>. Well, assuming that E3 trailer actually showed a landscape that resembles anything like one that we'll be exploring all these years on. I personally can't wait to try and climb the exact rock you can see in the foreground on the right, at the 14 second or so mark. Sure, it's not one of the big mountains, but you've gotta start somewhere.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to cleanliness is next to Toddliness. He was also asked in light of his comment about the game just appearing whether Bethesda could shadow drop The Elder Scrolls 6, as they did with Oblivion Remastered. "You might say that was a test run. It worked out well," was his answer. If Oblivion Remastered's anything to go by, in that case we can look forward to at least six months or so of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">leak and report-inspired chatter</a> in the run-up, to make sure this game Bethesda confirmed they were making about seven years ago really catches everyone off guard.</p><p>In news I'll adopt a less snarky tone for, Howard also spoke a bit about meeting the folks from series wiki the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages when they popped by to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-elder-scrolls-6-memorial-character-moulded-by-tamriels-finest-internet-lorekeepers-is-now-set-in-stone">design a character for the game</a> as a memorial to a forum user whose mid-2000s roleplay campaigns have some interesting connections to proper Elder Scrolls lore.</p>
<p>The dev was also asked whether he'd drink toilet water to survive during a real nuclear apocalypse, which was the point at which he drew the line on a series of hypotheticals based around that scenario. He thinks he'd "do ok" if the world ended, which is all the proof I need that he's probably never watched the 1984 film Threads. Or, at the very least, he's somehow managed to forget about it. We'd all be fucked, fella.</p>
<p>Maybe he's got a plan to install his head on an immortal mech body or something, and he'll come hunt me down for chatting shit once the bombs drop. Now that would be a shadow drop with the element of surprise unquestionably on its side.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bethesda creative director Todd Howard knows the wait for the next <em>Elder Scrolls</em> RPG has been “too long.” But in a new interview, he once again asked fans to be patient, and hinted that maybe <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> or some other Bethesda game in the future might shadow-drop without warning.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview">In an interview with&nbsp;<em>GQ Magazine</em></a>&nbsp;mainly focused on the 10th anniversary of<a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-the-kotaku-review-1743410637"><em> Fallout 4,</em></a> Howard talked about the studio’s next game: <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>.</em> First announced officially in 2018 via an E3 teaser, this next entry in the RPG franchise will be the first sequel since 2011’s <em>Skyrim</em>. And while Howard admits working on Starfield after <em>Fallout 4</em> was a nice “reset” for the team, he also acknowledges that the gap between sequels is too big.</p>

 <p>“I do like to have a break between them, where it isn’t like a ‘plus one’ sequel,” said Howard. “I think it’s also good for an audience to have a break – <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>&nbsp;has been too long, let’s be clear. But we wanted to do something new with&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>. We needed a creative reset.” Howard also made it clear that <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> is still a “long way off.”</p>

 <p>“I’m preaching patience. I don’t want fans to feel anxious,” Howard told the outlet. Previously, the creative director suggested that Bethesda had announced the new RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-elder-scrolls-vi-6-2018-e3-teaser-early-1850770820">too early.</a></p> <h2><em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> (or something else…) might get shadow-dropped</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the interview, after admitting that <em>Fallout 4</em>‘s dialogue system wasn’t well received by fans, Howard talked about letting some folks who donated to Make-A-Wish play<em> Elder Scrolls 6</em> early via a recent playtesting session. And yes, Bethesda is playtesting the RPG a lot now as it’s the studio’s next big project. But it seems like Howard isn’t a fan of spending years and years teasing and talking about Bethesda’s next game.</p>

 <p>I like to just announce stuff and release it,” said Howard. “My perfect version–and I’m not saying this is going to happen–is that it’s going to be a while and then, one day, the [<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>] will just appear.”</p>

 <p>When the interviewer pointed out that Bethesda shadow-dropped <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesdas-oblivion-remaster-is-out-now-on-xbox-ps5-an-1851777265"><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> earlier this year</a>, and it was a big hit, Howard vaguely teased: “You might say that was a test run. It worked out well.”</p> <p>Now, I don’t actually think Bethesda and Xbox will just launch the next mainline <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game without a marketing push. That would be wild. But I do think <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> proved that many of Bethesda’s past games are popular enough already that you don’t need to do much marketing to get people excited about a new version of a past classic. And over the last year or two, we’ve heard rumors and reports of a <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_3_remaster"><em>Fallout 3</em> remaster</a> being cooked up. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/7-years-after-it-was-announced-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/#google_vignette">And <em>VGC</em> reports that a <em>Fallout 3 r</em>emaster is in development.</a> Is Howard’s answer here alluding to that rumored remaster dropping without warning in the near future? Perhaps. <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-day-fallout-5-tease-event-remaster-2000638661">We know more <em>Fallout</em> projects are coming</a>. Just what those are and when we should expect them are still officially unknown.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-offloads-its-27-inch-dolby-atmos-soundbar-now-selling-at-a-new-record-low-on-amazon-only-2000642388</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bose-offloads-its-27-inch-dolby-atmos-soundbar-now-selling-at-a-new-record-low-on-amazon-only.1348843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Modern flatscreen TVs give you crystal-clear pictures but their razor-thin designs leave almost no room for decent speakers, so you end up with tinny audio that degrades your viewing experience. The B<strong>ose Dolby Atmos soundbar remedies this basic problem</strong>&nbsp;and makes your TV’s sound go from underwhelming to truly immersive, and<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/"> right now it’s just $399 at Amazon, down from its usual $499</a>. That’s a n<strong>ew all-time low</strong> on Bose’s compact all-in-one soundbar that crams theater-quality audio into a 27-inch frame.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>How Bose Packed Theater Sound Into 27 Inches</h2>
<p>The acoustic engineering inside this soundbar defies what you’d expect from such a compact unit: <strong>Bose squeezed five separate transducers into the frame</strong>&nbsp;including two upward-firing drivers that bounce sound off your ceiling to create height channels for Dolby Atmos content. This upward projection simulates the overhead audio effects you’d get from ceiling-mounted speakers in a proper home theater, making helicopters sound like they’re flying above you and rain feel like it’s falling from the sky. The <em>TrueSpace</em> technology takes this further by analyzing non-Atmos content like standard stereo or 5.1 surround mixes and intelligently upmixing them into immersive multi-channel experiences. That means even<strong> older movies, regular TV shows, and music benefit from spatial processing</strong> that adds depth and dimension to the soundstage.</p>



<p>AI Dialogue Mode addresses one of the biggest beefs with modern content: mumbly dialogue mixed too low beneath music and effects. This <strong>smart processing evens out vocal frequencies against background noises</strong> which brings conversations to the front of the mix without making the dialogue sound artificially separated or processed. You’ll finally catch every word of dialogue on those prestige dramas when the actors are whispering dramatically, and you won’t miss any plot-critical conversations during action sequences.</p>



<p>The streaming capabilities baked into this soundbar make it <strong>more than just a device to improve your TV audio</strong>. Bluetooth allows you to stream music directly from your phone, while Apple AirPlay 2 offers higher-quality wireless audio if you’re using an iOS device, along with multi-room audio if you have other AirPlay speakers. Spotify Connect lets you start music on your phone and then hand off playback to the soundbar, so you can use Spotify’s app as a remote control while the soundbar pulls audio directly from the service for better quality than Bluetooth streaming.</p>



<p>Setup simplicity makes this soundbar approachable even if you are not particularly tech-savvy: A single HDMI connection to your TV handles both audio from the TV and pass-through for connected devices like game consoles or streaming boxes, eliminating the tangle of cables that usually comes with traditional surround sound systems. The soundbar automatically detects when you’ve turned on your television and powers up accordingly, providing a seamless experience where you’re not thinking of the audio system separately from your television. The <strong>compact width of 27 inches fits comfortably in front of most televisions</strong> without blocking much of the view or overwhelming smaller entertainment centers and the low profile maintains a clutter-free aesthetic in your living space.</p>
<p>The<strong> sound quality this bar produces competes with multi-speaker setups</strong> costing considerably more. The bass response reaches surprisingly low for a soundbar without a separate subwoofer, offering enough low-end impact for most content without adding another box to your room. The clarity across the frequency range ensures instruments remain distinct in complex musical passages and that sound effects maintain their character rather than blurring together.</p>
<p>At $399, it’s the most affordable way into premium TV audio from Bose with the brand’s signature sound at the lowest price this model has ever seen. It checks off all the boxes that include Dolby Atmos support.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-black-firday-sales-2025-mario-zelda-2000642413</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-reveals-its-black-friday-deals-and-they-aren%E2%80%99t-great.1348840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I guess it’s that time of year again already. Nintendo just announced its sales for Black Friday 2025 and they are…not that impressive. Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">the Switch 2</a> remains full price. But there’s also no discounted Switch bundle in sight, and the slate of Switch games that are on sale for up to $30 off aren’t exactly the cream of the crop.</p>

 <p>Let’s start with which deals the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251110046253/en/Nintendo-Announces-Holiday-Offers-for-Black-Friday-and-Cyber-Monday-2025">Nintendo Black Friday 2025 sale</a> does include. First, Samsung MicroSD Express Cards for Switch 2 will be $20 off at select stores starting November 30. Second, a handful of <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Street Fighter</em> 6 amiibo will be $10 off. Finally, here are the Nintendo games that will be discounted starting November 23:</p>

 <ul> <li><strong><i>Princess Peach: Showtime! </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Luigi’s Mansion 3 </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe</i></strong> – $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Super Mario Odyssey</i></strong> – $30 (50 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Nintendo Switch Sports </i></strong>– $30 (50 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door </i></strong>– $30 (50 percent off)</li> <li><i><strong>Splatoon 3</strong> </i>– $30 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>Most of these are either B-tier releases or came out quite a while ago. There’s no <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> or <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, and <em>Mario Kart</em> is MIA as well. Other retailers might run their own discounts on physical Nintendo games, but it seems pretty clear the company is treating much of its back catalog as functionally brand-new releases for potential new Switch 2 owners this holiday.</p>

 <h2>RIP Switch Black Friday bundles</h2> <p>While Walmart, Target, and other retailers could still do their own deals, it’s disappointing that Nintendo seems to have retired the Switch bundles that it had been hauling out every Christmas for <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-black-friday-2024-deals-mk8-zelda-totk-1851696187">the last couple years</a>. There’s no <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle for the OG Switch or Switch OLED, and no returning Switch Lite sale. Combined with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220">price increases over the summer</a>, the older hardware will actually be more expensive this holiday than last.</p> <p>The lack of any special Switch 2 deals from Nintendo isn’t surprising at all. In fact, the $500<em> Mario Kart World</em> bundle the console launched with was essentially already that, giving you the hardware and game for $30 below the regular MSRP. I guess fans should just be thankful that Nintendo hasn’t raised the price of the Switch 2 yet and has plenty of stock for the end of 2025. The company said it doesn’t <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-sale-discount-2000642086">foresee any more price hikes</a> in the immediate future, unless another unexpected trade war erupts.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-will-add-changes-to-the-revive-system-in-chapter-7-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1348834/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite is reportedly introducing new changes to the game’s revive system, including self-revive and a new feature for reboot vans in Chapter 7. </p>



<p>The Simpsons have taken over Fortnite as we wait for Chapter 6 to come to a close. While waiting for Chapter 7, several new leaks about the title have surfaced online, including reports about a collaboration with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kill Bill and adding a general Hollywood setting</a> to the game. Now, it seems that the developers might be introducing some new gameplay elements as well by adding new additions to Fortnite’s revive system. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-is-getting-self-revive-and-drivable-reboot-vans">Fortnite is Getting Self-Revive and Drivable Reboot Vans</h2>



<p>The latest leak about changes to Fortnite’s revive system comes through NotPaloLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/NotPaloleaks/status/1987543200643383658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), corroborated by a reliable Fortnite leaks source, <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1987544757736759705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>. The latest post on the platform states that “self-revive” and “drivable reboot vans” will arrive with Chapter 7. When asked in the comment section how self-revive will work in the upcoming Chapter, NotPaloLeaks revealed that they have heard the system will be “similar to Apex or Warzone, like a token”, however, they aren’t sure about it.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Many players in the comment section have also criticized Fortnite for copying Call of Duty and Warzone’s self-revive system; however, we still do not know how it works or whether it will be implemented. Drivable reboot vans seem like an interesting addition, as they will completely change the reboot vans players target in the game. Usually, a van outside the circle was considered useless, but if this feature is indeed coming, then players can move those vans back into the circle and initiate the reboot process in a safe space. However, as these are leaks, players should treat this information with caution. </p>



<p>In other news, Ned Flanders has eliminated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ned-flanders-has-eliminated-over-33000-fortnite-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 33,000 players</a> globally. Additionally, here is when Fortnite’s Chapter 7 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to arrive</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Arc Raiders has seen strong player engagement from the jump. Developer Embark Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-players-receiving-in-game-compensation-for-server-struggles/1100-6535907/">offered in-game compensation to players</a> who experienced server issues November 2. That came just days after the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-off-to-a-strong-start-but-servers-are-struggling-to-keep-up-with-player-demand/1100-6535818/">servers were slammed from player demand at launch</a>. All of this data points to Embark making the right call <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-aint-scared-launching-between-battlefield-6-and-black-ops-7/1100-6535792/">to release Arc Raiders between Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, two of the biggest game releases of the year. It's not, however, one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-20-most-popular-steam-games-of-all-time/2900-6301/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6301">the top 20 most popular Steam games of all time</a>--though it's not far off. </p><p dir="ltr">Embark released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-aint-scared-launching-between-battlefield-6-and-black-ops-7/1100-6535792/">a new update for Arc Raiders that added deadly weather</a> and a night raid for the Blue Gate map over the weekend. There is also a mysterious bunker to discover in the game now. Last week, Alinea Analytics <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-reportedly-hits-a-major-sales-milestone-as-player-numbers-stay-strong/1100-6536011/" data-ref-id="1100-6536011">reported that Arc Raiders has sold 2.5 million copies</a>, with the majority coming from Steam. Keep in mind the $40 game is also available on the Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/">Arc Raiders review</a>.</p>

    <article>
      <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702170/Strange_Jigsaws/?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Strange Jigsaws'</em></a><em> </em>description is simple: It's a game of strange jigsaws where you solve strange jigsaws. I started playing it recently after seeing <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hownottodraw.bsky.social/post/3m4gmqikclc2b?ref=aftermath.site">some posts</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m4qamjr7n22h?ref=aftermath.site">about it</a> on social media. Created by <em>20 Small Mazes</em> puzzle master FLEB, <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> has about 50 or so puzzles—not necessarily <em>all</em> jigsaw puzzles, but using jigsaw pieces. It opens right into the chaos: "Solve jigsaws. Find the golden pieces. Open the door."</p><figure></figure><p>Designer FLEB opens <em>Strange Jigsaw</em> with a chaotic mess of multiple jigsaw puzzles, signaling that this game is more than just a puzzle simulator. Pieces are everywhere, and it's prudent just to start moving pieces around to test out what they do. Among the first few puzzles, I'm to put pieces together to power a magnet and a computer, respectively, which opens up <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> puzzles even further. Then, trouble! A puzzle is on fire, and <em>Tetris</em>-shaped blocks of water are the only thing that can put them out. On the newly-powered computer, more puzzles: A clever captcha-inspired puzzle game, then a burger-building logic puzzle that reminded me of <a href="https://aftermath.site/is-this-seat-taken-impressions-indie-direct"><em>Is This Seat Taken?</em></a></p><figure></figure><p>There are jigsaws that are highly meta, using pathways controlled by <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>' menu systems. There are darling puzzles illustrated by the designer's seven-year-old daughter, puzzles with missing pieces that must be recolored using a paint fill tool, puzzles that need a screwdriver to solve. <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> is expertly designed, but what makes it truly fantastic is the earnest playfulness of it all: FLEB loves puzzles, and that's obvious. He writes in <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>' Steam description that this game is harder than his last, <em>20 Small Puzzles</em>, and that may be true—but the puzzles here don't feel cruelly hard. Some are hard, but designed in a way to make them feel doable and intentional. I might not understand a puzzle now, but the game reassures me that I will be able to, later.</p><p>There are so many moments in <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> that I want to talk to you about, but unfortunately for me, the person writing about this game, talking about them will sully the experience for you. <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> is just $5, so I urge you simply to try it out yourself. But if you need a taste of what designer FLEB is out, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2570630/20_Small_Mazes/?ref=aftermath.site"><em>20 Small Mazes </em>is free</a>.</p><p>Or, you can look to YouTube: The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FLEBpuzzles?ref=aftermath.site">designer FLEB has a YouTube channel</a> in which he talks about his games and others. It's just as delightful as his games. His recent videos include a retrospective on <em>20 Small Mazes</em> and a newly designed puzzle called <em>Touching Grass</em>, which is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmndrQW5AmA&amp;ref=aftermath.site">naturally built out of grass</a>. Over the past 10 years—with a seven year break somewhere in there—FLEB has made videos about all sorts of different puzzles. If this doesn't convince you that FLEB knows puzzles, I don't know what will.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[That Time A Student Asked Us Not To Write Any Weird Or Horny Shit Until 4:30 PM, And Other Highlights From Aftermath’s First Two Years]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/that-time-a-student-asked-us-not-to-write-any-weird-or-horny-shit-until-4-30-pm-and-other-highlights-from-aftermath%E2%80%99s-first-two-years.1348813/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>We did it. Against all odds (our profound lack of business acumen), we made it to our second anniversary, which is today, <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-a-leftist-meme-account-accidentally-fooled-everyone-into-believing-a-famous-quote-came-from-final-fantasy-tactics">on the dot</a>. We’ll have more – MUCH more – for you next week, but for now, let’s all reminisce about the highs and lows of our first two years (out of a planned infinity).</p><p>On the latest Aftermath Hours, the whole gang – Gita, Chris, Riley, Luke, Isaiah, Nicole, and I – gathers to celebrate Aftermath’s two-year anniversary. We begin by announcing that we’re relaunching the site next week, but not with all the bullshit bells and whistles you’ve come to expect from this sort of thing. Instead, it’ll still be the simple, streamlined Aftermath you’ve come to know and love, but sleeker, more professional, and easier to use. We’re very excited for you all to try it out!</p><p>We then move on to a discussion of how far the site and the underlying business have come, as well as our proudest accomplishments and our hopes and dreams for the future. We want to hire more people and make space for fresh voices, and while that was a pipe dream when we first launched, we’re now tantalizingly on the cusp. Year three, ideally, is when it all happens. Thanks for sticking with us. We wouldn’t – and literally couldn’t – be here without you.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can expand the Aftermath empire until it includes 1,000 overlapping podcasts, at least 500 of them hosted by Riley, who absolutely loves podcasts.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nicole: </strong>We got an email, and Riley shared it with the group. It was about two different stories that I had written. A student wanted to write about a serious one that I had written about <a href="https://aftermath.site/candy-crush-saga-lawsuit-alleged-scam-tournament-king">a lawsuit concerning a <em>Candy Crush</em> scam</a>, and they were like “But my teacher says it has to be from a legitimate website, so can you guys not write about anything weird, like a breast milk river,” which was <a href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-sound-design-maxi-boch">the headline of a story</a> from an interview that I’d previously done. What other site would get that email?</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>“Don’t be weird or horny until this time and date.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>They specifically requested a time. They were like “OK, you can return to publishing those sorts of stories after this point in the day.” I think it was 4:30 PM or something? But until then, no weird shit or horny shit!</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Riley followed up to make sure it went OK.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>They were very kind about it, and it went well.</p><p><strong>Nicole: </strong>It went well. It was allowed.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> They were so lovely about it. I think at other sites, you’d get a mean, harassing email. But this was just so kind and lovely.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It was so kind and sweet, and it was because they wanted to show the professor that we are a reputable outlet. They just weren’t sure how the professor would take things like breast milk rivers. I was like “You know what? Thank you for doing us this favor for one day. Now your professor will accept us as a source. It’s good for us, good for you.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>It must also be noted that that professor is definitely a coward. They see a breast milk river and think “Oh, they’re not serious?” No, we’re very serious. We just so happen to be serious about many things, including breast milk rivers. That’s fine.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> That was a serious article, too! It was real journalism. You deserve a Pulitzer Prize.</p>

      <p>I try not to be gross on this site, but if you are a man of about 30 or 40 years old you know that your body just gets weird as you age. If you have met a very old man you will see that the hair in their ear and nose area is often out of control. Generally speaking, products for grooming the nose and ear are badly made, annoyingly loud, and battery powered. The Golden Birdie by South Korean brand Royal is none of those things, which is why it is life changing to me.</p><p>Most nose and ear hair trimmers I have used have been battery powered and built like garbage. These things are usually anemic little wands that are way louder than they have any right to be and just take forever at the task of trimming your hairs. The noise is particularly an issue when it comes to your ears, because any motor noise placed directly there becomes borderline dangerous to your hearing. Your other option is plucking, and I can think of few parts of your body that are worse to pluck than your nose hair.</p><figure><figcaption>It comes with a tiny case for travel and a brush for cleaning.</figcaption></figure><p>For a long time I had assumed the solution was more technology, like a quieter motor, but it turns out the opposite was true. The Royal Golden Birdie is a spartan and analog grooming device. It can be used one handed and is meant to be placed between your thumb and index finger. The tip is two interlocking crown shaped prongs that close in on each other when pressure is exerted on both sides. The only noise it makes is a charming metallic rustling sound, like a lower registered version of a barber using shears. It comes apart easily for cleaning; you simply loosen a screw on it and pull the interior layer out to be cleaned with the included brush, which also fits in the case.</p><figure><figcaption>Royal also has a higher end model, but it requires two hands to use.</figcaption></figure><p>Royal makes several models, including a premium one where the brush is stored inside the device, but that one requires using two hands to operate the device itself. I went with the Golden Birdie, which is like five dollars more than the twelve dollar base unit, but I can’t tell what the difference is aside from the golden one claiming to be hypoallergenic. None of these devices cost more than 22 dollars, which is how much money falls out of me like Sonic The Hedgehog every time I leave my house these days.</p><figure><figcaption>Comes apart easily, simple to clean.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike my nasty little Panasonic trimmer, the Golden Birdie just works. With 12 blades, nose and ear hairs just vanish after a handful of delightful little clicks. The Birdie is a joy to use in terms of both its exceeding simplicity and its tactile fidget toy feedback. It gives an otherwise unpleasant grooming task a mild ASMR atmosphere. The Birdie currently has about 11k largely positive reviews on Amazon, so I guess I’m not the only one who really likes this thing.</p><p>I have not put the Golden Birdie through the ringer for more than a few times, and I will concede that it might get shitty over time, but it’s an exceedingly simple device made entirely out of metal with few points of failure (like, say, a motor or battery), and even if it does fail me in the future it costs between a good sandwich and a very good sandwich to replace. That’s the joy when you find a simple solution to an age old problem – there’s just way fewer parts to screw up.</p>

      <p>It’s easy to grow jaded as a gamer, and even easier to forget why you got interested in games to begin with. As trends in video games change, you may find yourself longing for an imagined yesteryear, where that spark was still fresh. As a member of the diehard cult that hopes that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/telltale-delays-the-wolf-among-us-2-till-at-least-next-year-because-if-its-half-baked-were-going-to-get-torn-to-shreds/?ref=aftermath.site"><em>The Wolf Among Us 2</em> will ever see the light of day</a>, <em>Dispatch </em>feels like a return to the experimental golden age of episodic choice-driven storytelling, where fun isn’t in photorealism but in the online water cooler buzz of what you chose and why.</p><figure><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/DomTheBombYT/status/1984327008487428270?ref=aftermath.site"></a></blockquote></figure><p>After bingeing the first four playable episodes of <a href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-demo"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, I found myself swept back (<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-narrative-superhero-game-episodic-telltale-games?ref=aftermath.site">alongside other like-minded, nostalgic players</a>) into the magic of<em> Life is Strange</em> and <em>The Walking Dead—</em>the very games that ignited my love for storytelling in my teens when an innocuous <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/life_is_strange/b/playstation4/archive/2015/01/29/life-is-strange-episode-one-chrysalis-review-game-informer.aspx?ref=aftermath.site">GameInformer magazine blurb</a> first sold me on the dream of games playing like episodic TV. It follows Robert Robertson (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/aaron-paul-dispatch-video-game-interview-2000672017?ref=aftermath.site">played by Aaron Paul</a>), a semi-retired superhero turned mission coordinator, assigning heroes to crises based on their skills and (difficult) personalities, both with the promise of leveling up over time. Your squad of “heroes” is the Z-team in every sense. It’s a <a href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics">chaotic mix of washed-up villains no one expects to redeem</a>, each carrying enough emotional baggage to test the most seasoned therapist (caped or otherwise) a headache.</p><figure><iframe width="160" height="90" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zidpOy-Zta4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>While <em>Dispatch</em>’s branching choices aren’t quite as splintered as the most procrastinated windshield spider cracks, it has already revived the lost art of player-driven internet chatter—debating everyone’s choices, overlooked details, and speculating on how the story might unfold in the remaining four episodes.</p><figure><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/altades_art/status/1984378004072734770?ref=aftermath.site"></a></blockquote></figure><figure><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/Circlebircle_/status/1984989828442653076?ref=aftermath.site"></a></blockquote></figure><figure><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/batluuca_/status/1985111947772317911?ref=aftermath.site"></a></blockquote></figure><p>Being on the ground floor of something gaming-related that’s tied to players’ choices, discussing them, and trying to figure out how they’ll play out as the entire story unfolds in semi-weekly releases allows for community-driven conversations without the frustration of an episodic narrative that’s incomplete. This way, we see the whole work as evolving, rather than judging it based on unfinished pieces, which often leads to tired debates about graphics instead of emotional storytelling and character banter that really tug at your heartstrings or make you laugh.</p><figure><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/ReignOfPride/status/1984009936561676356?ref=aftermath.site"></a></blockquote></figure><figure><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/omniclayy/status/1984319752941064575?ref=aftermath.site"></a></blockquote></figure><figure><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/DM_Soloz/status/1984685512246829491?ref=aftermath.site"></a></blockquote></figure><div><p>I’ve only had <em>Dispatch</em> for a weekend, and it’s already the kind of refreshing gaming community experience I’ve missed forages. &nbsp;It feels so fucking good to feel like I’m a part of a community again, the kind I remembered from playing <em>Wolf Among Us</em> and <em>Life Is Strange.</em> I’m ecstatic that <em>Dispatch </em>isn’t just filling the void for <em>The Wolf Among Us</em> fans but also reminding me why I love talking about games with other passionate fans in the first place. </p><p>In an era where most online gaming conversations revolve around layoffs, imitation crab-ass gamergate faux outrage, or canceled games, it’s nice to see <em>Dispatch</em> become a bright spot online that highlights the good parts of gaming fandom. In <em>Dispatch</em>’s fandom, players feel less like rivals in a competitive arena and more like a community—eager to swap decisions, analyze tiny details, trade puzzle tips, and even talk about romance without feeling juvenile or ironic.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>This year <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/box-office-demon-slayer-infinity-castle-biggest-anime-opening-1236516498/?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle</em> </a>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/chainsaw-man-movie-reze-arc-box-office-weekend-premiere/?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em></a> played spoiler at the box office in their respective opening weekends (for the pocket-watching pundits among us), aweing moviegoers with the indescribable spark of magic animation. Anime has legs and is worth taking seriously as a new direction in cinema. Instead of addressing the 2D elephant of a lesson in the face, Hollywood said, “You know what the world really needs? More live-action anime films.”</p><p>According to an exclusive report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/chloe-zhao-manga-kodansha-studios-1236605962/?ref=aftermath.site">Deadline</a> (on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kodansha.us/post/3m4qpg6tpu32x?ref=aftermath.site">manga day</a>, no less), Chloé Zhao, two-time Oscar winner behind<em> Nomadland</em> and Marvel’s <em>Eternals</em>, and Nicholas Gonda are teaming up with manga publisher <a href="https://aftermath.site/heres-the-dumb-shit-you-have-to-put-up-with-to-read-manga-these-days">Kodansha</a> to head up a global studio called Kodansha Studios. Kodansha Studios, in turn, will exist for the express purpose of creating “premium, live action movies and television series” based on manga from Kodansha. To break this down in comic book movie terms, Kodansha is pulling a DC Studios by having Zhao and Gonda become their <a href="https://gizmodo.com/james-gunn-head-of-dc-movies-and-tv-warner-bros-1849701460?ref=aftermath.site">James Gunn and Peter Safran</a>, guiding a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/report-david-zaslav-pushed-back-on-ta-nahesi-coates-black-superman-movie-for-being-too-woke-2000628090?ref=aftermath.site">new era of live-action anime films</a> to a cinematic golden age. All the while, ensuring quality control, fostering healthy communication between international directors and manga creators, and developing solid scripts to bring their work to light. Hopefully, this will make the phrase “live-action anime film” less of a punchline than it has been over the past decade by utilizing Kodansha's manga catalog.</p><p>On paper, all of it sounds lovely, set against the haphazard wild west of <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-one-piece-yu-yu-hakusho-anime-live-action-netfl-1850050620?ref=aftermath.site">random-ass live-action Hollywood adaptations</a> that have seen the light of day and are looming menacingly over the horizon. But it's hard not to reflexively recoil when the Deadline piece namedrops “beloved manga” like Katsuhiro Otomo’s <em>Akira</em>,<em> </em>and go, “God dammit, they’re gonna try doing it again.”</p><figure><iframe width="160" height="90" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IqVoEpRIaKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is <em>Akira</em>. Still, Kodansha Studios' mere existence essentially shows that, despite decades of false starts, studio reshuffles, and directorial ghosting—such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/warner-bros-gives-up-on-akira-remake-but-hollywood-wont-2000621686?ref=aftermath.site">Warner Bros. shelving its version</a> in the early 2000s, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/jordan-peele-nope-akira-adaption-references-film-1850048374?ref=aftermath.site">Jordan Peele</a> politely declining, and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/taika-waititi-still-plans-on-directing-akira-eventuall-1839207999?ref=aftermath.site">Taika Waititi</a> eventually withdrawing after years of development hell—<em>Akira</em> remains Hollywood’s promised-yet-elusive cash cow. With Kodansha Studios declaring its raison d’être as “premium live-action projects” (whatever that means), the thought that <em>Akira </em>might be their flagship effort feels like creative ambition and more like comedic arrogance. Should <em>Akira </em>prove to be the hill Kodansha Studios chose to die on, with the promise of guaranteed success because it’s popular, it’s hard not to stifle a laugh at the thought of it still attempting to see the light of day.</p><figure><iframe width="160" height="90" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BXsar5rpgwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Tokyo Movie Shinsha’s 1988 <a href="https://gizmodo.com/akira-35-year-retrospective-impact-1850645834?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Akira</em></a> isn’t just a sci-fi anime film. It’s a miracle. A once-in-history convergence built on unheard-of budget, artistic labor, and technical muscle that animated over 160,000 cels and hand-painted matte backgrounds with the kind of obsessive artistry that <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2020/6/8/akira-anime-film-producer-corrects-30-year-fact-on-how-much-the-groundbreaking-film-cost-to-make?srsltid=AfmBOorrcZSOtdh698GQTcySSmgOi-xMhlmUSUnrM1vhjt7qmmXVFb0E&amp;ref=aftermath.site">no studio today could bankroll</a>. The film isn’t just looked back on as lightning in a bottle but as a global flag-planting moment that declared anime as a cutting-edge art form worth taking seriously. Threatening to recapture it in live action isn’t just misguided—it verges on being creatively bankrupt. Undeterred by taste, history, hubris, or the sheer impossibility of doing it justice.</p><p>To quote YouTuber Cosmonaut Marcus in his succinctly titled video, <a href="https://youtu.be/f9I-s2UwxZk?ref=aftermath.site">Why I Hate Live-Action Anime Adaptations</a>, “If you agree to adapt an anime into a live-action TV show or movie for Hollywood, then it means that you are already disrespecting the source material because in any great animated work, the beauty goes beyond the story or the characters, usually it's good because it's animated.”</p><p>While I’m <a href="https://aftermath.site/bet-kakegurui-netflix-live-action-anime">a bit of a sicko</a> who likes some live-action adaptations on their own merits, I agree with the latter half of Marcus’ take. Roughly 90 percent of why anime fans like the medium is the moving drawings. So reading this news in concert with Sony, through its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/sonys-potential-kadokawa-acquisition-could-tighten-its-grip-on-anime-and-manga-2000526376?ref=aftermath.site">fucked up homunculus merger with Kadokawa</a>, also plans to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/anime-movies/sony-is-stepping-up-its-plans-for-more-live-action-movie-adaptations-of-anime-and-manga-properties/?ref=aftermath.site">ramp up its live-action efforts</a>, despite their direct financial success from <em>Demon Slayer</em> and <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, has me both fucking exasperated and side-eyeing Kodansha Studios playing follow the leader.</p><figure></figure><p>It’s not like Kodansha hasn’t had successes with already-made anime adaptations of its works; they're special because they're animated beautifully, filling in the gaps in manga panel artistry for anime fans without losing their artistry. And Kodansha’s library has proven to yield some of the most memorable anime films, like <em>Weathering With</em> <em>You </em>and <em>A Silent Voice</em>—<em>anime</em> films being the operative word.</p><p>Playing devil's advocate, there are exceptions to the rule of live action adaptations not being an entire crapshoot, but mainly as a reflection in fans' eyes in retrospect as cult classic hits with the likes of Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt-led<em> </em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/all-you-need-is-kill-anime-movie-trailer-edge-of-tomorrow-warner-bros-2000575528?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Live Die Repeat</em></a> and The Wachowskis’ <em>Speed Racer</em> (pound for pound <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwh9ETdhrf4&amp;t=2980s&amp;ref=aftermath.site">the best live action anime film of all time</a>). There’s even been pretty decent live-action ventures in the past, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-loved-no-really-about-alita-battle-angel-1832758443?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Alita Battle Angel</em></a>, and that Netflix adaptation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLfE-WiHAWU&amp;pp=ygUdbGFzdCBzYW11cmFpIHN0YW5kaW5nIG5ldGZsaXjSBwkJAwoBhyohjO8%3D&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em>Last Samurai Standing</em></a> looks promising. But for every success, there’s also monumental failures from leveraging Kodansha’s catalogue for live-action works—your Scarlett Johansson-led <a href="https://www.wyomingnewspapers.org/?a=d&amp;d=WYWPN20170501-01.1.7&amp;srpos=1&amp;e=-------en-20-WYWPN-1--img-txIN%7CtxCO%7CtxTA-isaiah+colbert+ghost+in+the+shell-------0------&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em>Ghost in the Shell</em></a>.</p><p>Should Zhao and Gonda prove masterful international directors and original mangaka matchmakers, bringing underappreciated gems into the mainstream with “premium” live-action projects for works like all power to them. Works less likely to make folks reflexively throw their arms up like hearing “live action <a href="https://kotaku.com/my-hero-academia-netflix-live-action-anime-bnha-movie-1849883927?ref=aftermath.site"><em>My Hero Academia</em></a> or live action <a href="https://gizmodo.com/naruto-live-action-film-lionsgate-1851047617?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Naruto</em></a>,” not helping themselves by going for big-spectacle, fantasy-laden shonen hits with an even larger margin for error, for the disrespect Marcus mentioned earlier, to bring it to live action and look shit. If the first of their projects is <em>Akira</em>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-doesnt-just-redefine-shonen-anime-it-anoints-itself-as-the-next-big-thing-2000622249?ref=aftermath.site"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a><em>,</em> <em>Fire Punch</em>, or <em>Shangra La Frontier</em>, because they’re popular fantastical works, then all good will for Kodansha Studios is lost.</p><p>If Kodansha Studios instead invests in showcasing its creative skills through greenlighting live-action series and films based on more realistic sleeper hits in seinen and shojo genres, like <em>Princess Jellyfish</em>, <em>Blue Period</em>,<em> Hajime no Ippo</em>, or (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/vinland-saga-creator-makoto-yukimura-looks-back-on-writing-his-pacifist-viking-epic-2000664303?ref=aftermath.site">gulp</a>) <em>Vinland Saga,</em> then, and only then, can it flirt with its strength as a studio capable of delivering on its promises for all its so-called premium projects. Do that, and I can have faith in prospective Kodansha Studio live-action adaptations of series like <em>Knights of Sidonia</em>, <em>Land of the Lustrous</em>, <em>To Your Eternity</em>, <em>Tower Dungeon</em>, and be less gun-shy about them possibly tackling <em>Akira</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Most of the time when I’m working I need a little background noise. Sometimes that means music, sometimes podcasts, sometimes streamers. Most recently I’ve been working with the Criterion 24/7 channel on my second monitor, and I swear to god it’s fixing my mental health.</p><p>My husband and I are very aware of how much bullshit we let into our minds. We try not to binge television shows—after three episodes, we watch something else. For every fluffy blockbuster we watch, we make an appointment to watch something off the beaten path. We pop on an episode of <em>The Gilded Age</em> before embarking on an hours-long baseball game. It’s all about balance: If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p><p>But when I work, I often seek out the kind of slop I try to avoid in the rest of my life. For a long time my bread and butter for working was extremely long Let’s Plays, but I also keep podcasts in the rotation for a similar reason: I just like to hear the sound of human voices while I work on something. Streamers like NorthernLion and Hasan Piker have also worked their way into my routines, though there’s only so much I can take of grown men playing video games at this point in my life, as amusing as their anecdotes may be.</p><p>Reality television (my husband hates it, so I can only watch it in my office), podcasts and streamers genuinely do help me to get started with my work, because they help me feel like I’m not just typing alone in my office with my cat. The problem with all these sources of “content” is that they make me feel like my brain is melting after a while. So last week, on a whim, I tossed on the Criterion’s 24/7 channel, which plays movies from the Criterion Collection 24 hours a day, and I had the complete opposite effect.</p><p>I know that watching a dense, foreign language film like <em>Ceddo</em> while working on an essay or typing emails isn’t going to help me retain much of what I’ve seen. But that said, looking over to my second screen and seeing a frame that’s been arranged deliberately, with care, makes me simply feel more like an adult. I know I can’t really watch the movie with the focus it deserves, but at the very least it’s another really cool film to add to my list, and my growing collection of Blu Rays from Criterion.</p><p>Because of Criterion 24/7, which is available with a subscription to the Criterion’s streaming service, I’ve enjoyed the pleasures of Orson Welles’s<em> The Trial</em>, Pierre Creton’s experimental gay coming of age story <em>Un Prince</em>, as well as <em>In Celebration</em>, which features a very young Brian Cox. Sometimes I’m still in the mood for slop, but it’s a more balanced diet. Even if I’m not grasping every detail from these films, I still feel better off for having seen them—and am sometimes drawn into ten or fifteen minute stretches of beautifully framed shots. Since all of these movies are already in the Criterion streaming collection, I can always watch them again when I’m not working. But when I am working, they remind me that I am not sitting around bullshitting. Like these artists, I have the ability to make things with care, too.</p><p>My mom, who is a professor, used to watch Turner Classic Movies all day long while grading papers before she formed a mild addiction to home renovating shows on Bravo. Maybe I picked up this habit from her instead of inventing it wholecloth. Either way, watching images that are more than incidental, and aspire to more than just entertainment, is healing my neural pathways. It gives me no joy to admit this, but my mom had a point there.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-says-it-will-retain-creative-control-following-saudi-sale-but-like-come-on.1348789/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Today, as part of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125039888/ef20057994_defa14a.htm?ref=aftermath.site">an updated FAQ</a> aimed at workers (<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners?ref=aftermath.site">spotted by Game File</a>), EA said that its <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-ea-sale-is-bad-news-for-everyone">impending $55 billion sale</a> to a consortium that includes Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund will not come at the cost of creative control. If you take EA at its word, I have a bridge to sell you.</p><p>The FAQ includes a number of tersely worded sentiments intended to reassure.</p><p>"We will continue to be guided by our cultural values of creativity, pioneering, passion, determination, learning, and teamwork," it says to counter concerns around a change in culture. "EA will maintain creative control and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact."</p><p>Another eyebrow raiser: no layoffs following a major acquisition. From a company that already <a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-respawn-titanfall-layoffs-andrew-wilson-pay">laid off hundreds of employees</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs">across multiple rounds</a> earlier this year in the name of “<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-says-business-primed-for-accelerated-growth-following-layoffs?ref=aftermath.site">accelerated growth</a>.” Following a buyout that will <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-gaming-is-the-new-oil-how-the-ea-buyout-diverges-from-the-traditional-playbook-?ref=aftermath.site">saddle the company with $20 billion in debt</a>. Sure!</p><p>"There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction," reads the response to a question about layoffs. "Our focus is on driving innovation, and expanding our global reach, all of which require world class teams, who are excited to shape the future of entertainment."</p><p>The driving message underlying the FAQ is more of the same – literally, with EA saying that management, HQ, AI usage, and other staples will remain exactly as they are now.</p><p>That would be great if big companies had given us any reason to believe them in circumstances like this, ever. Bungie leadership told employees that Sony’s purchase of the studio <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/02/01/bungie-sony-buyout-destiny-2-developers/?ref=aftermath.site">wouldn’t result in layoffs or restructuring</a> back in 2022. Look at Bungie now: It’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio?ref=aftermath.site">a husk of itself</a>, dragging new <em>Destiny </em>expansions across the finish line while betting big on <em>Marathon</em>, a game whose lunch may have just been preemptively devoured by <em>Arc Raiders</em>.</p><p>Or consider everything Microsoft said in its attempts to avert the regulatory Eye Of Sauron while its purchase of Activision Blizzard was still pending. The deal will be <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/02/employee-organizing-engagement-labor-economy/?ref=aftermath.site">super worker-friendly</a>? <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july">Uhhh</a>. Game Pass prices <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-wins-against-ftc-injunction-against-activision-blizzard-buyout-is-denied/?ref=aftermath.site">won’t skyrocket</a>? <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/as-microsoft-lays-off-thousands-and-jacks-up-game-pass-prices-former-ftc-chair-says-i-told-you-so-the-activision-blizzard-buyout-is-harming-both-gamers-and-developers/?ref=aftermath.site">Hmmm</a>.</p><p>The latter comparison is especially apt when taken alongside the growing chorus of voices calling for greater regulatory scrutiny of the EA deal. In the immediate aftermath (dot site) of the sale’s announcement, US senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf?ref=aftermath.site">sent</a> <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Electronic-Arts-CEO-Andrew-Wilson.pdf?ref=aftermath.site">letters</a> to US Treasury Secretary and Committee Of Foreign Investment chair Scott Bessent and Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson warning of risks that include "surveillance of Americans, covert Saudi propaganda, and selective retaliation and censorship of persons disfavored by the Saudi government."</p><p>Workers at EA, in collaboration with <a href="https://aftermath.site/uvw-cwa-video-game-union-microsoft-trump-musk">CWA’s direct-join video game union</a>, have also voiced extreme suspicion of the deal, saying in a statement last month that they and theirs stand to be “jeopardized as a result of this deal” despite the fact that they were “not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed.”</p><p>“We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful,” the EA workers wrote.</p><p>Most recently, CWA president Claude Cummings Jr sent formal letters to the Federal Trade Commission and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States calling for a comprehensive review of the deal.</p><p>“This deal is not about innovation or growth for the U.S. economy – it’s about handing control to a small group of powerful investors and putting thousands of jobs and sensitive consumer data at risk,” said Cummings Jr in a statement of his own. “I’m calling on CFIUS Chair Scott Bessent and FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson to scrutinize this deal carefully and to ensure that this deal protects American workers, consumers, and the future of the video game industry.”</p><p>Of course, Trump’s FTC is different from Biden’s FTC, which, under now-former-commissioner Lina Khan, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-18/biden-antitrust-enforcers-set-new-record-for-merger-challenges?embedded-checkout=true&amp;ref=aftermath.site">blocked a record number of mergers</a> in an attempt to stem the tide of monopoly power in the US. On top of that, it is impossible to ignore the fact that another member of the consortium purchasing EA is Affinity Partners, an investment firm formed by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law. Trump has also done ample business in Saudi Arabia <a href="https://archive.is/6QLOj?ref=aftermath.site">since he won the 2024 presidential election</a>. Now, with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/saudi-crown-prince-bin-salman-will-visit-trump-november-18-white-house-official-2025-11-03/?ref=aftermath.site">set to visit the White House later this month</a> – seemingly to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/world/middleeast/mohammed-bin-salman-us-visit.html?ref=aftermath.site">discuss a nuclear deal and a defense pact</a> – the odds seemed stacked against those who’d rather not see the EA sale sail right on through.</p><p>Elsewhere in games, the International Olympic Committee recently backed out of a deal with the Saudi government to host and operate the Esports Olympic Games. According to <a href="https://esportsadvocate.net/2025/10/esports-breakup-why-the-ioc-backed-out-of-saudi-esports-deal/?ref=aftermath.site">a report from The Esports Advocate</a>, the two sides failed see eye-to-eye on the creation of an overseeing federation after the Saudi government concluded that existing options were insufficient. What the Saudi government proposed instead would've been under its control in perpetuity, an arrangement the IOC found untenable.</p><p>The report concludes with the following note:</p><p>"Further, the Saudi contingent pushed back on being forced to put women in leadership positions and adhering to rules on who (what nations) it could or could not allow to participate."</p>
