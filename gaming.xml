<p>Illustrative text-based-bangers ahoy!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're already all clued up and in the know about Moral Anxiety Studio's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>, you'll already be in the know about how it was one of the most critically acclaimed games of 2022. And now it could be repeating success on Switch as it comes to the console on 25th August 2025.</p>
<p>Preorders for this one are now available on the Nintendo eShop, and it'd be remiss of us not to point out that there's a 20% launch discount at the moment, which brings the price down to a very nice <strong>£7.91</strong> / <strong><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/roadwarden-switch/">$8.79</a></strong> until 15th September. Yessir.</p>
<p>Now, it may seem like just another retro-styled pixel adventure at first glance, but this text-based beauty is, in fact, the sort of game that has the energy and power to resurrect an entire genre. We've played it (well, this here writer has) and this release announcement got us very excited for any Switch players out there who are interested in very good games.</p>
<p>Here's some further details from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set in a gritty, low-fantasy world full of mystery, danger, and moral dilemmas, <em>Roadwarden</em> puts players in the boots of a solitary traveller tasked with exploring an untamed peninsula. The game combines <strong>isometric pixel art</strong>, <strong>deep narrative design</strong>, and <strong>RPG elements</strong> such as inventory puzzles, dialogue choices, character builds, and survival mechanics.</p>
<p><em><strong>Step into the unknown. Shape your fate. And guard the roads.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Key Features – Roadwarden</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explore a Mysterious Peninsula<br></strong>Uncover secrets, dangers, and hidden stories in a richly detailed, low-fantasy<br>
world.<br>
<strong><br>
Choose Your Class and Backstory<br></strong>Play as a warrior, mage, or scholar, shaping your character’s abilities, beliefs, and personality.<br>
<strong><br>
Meaningful Choices<br></strong>Engage in deep dialogue, make the right decisions and shape the world around you.<br>
<strong><br>
Unique Genre Blend<br></strong>Combines text-based storytelling, isometric pixel art, RPG systems, and adventure mechanics.<br>
<strong><br>
30+ Hour Campaign<br></strong>Immerse yourself in a narrative-driven experience full of quests, survival elements, and moral dilemmas.</p>
<p>Every shadow hides a threat, every stranger may be a friend or a foe, and every choice could be your last. <strong>Roadwarden</strong> on <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> invites a new audience to lose themselves in a world where every path is uncertain and every decision has weight. The roads are calling and only you can decide where they lead.</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 is now supported in over 175 games, the GeForce company announced today at Gamescom 2025. The list is about to grow with the likes of Resident Evil Requiem (CAPCOM) and Directive 8020 (Supermassive Games), both due in 2026 with DLSS 4 support and full path tracing to maximize visuals and performance.</p>



<p>Several other games will include NVIDIA DLSS 4 and ray tracing:</p>



<ul>
<li>Black State (stealth action/adventure game from Turkish developer Motion Blur, which we <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-state-qa-and-exclusive-screens-making-the-best-looking-games-with-best-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> a while ago)</li>



<li>Cinder City (formerly known as Project LLL, an open world MMO shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-announces-project-lll-an-open-world-mmo-shooter-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> by NCSoft in late 2022)</li>



<li>Cronos: The New Dawn (the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new sci-fi survival horror IP from Bloober Team</a>, out in a couple of weeks)</li>



<li>Dying Light: The Beast (the latest entry in the open world zombie franchise, now <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slated for September 19</a>)</li>



<li>Honeycomb: The World Beyond (a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1510440/Honeycomb_The_World_Beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sci-fi survival sandbox game</a> due in 2025)</li>



<li>Lost Soul Aside (the action game that started as a one-man project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-gets-delayed-to-august-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due in around ten days</a>)</li>



<li>The Outer Worlds 2 (Obsidian's sci-fi RPG sequel, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled for October 28</a>)</li>



<li>Phantom Blade Zero (the <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-new-gameplay-s-party-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hotly anticipated action game from S-GAME</a> with no release window in sight)</li>



<li>PRAGMATA (CAPCOM's <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-hands-on-sgf-2025-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new sci-fi action/adventure game</a>, due at some point in 2026)</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition, Gearbox's Borderlands 4 and the free-to-play third-person anime-style hero-based shooter game Fate Trigger by Saroasis Studios will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, accelerating performance even further for GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>



<p>Matt Wuebbling, vice president of global GeForce marketing at NVIDIA, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>DLSS 4 and path tracing are no longer cutting-edge graphical experiments — they’re the foundation of modern PC gaming titles. Developers are embracing AI-powered rendering to unlock stunning visuals and massive performance gains, enabling gamers everywhere to experience the future of real-time graphics today.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[RTX Hair Is Coming in September to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025 announcements</a>, NVIDIA confirmed that the long-awaited RTX Hair feature will debut in September in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>



<p>You might recall that it had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> to arrive back in February alongside the NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support. DLSS 4 MFG was indeed introduced with that update, but RTX Hair wasn't. Clearly, NVIDIA and MachineGames still had to iron out some kinks.</p>



<p>RTX Hair leverages linear swept spheres, a new hardware feature introduced with the GeForce RTX 50 Series of graphics cards. This new primitive renders hair with spheres instead of triangles as usual. NVIDIA says this is not only a better fit for the shape of hair but also reduces the amount of geometry needed to render each strand of hair. Additionally, RTX Hair reportedly offers better lighting and shadows while only occupying a small memory footprint. NVIDIA later clarified that in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, linear swept spheres will only be available to Blackwell GPUs, whereas any other GPU will have to stick with the existing hair model.</p>



<p>NVIDIA did not provide any detailed performance data on how RTX Hair will affect the frame rate in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, so we'll have to check that ourselves when the update goes live in a few weeks. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent first-person action/adventure game</a> will also soon get its story-based premium DLC, The Order of Giants, which was included with the Premium Edition and can be bought separately (with the Digital Premium Upgrade) for €35.</p>

Nvidia has been gradually improving its new app over the past 18 months since its release, and it’s getting closer to fully migrating all the legacy control panel options.</p><p>This week’s Nvidia app update will include anisotropic filtering, anti-aliasing, and ambient occlusion options, meaning you won’t have to navigate to Nvidia’s older control panel app to improve classic games. The setup tool for Nvidia Surround will also be part of the Nvidia app now.</p><p>You also won’t have to configure DLSS override features on a per game basis anymore, as Nvidia is now adding a global option.

And in a new blog from the devs behind the reboot, we learned that music is a big part of the upcoming skateboarding game and that a whole lotta people will be able to play it together online.</p> <p>This new <em>Skate</em> game was first officially announced all the way back <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate-game-1844087679">in June 2020</a>. And over the years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-ea-leaked-alpha-beta-build-pc-devs-1849176399">the game has leaked numerous times</a> while EA has also <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-skate-4-pre-alpha-gameplay-video-full-circle-session-1849131150">released official early footage of it</a> and brought in fans to playtest it. The development of <em>Skate</em> (which is not called<em> Skate 4</em> for some reason) has been remarkably transparent, and as part of this, <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle">developers Full Circle</a> have released regular blog posts sharing new details about the reboot. And in the latest one, the devs shared a bunch of information on how music–a very important part of any good skateboarding game–will work in <em>Skate</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨We will be inviting all registered skate. Insiders to come playtest in July. Check your emails.</p> <p>The latest build has improved textures and lighting, more challenges, and changes to our progression system. <a href="https://t.co/fyjxtOj3qi">pic.twitter.com/fyjxtOj3qi</a></p> <p>— skate. (@skate) <a href="https://twitter.com/skate/status/1935027470480330760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-five">In the most recent installment of “The Grind,”</a> EA and Full Circle announced that <em>Skate</em> will launch with “about 100” songs. These songs will be grouped into different, themed playlists that will act like radio stations. Players will be free to like songs and create their own playlist of favorites. There will also be a playlist that will feature songs other players are listening to and liking, which will update over time. As for what kind of music to expect in <em>Skate</em>, Full Circle says the team is “focused on emerging artists” and that they included some “deep cuts” that the devs hope will help players “discover” new favorites.</p>

 <p>EA and Full Circle also plan to add new songs to the game as it changes live-service seasons every three months. It also sounds like music that’s less popular with players might leave the game, but EA says it will make sure that the tracks you favorite and enjoy stick around in <em>Skate</em> “for longer.”</p> <p>While losing music is a bit of a shame, I’m excited to hear devs promising regular music updates. With live-service games that players are expected to play for months or years, new music being added over time can help reinvigorate things. There are only so many times you can hear the same tunes over and over before starting to hate them. As someone who has played <em>GTA Online</em> for over a decade, trust me on this.</p> <p>In the latest blog post, the devs also said that the team is aiming for about 150 players per server session. And yes, in case you forgot or weren’t aware, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-no-offline-mode-always-online-2025-1851777885"><em>Skate</em> is an always-online free-to-play skating game</a>, so multiplayer is a big part of the equation. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skate4/comments/1ln0xu4/comment/n0c50t1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Over on Reddit</a>, players who have been involved in playtesting have suggested that servers only supported 80 players during their time with the game, but that EA wanted to up that number to 150, which the blog confirms. 150 players is a lot, so hopefully <em>Skate</em>‘s open world is large enough to support all those skateboarding hooligans listening to music and popping kick flips.</p> <p><em>Skate 4</em> aka the <em>Skate</em> reboot <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-skate-4-reboot-release-date-early-access-2025-pc-ps5-1851650367">doesn’t have a specific release date yet</a>, but EA says it will be available on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC via early access at the end of the summer.</p>

<p id="block-4a71d319-73ea-4b45-91a4-006a34339f07"><strong>As no codes have been added to Steal a Fish</strong> <strong>so none have expired yet.</strong></p>

One of the main concerns coming out of the beta involves players worried about the average size of multiplayer maps being smaller and more compact like those in the beta--but if recent datamines from the BF community are any indication, those fears appear to be unfounded.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/battlefield-6-large-scale-map-images-leak-comparisons-alleviate-beta-concerns" rel="nofollow ">MP1st</a>, images of maps not found in the open beta were datamined from Battlefield Labs, the official community development platform for the Battlefield games. Two maps--one called Mirak Valley, which will be included in the base game; and Eastwood, which will apparently be part of the game's first season of extra content--were found during the datamine, and both maps are considerably larger than the Siege of Cairo map found in the beta. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4551512-battlefield-6-maps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551512" data-ratio="0.60502092050209" data-width="2390" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4551512-battlefield-6-maps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551512"></a><figcaption>A size comparison of the datamined maps versus Siege of Cairo, made by Reddit user u/Happysufigeee.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4551512-battlefield-6-maps.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Mirak Valley, per the datamine, features a riverbed running through two massive mountain ranges, and it's said to be more than half a kilometer in size. The other map, Eastwood, is said to be set in a country club in California, and it allegedly features a golf course, multiple burned-out houses, and two new vehicles: a golf cart and a boat.</p><p dir="ltr">Developers had addressed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-maps-are-too-small-players-say-but-bigger-ones-are-coming/1100-6533900/" data-ref-id="1100-6533900">concerns over map size</a> recently, with producer David Sirland saying that large maps exist, "and the tempo scales accordingly--you'll be able to see soon enough!" However, this is the first time that datamined information seems to back up that claim.</p><p dir="ltr">The Battlefield 6 open beta also made waves with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/">fans of the franchise's long-running Rush mode</a>, which was particularly affected by the smaller maps found in the beta. A few <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-makes-balance-changes-to-rush-but-its-still-12v12/1100-6533997/">balance changes</a> were made via a hotfix, but players were still upset with what the mode offered throughout the test.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 is set to launch October 10 on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC--with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-let-players-have-cross-play-if-they-want-it/1100-6533699/" data-ref-id="1100-6533699">cross-play available</a> to those who wish to use it. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-physical-edition-retailer-bonuses/1100-6533616/" data-ref-id="1100-6533616">Preorders are available now</a> for both the Standard and Phantom editions, the latter of which includes extra in-game skins, currency, and more for $100--compared to the standard edition's $70 price tag.</p>

<p>Coming in early 2026, <a href="https://x.com/SEGA/status/1957457668689260742">Sega has announced</a> the <strong>SEGA Villains Stage</strong>, and first up for our daring ninja is the blue blur's rival himself, Dr. Eggman.

<p>In the promotional image, you can also see two more sets of eyes lurking in the shadows either side of Dr. Eggman. No idea who those will be yet! Any guesses? Maybe a <strong>Like A Dragon</strong> villain? Mr. X? Dr. Curien?</p>

<p>It's a fun concept, and we're excited to see some of Sega's rogue's gallery in lovely painterly form. Lizardcube's new entry in the Shinobi series already looks fantastic, so this is a fun little cherry on top.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-state-of-play-coming-in-september-2025-it%E2%80%99s-claimed-%E2%80%93-rumor.1273143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has had a State of Play, or some kind of presentation in September every year for the last six years, and according to Jeff Grubb, who has proven to be a reliable source for information ahead of official announcements, they won't be breaking that streak in 2025 with a State of Play, "<em>maybe a Showcase</em>," planned for "<em>before the end of September</em>."</p>



<p>Grubb made his claim during Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings show, at the 20 minute and 10-second mark while Grubb and his guest, IGN's Seth Macy, were discussing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fairgame-canceled-according-to-michael-pachter/">weekend scare that Fairgames from Haven Studios had been canned</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="45-Minute Kirby Air Riders Direct Announced" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KYP00kf4GM?start=1221&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>I've heard, - and this one I feel comfortable saying, you can go write headlines about this if you want</em> - <em>they're planning a State of Play, or maybe a Showcase, but probably a State of Play, for the end of September, or before the end of September. So we're gonna hear, we're going to get updates from Sony here pretty soon</em>,<em>" </em>Grubb said.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-similar-length-tsushima/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, we don't know what Sony has lined up for the remainder of 2025, and after Gamescom ONL tomorrow, September would be the perfect opening for Sony to let players know what they can look forward to for the rest of the year.</p>



<p>The last <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/">State of Play this past June</a> included mostly news for third-party titles and 2026 releases. In the very likely scenario that a September 2025 State of Play is on the horizon, hopefully it includes more news about what's coming from PlayStation and Sony in the next few months.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam Makes A Big Change To How Review Scores Are Calculated]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-reviews-wuchang-fallen-feather-china-language-filter-2000618249</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-makes-a-big-change-to-how-review-scores-are-calculated.1273134/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Valve is overhauling how Steam reviews are displayed in a new update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/500579345320904529?l=english">it announced on Monday</a>. The percentage score usually assigned to games based on the number of positive and negative user reviews will now exclude reviews written in other languages. The change comes as Steam becomes an increasingly popular global PC storefront and routine review-bombing from players in specific regions can torpedo a game’s rating for everyone on the platform.</p> <p>“Steam’s growth since then into an even larger global presence means customers in different regions of the world may have vastly different experiences from each other for the same game,” Valve explained <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/500579345320904529?l=english">in a new blog post</a>. “There are a variety of reasons this may happen for a particular game, including translation issues, cultural references, poor network connections, and many others; things that the Overall Review Scores haven’t been able to capture until now. Calculating a language-specific review score means that we can better distill the sentiment of these different groups of customers, and in doing so, better serve potential customers that belong to those groups.”</p> <p>Not every game will be impacted by the changes. Valve said it will only start calculating “language-specific review scores” for games with at least 2,000 total publicly visible user reviews, and at least 200 written in a particular language. Players can now click through the review score section of a game’s Steam store page to get a breakdown of the scores across different languages. While this will now be the default mode for review scores on Steam, everyone will still have the option to toggle back to the old system.</p>

 <p>“We realize that whenever we make changes to User Reviews, we’re inviting some scrutiny into our motivations for making those changes,” Valve wrote. “Maintaining trust in the system is crucial to us, so we’ve erred on the side of being as transparent as possible.”</p> <p>The move comes just days after one of Steam’s bigger releases of the season, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-mod-censorship-1-4-2000618179"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></a>, implemented controversial changes to the game following apparent pushback from some Chinese fans over historical references in the fictional Soulslike. While it’s unclear if that game factored into this new policy at all, games on Steam increasingly get review-bombed for all sorts of reasons that don’t always necessarily have to do with the underlying functionality or experience, from allegations of using generative AI to complaints of terms of service requirements in places like Europe.</p> <p>Data from <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/4-great-graphs-and-1-new-feature">Simon Carless’<em> Game Discover</em> newsletter</a> earlier this year showed that a plurality of Steam users in 2024 had “simplified Chinese” as their primary language on the platform, followed narrowly by English in second place. Over the summer, <em>Helldivers 2</em> was <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-eos-prosperity-china-steam-reviews-1851782983">briefly review-bombed</a> after an apparent translation error led Chinese players to feel cheated by one of the game’s weekly mission objectives. The latest changes to review scores seem like an attempt by Valve to keep those two audiences separate, at least when it comes to rating new games.</p>

              <p><span>The Marvel universe is so vast that games like hero shooter </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-eomm-steam-reviews-max-payne-remake-n64-2000617137"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span> and fighting game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-vs-capcom-state-of-play-ps5-1851783734"><i><span>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</span></i></a> <span>already have a virtually endless bucket of characters to draw on for their growing rosters. Nevertheless, it sounds like NetEase is at least considering making its own original heroes for </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>at some point. You know, if that was something you ever thought about.</span></p> <p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/netease-green-light-marvel-create-original-characters-marvel-rivals"><i><span>MP1st</span></i></a><span> asked </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>director Guangyun “Guangguang” Chen if NetEase had considered adding heroes of its own to fight alongside Marvel staples like the Avengers and the Fantastic Four in a future season. After all, other Marvel projects like the MCU movies have created new characters. Would it be out of the question for </span><i><span>Rivals </span></i><span>to also indulge in making people up to capture an objective or push a payload? Well, Chen says that Marvel has given the team the green light to do that. While he told </span><i><span>MP1st </span></i><span>the team is “allowed to introduce original characters,” Chen played coy when asked if any are coming down the pipeline, merely saying “stay tuned.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Maybe my immediate aversion to this is just because </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>isn’t even a year old yet, and the thought that someone’s favorite comic book mainstay could get sidelined for some OC cooked up in the NetEase offices feels bad. However, Luna Snow, one of the most popular characters in </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>,</span> <span>also started as an original character in the mobile game </span><i><span>Marvel Future Fight</span></i><span>, which has been a point of contention considering all the attention she gets in terms of cosmetics compared to fan-favorite heroes who originate from the comics. I don’t doubt some interesting heroes might come out of this, but you’re still covering the classics, NetEase, so I hope any original characters you might introduce come after you’ve spent a bit more time filling out the roster with established heroes people are still waiting for.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For more on </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>, check out </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s review</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p id="block-27dcb43a-3815-41d9-a096-68bf9eb60a4c"><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-best-roblox-games-to-play-this-summer-holiday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Deep Blue is a game that sees the player stranded in the middle of the ocean, and to help them survive the vast expanse, the game has started making use of reward codes.</p>



<p id="block-5ba00f8e-104d-4fe9-8548-c13fd208d392">Below, we’ll reveal every active reward code in the game, and we’ll also keep track of all expired codes, so you’ll always know which ones are ready to use.</p>

<p id="block-5faf391a-c45d-4193-87f9-1547a2afd1d8">Use these codes before they eventually expire, as most codes in Roblox do.</p>

<h2 id="block-da1c171d-e28c-4ec7-8647-6ed6ce818ea2">How to Redeem Roblox Deep Blue Codes</h2>



<p id="block-840e5ff2-682e-4a86-b78a-dbd5011ad922">To redeem codes in <strong>Roblox Deep Blue</strong>, just follow these easy steps:</p>



<ol id="block-cec654f7-7a68-448e-bd71-e65dc6a8b74b">
<li>Launch<strong> Roblox, then the Deep Blue</strong> game.</li>



<li><strong>Click on the ‘Codes’ option</strong> on the <strong>left side of the screen</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Now, click the ‘Insert Code’ option.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Type in the code you want, and press ‘Redeem’</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p id="block-afb0834b-f90d-418a-8e7e-4013ea4d181e">If the code is still active, then you’ll receive the reward.<strong> Remember, each code can only be used once per user account.</strong></p>



<h2 id="block-1062c7a4-c337-43f7-a066-93c202d5d633">All Expired Roblox Deep Blue Codes</h2>

                <p dir="ltr">Guilty Gear Strive is one of the longest-running fighting games in the genre right now, with its fourth season of add-on content about to end and a new "2.0" patch coming in 2026. The last character of that fourth season is also a first for the franchise: Lucy from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners enters the fray as Guilty Gear's first-ever guest character on August 21, and we have an look at nine minutes of new gameplay featuring the mysterious netrunner.</p><p dir="ltr">Lucy's main weapon is her neon whip, the Monowire, which she can quickly throw out as a potent combo starter. She also has Sprint Attack, a fast low-sweeping move that can be chained into other moves depending on the buttons the player presses after a successful hit.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The most notable move in Lucy's arsenal, however, is her Quickhack super move. Here, she produces a menu of six unique perks that change her attacks, give her added buffs, and even debuff the opponent for a short time. Each activation of Quickhack gives Lucy a limited amount of RAM to use when selecting perks--which each cost a specific amount--so she won't be able to activate all six at a time, but she will come out at an advantage after each Quickhack.</p><p dir="ltr">The six Quickhack perks, along with their RAM costs and abilities, are below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Contagion</strong> (costs 3 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Lucy's attacks deal damage over time</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Energy Siphon</strong> (costs 6 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Lucy's attacks also restore her health</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Algorithm Malfunction</strong> (costs 13 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">All of Lucy's attacks trigger a Counter Hit</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Resistance Glitch</strong> (costs 9 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Opponents build RISC levels faster by blocking Lucy's attacks  <ul><li dir="ltr">The higher RISC a character has, the more damage they take from the next combo that hits them</li></ul></li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Pacify</strong> (costs 8 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Opponent gains less Tension gauge, GG's version of super meter</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Optics Inhibition (</strong>costs 3 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Lucy becomes glitched and hard to see, making opponents' moves miss more often</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Guilty Gear Strive is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Lucy will be available on August 21 as part of the game's Season 4 content bundle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has released a new gift code for Escape from Tarkov players, and it offers a hint regarding the game’s imminent graduation into a fully released game. For almost a decade, Escape from Tarkov has been a beta product, but in the coming months, it’ll transform, and the latest Escape from Tarkov reward code is teasing exactly that.</p>



<p>The latest Tarkov code offers a stack of free items, but more importantly, it tells us that the game’s full release is <strong>coming soon</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-latest-tarkov-code-gives-free-kit">Latest Tarkov Code Gives Free Kit</h2>



<p>If you want to redeem the latest Escape from Tarkov code, you’ll need to head to <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/promo/activate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, sign in, and click on ‘Activate Promo Code’. Then, type in this code: RELEASECOMINGSOON.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that you can only redeem these free Tarkov items on a PvP account and <strong>not </strong>on a PvE account. If you’re only tied to the latter, you won’t even be able to claim the code, period.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here’s everything you get when you redeem the new Escape from Tarkov gift code:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tactical Sport Headset</li>



<li>Fleece Beanie</li>



<li>TGlasses</li>



<li>AFAK</li>



<li>Esmarch x 2</li>



<li>Ultimag x 3</li>



<li>Zarya Flashbang</li>



<li>SJ6</li>



<li>7.62 PP x 60</li>



<li>7.62 PS x 120</li>



<li>RGD-5 x 2</li>



<li>Propital</li>



<li>Morphine</li>



<li>CALOK-B</li>



<li>CMS</li>



<li>Vaseline</li>



<li>A18 Skanda Armoured Rig</li>



<li>AKMN (fully kitted)</li>
</ul>



<p>The AKMN assault rifle you get with the new Tarkov code is a beaut, boasting the red hex components that are guaranteed to make it stand out.</p>



<p>You’ll notice that when you head to Escape from Tarkov to collect the rewards, you’ll be met with a message from System that simply reads ‘Soon.’</p>



<p>It’s indicative <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">of Tarkov’s 1.0 release</a>, which might drop before the year is out (but more likely it’ll come in 2026).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game"><u>Magic: The Gathering</u></a> has been around since 1993, but it wasn’t until 2011 that Wizards of the Coast debuted preconstructed decks (Precons) for the Commander format (also known as Elder Dragon Highlander).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Commander is the most popular way to play Magic, and a big part of that is that Wizards of the Coast regularly releases preconstructed decks that are playable right out of the box. Still, some are drastically more expensive than others, or hard to get hold of after limited print runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, I’ve put together a list of great preconstructed decks you can still get hold of. They’re not all cheap, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-magic-the-gathering-commander-decks-sale-new"><u>there’s a handy list of more affordable decks here</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Criteria</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To be considered for this list, a deck needs to tick a few boxes. For one, it needs to be available, and not just on the secondary market. While some of these are getting harder to find, you can still do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The decks also need to be fun to play, with a cohesive game plan, and some nifty reprints wouldn’t hurt, either. There’s also a hefty dose of my own opinion here, and I’ve not played with or against every deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all that said, here are my picks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Draconic Destruction</h2><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226645"><div id="226645" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Draconic Destruction</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, it used to be much, much cheaper, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKg0pB?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Draconic Destruction</u></a> is a great precon if you’re into casting dragons and sending them at opponents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s still a deck I find myself returning to because it’s remarkably easy to play, and while Atarka, World Render is hardly a pricey Commander, there are still some slightly pricier cards to be found, like Scourge of Valkas and Dragon Tempest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The strategy is simple: Cast big dragons, and get Atarka on the board to give them double strike. That makes it perfect for newcomers.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Quick Draw</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226646"><div id="226646" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Quick Draw</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Spellslinger decks in red and blue are nothing new, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7oAY?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Quick Draw</u></a> has a cool Commander in Stella Lee, Wild Card, which gives you access to more spells to cast, and the ability to copy instants and sorceries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll need to keep track of what you’re casting, but it can get out of hand pretty quickly when you’re throwing Vandalblast and Windfall around. Plus, Veyran, Voice of Duality remains a few dollars, alongside Thunderclap Drake and Niv-Mizzet, Parun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a subtle amount of player manipulation here, too, with Propaganda and Niv-Mizzet incentivizing some politics around the table.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Jump Scare</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226647"><div id="226647" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Jump Scare!</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Zimone, Mystery Unraveler helms this Duskmourn Commander Deck, and can allow you to cast big spells face-down until the moment comes for them to pop up (like a <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qbb3pJ?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Jump Scare</u></a>, get it?).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Being able to (potentially) cheat out cards like Worldspine Wurm, Shriekwood Devourer and Thunderfoot Baloth is nice, but there are some solid reprints, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aesi, Tyrant of Gyre Strait is a big beast that would cost you around $10 on its own, while Giggling Skitterspike and Ashaya, Soul of the Wild aren’t far behind. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Scrappy Survivors</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226648"><div id="226648" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Scrappy Survivors</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Our first Universes Beyond entry (and one of two from the Fallout decks), <a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8ZGy?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Scrappy Survivors</u></a> is a fun deck that’s helmed by a very good boy, Dogmeat, Ever Loyal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea is scrapping Aura and Equipment cards through milling, and then reclaiming them onto your creatures. Given there are some high-mana cards that fit the bill like Almost Perfect and Mantle of the Agents, it’s a solid plan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Codsworth, Handy Helper has seen its price skyrocket, too, thanks to some Final Fantasy synergies, while Silver Shroud Costume is still holding a decent value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mutant Menace</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226649"><div id="226649" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Mutant Menace</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The kind of deck that elicits a collective groan at any table, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YWvA4?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mutant Menace</u></a> is another Fallout deck, but one that’s far less wholesome than the last entry on this list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, Mothman’s whole shtick is the ‘Rad Counter’ mechanic which means players mill every turn. Doing so not only burns through their deck at an alarming rate once it gets going, but also powers up The Wise Mothman himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mutational Advantage and Power Fist are still pretty valuable, alongside Guardian Project, but the biggest draw is that nothing plays quite like this.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Riders of Rohan</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226650"><div id="226650" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Riders of Rohan</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sticking with Universes Beyond, while many of the plaudits went to other decks in the Lord of the Rings Commander lineup, <a href="https://zdcs.link/akK6OX?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Riders of Rohan</u></a> is powerful and relatively simple.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eowyn, Shieldmaiden lets you build an army of token creatures with trample and haste, and turn those into card advantage, while also being a 5/4 with first strike in her own right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With cards like Beregond of the Guard able to pump those tokens and give them vigilance, it’s not uncommon for this deck to be the most aggressive at the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Door of Destinies is the priciest reprint, so you can find this precon a little cheaper than others.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Revenant Recon</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226651"><div id="226651" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Revenant Recon</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this Murders at Karlov Manor deck the best around?

It uses the surveil mechanic to power up its Commander, Mirko, Obsessive Theorist, while also allowing him to resurrect cards from the graveyard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve seen this deck pop off and level entire boards by bringing Massacre Wurm back to slay a bunch of tokens, and there are some low-cost creatures to get the ball rolling pretty quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reanimate and Animate Dead are the main reprints of any note here, but the deck offers a fun way to play Dimir.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Counter Blitz</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226652"><div id="226652" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Counter Blitz</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tidus helms this <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJW31?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy X deck</u></a>, and it’s now easier than ever to get hold of (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-precons-discounted-amazon"><u>and under MSRP</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s perhaps not best-suited to newcomers since it requires keeping tabs on a lot of counters (often different types), but by spending some time planning, you can create Summon creatures and keep them on the board much longer than expected, while also powering up just about everything on your board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a decent amount of card removal to help enact your game plan, too, while Yuna, Grand Summoner and Walking Ballista still command a decent price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Upgrades Unleashed</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226653"><div id="226653" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Upgrades Unleashed</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2rGm?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Upgrades Unleashed</u></a> is a smidge harder to find and doesn’t have a huge number of pricey reprints, but it’s a really fun deck that uses Chishiro, the Shattered Blade, to create tokens and power up ‘modified’ cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its best party trick, however, is building up an army before using Akki Battle Squad to trigger a surprise combat phase, while building up modified creatures will let you drop Walking Skyscraper for nothing if you time it right.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">For Bigger Budgets</h2><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnlW4?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veloci-Ramp-Tor<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$103.90</span></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAgGp7?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Draconic Dissent<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$109.73</span></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QObmAB?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hosts of Mordor<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$79.96</span></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These decks are still readily available, but they do have sharp markups.

Add in some straight-up theft of other players’ cards and it really does have an answer for just about anything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Astral Dragon is a pricey card these days, as is Artificer Class, while Firkraag, Cunning Instigator (the deck’s Commander), will set you back $10, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Veloci-Ramp-Tor</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226654"><div id="226654" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Veloci-Ramp-Tor</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Quite frankly, this precon is by far the best out of the Lost Caverns of Ixalan set, and undoubtedly one of the most cohesive we’ve seen in the last couple of years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The brilliantly-named <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnlW4?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Veloci-Ramp-Tor</u></a> is all about getting dinosaurs on the field and using Pantlaza, Sun-Favored’s ability to then grab more dinosaurs or spells with the discover mechanic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t take long to build a fleet of dinosaurs John Hammond would be proud of, while Akroma’s Will, Xenagos, God of Revels and Apex Altisaur mean there are some cards going for a fair amount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having a one-sided board wipe in Wakening Sun’s Avatar is very welcome, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hosts of Mordor</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226656"><div id="226656" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Hosts of Mordor</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QObmAB?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Sauron’s very own deck is still pricey</u></a>, but it’s very fun to play with the caveat that Sauron is an 8-cost Commander which might make you want to swap him with another version of The Dark Lord.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In any case, there’s a sort of dual game plan here. On one hand, you can make an Orc army that’s pretty massive, able to do your defensive bidding while you attack with just about anything else, but there’s also a light reanimation theme since Sauron can bring creatures back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It makes sense, then, that Reanimate and Living Death are in here, but there are also pretty pricey cards like Cavern-Hoard Dragon and The Black Gate to ramp up the value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 18, 2025 5:00 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-commander-precons-best-decks]]></content:encoded>

<p>Launching exclusively on the Switch 2, The Touryst: Deluxe will come with brand-new content, including a new island and monument to explore, new items and quests, plus improved visuals in both handheld and docked mode.</p>
<p>We already noted how the original Switch version had incredible visuals with flawless performance on the ageing console, so to see that Shin'en has improved this even further is simply incredible. We awarded the game a score of 9/10 and said that it's got "a perfect balance of atmospheric puzzling, leisurely exploring and minigame madness that'll keep you thoroughly entertained from start to finish".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jxlpzm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-converted-kevin-feiges-son/">Marvel Rivals</a> has been one of the most popular games of 2025 so far, and has already introduced <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-3-5-release-date-update/">several famous Marvel characters</a> to its roster, with more on the horizon. But if you were wondering if NetEase would ever go beyond the limits of the vast list of characters in the Marvel universe, that option seems significantly more likely after recent comments from the game's director, Guangguang.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/netease-green-light-marvel-create-original-characters-marvel-rivals">MP1st</a>, when asked if making an original character was something NetEase was even allowed to do, Guangguang confirmed that NetEase does in fact have Marvel and Disney's approval to make an original character for the game. As to whether NetEase will take advantage of that free reign, Guangguang simply said to "<em>Stay tuned</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Yes, we are allowed to introduce original characters in Marvel Rivals</em>," Guangguang said in response to the question of whether NetEase could even go that route.</p>



<p>Guangguang doesn't confirm or deny that they're looking to make an original character, but it's exciting for players and Marvel fans to know that the option is open to the studio. Though, as interesting as it would be to see NetEase create their own Marvel character, it's worth wondering if that is even worth the time and investment with a game like Marvel Rivals, that leans so heavily on NetEase taking well-known existing characters from the Marvel universe and putting their own artistic spin on their design and gameplay mechanics.</p>



<p>NetEase puts its own stamp on the Marvel franchise with its sharp designs for each character. It doesn't necessarily need to go the extra step and create a wholly original character, but it's nice to know that the option is there for the team if they ever decide to use it. And who knows, there could be one waiting in the wings to be announced with the game's next major update.</p>



<p>As Guangguang said, we'll have to wait and see what NetEase does next.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/760813/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-new-price-plan-hint</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-hints-at-%E2%80%98more-affordable%E2%80%99-xbox-cloud-gaming-plan.1273062/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Two years ago we learned, thanks to the FTC, that Microsoft was working on a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23770460/microsoft-xbox-xcloud-gaming-subscription">separate “dedicated” version</a> of Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft Gaming CFO Tim Stuart then hinted, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/23999661/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-free-version-ads">a few months later</a>, that there could be a free version Xbox Cloud Gaming in exchange for ads. Now, Microsoft is hinting at making Xbox Cloud Gaming “more affordable” again.</p><p>Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s VP of Next Generation, has appeared on the company’s official Xbox podcast today, to discuss Xbox Cloud Gaming, Xbox Play Anywhere, and Microsoft’s next-gen chip partnership with AMD. At the moment Xbox Cloud Gaming is only part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, meaning you have to pay $19.99 a month to get access to xCloud.</p><p>“One of the things we see is there’s a lot of players who use Game Pass Ultimate to access the cloud, whether that’s the primary way they play, or an additional way to play on the go,” says Ronald. “I think for us, it really opens up the opportunity to make it much more affordable, and make it more accessible to players. Whether that’s going into new regions, or new ways to actually access the [Xbox] cloud.”</p><p>Microsoft’s hints of a more affordable version of Xbox Cloud Gaming come just hours before Nvidia has some “major” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760527/nvidia-geforce-now-major-news-gamescom-stream">GeForce Now news</a>. Nvidia’s cloud gaming service is far superior to Xbox Cloud Gaming, thanks to PC-powered performance, better bitrates, higher resolution gameplay, and lower latency. Microsoft has even integrated GeForce Now into its own Xbox game pages.</p><p>Ronald stops short of announcing a new Xbox Cloud Gaming tier, but it’s clear that’s been Microsoft’s thinking for a few years now. Microsoft started expanding Xbox Cloud Gaming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300547/xbox-cloud-gaming-game-library-streaming">beyond just the Game Pass library</a> last year, with the ability to stream games you own as long as you’re an Ultimate subscriber.</p><p>There’s an opportunity to bring that Ultimate paywall down, especially for mobile streaming. Microsoft had planned to sell games directly in its Xbox app for Android and allow customers to immediately stream those games directly to their phones and tablets, but a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313976/microsoft-google-xbox-app-android-future-notepad">legal battle</a> has put those plans on hold.</p><p>Microsoft is currently preparing the next generation of Xbox Cloud Gaming, alongside its next-gen Xbox console work. “Together with AMD, we’re designing dedicated silicon and hardware to enable the next generation of gaming experiences,” says Ronald. “We’re investing deeply in the next generation of rendering technologies, such as neural rendering, which will bring a new level of quality to the games that you’re having.”</p><p>That next generation of Xbox hardware will likely see Xbox and Windows move even closer together, alongside the choice of different stores for Xbox owners. It’s also an opportunity for Microsoft to bring more AI-powered features to the next Xbox.</p><p>“We’re also investing in dedicated silicon to enable the next generation of AI capabilities, that will be transformative in how you actually experience your gameplay,” says Ronald. Microsoft will “start experimenting” with some of these AI-powered features on the upcoming Xbox Ally X device, because it has a dedicated NPU chip just like Microsoft’s Copilot Plus PCs.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/760813/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-new-price-plan-hint]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's rare for Epic Games to make a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Icon skin for a content creator who isn't specifically focused on Fortnite, but it <em>does</em> happen occasionally. And it looks like another influencer is joining that club this week, as Kai Cenat teased on Sunday.</p><p>As the tweet indicates, Cenat is going to reveal the new skin on Monday night at 8:30 PM PT / 11:30 PM ET, and the announcement should happen live on Twitch, since that's usually how they do these things. There will probably be a tournament in the next few days where players can earn the skin for free, before it releases in the item shop later in the week.</p><p>Fortnite typically awards Icon skins--that being a skin based on a real human being, rather than a fictional character--either to streamers who have a specific focus on Fortnite, or celebrities who are much more broadly famous, like Mariah Carey, Shaquille O'Neal, Sabrina Carpenter, and other folks like that.</p><p>Cenat, however, is Fortnite's third Icon Skin, after Mr. Beast and Khaby Lame, that falls in between those two categories--content creators who are famous enough to get a skin despite not being known for playing Fortnite. Epic doesn't do this very often. The Mr. Beast skins were released in December 2022, and Khaby Lame was on the Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass two years ago. Cenat will be the first such Icon skin to hit Fortnite since Khaby Lame.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[CI Games says Lords of the Fallen 2 will be their “Empire Strikes Back” Moment, and a “Darker” Game Than the 2023 Reboot]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ci-games-lords-of-the-fallen-2-empire-strikes-back-dark-knight/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ci-games-says-lords-of-the-fallen-2-will-be-their-%E2%80%9Cempire-strikes-back%E2%80%9D-moment-and-a-%E2%80%9Cdarker%E2%80%9D-game-than-the-2023-reboot.1273032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The very first Lords of the Fallen release came in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/265300/Lords_Of_The_Fallen_2014/">2014</a>, and while it was able to find an audience, it ultimately didn't make a huge splash. Despite a myriad of issues, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">2023 reboot</a> fared much better, so much that CI Games has already announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-egs/">sequel in the works</a> for 2026. After spending a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/">significant amount of time fixing the 2023 release</a>, the studio is confident that its sequel, titled Lords of the Fallen 2, will be the studio's "<em>Empire Strikes Back</em>" moment.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/lords-of-the-fallen-2-ci-games-empire-strikes-back-sequel-darker-title">MP1st</a>, creative portfolio strategist at CI Games, David Valjalo, likened Lords of the Fallen 2 to the famed Star Wars sequel back when the original trilogy was all we knew, or for those who may not have grown up with Star Wars the way Valjalo's generation did, he instead likened it to the studio's Dark Knight moment, the famous sequel in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy.</p>



<p>"<em>We're right on track and in the thick of it now</em>," Valjalo said. "<em>The sequel is looking spectacular. I have the privilege of seeing all the juicy behind the scenes bits and pieces - art, animation, combat, - and each day there's something that just stops me in my tracks. It's bloody, bold, brave...it's a true sequel. It improves on the previous game but carries its spirit forward. It's also a darker game, tonally, with a really unique setting and even higher stakes than the last game, if you can believe that. It's our Empire Strikes Back. Or for Gen Z I suppose it's their Dark Knight</em>."</p>



<p>Strong words from a studio that took two years to release an overhauled "<em>2.0</em>" version of their last game that launched with a bevy of issues, so many that our reviewer called it "<em>one of the most frustrating Souslikes ever released</em>." CI Games also recently permanently reduced the price of the 2023 title, and every game in its catalogue, as part of what it called its <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-permanent-price-cut-ci-games/">"<em>player first</em>" commitment</a> that also couldn't help but read like an apology for the fact that they released a product below their standards two-years prior.</p>



<p>If it does hit its 2026 target release window, then perhaps by 2028 it'll be the studio's 'Empire Strikes Back' for the series.</p>

              <p><span>I like horror movies okay, but I need a good concept to draw me in. </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span> certainly has one of those, but the concept that makes it compelling is also one that taps into my most </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-nickname-pet-name-go-black-white-legends-arceus-1850392164"><span>deep seated fears</span></a><span>, and I don’t know if I can handle it. As the name suggests, </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is a spooky movie whose events are viewed from the perspective of a dog. Aren’t we as humans subjected to the horrors enough? Do we need to bring our canine companions into the pain and suffering?</span></p> <p><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>premiered at South by Southwest way back in March, and the reception to the supernatural horror movie has been </span><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/good_boy_2025"><span>really strong so far</span></a><span>, with early reviews </span><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/good-boy-movie-horror-movie-review-dog-pov-1235102488/"><span>calling it one of the best in the genre this year</span></a><span>. Though I don’t know where it all ends up, several reviews call out that it’s very emotional and heartbreaking—which could mean anything, really—so if you’re looking for a straightforward scare, be aware that </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>might have a bit more going on. The film stars Indy as a dog whose owner has suffered a death in the family and who moves into a haunted house. Ever the watchful companion, Indy notices that something is amiss and he and his owner are not alone. Now, he has to do what he can to save his owner from the dangers lurking in their new home.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Good Boy - Official Trailer | HD | IFC Films" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4-CRkd_74g?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Y’all, I’mma throw up. There’s a reason Does the Dog Die?, an entire website dedicated to </span><a href="https://www.doesthedogdie.com/"><span>asking if a dog you see in movie trailers is going to die</span></a><span>, exists, and it’s for people like me who can’t handle that shit. There’s already a page for </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>on that website and I saw it as I was grabbing the link. I can barely handle seeing a dog be in distress under normal circumstances, much less supernatural ones. Whether Indy makes it out or not, he’s about to have a bad night. I guess I’ve got some time to figure out if I want to see </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>, as the movie is coming to theaters on October 3. </span></p>

              <p>The second season of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505">Amazon Prime’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> show</a> arrives later this year, but before then, we have some new images of the post-apocalyptic series, and one in particular featuring a shot of Las Vegas before the bombs dropped and turned it into <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-series-prime-new-vegas-canon-1851410280">New Vegas</a> is very, very intriguing.</p> <p>On August 18, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/fallout-first-photos-season-2-1236489897/">Amazon shared seven new images</a>&nbsp;of the upcoming season of its hit <em>Fallout</em> TV show. The new screenshots show a variety of characters and locations, but the one that immediately caught my eye was a single shot of Howard Cooper (Walton Goggins) in a car driving down the Las Vegas Strip. (After the bombs fall, it becomes New Vegas.) In the window is a reflection of the Lucky 38’s large and iconic sign, first seen in <a href="https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346">2010’s <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>.</a> In the show, Cooper survives the bombs falling and becomes the decaying bounty hunter known only as the Ghoul. But before that, he had a life pre-war that intersected with Vault-Tec and the company’s nefarious plans. And now it seems like he might have met Mr. House, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-tv-mr-house-new-vegas-1851559169">a villain from <em>New Vegas</em> who was teased back in season one</a>. Okay, <em>Fallout</em> season two, you have my attention.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618243" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618243"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618243">©Amazon / Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>The other teaser images released by Amazon include looks at Ella Purnell’s loveable Lucy and Aaron Morten’s Maximus. We also see Lucy’s dad, played by Kyle MacLachlan, who was revealed to be a pretty bad guy at the end of the show’s first season. He ran off in a power suit to New Vegas, and it seems we’ll be catching up with him later this year. Of course, this isn’t <em>actually</em> the first time we’ve seen some of this stuff, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-new-vegas-set-leaks-lucky-38-amazon-1851768855">as set leaks earlier this year</a> hinted at some pre-war flashbacks set in Las Vegas.</p>     <p>Last year, after premiering in April, the <em>Fallout</em> series received rave reviews, big ratings, and lots of award nominations, leading to a spike in people playing old <em>Fallout</em> games. Amazon quickly announced a second season, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-prime-bethesda-1851421573">which wrapped up filming in May</a>. The highly anticipated new season of <em>Fallout</em> arrives on Amazon Prime this December, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-trailer-new-vegas-season-3-ghoul-lucy-1851780416">the show has already been picked up for a third season</a>. Here’s a teaser for the show’s second season:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fallout Season 2 Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tu5EN8V35JM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

And of course, just like recent weeks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is also hanging out in the top ten, producing yet another double-whammy for Nintendo.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_PuEn0ZOn5c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f036zlkxnp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PuEn0ZOn5c" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of 2025’s biggest and most important titles is a remake—Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. It’s a full remake of MGS3, and the review embargo will tell us if it’s lived up to the original game’s legend, or if it’s fallen flat on its face in Tselinoyarsk mud.</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid is an all-time franchise. Its stories still stand the test of time, and there are gameplay ideas that had they not been done previously would be unthinkable in 2025—although looking at the back of the game case would be slightly problematic in the digital era. I don’t think there’s a finer example of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-boss-fights-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MGS than Snake Eater</a>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater remake</a> is a fitting first reimagining. Even though Hideo Kojima isn’t at the helm of the project, we still expect this to be a hit. So let’s check out its review embargo details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Fans will hang onto the word of reviews. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Several sources have quoted August 22 as the game’s review embargo date, with a release time of 12:01 AM PT.</strong></p>



<p>Many outlets and critics already seem to have gotten their hands on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. You can see from Destin Legarie’s <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page that this is the case.</p>



<p>Destin is quoted as saying: “I’ve played Metal Gear Solid Delta on PS5 and PC. Embargoed for Friday, August 22nd, 2025 as 12:01am PT. Coverage beyond me fanboying will be live at embargo.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>I’ve played Metal Gear Solid Delta on PS5 and PC.

Embargoed for Friday August 22nd, 2025 as 12:01am PT

Coverage beyond me fanboying will be live at embargo.</span></p></article></div>







<p><strong>Expectations for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater are sky-high, and I expect the reviews to follow suit with a Metacritic score in the region of 90-95.</strong></p>



<p>A telltale sign that Konami is confident about Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is that review copies are already out weeks in advance. The other sign is the review embargo date being a week before launch. Companies only do this if they’re confident about their product.</p>



<p>I would suggest Konami is more than happy with the state of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. This is great news when you consider 2004’s original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater has a <strong>91/100 rating</strong> on Metacritic. As long as the remake builds upon existing greatness and adds some modern-day quality of life changes, it’s hard to see the score dropping below 91.</p>



<p>Using my reasoning, I don’t think a <strong>92 or 93</strong> score is out of the question.</p>



<hr>



<p>The wait for the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review embargo will be more excruciating than Naked Snake using CQC to battle a crab. Let me know what score you think the Snake Eater remake is going to score. Be sure to check out the Insider Gaming forum for more MGS discussions.</p>
