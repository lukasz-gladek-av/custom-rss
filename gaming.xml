		<p>It’s been a hell of a gaming week, with some actual bangers arriving to brighten up a dreary start to September. I’ve been reviewing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a>, and loved its rendition of Warhammer 40,000’s universe, and now I’m jumping into Age of Mythology: Retold, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-plucky-squire">The Plucky Squire</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. There is some juggling going on!</p>
<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has also played Astro Bot, and he played it before the rest of us! He awarded it a massive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">10/10 in our review</a>, and told us, “It’s bloody delightful!” He’s also played little bits of Magic and Monster Hunter Now.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> played the demo of Stories from Sol The Gun Dog and started Final Fantasy XVI where he replayed the intro as he forgot what happened in that (isn’t restarting an RPG literally the worst thing in gaming?) He’s also been playing NBA 2K25 and Beyond Galaxyland for review.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been scoundrel-ing in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, hunting in Hunt Showdown 1896, tried out Quidditch Champions, and has been performing indie songs, beating up weirdos, and having emotional moments about his past in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dustborn">Dustborn</a>. That’s not all though, as he tells us, “I also started Cult of the Lamb, which I didn’t know anything about other than make a cult. Now I know it’s Binding of Isaac with a cult theme I’m not sure if I’ll return.”</p>


<p>Giving up on the “fairly pants”&nbsp;Wukong Black Myth, <strong>Ade</strong> has been playing Wild Bastards and Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions for review instead. He’s returned to being a pirate again too: “I’m also on with Skull and Bones Season 3, which is brilliant! Teaming up with about seven other players to take down a giant flying storm dragon was awesome!”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> started the week off strong by finishing the “entertaining” Dungeons of Hinterberg before moving on to Creatures of Ava in the ‘what’s interesting on Game Pass’ style. He’s continued to bung a lot into one week though, continuing, “Alongside that I have just started what will be a very long-running playthrough of the Age of Mythology: Retold which is super nostalgic as I rinsed the original back in the day. I also finished Atlas Fallen: Forgettable Subtitle which was a surprisingly decent open world Ubi-type game but less bloated than the usual Far Cry/Ass Creed. Nice sand traversal and pretty deep combat too. Finally I have just installed the Silent Hill 2 Enhanced Edition PC mod for a pre-Remake playthrough after finishing my review time with an embargoed upcoming horror game that blew me away.”</p>
<p>While he had hoped to continue his career as a Freegunner, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">Sony’s decision to axe Concord</a> left <strong>Jim</strong> with no desire to jump back in (until the game’s expected future relaunch). It’s been a tough week all round for Jim, as he says, “I’ve also entered a bit of a slump while playing Fallout: New Vegas and its Lonesome Road DLC which has turned out to be a bruising gauntlet of super tough enemy encounters I clearly wasn’t ready for. Thankfully the end is in sight – when I return to the Mojave Wasteland, I’ll almost be ready to wrap up the main questline.”</p>

<p><strong>Nick P</strong> played and finished <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/the-casting-of-frank-stone-review/">The Casting of Frank Stone</a> for review, as well as continuing his play through of Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth and Parasite Eve. He almost certainly snuck in some Fortnite and Dead by Daylight too.</p>
<p>And finally, we come to&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong>, who’s shared his impressions from going <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preview-link-who/">hands on with Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, and had a great time with the fresh spin on a Zelda adventure (now with playable Zelda!). Beside that, he dabbled a tiny bit with COD Black Ops 6’s beta, with plans to play some more this weekend, and will make a start on Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown today, after a week of server issues has stalled our review on the starting line.</p>
<p>How about you? Have you been scoundrel-ing? Or do you fancy being a tiny PlayStation robot?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/what-car-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-the-car-review-%E2%80%93-where-we%E2%80%99re-going-we-don%E2%80%99t-need-roads.973914/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/what-car-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of my least favorite things about living in America is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/how-gran-turismo-revolutionized-car-culture">the obsessive car culture</a>. We’re so reliant on them, and they don’t even have legs or rockets! <em>What the Car?</em>, a comedy game from Triband, bravely asks us to reconsider what cars can really do for us.</p>
<p>If you’re a mobile gamer, you’ve already seen this on your iPhone thanks to Apple Arcade. However, on September 9, <em>What the Car?</em> hits Steam, opening the door for so many others to experience this charming game.</p>
<p>At its core, it’s like most other games starring a car: You have to get from point A to B as fast as possible. But like anything worth enjoying, <em>What the Car?</em> is more about the journey than the destination.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-frogger.jpg?itok=mQ_0E3Uq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-frogger.jpg?itok=UTRKszXR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ribbit.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>What the Car?</em> Reinvents the Wheel</h2>
<p>Made by a Copenhagen-based team of developers who primarily don’t drive, <em>What the Car?</em> is a comedy game first and foremost. You might recognize one of their other games, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/what-golf"><em>What the Bat?</em></a></p>
<p>Community Manager Sarah Sanders, who I spoke with at PAX West, said one of their primary measures of success is “laughs per minute.” And I can confirm, I found myself chuckling a lot at this silly little game.</p>
<p><em>What the Car?</em>’s humor lands more often than not thanks to the boundless creativity on display here. You play as the titular Car, who’s primarily on two human legs instead of four wheels—and it only gets weirder from there.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’re a car riding a bike with a jetpack on its back. Other times, you’re an ac-car-dion, slinking along the level, or a carp swimming through water. Occasionally, you're chopping veggies like Cooking Mazda. There’s even one mini-game where you’re a car who would literally rather be fishing.</p>

<p>I’m barely scratching the surface of just how ludicrous these premises get. Each level is named either after the car type or features a punny reference on something else.</p>
<p>Choice names include “Bike Me Up Inside,” “Drop It Like It’s Hot Wheels,” and my personal favorite, “Car on Skateboard but Giraffe.” That last one’s not a pun; it’s just wonderfully silly, with and without context.</p>
<p>Controlling each of these monstrosities is pretty simple, and it’s maybe the biggest giveaway of the game’s mobile roots. You move left or right and have one action button. The action button can be pressed or held, depending on the level and the car’s modifications.</p>
<p>The only thing funnier than the puns is moving Car itself, especially when it's a weird mess of spare parts and gears. Turns out, controlling a car with keyboards for wheels isn't easy, but the absurdity of it all makes it so enjoyable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-pirate-ship.jpg?itok=3FkE5ME7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-pirate-ship.jpg?itok=RSn_q7n5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is the tale of Captain Jack Car-row.</figcaption></figure><p>For the most part, maybe only one or two levels confused me on how they worked, but that confusion lasted for maybe five seconds. Once you play around with it, it’s all pretty intuitive.</p>
<p>Each level, you're ranked by a bronze, silver, or gold crown based on how long it took you to finish. As an added challenge, there's a collectible card hidden in each level, asking you to detour and find some shortcuts.</p>
<p>Thankfully, shortcuts can be easy to find on lots of these levels. The physics in <em>What the Car? </em>are whimsically wonky, giving you lots of leeway to make certain jumps or finagle your way around corners.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-hot-wheels.jpg?itok=k49rJPkc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-hot-wheels.jpg?itok=sT3r0ega 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What's this? A normal-looking racing game?</figcaption></figure><h2>Pumping the Brakes</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I found the wonky physics to also be a small point of contention. There are optional harder levels denoted by a skull, and personally, the floaty feeling sometimes contributed to more annoyance than ingenious shortcutting.</p>
<p>Sometimes Car's legs would get stuck on some debris, and other times, one little bump would send it flying higher than expected. Similar bumps would just result in a smaller hop or something, but it wasn't always predictable.</p>
<p>Momentum also works a little weirdly in <em>What the Car?</em>, where sometimes hopping with a jetpack would carry forward the momentum. Yet other times, it would just kill all the built-up speed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-soccer-cannon.jpg?itok=t5iID_KV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-soccer-cannon.jpg?itok=zK8DKseT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, that's a car sliding along on its top with the power of a soccer ball cannon.</figcaption></figure><p>Levels are grouped into what Triband calls Episodes, and at the time of writing, <em>What the Car? </em>has nine themed Episodes. You can navigate to each of these Episodes through an overworld that Car can run through and explore.</p>
<p>There are lines that denote main-path levels and optional levels, and there's even more to find off the beaten path, like secret quests and skull levels.</p>
<p>On the whole, though, I think the overworld introduces more tedium than fun. Exploring is alright, but it wears out its welcome partway through, and the extra bit of time it takes to navigate through levels doesn't really add to the charm.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm biased by the demo I played at PAX West, where it was just a quick hit of level after level, just a black screen in between. That rapid fire of inventive humor felt better paced than what the overworld provided.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-overworld.jpg?itok=4jAvNj40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-overworld.jpg?itok=YjHbyV1s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The bears are cute, though.</figcaption></figure><h2>Live Servicing Your Car</h2>
<p>Another sign of <em>What the Car?</em>'s mobile gaming roots, there's already a history of Triband supporting the game with updates after launch. The team continues to add new Episodes, and they release surveys asking players what they should do next.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are daily missions as well as special weekly levels to enjoy. If that's still not enough content, there's a whole library of user-generated levels that you can explore—and there's already a lot, thanks to the Apple Arcade head start.</p>

<p>If you want to get into the level-making game though, I'd recommend a large dose of patience to go with it. The level editor uses the same control scheme as the overworld navigation. In fact, all the menus use this system; you walk up to what you want to do and interact with it.</p>
<p>I found this made for less precision and control over the creation tools, which makes the well-built stages all the more impressive. However, it also meant I wouldn't jump into it for myself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/what-the-car-mad-max.jpg?itok=YujjT6Zv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/what-the-car-mad-max.jpg?itok=v4NZqWYj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm torn between making a Darude - Sandstorm joke or a Mad Max reference.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>What the Car?</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Long story short, there's a lot of content to explore in <em>What the Car?</em>, if it's your kind of game. The mainline levels plus some side content took me five hours, but if you obsess over getting the gold crown and card on everything, you can get a lot of miles out of this.</p>
<p>However, I think this game benefits more from taking it easy on the scenic route. At first, I got caught up in trying to get gold everything, but that detracted from enjoying the absurdity of the game.</p>
<p>As long as you're expecting a silly game that deconstructs the meaning of a car, you'll be in for a good time with a high laughs per minute score. But your mileage may vary if you take it more seriously.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>What the Car? </strong>was reviewed on PC via Steam with a copy provided by the developer over the course of around 5 hours of gameplay. All screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
If we’re measuring the success of What the Car? by laughs per minute, it’s a pretty sweet ride. The overworld eventually wears out its welcome, and some of the harder levels feel a little too frustrating for a comedy game. However, as an overall lighthearted experience, this game kicks it into high gear. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-pathea-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>My Time at Portia&nbsp;</em>developer Pathea Games has revealed&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, the third game in the cozy series of life sims.</p>
<p>Right now, we don't know a whole lot about&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>; a full reveal is coming later this month when <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Kickstarter campaign</a>&nbsp;for the new game goes live. We don't have an official date for that yet.</p>
<p>What we do have, though, is a piece of concept art, which you can see above. It depicts what are presumably several of the characters from&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, as well as the game's logo, which is consistent with the previous two games in the series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-time-at-sandrock-gameplay-my-time-at-evershine.jpg?itok=mlXHZ73M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-time-at-sandrock-gameplay-my-time-at-evershine.jpg?itok=mbtdFlN2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The followup to&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/666140/view/4602203912329491293" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a> teasing&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, Pathea says it opted for a Kickstarter campaign once again with&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>because "indie game development comes with its challenges".</p>
<p>The studio says that&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock</em>'s budget was nearly $12 million, which "stretched [the] studio's resources". Since Pathea wants to "reach and exceed"&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, crowdfunding will help the devs to "make more decisions earlier in the development cycle".</p>
<p>Pathea says that&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>will feature "major upgrades in graphics, animation, and gameplay", and that it will offer "more consistent product quality across all platforms".</p>
<p>The announcement concludes with Pathea saying that crowdfunding has helped it to gather together a community of passionate fans, and that it hopes those fans will "continue to support [it]" throughout&nbsp;<em>Evershine</em>'s development.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-time-at-portia-pathea-games.jpg?itok=DnRf04J2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-time-at-portia-pathea-games.jpg?itok=h1bkhoHj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also recognize Pathea Games' name from&nbsp;<em>My Time at Portia</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If it feels like there hasn't been much time between the release of&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>and the announcement of&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, well, that's because there hasn't.</p>
<p><em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-sandrock-early-access-release-date-revealed">hit Early Access back in May 2022</a>, and it was released in full in November last year (having been delayed from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-sandrock-finally-builds-full-release-date-will-leave-early-access-in">original September release date</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when you factor in development time, it's likely we won't see&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>for a good few years yet, so there's still plenty of time to play and enjoy&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock</em>.</p>

I will presenting my own understanding and experiences as both a player and a game designer</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whether it's levelling up a character, acquiring new abilities, or unlocking powerful gear, the satisfaction of becoming stronger or more capable keeps players engaged and invested in the game world. Understanding the psychology behind power progression can help game designers create experiences that resonate with players on a deeper level, leading to more immersive and enjoyable games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="1. The Appeal of Progression: Why Do Players Crave Growth?">1. The Appeal of Progression: Why Do Players Crave Growth?</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation:">Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the heart of power progression, in games, lies the delicate balance between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation drives players through the internal satisfaction of mastering skills, overcoming challenges, or uncovering stories. Some other common intrinsic motivators are exploration and curiosity. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Detroit: Become Human</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> relies quite heavily on these types of motivation; this game's story changes depending on the player's actions, using curiosity to drive players to replay the game and explore alternative versions of the story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the other hand, extrinsic motivation is fueled by external rewards like levelling up, earning loot, or gaining recognition from others. Many multiplayer competitive games motivate the player through their ranking systems and being able to showcase their rank as prestige, or unlockable skins.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valorant </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Call of Duty</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will award players with icons to represent either their mastery of the game, or overall play time.

The game sets the expectation that a large chest will contain something that will give you access to new areas of the game. It builds further emphasis on the importance of this item by combining several of the mentioned elements; having a musical jingle, playing an animation and drawing all focus on Link opening the chest.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Feedback Loops:">Feedback Loops:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Feedback loops are a fundamental concept in game design, especially in the context of power progression. A positive feedback loop occurs when success in the game leads to further success, creating a sense of momentum and growth. Open world games that have level-locked zones allow for the player to feel this sense of power increase; enemies that used to be tough are now easily dispatched and an area the player previously couldn’t have survived, now becomes the play area for them to explore.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conversely, a negative feedback loop can be used to introduce challenges that prevent players from advancing too quickly, ensuring that the game remains engaging and balanced. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Kart</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> uses a negative feedback loop with its item distribution system, the better your positioning within the race the weaker your item will be.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Designing Effective Progression Systems">2. Designing Effective Progression Systems</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Balancing Challenge and Reward:">Balancing Challenge and Reward:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The core of an effective progression system lies in the balance between challenge and reward. If a game is too difficult, players may feel frustrated and disengaged; if it's too easy, the rewards can feel unearned, diminishing the sense of accomplishment. Striking the right balance means creating a difficulty curve that gradually increases, ensuring that players are constantly being tested but are also consistently rewarded for their efforts. This balance keeps players in a state of "flow", where the game is challenging enough to be engaging but not so difficult that it becomes discouraging. Within </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Left 4 Dead 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s The Parish level, the director system will determine a path through the cemetery and how intense of a hoard to fight depending on how the players are progressing, aiming to keep the players in an appropriate state of flow whilst moving through the zone.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Milestones and Plateaus:">Milestones and Plateaus:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In any progression system, the pacing of rewards is crucial. Frequent small rewards keep players motivated, while larger, more significant milestones provide a sense of major achievement. However, periods of slower progression, or plateaus, can also play an important role. These moments of relative stasis build anticipation and make the eventual breakthrough more satisfying. By designing a progression system with well-placed milestones and intentional plateaus, game designers can keep players engaged and eager to continue their journey.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Your Chronicle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, an incremental game, showcases this principle well. The player can progress through each area's minor dungeons, unlocking small amounts of content upon completion (minor milestones), however the story content will plateau unless the player switches gears to focus on increasing the strength of their creatures, allowing them to beat the area boss and unlock the next area of content (major milestone).</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Customisable Progression Paths:">Customisable Progression Paths:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most effective ways to enhance player engagement is by offering customisable progression paths. Whether through skill trees, branching storylines, or personalised upgrades, allowing players to choose how they progress through the game creates a deeper sense of ownership and investment in their character’s development. This personalisation not only makes the progression feel more meaningful but also caters to different playstyles, ensuring that a wide range of players can find satisfaction in their unique journey through the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Path of Exile</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s skill tree will place the player on a different starting point depending on which character they start with, and as they player earns skill points they can move around the tree customising the build to whatever they would like.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="3. The Emotional Journey of Progression">3. The Emotional Journey of Progression</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="From Novice to Master:">From Novice to Master:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players start as beginners, often with limited abilities and knowledge, and gradually grow into experts who can overcome increasingly complex challenges. This progression mirrors many classic tales, where the protagonist evolves through trials and tribulations. By carefully pacing this growth, game designers can create a deep emotional connection between the player and their character, making each victory feel like a hard-earned step toward mastery. The satisfaction of seeing one’s skills develop over time is a key driver of long-term engagement.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Overcoming Obstacles:">Overcoming Obstacles:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Encountering new obstacles and setbacks requires players to measure, compare and adapt the strategies they had been using, allowing them to develop new strategies, eventually leading to learning and triumph. Forcing players to interact with a new item or ability increases their overall understanding and mastery of the game. Effective obstacle design encourages experimentation and enhances the player’s sense of achievement, turning moments of struggle into learning points.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Within my own game Deadbeat Wizard, the player must use their lightning spell to disable shielded enemies.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The Endgame:">The Endgame:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As players approach the endgame, the traditional power progression often slows or reaches its peak. However, maintaining player engagement at this stage is crucial. The endgame can introduce new forms of progression, such as mastery of advanced mechanics, social status within the game’s player community, or the pursuit of rare and prestigious rewards. By shifting the focus from growth to refinement, and from power to prestige, designers can create a satisfying conclusion to the player's journey while still offering goals to strive for. This approach ensures that the emotional investment in the game continues, even after the main progression is complete.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="4.

For instance, adaptive difficulty systems dynamically adjust the game’s challenge based on the player's performance, ensuring a balanced experience that keeps players in their ideal "flow" state. Roguelites, on the other hand, offer a unique twist by using post-run progression, where each playthrough builds upon the last, creating a cycle of learning and improvement. These innovations highlight how contemporary game design continues to evolve, offering new ways to keep progression systems fresh and engaging.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Live Service Games:">Live Service Games:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Live service games, like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, have revolutionised power progression by introducing seasonal content that refreshes the player experience over time. These games keep players engaged through ongoing updates, new goals, and time-limited rewards that encourage regular play. Seasonal progression systems provide a sense of renewal and excitement, with each season offering new challenges and opportunities for growth and mastery of a new set of skills. This approach not only sustains long-term player interest but also creates a dynamic, ever-evolving game world where progression is constantly being redefined.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fortnite Season 4 banners showcasing the new features and locations added within that chapter.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="5. Avoiding Common Pitfalls in Power Progression">5. Avoiding Common Pitfalls in Power Progression</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Power Creep:">Power Creep:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Power creep occurs when new content gradually raises the power ceiling, making older abilities, gear, or strategies less effective over time. This can lead to imbalance and frustration, as players may feel compelled to constantly chase the latest meta to remain competitive. To avoid power creep, designers can introduce horizontal progression, where new content offers different playstyles or abilities rather than simply increasing power. Additionally, seasonal resets or level caps can help maintain balance by ensuring that older content remains relevant and that progression feels fair and rewarding for all players.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Monotony:">Monotony:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the risks in designing power progression systems is falling into monotony, where players feel like they're simply grinding through repetitive tasks to achieve incremental gains. This can quickly lead to boredom and disengagement. To combat monotony, it's essential to introduce variety in the ways players progress. This could involve offering multiple types of challenges, incorporating narrative-driven progression elements, or providing different routes to reach similar goals. By keeping the progression experience dynamic and varied, designers can maintain player interest and help make each step in the journey feel fresh and exciting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Skill level 92 is the halfway point in terms of experience to reach skill level 99 in RuneScape.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Player Fatigue:">Player Fatigue:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Player fatigue is a common issue in games with extensive power progression systems, particularly when players feel pressured to constantly grind for progression. This can lead to burnout and a diminished enjoyment of the game. To prevent fatigue, it's important to design progression systems that allow for breaks and downtime. Implementing features like daily or weekly caps on progression, offering non-progression-based activities, or introducing narrative pauses can give players a chance to recharge without feeling like they’re falling behind. By respecting players' time and providing a balanced pace of progression, designers can help maintain long-term player engagement and enjoyment.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion: Crafting Compelling Power Progression Systems">Conclusion: Crafting Compelling Power Progression Systems</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Striking the right balance between challenge and reward is essential. When players feel that their progress is deserved and impactful, it deepens their connection to the game and enhances the sense of achievement with each milestone. Avoiding missteps like power creep or overly slow advancement ensures that the progression remains exciting and rewarding, encouraging players to continue their journey.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Innovation in power progression breathes new life into familiar systems, offering fresh experiences that keep players intrigued. Whether by revisiting classic mechanics or introducing entirely new ones, designers have the opportunity to create progression systems that resonate deeply, making each step forward feel significant and engaging.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And so in the end, power progression is far more than a method for increasing a player's capabilities; it's the driving force behind a game’s emotional and narrative depth. This system takes players on a journey of growth, where every challenge overcome and every skill mastered becomes a testament to their evolving prowess. The true power of progression lies in its ability to keep players engaged, motivated, and emotionally invested in their journey.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/slitterhead-preview-bloody-and-bit-messy</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slitterhead-preview-bloody-and-a-bit-messy.973872/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/slitterhead-preview-bloody-and-bit-messy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's hard to believe it's been several years since the reveal of <em>Slitterhead</em>, with its bone-chilling and downright disturbing reveal trailer. After seeing its actual gameplay during the Summer Game Fest showcase last June, I was even more intrigued by its strange mesh of action and horror.</p>
<p>We managed to get some hands-on time with <em>Slitterhead</em> at PAX West 2024, and that initial intrigue I had is now a bit more restrained. <em>Slitterhead</em> doesn't seem like a bad game, but I'm having a difficult time grasping the vision its trying to execute.</p>

<h2><em>Slitterhead</em>'s a Bit of a Weird One</h2>
<p>Mechanically, <em>Slitterhead</em> is a smorgasbord of genres: Horror, action, and hell, even some platforming is thrown into the mix. The demo I played seemed to be a tutorial giving players a grasp of the traversal mechanics and combat, but there's a lot going on under the hood, so I wish there was more time to see what else <em>Slitterhead</em> has to offer.</p>
<p>But let's start with the premise. Well, it <em>seems</em> like players begin as a spirit than can possess and control the bodies of humans. Set in an ambiguous, densely crowded city (probably Hong Kong?), <em>Slitterhead</em> gives players ample bodies to take over as they travel around the city. Jumping from human to human is actually pretty neat as a means to get to your objective.</p>
<p>You can pop into some old lady's body, look up at some folks on a balcony from afar, jump into one of them, and then possess another person even higher up in a building to travel. In one instance, in order to get more acquainted with these mechanics, <em>Slitterhead</em> asked me to jump off a building, and right before hitting the bottom, taking over a body on the street.</p>

<p>Of course, the original host dies and a bunch of people go running in panic. Since you can't travel far without possessing someone, it necessitates jumping around like these, even at the expense of someone's life. How traversal actually plays out in the actual story is an unknown, though, since again, this was more of a tutorial asking me to reach a destination with no story impact.</p>
<p>These random people you take control of are more than just fodder used to jump around -- they're the means by which you'll fight. There are various creepy and horrific enemies the demo had me battle, and the more people you have around to take control of, the more you can switch around to dodge. And of course, if one of your hosts is nearly dead, swap to a fresh one and head back into battle.</p>

<h2><em>Slitterhead</em>'s Weirdness Extends to its Combat</h2>
<p>There's also this blood sword you use to fight enemies, which looks as badass as it sounds. You can slash with light and heavy attacks, as well as parry enemies. The parrying is a little weird here -- it's positional, so you're given an indicator where their strike might land, and you'll flick the joystick a certain way in order to (hopefully) parry the attack.</p>
<p>It took quite a few times to get used to the parry timing, and I'm not sure I like it all that much. It's not as satisfying a parry as other games, and it makes the gameplay feel a bit slow overall. Gameplay picks up near the end of my demo, however, as we discover what is called a Rarity.</p>
<p>While most humans are generic and hold no special abilities, Rarity are exceptional individuals with powerful skills. One Rarity is backed into a corner by a "Slitterhead." By possessing the Rarity, we're given these bloody claws that ferociously slash away at the enemy, and we're granted a few other abilities for damage or support effects.</p>

<p>Rarities seem to be tied to story and are likely the main characters you'll use throughout the campaign, but they aren't invincible, so you still need to use the regular people to your advantage as well. This boss we fight, a Slitterhead, transforms into some horrifying, almost Lovecraftian horror before it's defeated.</p>
<p>This boss is where I regained some enthusiasm for what's in store with <em>Slitterhead</em>. I'm not sure if I jive with the slower combat, but Rarities hold some potential; likewise, I don't know if the platforming will stay fresh across however long the campaign ends up being.</p>
<p>And though I enjoy the grimy, neon-lit aesthetic,<em> Slitterhead</em> looks quite dated. Closeups of models are disappointing, to say the least. The city is nice, but it also fails upon closer scrutiny. Overall, it failed to meet some of my expectations, along with the gameplay. Hopefully by this November, I'll be interested enough to take a look at the final release.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, Larian released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings">Patch 7 for Baldur's Gate 3</a> on PC. This patch sorts out some lingering bugs and adds a number of new features to the game, including additional evil ending cinematics (more on those in a moment).</p>
<p>This patch also added official mod support to the PC version of the game, with the aim to get this patch onto consoles and Mac sometime next month.</p>
<p>However, if you are a PC player who wants to hold off updating their copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> with this recent patch for whatever reason, you can do just that.</p>

</figure>
<p>In a follow-up post to yesterday's Patch 7 announcement, the Baldur's Gate 3 developer said it had also made a Patch 6 beta branch for those " who want to to allow more time for mod authors to update their mods, continue to play on multiplayer with Mac, or keep console cross-saves working!" Huzzah!</p>
<p>Here's what you need to do, as laid out by <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1831750095118987542">Larian</a>, to head down this Patch 6 beta branch:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on BG3 in your Steam Library &gt; Properties &gt; Betas</li>
<li>On Beta Participation select: release_patch6_hf9</li>
</ol>
<p>And, that's all there is to it.</p>
<p>So, now... those evil endings I mentioned. Please note, the below <strong>will contain spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3</strong>, so if you want to keep any ending details as a surprise, this image break is your cue to head elsewhere now.</p>

<p>Right, let's have at it.</p>
<p>Larian has well and truly delivered with its batch of evil ending cinematics, so much so that Baldur's Gate 3's tiefling Barbarian Karlach was actually trending on social media yesterday. As pointed out by one <a href="https://x.com/gali_le0/status/1831725884174172231">fan</a>, Karlach's ending is "absolutely metal", with the tiefling going "absolutely insane!

			<p>Almost ten years after its original release, Bloodborne is finally getting some impressive visual improvements thanks to the ShadPS4 emulator and the hard work of modders.</p>
<p>Well-known Souls series modder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fromsoftserve</a>, shared a video earlier this week showcasing the game with full dynamic shadows, which improve the visuals quite a bit. Obviously, their inclusion impacts performance greatly in certain scenarios, but as emulation improves, so should performance with similar mods aiming to enhance visuals.</p>
<p><iframe title="I added dynamic shadows to ALL of Bloodborne PC (and more ShadPS4 progress, too!)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-XXSVFJ7wJ8?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The modder also shared an additional Bloodborne gameplay video showcasing how the game runs on the ShadPS4 emulator currently and how far it is possible to go into the main campaign before it becomes unplayable. When the game runs well, emulation is extremely accurate, and with the rapid pace the ShadPS4 developers have been improving the emulator, it really won't take much longer to have the game fully playable on PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="I play Bloodborne on PC for an hour &amp; ascend to a Great One (derogatory)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-kzRnMWwf44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Full dynamic shadows aren't the only improvement fromsoftserve is working on for Bloodborne. The modder already released the first version of an <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-upgraded-texture-pack-remaster/">Upgraded Texture Pack</a> which will eventually enhance all of the game's textures.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator that is making it possible to play Bloodborne on PC can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

			<p>At some point during development, Black Myth: Wukong featured online multiplayer, as revealed in a new video shared online earlier this week.</p>
<p>The video, which was put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LiPuDeDongZai">Outrageous Dong Chai</a>, shows the references to the scrapped online multiplayer mode that can still be found in the game's code. While the entire video is only available in Chinese, there's no doubt that the user's findings are related to online multiplayer with options like creating and joining rooms, role configuration, and more. As Black Myth: Wukong is getting expanded in the future to further extend the title's life and increase its sales from the already impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-18-million-copies-expansion/">18 million figure</a>, which was achieved in only two weeks, the addition of a multiplayer mode would extend the game's life even further than a few simple expansions could.</p>
<p><iframe title="黑神话悟空竟有联机模式！被删掉的隐藏内容有哪些？" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0iaLmenkDiE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide and will launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delay-has-nothing-to-do-with-xbox-limitations-says-microsoft/">yet-to-be-determined release date</a>. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>

                <p>Actors union SAG-AFTRA, which also represents voice actors, has announced that companies behind 80 games have agreed to its terms over the use of AI, while voice actors and mo-cap performers continue to strike against major industry players. The contracts, which include both tiered-budget and interim agreements, will allow performers more employment opportunities as the strike continues.</p><p>The video game actors' strike <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">began on July 26</a> this year, with the union demanding fair AI protection for its members. At the beginning of the strike, SAG-AFTRA said that studios would need to sign one of three agreements offering "critical AI protections" if they wanted to hire union talent for covered work, which includes all games that started development after September 2023.</p><p>Currently, 80 games are covered by one of these agreements, a statistic that SAG-AFTRA says proves its terms are reasonable and fair for businesses. "We applaud those video game companies signing our tiered-budget and interim agreements," said SAG-AFTRA chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. "Not only are they doing the right thing by their workers; they’re also helping to preserve the human art, ingenuity, and creativity that fuels interactive storytelling. These agreements signal that the video game companies in the collective-bargaining group do not represent the will of the larger video game industry."</p><p>Some of the studios that have already signed agreements include Lightspeed L.A., which is currently working on its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-sentinel-announced-with-gripping-debut-trailer/1100-6519787/" data-ref-id="1100-6519787">debut game Last Sentinel</a>, as well as Ark: Survival Evolved developer Studio Wildcard and indie studio Little Bat Games.</p><p>SAG-AFTRA adds that some of the games that have signed agreements weren't covered by the strike order to begin with, but have now guaranteed that actors' performances both past and present will be protected from unregulated AI use.</p><p>The voice actors' strike will continue, with the major industry players involved in the bargaining still yet to come to an agreement with SAG-AFTRA. The companies involved in the negotiations include EA, Activision, Take-Two, WB Games, and more. It has been confirmed that GTA 6 will be unaffected by the strike, and current live-service games are also exempt from the strike action.</p>

<p>When launching the game on Steam, an Epic Online Services client is installed once the game's EULA (End User Licence Agreement) is accepted. This is to support optional crossplay between players on both platforms and to synchronise friend lists between them, <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/forums/27-bugs/threads/43800-quick-note-on-the-most-common-issues#post-207833">Focus confirmed in a forum post</a>.</p>
<p>"However, please be aware linking your Steam and Epic accounts is not required to enjoy the game," the company wrote. "These features are entirely optional and will not affect your gameplay experience in any way."</p>

</figure>
<p>However, players have since complained of "stealth installation of Epic Online Services" and have, of course, review bombed the game on Steam in protest.</p>
<p>Clearly there's been a misunderstanding from players through a seeming lack of transparency from the developer. Perhaps they just clicked through the EULA too quickly. As one reddit user wrote, it's "a touch egregious".</p>
<p>The EULA itself, from developer Saber, is now standard in games. It seems some players didn't read it in full.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="563"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1f9ule0/space_marine_2_is_sitting_at_55_on_steam_due_to/">Space Marine 2 is sitting at 55% on Steam due to stealth installation of Epic Online Services, Saber EULA which makes you acknowledge and consent to the processing and transfer of personal data collection, and bugs.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/saltysteve0621/">u/saltysteve0621</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/">Warhammer40k</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Space Marine 2 follows Earth Defence Force 6, released back in July, which had a similar Epic requirement for crossplay that frustrated players.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Epic Games for clarification on its client requirements for crossplay.</p>
<p>Perhaps a precedent of sorts was set by Sony at the start of the year, when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> required players link their Steam accounts with PSN. This was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">overturned due to player backlash</a>, but then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">put back in place</a> a few months later.</p>
<p>While Space Marine 2 had a "mixed" review shortly after launch, it's now risen to "mostly positive" as players perhaps understand more of the situation following the comments from Focus.</p>
<p>"Space Marine 2's campaign is a spectacular and mostly thrilling follow-up to the original, but the game's grisly combat shines best in its cooperative Operations mode," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Eurogamer Space Marine 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>And if you are experiencing more tangible issues with the game, such as game crashes or controller issues, the Focus forum post provides potential workarounds for each.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Gearbox developers working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk Of Rain 2</a> have released a patch for its poorly received expansion, Seekers Of The Storm. The recent DLC for the action roguelike came out of the oven a little doughy, with enough game-breaking bugs to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risk-of-rain-2-creators-still-believe-that-gearbox-is-heading-in-the-right-direction-despite-troubles-with-recent-dlc">thoroughly upset some fans</a>. Including one bug that sometimes made the game's final boss accidentally invincible. Ah. Yesterday's patch seems to target the worst of these bugs, and the dev team promise there are more fixes are to come.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This DLC fell short of your expectations," said the developers in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/632360/view/4608959311771420255">a Steam update post accompanying the patch notes</a>. "That feedback is fair. We’d like to take a moment and walk everyone through our plan to make it right."</p>
<p>A lot of the issues seem to have stemmed from a bug that "occasionally led to behaviors being erroneously tied to FPS." You can see why this might bother players on a slower PC. For example, one weapon, <a href="https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crowdfunder">the Crowdfunder</a>, would stop firing if the player's frame rate dipped below 30 frames per second. (This sounds similar to a bug reported in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> following its Lightfall expansion, by which any damage the player took from enemies was <a href="https://gamerant.com/destiny-2-enemy-damage-fps-link/">seemingly tied to the player's frame rate</a>). It's a substantial error. But considering the sheer amount of overlapping and ultra-stacking relics and effects in Risk Of Rain 2, I'm not surprised the code is easy to break. </p>
<p>That particular frame rate bug is now fixed, claim the developers, alongside a long list of other issues, like the cheekily invulnerable final boss, and another bug that prevented players from picking up items (somewhat important in a fast-paced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>). </p>
<p>"First, to be clear, we're committed to making the DLC everything that you expected and deserve," the developer continues. "This is a game that countless people love; anything that jeopardizes that experience is something we take very seriously. We hope that in the coming days and weeks, we can earn back your trust, and we know that’s going to take time and action."</p>
<p>The poorly optimised DLC garnered some annoyance but also some sympathy, in particular from Risk Of Rain's original creators at Hopoo Games (they sold the rights to Gearbox in 2022). "Definitely a hard situation for everyone involved," said the roguelike's co-creator Duncan Drummond last week. Since then, Drummond and his co-founder Paul Morse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risk-of-rain-creators-wind-down-work-on-unannounced-project-and-take-jobs-at-valve">shuttered their studio so they could take jobs at Valve</a> along with other workers at Hopoo. In other words, it's been a dramatic couple of weeks for Risk Of Rain 2.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cosmetic-skins-spectre-divide/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spectre-divide-reduces-cosmetic-skin-price-from-90-to-70-after-backlash.973803/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cosmetic-skins-spectre-divide/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Spectre Divide, a new free-to-play 3v3 competitive shooter, has reduced its cosmetic skin prices by 17-25% following criticism that they are too high.</p>



<p>Mountaintop Studios, the development team behind Spectre Divide, announced its plans on Discord yesterday. The announcement read, “First and foremost—my personal apologies for the situation. We’ve heard the feedback on pricing, and we’re going to make some big adjustments.” Those “big adjustments” include a 17-25% reduction in the prices of weapons and characters across the board.</p>



<p>However, Mountaintop Studios has still faced criticism for the move as its skin prices are still way too high. One bundle, named the ‘Cryo Kinesis Masterpiece bundle’ will set players back 7000 Spectre Points, equivalent to $70.</p>



<p>For that price, for which you can buy a fully-fledged AAA title, you’ll get four very basic weapon camos and an axe melee weapon (which is still just a cosmetic overhaul to a knife).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even more concerning to players is that the bundle already had a 25% discount before the recent change, which would have set players back nearly $120. </p>



<p>Following the recent change, the game’s next bundle, named the “Medusa Bundle,” is cheaper but will still set you back 3400 Spectre Points, equivalent to $34. </p>



<p>Spectre Divide is out now for PC, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spectre-divide-console-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console versions of the game</a> expected to be released in the future.</p>



<p>What do you think of Spectre Divides’ overly priced cosmetic skins? Let us know in the comment below!</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s price is increasing from £10.99 to a very precise £16.75 ($20/€19.50) later today, 6th September.</p>

<p>"Thank you to all the dedicated Ghost Hunters worldwide for your ongoing support. We’re excited to welcome new recruits when Phasmophobia is released on PS5, PS VR2, and Xbox Series X|S later this year."</p>
<p>Phasmophobia has indeed changed significantly since it first launched in early access four years ago.</p>
<p>Not only are there extra ghosts, maps, and difficulties, but substantial changes have also been made to your ghost-hunting tech, ghost behaviours, and challenges.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Developer Kinetic gave players "two-three" hours notice of the changes a couple of hours ago, so if you've yet to bite but are keen to lock it in at the early access price, you'd better move like a Jinn and grab it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all ghosthunters are happy with the price increase, which works out to be a 41 percent hike here in the UK.</p>
<p>"Here's an idea, maybe hold off on price gouging future hunters (console players) until you include one of the main features, voice recognition, that makes the game more immersive, and unique. It's only fair to hold off until you can release a full game, not just a half-assed one," <a href="https://x.com/JessicaMosley86/status/1831970577554518311">said</a> one.</p>
<p>"It's a disgrace they are upping the price without adding the voice recognition for consoles," added <a href="https://x.com/skippy1090/status/1831974746357199032">another</a>. "After the bs them saying it would be released a while back. No communication what so ever. I own it on PC but want it for console too."</p>
<p>There's currently still no word on when the ghost-hunting adventure will be released on console, but Kinetic says it's still due "later this year".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Week 3 quests are live; players can acquire 100,000 XP with this week’s quests.

<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-week-3-quests-list">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Week 3 Quests List</h2>



<p>The game releases new weekly quests every Tuesday, each granting 20,000 XP to players. Fortnite’s Week 3 quests for the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/be-a-marvel-hero-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-4-absolute-doom?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Absolute Doom</a> season are as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-damage-opponents-with-the-monarch-pistol">Damage opponents with the Monarch Pistol</h3>



<p>The first quest is simple, but acquiring the Monarch Pistol can take time. Players can find this weapon in common and rare chests across the island. If you are confident, you can defeat Doombot to get a hold of his legendary Monarch Pistol. Once you have the weapon, inflict 300 damage on any enemy player or NPC to complete the quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-collect-ammo-while-you-have-a-specialist-hired">Collect ammo while you have a specialist hired.</h3>



<p>This Fortnite Week 3 quest could be the easiest one of the season. All you need to do is head to Redline Rig or Grand Glacier and hire a specialist. Then, keep opening ammo boxes and chests in the area until the quest is completed. You only need 50 bullets to complete this quest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, this Fortnite Week 3 quest requires some skill from the players. You have to collect 15 weapons from eliminated opponents. However, you can complete this quest across multiple matches.

<p>The last quest for Fortnite Week 3 is challenging because it is time-consuming. Firstly, you must remember to sprint just before shooting at any enemy on the island. Also, you have to inflict 3,000 points of damage, which is challenging. Consider taking on Doombot or Emma Frost while completing this quest to get it done quickly.&nbsp;</p>

Microsoft has a long list of first-party studios currently working on various games due out across the next few years, but the mention of Activision, Blizzard, and Bethesda perhaps narrows down the list. Activision is set to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> in October, so perhaps the shooter will make an appearance. Blizzard, fresh from releasing World of Warcraft expansion <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within">The War Within</a>, has Diablo 4 expansion <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred">Vessel of Hatred</a> out in October, as well as ongoing updates for mobile game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a>.

Obsidian’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, recently delayed to February next year, may also turn up.</p><p>As for the games from third-party partners based in Japan and across Asia, perhaps Square Enix will finally announce <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-to-double-down-on-xbox-releases-final-fantasy-14-producer-says">Final Fantasy 16 for Xbox</a>, and maybe even the Final Fantasy 7 remakes for Microsoft’s consoles. Microsoft recently announced that MiHoYo’s megahit <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/genshin-impact-is-coming-to-xbox-gamescom-2024">Genshin Impact is finally coming to Xbox</a>, so maybe that game will make a big splash, too.</p><p>It’s worth noting that this year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Microsoft closed its Japan developer Tango Gameworks</a>, with the studio having released Hi-Fi Rush to critical acclaim, as part of significant cuts that resulted in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">1,900 layoffs</a> across its gaming business. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/around-50-of-100-tango-gameworks-staff-moving-over-to-krafton">PUBG publisher Krafton later picked up roughly 50 of the 100 staff members employed at Tango</a>.</p><p>Microsoft is also heavily rumored to be working on an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-xbox-handheld-rumors-being-able-to-play-games-locally-is-really-important-ign-live-2024">Xbox handheld</a>, and has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console">confirmed plans for next-generation consoles</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Remedy is set to update its original version of Alan Wake on PC, removing David's Bowie's Space Oddity from the credits in the process.</p>
<p>This, the developer has said, is due to "changes in licensing". Once this update goes live, players will instead be met with an original song by Petri Alanko, known as Strange Moons.</p>
<p>Alanko has also composed music for a number of Remedy's other games, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> and Control.</p>

<p>Resharing Remedy's post, Alanko said the upcoming replacement song was "written from a point of view of an astronaut who does have quite a few problems. But even _that_ is okay, as it is what it is".</p>
<p>The composer furthered this upcoming change to the original game "wasn't completely out of scratch (heh), as a section of the song was originally in a level in OG AW, but that level was cut out long before release".</p>
<p>This Alan Wake update will be going ahead this coming Tuesday, 10th September, across Steam, Epic Games Store and GOG. Can you hear me, Major Tom? Well, original Alan Wake players won't be able to from then.</p> <div>

<p>Having initially released in 2010 on Xbox 360, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-remastered-will-see-the-xbox-360-classic-finally-debut-on-playstation">Alan Wake got the remaster treatment</a> in 2021. This remaster <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-remastered-ditching-originals-product-placement">ditched the original game's hefty product placement</a>. A sequel, aptly named Alan Wake 2, was then released last year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-design-teased-by-sony-in-30th-anniversary-post-announcement-is-inbound-and-launch-is-set-for-november/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned leaker billbill-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-render-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the first look at the PS5 Pro earlier this week, and Sony has now basically confirmed the design as part of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/05/celebrating-30-years-of-playstation-my-first-gt-digital-soundtracks-shapes-of-play-collection-and-theres-more-to-come/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation's 30th anniversary blog post</a>. In the celebratory image, Sony sneakily added a mockup that seems very much in line with the leaked one.</p>

<p>While reporting the story, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236967/sony-ps5-pro-design-leak-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that developers have been told all games launched on or after September 16 will have to support the PlayStation 5 Pro, hinting at an inbound announcement. Insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-image-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that the current plan is to launch the mid-generation console refresh in November, thus mimicking perfectly the September announcement and November release seen during the last generation for the PlayStation 4 Pro, as we had surmised when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> developers talking freely about it at Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p>Next week is probably the right week for the PS5 Pro announcement, then, and the excitement may not end there for PlayStation fans. Another rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-announced-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hints</a> that Sony is also preparing a new State of Play broadcast to show off first-party games on the week of November 19-20.</p>
<p>Let's recap what we know about the PS5 Pro so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>45% performance improvement in rasterized rendering thanks to a larger GPU and faster memory</li>
<li>Hugely improved ray tracing architecture delivering 2-3x speedup on average, with peaks of 4x</li>
<li>Custom machine learning architecture that supports 300 TOPS at 8-bit to power the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscaling technique, Sony's version of Multi Frame Super Resolution based on the PlayStation Machine Learning (PSML) algorithm.</li>
<li>PSSR is an ML-enhanced version of Temporal Anti-Aliasing Upscaling (TAAU) that requires inputs similar to NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR and fully supports High Dynamic Range (HDR) pipelines. It also does not require per-game training like the latest version of DLSS.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's no info on the pricing yet, but we'll let you know as soon as there is a credible rumor on the topic.</p>

            <p>About 12 years ago, we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-survivors-jasper-byrnes-new-game-canned">drew our breath in pain to report</a> that Lone Survivor developer Jasper Byrne's new "Zelda x Demon's Souls" action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> was no more. "It was too big for a single person to make," Byrne wrote at the time. "This is the root of the problem. It wasn't that I fell out of love with the idea, just that I can't physically do it." That was then and this, thankfully, is now. Byrne has tentatively returned to the project and begun sharing screens on social media.</p><!--more-->
<p>If you never played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lone-survivor">Lone Survivor</a>, it's an excellent side-scrolling survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> that mixes together ideas from Silent Hill into something wholly its own. "The strongest praise I can supply is that this is a game clearly made by a man who understands why people still hope for a return to the glory of Silent Hill 2," Adam Smith (rest in BG3) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-lone-survivor">wrote in 2012</a>. "It's a game made by someone who appreciates that the best way to get under someone's skin is to make them think about that skin, not just the way that it peels off when a knife is applied, but the way that if feels to touch, the way that it covers our skulls and helps us to express ourselves, and the way that it wrinkles and ages." I will only add that the soundtrack <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFiBkP3krjs">bangs</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure when, exactly, Byrne decided to revive his action-RPG project - he's been <a href="https://x.com/PRDXCL">posting WIP screens for years</a>, perhaps more for the pleasure of sharing than as an indicator of progress - but in <a href="https://x.com/jasperbyrne/status/1830588551526027732">one of this week's surprise Xitter updates</a>, he says he rewrote the whole thing to run in Unity at some stage. He also took an extended break from development when Covid hit. "[It] feels so fresh after a nearly 5 year hiatus," reads <a href="https://x.com/jasperbyrne/status/1830579798260781226">another TwiXter post</a>. "i never fell out of love with it but when covid started i got too much anxiety about it and made the call to hit pause. i only recently felt brave enough to try, so i'm seeing how it feels to work on again. let's see what happens".</p>
<p>Here's a shot of the project from 2013, back when it ran on the Blitzmax engine.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Blitzmax-engine-2013.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>And here's one of the screens Byrne has shared this week. I really like the fog and how the choice of perspective works with the terrain textures.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/3_wGJAMxv.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Jasper Byrne</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/jasperbyrne/status/1830579798260781226">a further update</a>, Byrne says that he's "written down the 8 milestones needed to get this thing out the door. nothing but the bare minimum, because 12 years is plenty enough already". Fingers crossed it's relatively smooth sailing from here. If you'd like to give him a hand, and you've yet to play Lone Survivor, you can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1907440/Super_Lone_Survivor/">a remastered version on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
