			<p>Yesterday, SEGA and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced that Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. is coming to all the main consoles (PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2) following <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-available-on-steam-new-launch-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its debut on PC on January 28</a>.</p>
<p>The news was shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivwjAPp-w6Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during Virtua Fighter Direct 2025 Spring</a> by legacy Virtua Fighter project producer Seiji Aoki, who stated:</p>
<p><em>I know we’ve kept you waiting, but our Steam release Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. is finally coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2. Since Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O.'s launch, we’ve heard your requests for multiplatform support via the official Virtua Fighter Discord and other channels. We on the development team want to give users on all platforms the opportunity to enjoy Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O., so we are happy to bring you this announcement.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Also, in bringing this title to multiple platforms, we’re planning to include cross-play support. And to make your cross-play experience even smoother, the rollback functionality used in the Steam version will be supported on all platforms. We’re going to include even more content to make this much more than a simple port, which we’ll tell you about in future updates.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. - Multiplatform Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4EEo8qyubs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>During the dedicated live stream, the developers also provided an update on the New Virtua Fighter Project. Wolf Hawkfield, a returning character, will be featured in the upcoming new franchise installment. As part of the announcement, it was also explained that each character's motivations behind their decision to join the fighting tournament would be made much clearer to players this time around. Producer Riichiro Yamada said:</p>
<p><em>In previous Virtua Fighter games, the backstories and motivations of the characters weren't well known. This is one of the major differences between the previous games and our new game. Playing the new game will give you a much better sense of who the characters are, including their backstories and personalities.</em></p>
<p><em>This includes characters from the previous games, too. Legacy characters have been refined for the modern age but remain authentic at their core. </em><em>Wolf's motivation this time is his love for wrestling. What's happened to Wolf since the last game? Why does he fight?</em></p>

<p>The new Project does not currently have a release window, but we'll keep you updated on any rumors and news about it.</p>

We see Hanrahan, whom we briefly saw Isaac (Jeffrey Wright) meeting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-episode-4-dina-ellie-isaac-seraphite-1851779062&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-episode-4-dina-ellie-isaac-seraphite-1851779062">in the opening flashback last week</a></span>, walking through one of the group’s bases with dozens of troops looking at her with concern. Whatever she’s there to do must be important because the tension is palpable. She enters a room where a lone woman named Sergeant Park sits at a table with a cigarette in her hand. Hanrahan tells her that her soldiers are clearly very loyal to her, but Park thinks their worry might be misplaced, since if she were getting executed, she imagines Isaac would have come to pull the trigger himself. Hanrahan says Isaac is off dealing with more important matters, like fighting the Seraphite forces elsewhere in Seattle. This woman apparently killed several W.L.F. soldiers; however. So, despite her confidence based on Isaac’s absence, the jury’s still out on whether she’ll be executed.</p><p>Park, we learn, was in charge of securing a hospital, and when her squad cleared the ground floor of infected, they headed to the basement where the original cordyceps patients were supposedly brought back when the outbreak began over 20 years prior. However, aside from the fungus that had grown onto the walls as it does anywhere the infected proliferate, they found no sign of infected. But as the squads investigated the basement floors, they started to exhibit respiratory symptoms along with the early signs of infection. There’s only one possibility: The infection is in the air. The squads above the basement floors hadn’t gotten sick, so they sealed the basements shut with their less fortunate comrades inside and fell back to the base. After Park recounts her tragic tale, Hanrahan says that as far as the W.L.F. is concerned, her actions were heroic and ensured the longevity of the group’s operations. She’s exonerated and left to mourn her squad, her son included.</p><p>When season one aired, <em>The Last of Us </em>showrunner Craig Mazin <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-lore-changes-tendrils-mycology-tess-1850019712&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-lore-changes-tendrils-mycology-tess-1850019712">made a big hoopla</a></span> of changing how the cordyceps infection spreads. In the games, it’s an airborne illness, spread via spores that hang visibly in the air in environments where the fungus grows, but the show did away with this. Mazin admits that was done in part so that Pedro Pascal’s face wouldn’t be obscured by a gas mask every other episode. But now that we’re coming up on a scene that relies on the use of the original airborne virus, this seems like the show’s way of weaving it back into the world. Right now, only the W.L.F. seems to know about this, and it seems to only really be a danger in long-incubated spaces like the hospital basement Park’s squad was inspecting, so I doubt we’ll see Ellie and Dina putting gas masks on anytime soon.</p><h2 id="h765832"><a id=""></a><strong>The boys are back in town</strong></h2><p>Back at the theater, Dina is still on radio duty, listening to the W.L.F. chatter and marking up a map of the city. Ellie has managed to get the power running in the old building, but still wants to help Dina with whatever she can. Dina gives Ellie light shit for not being “school oriented” as she triangulates the probable location of their targets based on what she hears on the radio. When it becomes clear that Ellie’s out of her depth, she leaves Dina to figure it out. As she leaves, Dina calls out to her and just silently smiles at her when she turns around. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNvdcu9Uh88&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNvdcu9Uh88" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“I just wanted to take another look at you.”</a></span></p><p>Ellie explores the theater a bit more and finds the remains of a musical outfit that was performing on the stage some time before the outbreak. The show does a good job of pulling from the games’ soundtracks at exactly the right moments, like here, when it uses the gorgeous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk5m1iMWJnM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk5m1iMWJnM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Vanishing Grace”</a></span> from the first game, which was most notably used when Joel and Ellie got a brief break from all the horrors to pet some giraffes in Salt Lake City. It gives this moment where Ellie looks at the empty theater a sense of cozy, nostalgic safety after the terrors of running away from infected and a crazed militia.</p><p>She finally stops when she finds a line of guitars just waiting to be played. She picks up an acoustic one and sits on a stool on the stage to start playing. The guitar is miraculously somewhat in tune, so she only has to turn a few knobs to get it where she needs it to be. Then, she finally starts picking away at the strings and plays a few measures of “Future Days” by Pearl Jam before putting the guitar down in a huff.</p><p>Any <em>Last of Us </em>game fan knows this song immediately, but this is the first time we’ve heard it performed on the show, even if it’s only for a few moments. The funny thing about the use of this Pearl Jam deep cut in the show is that there is no plausible reason for it to exist in the show’s timeline. For some reason, HBO’s series begins in 2003, rather than in 2013 as the games do. “Future Days” is from the grunge band’s 2013 album <em>Lightning Bolt</em>, which wasn’t even out by the time the outbreak began in the game’s timeline on September 26. Naughty Dog explained this by pointing out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-why-the-last-of-us-2-could-feature-that-pear/1100-6479066/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-why-the-last-of-us-2-could-feature-that-pear/1100-6479066/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the song had been performed live</a></span> and posted to YouTube months before the album was released, but that explanation doesn’t work for the show, since neither the song nor the video platform existed in 2003. Will the show have its own explanation for why a song that shouldn’t exist does? Or is it just too important to the story of <em>The Last of Us</em> to leave out, even if it makes no sense?</p><p>Dina has mapped out a way for Ellie to reach the hospital where Nora is stationed, but her plan does require them to go through a building that the W.L.F. seemingly avoids. The only reason they can think of is that it’s likely overrun with infected. How does she know this? The W.L.F. never shut up on the radio. Ellie points out this is stupid, considering they’re just giving away their positions to their enemies, but based on the fact that the “scars” they’re facing use archaic weaponry and seem to be some kind of religious cult, Dina hypothesizes that they may not use technology, and she wonders if they’re like the Amish. (Sidenote: Dina, you know who the Amish were, but not what a Pride Flag is? What are they teaching about the old world in these post-apocalypse schools?)</p><figure id="" data-id="cc23a78bc85c5ac0a69d2fec9c473e1e" data-recommend-id="image://cc23a78bc85c5ac0a69d2fec9c473e1e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dina looks at something off-screen while Ellie approaches her from behind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dina looks at something off-screen while Ellie approaches her from behind." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc23a78bc85c5ac0a69d2fec9c473e1e" data-recommend-id="image://cc23a78bc85c5ac0a69d2fec9c473e1e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dina looks at something off-screen while Ellie approaches her from behind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The two head out and kill some time talking about baby names for the bun in the oven. Dina jokes that if it’s a girl, she’ll name the baby “Ellie,” and if it’s a boy, “Elijah.” Before she can offer a more serious option, the two stumble upon the bodies of a group of massacred Seraphites, which makes Dina sick to her stomach. Ellie tries to get her to turn back for her and the baby’s safety, but Dina presses on, offering her own reason for why she intends to see this through with Ellie. She brings up how Ellie never asked about the first person she killed after she’d asked Ellie about hers on the way into the city, and she proceeds to tell the story now. Dina recounts how, when she was eight years old, she lived in a cabin north of Santa Fe and would get bored because she wasn’t allowed to go outside to play. Despite her homophobic mother’s protests, Dina went out one day to explore, but brought a gun with her for protection. But, as it turned out, she wasn’t the one who needed it; her mother and sister did back home.</p><p>A raider entered the cabin while Dina was gone and killed her family, and was still there when she ran back upon hearing the screams. Ellie didn’t kill her first human until she was a teenager, but Dina was half that age when she shot the raider for what he’d done to her family. Ellie apologizes for not asking before, but as she inquires about how she made it to Jackson, Dina says it doesn’t matter because it’s the past. What matters is right now. Joel didn’t deserve what happened to him any more than her mother and sister did, she says, and if the person who killed her family had gotten away, she would have hunted him down, too.</p><p><em>The Last of Us </em>has probably embellished Dina’s story more than any other this season, and with each passing episode, I’m more curious where her journey ends because it’s so starkly different from the source material. In <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, Dina is devoted to Ellie’s cause because she’s being supportive of her girlfriend, whereas the show has gone out of its way to give her more personal stakes than before, and at times, she seems almost as consumed by the need for vengeance as Ellie. Maybe she still ends up in the same place as she does in <em>Part II</em>, but the more the show changes her, the more I wonder. The show’s given me zero reason to have any confidence in its vision of this story, but I guess I’ll take cautious intrigue over being bored and annoyed the whole time.</p><p>Ellie decides to let Dina stay with her, and they finally reach this mystery building the W.L.F. refuses to enter. Inside is an office that seems empty at first glance, but the militia is still keeping an eye on it with a searchlight. At least, they’re looking at the perimeter around it. Dina notes that they haven’t positioned searchlights to see inside the building itself, which means the girls should be able to move freely throughout without worrying about the wolves. She offers to scout out the next room before Ellie says she should be the one taking point, since she can’t get infected. Now that the facade is over, the team can be a little more tactical. Ellie doesn’t see any infected, and Dina surmises that there are probably, at most, a few strays somewhere in the building rather than a full-blown horde. The two get into a little lovers’ spat when Dina accuses Ellie of being a loose cannon with her firearms, but says that her “crazy” side is exciting and one of the reasons she loves her. When she says the L-word (Lesbians), Ellie is a little starstruck and nearly says it back before Dina interrupts and says, “Oh, I know.”</p><p>I am glad to see some of this confidence Dina exudes redirected at Ellie now that the relationship is official. But damn, these girls are slamming their feet on the gas like the most stereotypical U-haul lesbians. I keep getting pulled back and forth between how much I enjoy Merced’s performance and how the pacing of this relationship has been thrown all out of whack by Mazin’s timeline. Yeah, Dina has pretty much always loved Ellie, so dropping this less than 24 hours after they confessed their feelings and decided to raise a child together isn’t entirely out of the question. But damn, it sure feels like this relationship is being fast-tracked without taking a breath to accommodate the TV show format.</p><p>The two move through the building and it’s unnervingly quiet, until they reach a boiler room and find the mangled remains of a wolf caught by an infected. Not just any infected, though; it’s another stalker.</p><p>But it’s just one of them, right? If they coordinate, they can probably take it out, no problem. But unfortunately it’s not going to be that simple, because an entire pack of stalkers starts to circle the two. Dina starts to panic, and Ellie tells her to take shelter in a gated area while she lures them away. Dina’s not about this plan, but Ellie reminds her that she can get bitten as many times as she has to without getting infected. There’s no other choice right now. She sends Dina off with a kiss, and the girls get to work. Dina reaches the gated area and is able to seal herself inside, but the stalkers immediately start to tear through the rusted metal. Meanwhile, Ellie is quickly overpowered by them, and for just a moment it seems like this might be the end for our girls. Just then, however, gunfire starts ringing through the room. The infected collapse one by one as the mystery gunman takes them out with a trained and precise hand. As he reaches out to Ellie to help her off the ground, we see it’s Jesse, who has finally reached the city after leaving Jackson shortly after the girls.</p><p>He asks if Ellie got bitten in the scrap, and seems a little unconvinced when she insists she wasn’t. But they don’t have time for a full body check, they gotta get moving before more infected show up. The trio books it out of the building and narrowly escapes a wolf squad by running into a park that the soldiers won’t enter. They assume that means the infected are lurking, so they’re still on guard. Ellie immediately starts bombarding Jesse with questions about how he found them, and he says he tracked them to the theater and found the map Dina had been marking up. Finally, after Ellie asks one too many questions, Jesse snaps and asks, “Do I look like I want to fucking talk to you right now?”</p><p>Okay, mean ass. It feels like Jesse is taking on the role of “unlikeable hero” in the show now that HBO has siphoned all of Ellie’s irritability out of her to make her a loving mother-to-be. <em>The Last Of Us</em> (Craig Mazin’s Version) and all its creative liberties have felt fundamentally at odds with the story of self-destructive revenge that it’s based on in a seeming effort to make it more palatable, and one of the many casualties of this approach is that the golden retriever of the group has now become an angsty rottweiler so Ellie doesn’t have to be one. I sometimes worry too much of my criticism of this show reads like a jilted game fan mad that the show isn’t following the original script to the letter, but nearly every change the show makes is either undermining the actual point of the story, or is replacing the dynamics the characters once had with new ones that are not as interesting. The Bill and Frank episode in season one, a notable exception, is still one of the most drastic shifts away from the source material that the show has done, but it lifted up the larger themes of the story. This season, it seems like every effort is being made to ensure Ellie is still the hero of her own story, even if that means making the people who were originally there to ground her read more like scolding family members.</p><figure id="" data-id="0df64fa6d398858ed91bc6165ba97405" data-recommend-id="image://0df64fa6d398858ed91bc6165ba97405" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A group of Seraphites walk through a forest with lit torches." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A group of Seraphites walk through a forest with lit torches." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0df64fa6d398858ed91bc6165ba97405" data-recommend-id="image://0df64fa6d398858ed91bc6165ba97405" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A group of Seraphites walk through a forest with lit torches." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jesse reveals that he and Tommy both left Jackson the day after Ellie and Dina snuck out, but they’re not here to help with the girls’ crusade; they’re just here to collect them and get them back to Wyoming. Ellie protests, but their argument is interrupted by the shrill whistles of the Seraphites. A group of cultists gathers in the middle of the park with a W.L.F. prisoner, who begs for his life as they tie a noose around his neck. The Scar leader says they have no interest in any secrets he can offer about Isaac’s plan, and then disembowels him with a scythe. The Jackson trio watches in horror before one of the cultists sees them and fires an arrow into Dina’s leg. Ellie tells Jesse to carry her out of there and back to the theater while she diverts their attention. The darkness of the night works to her advantage, and she’s able to disappear into the woods as Jesse and Dina escape. But even as the Scars give up on the chase, Ellie’s not retreating to the theater where her injured girlfriend waits for her just yet.</p><h2 id="h765833"><a id=""></a><strong>“...I’d surely lose myself”</strong></h2><p>Instead, Ellie heads for her original target: Nora. After evading the guards positioned outside the hospital, Ellie sneaks into the building through a hole in the wall too small for the average person to crawl through. Even as the W.L.F. guard dogs bark at the opening, their human owners hold them back, assuming some kind of animal must have set them off. They’re not entirely wrong, I suppose.</p><p>We then see Nora working in the hospital’s sick bay and caring for the injured. As she leaves to put away some supplies, she’s greeted by none other than the girl she thought she’d left behind in Jackson. Ellie tells her to put her hands up and turn around to face her. She asks if Nora remembers her. She doesn’t answer, but her expression reveals she certainly does. Nora asks what Ellie wants, and she asks where Abby is. Nora claims she doesn’t know, but Ellie doesn’t believe her. If Ellie shoots Nora, her quarry points out, the gunfire will have every wolf in the building scrambling to her location. “You’ll still be dead,” Ellie replies.</p><p>Nora tries to appeal to Ellie’s sense of mercy, pointing out that they could have killed her in Jackson, but they only came to Wyoming with one target in mind. Ellie says that was a mistake, and once again asks where Abby is. For a moment, it seems like Nora is about to confide in Ellie that she regrets what happened to Joel. She says she still hears the screams he let out as Abby tortured him at night, and she’s sorry that Ellie had to see it happen. But then, just as Ellie slightly lets her guard down, Nora’s tune changes: “Yeah, that little bitch got what he deserved.” Ellie is stunned just long enough for Nora to throw a bucket of water and supplies at her and give herself a window to run. Then Ellie gives chase. As Nora runs through the hospital she screams for her fellow soldiers to fire at the intruder, but then she reaches a dead end with her only way out a sealed elevator leading to the basement floors. You know, the ones where the infection is in the air. This scene is probably why the show had to bring spores into the fold. Short of a complete rewrite, the clash between Ellie and Nora requires the cordyceps infection to be an airborne illness to work. The difference this time around is that there’s a dramatic irony as Nora heads into the basement floors to escape Ellie’s wrath, only for us as viewers to know that a different danger entirely awaits.</p><figure id="" data-id="e6c8afefed11782715c68975f5e5d9db" data-recommend-id="image://e6c8afefed11782715c68975f5e5d9db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nora raises her hands and looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nora raises her hands and looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e6c8afefed11782715c68975f5e5d9db" data-recommend-id="image://e6c8afefed11782715c68975f5e5d9db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nora raises her hands and looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ellie gives chase and finds the overgrown fungus covering the walls. A few still-breathing infected are trapped within the structure, breathing out bits of infection with each wheezing gasp. Hearing the labored breathing of someone else in the next hallway over, she turns on the oppressive red emergency lighting in the electrical room, only to find Nora leaning against a wall, choking on the spores in her lungs. She hacks up a curse in Ellie’s direction and says that she’s “killed [them] both” by driving them to this sealed basement. But when she realizes Ellie isn’t struggling to breathe, she realizes the reports of an immune girl in Salt Lake City were real. Ellie confirms that she is, in fact, that girl, and asks, once again, where Abby is.</p><p>Nora tries to appeal to Ellie’s humanity, telling her about all the people Joel killed, including Abby’s father and with him, any hope the world had of being rid of this infection. Then, to her surprise, Ellie says that she already knows and again asks where Abby is. Nora collapses on the ground and stays silent. Then Ellie looks around and, finding a pipe, holds it over Nora and asks her question one more time. Nora flatly says “no,” and Ellie starts to let loose, bringing the pipe down on Nora’s legs, repeatedly asking where Abby is until the screen cuts to black.</p><p>Okay. There’s a lot to unpack here. This is arguably one of the most controversial scenes in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and for good reason. But before we get into the uncomfortable optics, I do have to point out that part of what made this section effective in the game was that this originally served as the big reveal that Abby and company were once Fireflies, but the show instead told us that right off the bat. The game used this scene as a one-two punch to reveal both that truth bomb <em>and </em>the fact that Ellie was already well aware of what Joel had done by the time Abby had made her way to Jackson. So much of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s excellent narrative tension comes from its calculated silence. The game tells you almost nothing about what Ellie is feeling, outside of her journal entries which conveniently write around the specifics of what she already knows. This exchange between Ellie and Nora is a moment of realization for both of them, as Nora realizes that Ellie is the immune girl Joel killed dozens of people to save, and Ellie discovers that this entire crusade against her surrogate father was carried out by people who suffered for her survival. All of these things could have been inferred by the player, but the game hadn’t said them outright by this point, and the sparse script and unnerving performances by game actors Ashley Johnson and Chelsea Tavares really sell the weight of that moment before any blood has been shed.</p><p>Looking back at the original scene and how its dialogue elegantly reveals so much without having to beat you over the head with the most literal expository writing makes the show look like an amateurish rewrite by someone who thought that scene was a little too subtle. Plus, Ellie already told Jesse, and by extension, the audience, that she and Joel were getting past whatever conflict they had in his final days, so the reveal that she already knew about the Salt Lake City massacre isn’t really a surprise this time around. But that’s not really new for the show, as I’ve pointed out several times over the course of the season. Every time we get to what was a huge “oh shit” moment in the game, it feels like the show just goes through the motions of recounting it while cushioning uncomfortable moments like Joel’s death with quippy dialogue, or Nora’s interrogation with overexposition.</p><p>In the end, neither of those reveals change anything. Ellie is still dead set on killing Abby, even if she has to torture her friend to do it. Which means it’s time to get into one of the more questionable moments in the entire <em>Last of Us </em>franchise. In <em>Part II</em>, Nora’s death was notable for a few reasons. On top of it being the first kill that really solidified Ellie’s revenge tour demanded more of her than she bargained for, it is framed much differently from any other in the game. Prior to this, Ellie had killed Abby’s hotheaded friend Jordan who wasn’t included in the show (Manny seems to have been made into a composite of himself and Jordan for the series), and that fight is a bit more cathartic because that dude was a shithead who taunted Ellie and didn’t spend his final moments begging for his life. Nora, meanwhile, is tortured for information, and the interrogation leaves Ellie absolutely shattered at what she had done. This is all in-line with the story <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> tells, in which Ellie goes down this violent path but is unable to stomach the reality. However, the difference is that when the player kills Nora, the woman herself isn’t even given the dignity of an on-screen death. The camera lingers on Ellie as the player is forced to press a button to strike her off-screen. It’s supposed to be a transformative moment in which the player is forced to look upon Ellie in her darkest hour and understand what this crusade is doing to her. But when you have a white woman beating the lone named Black woman in the game for information and you can’t so much as show her as it’s happening, it is the most damning example of a trend of <em>The Last of Us </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://uppercutcrit.com/the-world-of-the-last-of-us-leaves-black-trauma-behind/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://uppercutcrit.com/the-world-of-the-last-of-us-leaves-black-trauma-behind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subjecting Black characters to the worst fates</a></span> it can imagine in its post-apocalyptic world.</p><p>HBO’s take on the series has only slightly mitigated this by casting more actors of color, including Rutina Wesley as Jackson’s leader, Maria. But even so, Nora’s death still has an optics problem that the show can’t shake. If there had ever been a time for the show to reconsider the source material and make thoughtful, intentional changes, this was probably it. But here we are, watching Ellie torture Nora for information on Abby’s whereabouts. If nothing else, it’s still just as effective at communicating Ellie’s fall from grace.</p><p>We end this episode with something a little more pleasant: a flashback. The sun shines through the window in Ellie’s old room in Joel’s Jackson house. She stirs awake as Joel enters the room with his signature “Hey, kiddo.” Ellie says “hi” as the credits roll. Rejoice, Pedro fans. Daddy’s back next week.</p><hr><p>New episodes of <em>The Last of Us </em>air on Sundays at 9 p.m. Eastern on Max.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Amazon's hit Fallout show will run for five or six seasons.</p>
<p>That's according to actor Aaron Moten, who revealed in an interview at Comic Con Liverpool that when he signed on for the role of Maximus, he was told to expect the show to run for "five, six" seasons in total.</p>

<p>"When I signed on to do the series, we would have a starting point, and they gave me the end point," Moten explained (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-tv-show-six-five-seasons-of-story-planned/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>"That endpoint hasn't changed, but it is season five, season six, type of endpoint. We've always known that we're going to take our time with the development of the characters."</p>
<p>Given Fallout's rich lore across several games, this may not be a complete surprise, but it's good news nonetheless, as it assures Fallout fans that the show was created with longevity in mind.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wolf-hawkfield-revealed-for-new-virtua-fighter-project-and-a-new-focus-on-storytelling.1186458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/11/wolf-hawkfield-revealed-for-new-virtua-fighter-project-and-a-new-focus-on-storytelling/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/virtua-fighter">New Virtua Fighter Project</a> still deep in development, the team at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio shared a new glimpse of what they’ve been working on, and revealed a returning character.</p>
<p>Wolf Hawkfield is back, and he’s sporting a whole new look, which Art Director&nbsp;Ryo Shibasaki digs into.</p>
<p><iframe title="ART DIRECTING VIRTUA FIGHTER | English Subtitles" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_5IqA9CuD9Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s not much more news about the next Virtua Fighter, but Producer Riichiro Yamad talked more about how this game will delve much deeper into the characters and their backstories, including returning legends from previous entries. It won’t be origin stories, necessarily, but will reveal some of the motivations that they have for fighting, what happened to them between games, and tie in with the character designs in general. This is all something that Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio wanted to bring into the series,</p>
<p>Art Director Ryo Shibasaki also spoke about how Hawk’s design is that of a wrestler who still performs, evolving his look to be cool and with a “heel” atmosphere to him. He definitely looks the part, with the ammo belt belt, the heavy tattooing, and the older looking face and skin that really gives that ageing wrestling star vibe.</p>

<p>Prior to this, the last we saw of the game was Akira and Sarah Bryant going fighting, and with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/new-virtua-fighter-project-pre-development-concept-video/">a pre-production video in January</a>, a pair of Akira battling.</p>
<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has become a lynchpin studio for Sega over the last few years. You’ll know them best as the studio behind the hugely popular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-latest-trailer-reveal-naval-combat/">Yakuza/Like A Dragon</a> series, but as broad as that series has become, they’ve also handled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review/">recent Super Monkey Ball games</a> as well. Given that Yakuza’s own combat was a hand-me-down from Shenmue, which was in turn fed a branch off from Virtua Fighter, this makes them the perfect team to take the series’ reins.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the team confirmed that, after a well-received revamp of the last game for PC, Virtua Fighter 5 REVO is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At the beginning of the month, things weren’t looking good for gaming site <em>Giant Bomb</em> after its <a href="https://kotaku.com/giant-bomb-fandom-dan-ryckert-jeff-grubb-gerstmann-1851778728">content was put on hold</a> amid reports of editorial interference from its parent company, Fandom. Today, some feel-good news: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/giantbomb.bsky.social/post/3lou2vs2v2c2t"><em>Giant Bomb</em> announced</a> it is now an independent, employee-owned entity.</p><p>“Giant Bomb lives! Fandom has sold the site to us,” the outlet wrote on Bluesky yesterday evening. In a <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/join">post on its website</a> about the new development, the <em>Giant Bomb</em> says it’s “not serving an algorithm or executives,” and that it aims “to lean into what’s always made Giant Bomb special, and that’s the people you see and hear on our content, and our extremely passionate community.”</p><p>The site also announced a <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/get-premium/">new subscription model</a>, which it says “will go directly towards maintaining and growing Giant Bomb and paying the fine folks that you see on our programming week after week.”</p><div><blockquote><p>Games media has changed dramatically since Giant Bomb launched in 2008, and our new model aims to evolve with the times. We want people to be able to see our content whether they’re able to support us monetarily or not, so the large majority of what we put out will be available for free. That’s how Fortnite works, right? The kids love Fortnite. Dan Ryckert skin coming soon!</p></blockquote></div><p><em>Giant Bomb</em> sums up its new monthly ($9.99 per month) and annual ($99.99 per year) subscriptions:</p><div><blockquote><p>If you sign up today, you’ll get ad-free RSS feeds for all of our podcasts and access to premium-only Discord channels (like behind-the-scenes, Town Hall Q&amp;As, and more). We are going to launch very simple and we will grow and adjust from there. This all finally came together literally hours ago, and we couldn’t even update the language on the sign up page yet. The perks are a little different from what’s listed there, so If you have any questions, reach out on social and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can. For example, our Discord verification process might be slow, so bear with us for now!</p></blockquote></div><p>The news feels like a pleasant combo-breaker after the May 1st one-two punch news of <em>Giant Bomb</em>’s content pause and <em>Verge</em> parent company Vox Media’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659575/polygon-vox-media-sold-valnet-gamerant">sale of gaming site <em>Polygon </em>to Valnet</a>, a media company that’s <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250425504752/en/Valnet-Inc.-and-its-CEO-File-Lawsuit-Against-The-Wrap-News-Inc.-for-Defamation-Unfair-Competition-and-Other-Illegal-Actions">suing <em>TheWrap</em></a> over its <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/">damning report</a> of accusations of “almost sweatshop-level” working conditions.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>What had been a closed beta test for Funcom's upcoming Dune Awakening is now available to everyone who has pre-ordered the game, not just those lucky enough to have bagged a code.</p>
<p>In a message posted to social media, Funcom confirmed that has "had heard [the] feedback" from fans surprised a pre-order wasn't enough to secure a beta key, and now anyone who has ordered the MMO "can now also access the beta" which is live now and due to close tomorrow, Monday 12th May.</p>

<p>"We heard your feedback on this, "the studio said. "If you already own or decide to pre-order any of the editions this weekend, you should now also see a Beta Weekend product in your Steam library.

<p>Dune: Awakening has been in closed beta for over a year now, but with its full release now looming following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-delayed-for-last-minute-changes-from-beta-testers">brief delay</a>, this final, large-scale beta blowout will run from 9th-12th May. The studio is calling it Dune: Awakening's "largest beta yet... with a huge number of new players joining compared to previous closed betas".</p>
<p>It's likely the studio acquisced after players on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1kfzht6/have_people_been_informed_that_they_are_in_the/">game's subreddit and Discord complained</a> about not getting access to the latest beta despite having pre-ordered the MMO.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/664492/clair-obscur-expedition-33-twist-spoilers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>is my favorite game of the year so far, with an exhilarating battle system, excellent exploration, and a haunting soundtrack. But I’m not the only one who loves it: the game has become a huge hit, with more than 2 million copies sold just 12 days after <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3loiolfljys25">its late April release</a>. “It feels very surreal,” says Guillaume Broche, Sandfall Interactive’s CEO and creative director.</p><p>According to Broche, the game is performing “far beyond expectations” and that the team was not expecting it to “blow up” as fast as it did. “We are still in denial, basically” he says. Lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen adds, “I’m going to wake up tomorrow and this is all a joke, right?”</p><p>A major part of <em>Expedition 33</em>’s success is its gripping story. It kept me coming back to the game every moment I could just to see what happened next. The opening hits you with a gutpunch. Playing as Gustave, voiced by <em>Daredevil</em>’s Charlie Cox, you learn about the tragic circumstances of the world, its characters, and the annual “Gommage” that makes everyone of a certain age disappear in a flurry of petals when a giant being called the Paintress paints a new, lower number on a giant monolith.</p><p>Gustave is one of the next Expeditioners that will strike out and attempt to take down the Paintress, and that team also includes Maelle, a teenager who he is responsible for. But he also loses an ex, Sophie, to the Gommage after the Paintress paints a 33.</p><p>It’s a powerful, emotional opening, and it got me interested in <em>Expedition 33</em> right away. But there was a key scene later on that shifted the game’s story from good to great for me — and I got to talk to Brocke and Svedberg-Yen all about it.</p><p><strong>Spoilers ahead. Don’t scroll past this picture unless you want to read about a major plot development.</strong></p><p>If you chose to keep scrolling, the moment I’m talking about is at the end of Act 1.</p><p>The mysterious white-haired man who massacred much of Expedition 33 earlier in the story appears after an intense boss fight. Without warning, the man stabs Gustave with a gigantic sword, and after a brief battle, stabs him again, killing him — and all right in front of Maelle, who is trapped in a dome of magical energy that renders her helpless.</p><p>When it happened in my playthrough, my jaw was on the floor. <em>Expedition 33</em> had so far portrayed Gustave as the protagonist, and I figured he had the plot armor to make it all the way to the end so that he could get closure on losing Sophie. (Heck, they cast Charlie Cox, who also plays a Marvel superhero, to voice him!) But within hours of the game’s opening, Gustave was gone.</p><p>“It’s where the story needed to go,” Svedberg-Yen says. For the narrative and themes that the team was going for, “it’s what was most organic.”</p><p>“One of the main themes of the story is very obviously grief,” Broche says. In order to make a game about grief feel true, the team wanted players to “go through the horror that the characters are going through,” he adds. “It just made sense to inflict the pain on the player as strongly as the characters receive.”</p><p>Broche says that actually playing as the character creates a deep link and attachment. “Losing that is the hole that the characters in the game experience basically every year with the Gommage, and it’s something here that just felt true to the game and the narrative.”</p><p>The scene is brilliantly crafted to make the death feel impactful. After the boss fight and before the white-haired man’s appearance, I had relaxed — I figured I would get a nice, post-fight cutscene of celebration before moving on to the next thing. But the surprise of what happened next and the powerful performances from the motion capture actors and the voice actors made the scene memorable and powerful.</p><p>I was particularly struck by the killing blow: after the white-haired man stabs Gustave, the game goes into slow motion to pause on that moment, on Maelle’s horror, and on Gustave’s armband emblazoned with “33,” which Sophie put on him shortly before she Gommaged.</p><p>To me, it felt reminiscent of Aerith’s death in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, but Broche and Svedberg-Yen say that wasn’t intentional. “If people find some similarities, it’s not actually conscious from us,” Broche says. (Svedberg-Yen said she hasn’t actually played <em>FF7</em>, so I apologized for spoiling Aerith’s death.)</p><p>Gustave’s final words are powerful, too: “For those who come after, right?” It’s a motto used by the Expeditioners to acknowledge the purpose and futility of their mission, and throughout act one, it becomes something of a catchphrase for Gustave. But in the moments before the killing blow, he seems to know what’s coming, and he says it as he gives a heartbreaking look to Maelle — who will have to grapple on her own with whatever comes after — before making his final attack. “That’s his whole character,” Broche says of the line.</p><p>The motto itself has broader meaning, too. “We really wanted to hone in on the idea that they are part of a larger tradition, that they are one expedition in a chain,” Svedberg-Yen says. “So we really wanted to figure out a way to encapsulate that.”</p><p>Like the rest of <em>Expedition 33</em>’s most impactful moments, what makes the scene work is a combination of elements — writing, performance, music, and more — that merge together to create moments I can’t stop thinking about, even when they don’t feature a dramatic and unexpected death. “When we think about the storytelling, it’s all the teams together — that whole package — that really made it come alive,” Svedberg-Yen says.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, if there’s one issue that continues to crop up, it’s performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-revisited-profound-problems-have-yet-to-be-addressed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry has run an extensive analysis on Oblivion Remastered on all console platforms</a> and found the game to have significant problems across the board. DF’s Thomas Morgan said of Virtuos’ Unreal Engine 5 overhaul:</p><blockquote>No platform is spared of issues: whether it's PS5, PS5 Pro, or either Xbox Series machine, all struggle with traversal hitches while roaming the open world. Secondly, there's major sub-60fps frame-rates, where I've also discovered that performance slowly degrades with more playing time - quite possibly down to a memory leak. And finally, software freezes are the icing on the cake, with all PlayStation and Xbox platforms crashing to the system menu on loading a save one too many times.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">How does this manifest itself in-game? According to DF, a “charged” playthrough with more continuous play time behind it performs worse than a fresh boot. Cycling through saves also introduces bugs in the charged play through, Morgan revealed. And this is particularly curious: this also leads to the camera position being too high while riding horseback. You can fix this by resetting the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The discovery of performance degrading over time as a result of a potential memory leak is of particular concern. The crashes on loading a save too many times is a significant issue, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hope of course is that Bethesda addresses these problems sooner rather than later, especially as players spend more time with the expansive fantasy role-playing game and are more likely to run into these performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a dire position for any remaster to be in and developer Virtuos needs to address the game's stability - the crashes - as a priority,” Morgan continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Digital Foundry asks some tough questions in its analysis, suggesting Oblivion Remastered was “rushed to market.” There also seems to be a discrepancy between versions, with a hotfix released for Xbox Series X so far unavailable for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a damning assessment of Oblivion on console, but what about PC? DF had already issued its analysis of the PC version, calling its performance “dire.” It’s worth checking out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-is-one-of-the-worst-performing-pc-games-weve-ever-tested" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DF’s analysis in full</a> for more.</p><div id="ranking-the-best-races-in-oblivion" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ranking the Best Races in Oblivion</h3><h3>Ranking the Best Races in Oblivion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the performance issues, Oblivion Remastered is a hit. It became the third best-selling game of 2025 in the U.S. after just one week on sale, having shadow-dropped on April 22. Oblivion Remastered trails only Monster Hunter: Wilds and Assassin’s Creed: Shadows at the top of the 2025 sales chart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology.

Right, sorry parents that proudly put their kids' borderline impressionist drawings on the fridge, there's a new bare minimum you have to meet. If you're not turning your child's drawings into full on video games, then I'm sorry to say you're not doing a good enough job. This doesn't apply to Artur Latkovsky, though, who is quite literally doing that with his game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/odd-dorable">Odd Dorable</a> (I'm sure I don't need to explain the name to you), a game where every single bit of art in the game was made by his four-year-old daughter.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, here's the thing: the art is very obviously something drawn by a four-year-old. You're not going to boot Odd Dorable up and think "wow, she's only four and she drew this?" It so clearly was! And yet, it is immediately, infinitely charming because it is raw, unfiltered art made by someone that doesn't have any preconceived notions of, well, presumably just about most things.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1kee9op/i_am_working_on_a_game_made_from_my_daughters/">I am working on a game made from my daughter’s drawings</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/acem13/">u/acem13</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/">indiegames</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

Latkovsky describes it as an "open-world exploration, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game" where you have to help a princess find all her lost candies. I can't quite tell you what those puzzles will be like, details are pretty light, but given the involvement of a literal child in the developmental process, I'm going to assume they're not going to be all that complicated. 
</p>
<p>
The real hook here is the improvisational nature of it all. Latkovsky explained in a Reddit post that he even tries to get art drawn by his daughter on concrete into the game. Another example is that his daughter drew a dinosaur with fairy wings who is guarding a space rocket, so of course that gets added in. I mean, isn't this every child's dream? To tell someone all of the ridiculous ideas you have and they make them real? Good stuff, even if the kid is technically being paid in candies according to Latkovsky.
</p>
<p>
It'll also be quite a short game, capping out at around an hour, purposefully designed to be "digestible", so don't expect too much from it when it apparently arrives in September this year. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690890/Odd_Dorable/">here</a> if you're as charmed as I am.

Horror asymmetric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> is celebrating its ninth anniversary later this year, an amount of time so large it really makes you think "man, most live service devs should have had the foresight to make their game a decade ago, huh?" With that anniversary approaching imminently, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/behaviour-interactive">Behaviour Interactive</a> held a year nine anniversary broadcast where there was one reveal that'll have you going "yeah that makes sense" and another where you'll say "ok, sure."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The first one is that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> villain Springtrap is coming to the game as a new killer, an addition that feels so obvious I'm not sure why it's taken this long. It seems like they're taking some cues from the movie for this one, as Matthew Lillard is actually reprising his role as the character from the film adaptation. Details like Springtrap's moveset and a release date are being withheld for an incoming livestream, but there's a legendary outfit planned alongside the Yellow Rabbit version from the film. Oh, and of course there'll be a map based on the Freddy Fazbear's restaurant too.

<p>
Here's the weird one: it's another collaboration, this time with The Witcher of all series. No, you won't be running around as Geralt or anything, it's coming in the form of a few costumes. Survivor Vittorio Toscano is getting an outfit based on Geralt's, with other outfits planned based on characters like Yennefer, Ciri, Triss, and Eredin. This one's just a bit odd! The Witcher games aren't horror, so it just feels a bit like suits swinging around properties they own just because they can.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that, a few other updates are planned throughout the rest of the year, with June seeing a rework of The Archives and adjusted gamma settings, alongside other updates further down the line allowing for more spectators in custom matches, rebalancing for map and key items, and a few other bits and pieces.
</p>
<p>
There's also a new chapter coming in 2026 where you (yes, even you) will be able to take part in a choose-your-own-adventure style activity to vote on different aspects of a new killer and survivor. TLDR: Lots on the way!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-the-board-game-buying-guide<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-monster-hunter-games">Monster Hunter franchise</a> is a phenomenon, accumulating critical and commercial acclaim and spanning dozens of main titles and spinoffs. The secret to its success is an addictive gameplay loop, where you battle huge and terrifying monsters to gain loot that, in turn, lets you acquire better gear and hunt bigger, badder beasties. It’s an easy loop to replicate on the tabletop and that’s exactly what Monster Hunter World: The Board Game does. Just like its parent franchise, however, it comes in a variety of flavors, so here’s what you need to find your feet in this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">video game board game</a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not one for blurbs, you can scroll through all the items in this article right here. However, if you'd like to know more about what's available and what comes in each box, read on for the goods.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Core Boxes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the core boxes is a standalone game, containing four hunters and four monsters for them to hunt. However, they can also be combined, allowing you to mix and match characters and their prey from different sets. The majority of the components in each box are specific to the hunters and monsters unique to that set, but there is some overlap, and each set contains a few extra cards that are only used if you’re combining with its opposite number. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As such, you’re probably best off with a single core box to start with and, if you get into the game, you can start by adding some of the smaller expansions, listed below, doubling up on a second core set in the event that you develop a passion for the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s not really any difference between the core sets in terms of quality. Both feature the same ruleset, the same compulsive loop and the same stratospheric levels of production quality, with gigantic monster miniatures that tower above the hunters for an awesome sense of scale. But the look and feel of each is quite different, so you’re best off just going whichever one appeals most aesthetically, or ties in with fond memories from the video game series.</p><p id="ancient-forest-core-box"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Ancient Forest - Core Box">Monster Hunter World: The Board Game - Ancient Forest</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220571"><div id="220571" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World: The Board Game: Ancient Forest</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might expect from the title, the setting for this collection is a primeval forest. The game boards are a lush green and brown and the monsters are clearly inspired by dinosaurs and tropical animals. There’s the lizard-like Great Jagras, the furred and scaled Tobi-Kadachi, the fearsome tyrannosaur Anjanath and the huge dragon Rathalos. Setting out to take them down are the classically-armed hunters Great Sword, Sword and Shield, Dual Blades, and Bow.  </p></div><p id="wildspire-waste-core-box"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Wildspire Waste - Core Box">Monster Hunter World: The Board Game - Wildspire Waste</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220572"><div id="220572" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World: The Board Game - Wildspire Waste</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wildspire Waste is a little more esoterically-named but the monsters and boards make clear that it’s a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-world/Wildspire_Waste">badlands-type setting</a>, with a mixture of rocky outcrops, desert and swamp. The included creatures are the heavily-armored Barroth, monstrous swamp-fish Jyurados, the bird-like Pukei-Pukei, and underground behemoth Diablos which bears more than a passing resemblance to its demonic namesake. The hunters in this set are a little more bizarre, wielding Charge Blade, Switch Axe, Heavy Bowgun and Insect Glaive respectively.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Retail Expansions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As is often the case with Kickstarter-driven games, there were a slew of expansions available to pre-order at the same time. Most of these are still available at retail, however Nergigante is very hard to find and Teostra is  exclusive to the publisher, Steamforged games – both of them are currently available directly from their website.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nergigante, Kushala Daora and Teostra are all Elder Dragons, a new type of monster for you to hunt. They come with additional quest content for the base game, but perhaps most appealing of all they offer an extra, five-star difficulty level that’s a grade above any of the base game monsters, and the included miniature is a whole level bigger than any of their core box counterparts, too. That gives you an extra, mega-boss challenge to overcome and extends your campaign. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While getting to fight an ultimate boss in a longer campaign might sound like the ideal way to extend your base game content, all these expansions are expensive, and many have features that only work with one core box or the other. For example, Daora has one special crafting weapon that fits a hunter from the Ancient Forest, and another for a hunter from the Wildspire Wastes. As such, picking up the second core set might well be your best first stop if you want additional content for your game.</p></div><p id="hunters-arsenal-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Hunter's Arsenal - Expansion">Monster Hunter World The Board Game: Hunter's Arsenal Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220573"><div id="220573" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World The Board Game: Hunter's Arsenal Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This offers six new hunters, as usual named after their weapons, which are a mixture of the traditional and peculiar. You can choose from the Light Bowgun, the Long Sword (which is very long indeed), the Gunlance, the Hammer, the Lance and the Hunting Horn (which looks nothing like a horn). While cool dragons and other monsters are obviously appealing, in terms of adding variety to your games, this box gives you the biggest bang for your buck as you get six different new toys to play with, and six new upgrade paths to explore, rather than just one beastie. However, you’ll need both core sets to be able to fully utilize all six.</p></div><p id="nergigante-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Nergigante - Expansion">Monster Hunter World: The Board Game - Nergigante Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220574"><div id="220574" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World: The Board Game - Nergigante Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you do want one single dragon to add to your campaign, this might be your best bet because it allows you to craft additional weapons for all the currently available characters, including all those from the core sets and the Hunter’s Arsenal. He’s also delightfully odd, a spiny colossus who grows vicious spikes to impale the hunters wherever he’s damaged.</p></div><p id="kushala-daora-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Kushala Daora - Expansion">Monster Hunter World The Board Game: Kushala Daora Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220575"><div id="220575" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World The Board Game: Kushala Daora Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-world/Kushala_Daora">Kushala Daora</a> is a wind dragon, who buffets the hunters with powerful storms and he’s also got the biggest miniature in the range, with a foot-wide wingspan. As if beating such a behemoth wasn’t a tough enough fight in the first place, you’ll also have to fight through strong winds and tornado blasts just to even close with your quarry.</p></div><p id="teostra-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Teostra - Expansion">Monster Hunter World: The Board Game - Teostra Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220576"><div id="220576" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World: The Board Game - Teostra Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the dragons, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-world/teostra">Teostra</a> might be the most familiar simply because it’s the classic fire dragon everyone knows and either loves or fears, possibly in equal measure. As you might expect that means a lot of ranged punishment from blasts and fireballs for anyone that dares trespass onto the dragon’s lair.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Exclusive Expansion</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This was originally only available as part of the Kickstarter campaign for the game. Expect to pay a hefty premium if you want to pick one up second-hand. However, there’s currently another chance to snag one thanks to the more recent Kickstarter campaign for the new Iceborne boxes, detailed below.</p></div><p id="kulu-ya-ku-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Kulu-Ya-Ku - Expansion">Monster Hunter World - Kulu-Ya-Ku Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220577"><div id="220577" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World - Kulu-Ya-Ku</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bizarre creature can pick things up in its dextrous claws, such as rocks to throw at intrepid hunters. In mechanical terms this not only gives it a missile attack but its ability to use tools makes it unpredictable, ensuring you’ve got to pick the right spot from round to round in order to score maximum damage. It looks a lot like an ornithomimosaur - an ostrich-mimic dinosaur - so looks right at home in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-world/Ancient_Forest">Ancient Forest</a> although it can be used with either core box.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Upcoming Content</strong></h2></div><p id="monster-hunter-world-iceborne"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Monster Hunter World Iceborne">Monster Hunter World Iceborne: The Board Game</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220578"><div id="220578" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World Iceborne: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the success of the initial lineup detailed above, publisher Steamforged Games ran a second Kickstarter for a new iteration of the basic design called Monster Hunter World: Iceborne. While it features the same core mechanics it has a range of new concepts, so it’s only partially compatible with the original boxes: you can port monsters and hunters from one to the other in arena games, but you can’t shunt a campaign from one setting to a different one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Iceborne content follows a similar, but slightly different path to the original campaign. There’s just one core box this time, Hoarfrost Reach, again with four monsters and four hunters. Also as before there are Elder Dragons and a Hunter’s Arsenal expansion to add. But instead of another core box there are three monster expansions with four new monsters each, Absolute Power, Seething Anger and Overpowering Hunger. Plus a smattering of extras unlocked during the campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the campaign has closed, the game has not yet shipped and you can still order items from the offered range via Gamfound.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arkham-horror-the-board-game-buying-guide">Arkham Horror buying guide</a> if you're into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">horror board games</a>, or take a look at our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dominion-buying-guide-expansions">Dominion buying guide</a> if you're more a fan of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building games</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance writer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-launcher-is-indeed-clunky-admits-epic%E2%80%99s-tim-sweeney.1186224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-launcher-is-indeed-clunky-admits-epics-tim-sweeney/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-unreal-engine-6-info-shared-by-epics-tim-sweeney-preview-versions-in-2-3-years-goal-is-to-go-multithreaded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> earlier this week, Epic Games founder, president, and largest shareholder Tim Sweeney was featured in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive interview with Lex Fridman</a>. The highlight of the conversation was the unexpected mention of Unreal Engine 6 progress, but in the four-hour-long chat, Tim Sweeney also addressed some of the feedback on the Epic Games Launcher, which is often criticized in comparison to Valve's Steam client. Sweeney admitted to the launcher's faults, but also stressed that Valve has had a lot more time to mature its platform.</p>
<p><em>I think one of the reasons that people characterize the Epic Games launcher as clunky is because the Epic Games launcher is clunky and we need to improve this. There's a lot of work going on there and, you know, I wish we'd gotten better at addressing quality of life features and prioritize them above all of the other features.</em></p>
<p><em>Steam has 15 years of built-up work by many of the best programmers in the whole industry working on that. It's a much larger team working on Steam and a lot more time working on it, so we've had to make a lot of prioritization decisions about what do we support with the Epic Game Store and when.</em></p>
<p><em>A lot of the time, it's been supporting commercial features like merchandising, offering multiple versions of a game for sale, and offering upgrades from the regular edition to the deluxe edition and other things that partners work.</em></p>
<p><em>Other priorities have been quality of life and launcher load times and other things. And we've not put enough emphasis on the quality of life features.&nbsp; We've recognized this very clearly multiple times, and we've gone through multiple refactorings. But that's definitely been a disappointment to us and to a lot of users. One thing it took us a while to realize was it's not in uniform.</em></p>
<p><em>Depending on your proximity to a CDN and the size of your game collection, it can be either awesome or really clunky. And the users for whom it's really clunky are the people behind a large part of the complaints. I should also say that the Steam launcher, for a long time, from my memory, but also just looking online, was also very clunky in the beginning.</em></p>
<p>While Sweeney has a point, it should be clarified that the Epic Games Launcher can no longer be considered at its beginning, having launched in December 2018. There's still a lot of room for improvement on the client, that's for sure.</p>
