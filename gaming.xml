		<p>A while ago Activision removed all the Transformers games from store fronts, presumably because they had lost the licensing. These included the two excellent Cybertron games, Devastation, and the rather inferior movie tie in titles.</p>
<p>It seems that their parent company has had a change of heart, or maybe they just want to cash in on the upcoming Transformers One movie, but either way Transformers games appear to returning.&nbsp; At first there was just a <a href="https://news.tfw2005.com/2024/09/01/rumor-microsoft-studios-is-working-on-two-transformers-video-game-projects-519899">leak</a> that Microsoft were working on something Transformers and now the Australian Classification Board has listed the games. Both games&nbsp; are simply listed as Transformers but as both the games are also listed with “Online Interactivity” that does suggest multiplayer, and that has fans&nbsp; War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron very excited.</p>


<p>We also know that all the Transformers games have been relisted on the Xbox and Steam stores. but you can’t buy them yet.&nbsp; The <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/search/transformers">PlayStation store</a> only has Battlegrounds, the recently announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/02/race-and-battle-in-transformers-galactic-trials-this-october/">Galactic Trials</a>, and the VR game.</p>
<p>Before everyone get’s too excited, if we return to the Australian Classification Board which is listing for two games both called Transformers, the one key difference is one is listed as “Original” and the second as “Modified”, and that sounds rather like the same game being listed for last gen, and then a shiner updated version for current gen.&nbsp; None of the Transformers games had a PS5 or XBox Series X|S version, Fall of Cybertron was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/31/transformers-fall-of-cybertron-on-ps4-wasnt-remastered-but-it-doesnt-matter/">re-released on PS4</a> but without any graphical update.</p>
<p>So what does it all mean? Well there’s something Cybertronian on the way, maybe one of the games is coming to Game Pass, but what is most telling is the publisher here is Microsoft not Activision.&nbsp; Obviously Microsoft own Activision but it would still be a lot of legal faff for Activision to “give” Microsoft the code for the Transformers games, they cant just hand it over, so I’m hedging my bets. This may be a re-release, but it could also be some sort of promotional bit of fluff to tie in with Transformers One.</p>

<p>At least it’s something while the seemingly endless wait for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/09/transformers-reactivate-pc-ps5-xbox/">Transformers Reactivate</a> continues.</p>

The sixth installment in the long-running Activision sub-franchise is faster than ever before, and full of players who have already gotten the brand-new omnimovement system down to a science, which means every match goes one of two ways: fun or frustrating. Luckily, most of my time spent playing <em>Black Ops</em> <em>6</em> this weekend was fun, though I worry that as more and more people get a chance to go hands-on with the shooter ahead of its October 25 release, the worst parts of <em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer will take over.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196163,195371" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h51579"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 </em>multiplayer beta impressions</strong></h2><p>Ahead of the <em>Black Ops 6 </em>beta, everyone was geeking out over omnimovement, a brand new system developer Treyarch developed that allows players to move in a full 360 degrees at any time—sliding and diving in any direction, or rotating completely around while jumping off a ledge to fire off a few shots at an enemy on their tail (yes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-cod-blops-ps4-leak-mod-1851615761&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-cod-blops-ps4-leak-mod-1851615761">like <em>Max Payne</em></a></span>). All of this is done without any involved or laborious animation, and trust me, you’ll notice how fast and seamless this is—after going through a quick tutorial on the movement system, I found myself sliding and diving all over my first match with ease, as if I’d been doing it for years. The fact that omnimovement feels naturally baked in already is a testament to Treyarch’s tremendous work—it’s hard to imagine any future <em>Call of Duty</em> game without it.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="1758967d20a0e586dd04a6e597d6f21f" data-recommend-id="image://1758967d20a0e586dd04a6e597d6f21f" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two Call of Duty Operators dive while firing guns.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unfortunately, omnimovement also means that the most annoying kinds of <em>Call of Duty</em> gamers are thriving. From the moment I booted up the beta (a day late as I was visiting family), those who had already spent 24 hours with it were absolutely waxing my ass, moving around with jerky, twitchy movements that are almost impossible to predict. Nearly every close-quarters firefight is a diving, sliding shoot-out, with players dropping prone or supine all over the map—it’s absolute chaos. If you just go with the flow, you’ll have a blast, but if you’re actively trying to get good at this game, prepare to be frustrated: nearly every match is full of some hyped-up teenage streamer flopping and jerking all over the map.<br></p><p>Though the <em>Black Ops 6</em> beta only featured four maps, they offer a pretty clear picture of what to expect from the game when it launches in a month or so. Two of them got old pretty fast: Derelict, an abandoned, three-lane train yard that’s far too small; and Scud, a larger map set on a recently bombed military outpost that’s laid out real weird, making it hard to find enemies. But the other two maps, Skyline and Rewind, were a delight—I could play those two on an endless rotation and never get sick of them. Skyline is set on the rooftop of a resort, so there’s tons of breakable glass windows and nooks and crannies to explore, while Rewind is a strip mall straight out of Long Island, complete with several storefronts you can run through, the largest of which is an abandoned video store.<br></p><p>The four maps available during the limited beta showcase <em>Call of Duty</em>’s strengths and weaknesses: three-lane maps can get old fast if they’re too small, but more kitschy, innovative layouts and themes are a blast.<br></p><p>The last thing I noticed while playing the beta this weekend was the dangerous combination of features <em>Black Ops 6</em> offers: proximity chat and a new ability to pick up downed players and use them as human shields. Five minutes into my first match, my operator’s body is picked up by an enemy player and repeatedly humped against a wall. Luckily, prox chat wasn’t on, so I didn’t have to listen to whatever sweet nothings they were undoubtedly shouting in their headset, but I got the point anyway. Activision does warn you that they’re recording voice chat ahead of every match, so hopefully this will dissuade bad actors, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/toxic-voice-chat-women-overwatch-valorant-xbox-report-1850663717&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/toxic-voice-chat-women-overwatch-valorant-xbox-report-1850663717">any woman who has ever played an online multiplayer game</a></span> knows you can’t stop assholes from being assholes.<br></p><p>Between the prox chat, human shields, and lightning fast movement that can easily be abused by high-level players and young kids hopped up on Baja Blasts, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>runs the risk of highlighting the worst aspects of the franchise. Though I enjoyed my time with it this weekend, I’m wary of how the experience will be when it launches in October—it could be too fast, too frenetic, too twitchy and toxic, or it could just be an absolute blast. We shall see.<br></p><p><em>Black Ops 6</em> drops on October 25 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, and PC. An open beta will take place from September 6 to 9. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer in a recent interview commented on the fact that he passed on acquiring games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny/" data-ref-id="5000-38799">Destiny</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/guitar-hero/" data-ref-id="5000-24531">Guitar Hero</a> for Xbox. The CEO went on to say he's made "some of the worst game-choice decisions" but that he ultimately has no regrets.</p><p dir="ltr">His comments came as part of an interview at PAX West titled "Story Time with Phil Spencer," where the head of Xbox discussed some of his favorite games from over the years, one of which is Destiny.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDsvw-WPBfU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="8">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GDsvw-WPBfU?start=8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Spencer said he has mixed emotions and stories around Destiny. The shooter didn't initially click for him when he first played it, despite having a close relationship with developer Bungie, he said. He once shared a floor at Microsoft with Bungie founders Alex Seropian and Jason Jones and "learned a ton from just being around Bungie," Spencer said.</p><p dir="ltr">He said Microsoft did receive a pitch from Bungie to publish Destiny, but Xbox ultimately decided not to sign-on. It would take the game's House of Wolves expansion for Spencer to come around on Destiny.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a game that I'll always love and a team I'll always have a ton of affinity for," Spencer said.</p><p dir="ltr">Guitar Hero was another major franchise Spencer said he initially had doubts about.</p><p dir="ltr">"An interesting one is when this team came down to Redmond and Alex Rigopulos, who is great, he pitches a game where they're actually going to make plastic guitars, and they're going to plug into consoles, and then they're going to sell tracks where you're going to play Simon on this guitar and I'm like, 'Really?" Spencer said. "Do we really think that's going to work?</p><p dir="ltr">"A few people played Guitar Hero," Spencer said jokingly. "I heard that turned into a pretty good game."</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer said he's ultimately not a "regrets-type person," and prefers to be positive and look forward when it comes to the things Xbox is currently doing, rather than shaking his first over what could have been.</p><p dir="ltr">"Maybe that's a fault of mine, but I passed on so many games," Spencer said.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time there has been mention of Microsoft having been in the running when it came to the developer being acquired for a second time. Bungie originally split off from Xbox back in 2007, but not before giving up the Halo IP to the house of Xbox. Former Bungie composer Martin O' Donnell has previously said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-explored-signing-destiny-deal-with-microsoft-or-sony/1100-6490843/" data-ref-id="1100-6490843">Bungie did consider going back to Microsoft, but also entertained the idea of being acquired by Sony</a> (which would eventually acquire Bungie in 2022). Bungie wanted to own the Destiny IP, O'Donnell said, making negotiations with the two first-party companies a non-starter. The developer ultimately partnered with Activision to publish Destiny and Destiny 2, a deal that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-composer-calls-destiny-activision-deal-bad-fr/1100-6479396/" data-ref-id="1100-6479396">O'Donnell has said in interviews was "bad from the start."</a> Bungie and Activision's publishing agreement ended in 2019.</p>

They were both very good about realizing Dad Was at Work, but you know, kids are gonna be kids, and there's only so much patience a four-year-old and eight-year-old can show. But I also managed to play a lot of really interesting video games while walking around PAX, and I'm excited to chat about them this week.</p><p>-pk, who cannot help <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1830999524938035554?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">but feel devastated for the developers of <em>Concord</em></a></p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>I travelled back from PAX, where I played games like<em> The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom </em>and <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>, which I'll be able to chat about on this week's podcast.</li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>Sports! should be available shortly on every podcast feed, in which Rob and I talk through the upcoming NFL season. In the past, we staggered its release, but we're changing it up: day one for everyone. The only difference is people on higher tiers will, obviously, not hear ads. We also recorded a new episode of Remap Hotline, which you'll hear next week.

Stay tuned! We'll also publish Remap Radio <em>and</em> host the next installment in me and Brad Shoemaker from <em>Nextlander </em>playing through <em>Volgarr the Viking</em>.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

Instead, they hit the max level without venturing out into the wider world of Blizzard’s popular MMO. This wasn’t easy, as there aren’t many quests to complete in the starting zone. So eventually, they had to grind XP by picking herbs and mining. This took about two years, but eventually, they hit the max level in <em>Mists of Pandaria</em>’s starting zone, which means they never had to pick a side in <em>WoW </em>war between the Horde and the Alliance. </p><p>For the last decade, NeutralAgent has continued to stay in the starting zone, remaining neutral, and picking a ton of plants to slowly reach the max level in each and every future expansion, including the recently released <em>War Within.</em><br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/doubleagent-hits-level-80-with-neutral-pandaren-in-the-war-within/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/doubleagent-hits-level-80-with-neutral-pandaren-in-the-war-within/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by<em> Icy Veins</em></a></span>, on September 2 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NeutralAgent/status/1830535142131048947&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NeutralAgent/status/1830535142131048947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NeutralAgent hit the max level in <em>War Within</em></a></span> while still hanging out in the <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> starting zone.

It’s not only a great place for the gaming community to gather and celebrate our favorite pastime, but also an excellent opportunity to check out the upcoming slate of games coming this year and early in 2025. Coming hot on the heels of Gamescom, PAX West 2024 showcased a substantial suite of games from big favorites like Nintendo, Square-Enix, and Bandai Namco, along with some under-the-radar releases that have the potential to become someone’s next sleeper hit.<br></p><p>In this roundup, I share some of the best games I saw at PAX West 2024 and other gaming events taking place around it, such as The Mix (The Media Indie Exchange). Here is our list of some of the most exciting games from this year’s show. Oh, and one of my top games of the show has its coverage embargoed until the morning of September 4, so come back tomorrow and you’ll find that one at the top of the list.</p></div></div><div><p>Developer: Deck Nine Games<br>Platforms: PC, Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X/S<br>Release Date: October 29, 2024</p><p>While the<em> Life Is Strange</em> series had adopted the anthology approach for its many sequels, <em>Double Exposure</em> brings the focus back to the original protagonist, Max Caufield. This time, we see Max, now older, wiser, and a famous photographer, possessing new powers that allow her to slip into two parallel realities. Pulled into a murder mystery across dimensions, Max has to uncover who was behind the death of her friend Safi in one reality while still interacting with her in another and trying to prevent her death.<br></p><p>According to the developers, they weren’t too concerned with the canon events of the original game’s “impossible choice” ending. If anything, they see <em>Double Exposure</em> as something of a best-of-both-worlds approach to the series, acknowledging choices made and not made in the player’s experience with the story. <em>Double Exposure</em> puts that aspect at the forefront. Yet the causality of these choices, which see you building a relationship in one timeline but potentially weakening it in another, is still important. Being able to transition between realities seamlessly was so intriguing, and interacting with two different versions of the same character led to some interesting dilemmas that I want to see play out. This focus on relationships is part of what makes the <em>Life Is Strange</em> series so well-loved by fans— its empathetic storytelling makes it very welcoming for players, who often quickly become attached to the cast of characters. I like where <em>Double Exposure</em> is going with its story, and it could prove to be one of the boldest entries in the series yet.</p></div><div><p>Developer: Summitsphere<br>Platforms: PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4/PS5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S<br>Release Date: November 12, 2024</p><p>What made <em>AntonBlast</em> such a thrilling little experience was that it felt equal parts like a high-energy ‘90s Nickelodeon cartoon and an early 2D PS1-era platformer riding high on the enhanced tech of the 32-bit console. Inspired directly by the <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> and <em>Wario Lan</em>d games, <em>AntonBlast</em> has you play as a pair of chaotic bruisers that plow through environments and baddies with reckless abandon. Similar to <em>Pizza Tower</em>, the aim is to tear through levels as fast as possible while causing destruction to the levels and enemies in equal fashion—and in some cases, your wrecking journey will even take you into the backgrounds of levels to break stuff in the distance. Once I got into the groove of its high-octane platforming pace, I found <em>AntonBlast</em> to be a fun throwback, filled to the brim with raucous energy that I couldn’t help but admire.<br></p></div><div><p>Developer: Jed Shepherd in association with Limited Run Games and Visible Games<br>Platforms: PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4/PS5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S<br>Release Date: TBD 2025</p><p>On the surface, <em>Ghosts</em> presents itself as a tribute to the “so-bad, they’re good” FMV (full motion video) games from the ‘90s in the vein of<em> Sewer Shark </em>and <em>Night Trap</em>. However, <em>Ghosts </em>puts a twist on the formula: playing as a producer of a horror-based reality tv show, you cycle through camera feeds watching contestants explore a haunted house, and you begin to experience your own share of hauntings within the confines of your comfy van, revealing a dark presence that draws you into something sinister. The game also employs a fascinating gimmick: it will only be playable in “real time” after 10PM based on your current timezone—and also, quitting the game prematurely will result in the worst and most gruesome ending for the live action cast.<br></p><p><em>Ghosts</em> is an alluring spin on popular narrative-driven horror experiences and the experimental games that never left the ‘90s—think equal parts <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em> and <em>Night Trap</em>. The combination of the two, with the jarring yet playful use of live-action actors exploring the house and the explorable space of the van feeling increasingly unsafe, made for something very compelling, a new mix of different genres, and it’s something I want to see more of—especially with monster designs coming from Siren Head creator Trevor Henderson.<br></p></div><div><p>Developer: Digital Eclipse<br>Platforms: PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4/PS5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S<br>Release Date: TBD 2024</p><p>According to the developers, the main goal behind <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind</em> was to make the proper high-energy, bombastic arcade-style beat-em-up that the series never got. True to their word, playing <em>MMPR: Rita’s Rewind</em> feels like a throwback to’ 90s-style fast-paced brawler action that puts it alongside genre siblings like <em>Streets of Rage</em> and the best <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles </em>clobberfests.</p><p>Made in the same style as the ‘90s nostalgia-tuned <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge—</em>which is a good thing—<em>Rita’s Rewind</em> is a fun tribute to the original series that not only tosses in deep cuts, but so far looks to be a pretty solid beat-em-up in its own right. Each member of the OG crew feels unique and possesses their own moves, and it was really thrilling seeing all the action unfold. Along with planned missions focusing on giant robot and kaiju battles presented in SNES-style Mode 7 visuals, <em>MMPR: Rita’s Rewind</em> looks to not only show the greatest hits of the series but also offer a fun dive back to a classic era of gaming.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d69e8cc4ca3a6dce462d811517a187de" data-recommend-id="image://d69e8cc4ca3a6dce462d811517a187de" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Key art for Demon Spore shows a scientist framed by a doorway holding a flamethrower and looking on in horror as other people are attacked by tentacled monstrosities.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Developer: DinoBoss<br>Platforms: PC, other platforms TBD<br>Release Date: TBD 2024</p><p>What hooked me with <em>Demon Spore</em> is that it turns the general idea of John Carpenter’s <em>The Thing </em>into a co-op roguelite experience. Focusing on a group of scientists and security guards trapped in a facility slowly being overrun by a hostile organism, the survivors must scrape together supplies and chart out an escape while staying one step ahead of the growing parasite. It mixes elements of survival horror with top-down twin-stick shooters, all within the framework of a dungeon crawler that has you compete against an opponent making moves in the dungeon as well.<br></p><p><em>Demon Spore</em> was such a blast with a crew, and seeing how quickly things escalated was a real trip. You have to pick up whatever you can find to survive, including guns and fire extinguishers to freeze enemies or computer screens to shock them. My favorite moments came when things took a turn for the worse; seeing the chaos and sense of desperation that occurred when the parasitic tendrils took over sections of the room in real time was so unnerving. It has all the makings of a fun and unsettling time with a crew.<br></p></div></div><div><p>Developer: Nautilus Games<br>Platforms: PC, Nintendo Switch<br>Release Date: TBD</p><p>Made by some of the devs behind <em>Death’s Door</em> and <em>Go Mecha Ball</em>, <em>Everdeep Aurora</em> presents a more cozy and atmospheric take on a post-apocalyptic game. Set in the time after a meteor has collided with the planet, you take on the role of Shell, a cat-like explorer armed with a drill that can burrow deep below the surface. After your mother goes missing you resolve to find her, with your only clue a note leading you down into the depths below the village into caverns filled with oddball scavengers and platforming challenges to face.<br></p><p><em>Everdeep Aurora</em> is a visual stunner, using the aesthetic of a 16-bit game to establish itself as a stunning and atmospheric adventure that feels equal parts <em>Hollow Knight</em> and <em>Steamworld Dig</em>. As you delve deeper, new 16-bit filters show off the change in scenery, which are cool moments that help to build up its atmosphere even further. With no combat, <em>Everdeep Aurora</em> focuses more on platforming action and adventure-like quests to set the mood and give you a sense of growth throughout Shell’s journey.<br></p></div><div><p>Developer: Supermassive Games<br>Platforms: PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4/PS5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S<br>Release Date: TBD 2025</p><p>What makes the <em>Little Nightmares</em> series so compelling is that it manages to be simultaneously whimsical and utterly terrifying. The first two games from developer Tarsier Studios told a connected story, but with the third game coming from Supermassive Games of <em>Until Dawn</em> and <em>The Dark Pictures Anthology</em> fame, the series is going for a fresh start. This new beginning also means a change in scope, and <em>Little Nightmares III</em> focuses on two playable protagonists experiencing the horrors of the story together—a story which can be played solo with an AI companion or in co-op.<br></p><p>During my co-op session, I coordinated with my partner to find the best ways to get ahead of the new baddies lurking about, which in our demo included a four-armed factory administrator who didn’t want anyone in their office. Playing with another person heightened that sense of dread as we had to figure out the best way to proceed. Supermassive Games is keeping up well with the series’ focus on an unsettling cinematic platformer experience, and while the third game does feel very familiar, it looks to be building off its foundations for a promising third entry that could take <em>Little Nightmares</em> to new heights.</p></div><div><p><strong>Heartworm</strong><br>Developer: Vincent Adinolfi<br>Platforms: PC<br>Release Date: TBD 2025</p><p>While many developers who worked on classic ‘90s survival horror games had to build environments and characters around the limited technology of the time, that low-polygon aesthetic and sense of atmosphere still has many fans today. The upcoming <em>Heartworm</em> aims to recapture that ‘90s style from classic <em>Silent Hill</em> and <em>Resident Evil</em> for a surreal and unnerving new game. Mixing <em>Fatal Frame</em> with the unease of <em>Twin Peaks</em>, <em>Heartworm</em> is a nostalgia-fueled nightmare gallery that channels that familiar mood of classic survival horror. While battling monsters that looked like they’d crawled out of static televisions, I was taken in by the ever-changing environments, which got increasingly unhinged as it went on. I dug where this horror game is going, and I’m all for developers giving the low-polygon aesthetic a second life with modern games.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="42e795f71bf7d56fab2979cd052b66ec" data-recommend-id="image://42e795f71bf7d56fab2979cd052b66ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Some bandits glare intimidatingly at the viewer, while a man lies tied up behind them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some bandits glare intimidatingly at the viewer, while a man lies tied up behind them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Deep Silver</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42e795f71bf7d56fab2979cd052b66ec" data-recommend-id="image://42e795f71bf7d56fab2979cd052b66ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Some bandits glare intimidatingly at the viewer, while a man lies tied up behind them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Developer: Warhorse Studios<br>Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S<br>Release Date: February 11, 2025</p><p>What made the original <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> such a hit was that it was essentially a Bethesda-style RPG with an element of realism that served its historical backdrop. While the original didn’t hit all the historical and gameplay beats it needed, the upcoming sequel looks to be a major step forward that presents a greater level of detail and grounding for its take on an open-world medieval-era Bohemia. Picking up after the original, protagonist Henry returns to explore a larger version of Bohemia and its surrounding regions during a civil war.<br></p><p>I was very impressed with just how immersive the sequel is, and the game’s larger scale uplifts the richness of the setting—which feels both more faithful to history and more interesting to explore. Just walking the streets of one of the game’s towns, named Kuttenberg, was a highlight in my demo; the daytime activity in the town felt lively, while exploring the town at night, when everyone required torches to travel, was a moody and compelling change of pace. Along with the return of realistic, directional-based swordfighting, Henry also has more ways to go about solving specific problems, giving the sequel more of an open-ended nature that didn’t feel as present in the original. So far, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> looks to be a fully realized sequel that does more to live up to the concept of a true medieval open-world RPG.<br></p><p>To read more on <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, check out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-medieval-rpg-1851626849&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-medieval-rpg-1851626849"><em>Kotaku</em>’s full impressions</a></span> following a three hour session with the game.<br></p></div></div><div><p>Developer: Paper Cult<br>Platforms: PC<br>Release Date: TBD 2025</p><p>Paper Cult’s <em>Tears of Metal</em> is an intriguing mash-up of a large-scale medieval action brawler with a roguelite. Set in the aftermath of a meteor landing in the Scottish highlands, you play as a general tasked with leading a battalion of captains and soldiers into battle to reach the fallen star before rival factions beat you to it. With its battles taking place on a similar scale to those of the <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> series, players use their character’s skills to tear through enemies, capture territory, and defeat unit captains. Each successful engagement earns new buffs, such as explosive fire damage or heightened defense, and it was thrilling to see how much power you can attain in a short time. With its grim fantasy aesthetic coupled with the large-scale fights, <em>Tears of Metal</em> presents a neat and exciting spin on a roguelite brawler.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Less than two weeks after its launch, Firewalk Studios and Sony are taking <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> offline, halted sales of the hero shooter and are issuing refunds to all players. The game’s servers will be shut down on 6th September 2024, but it’s not necessarily the end of the line as they will “explore options” for the game’s potential return.</p>
<p>Writing on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">PlayStation Blog</a>, Game Director Ryan Ellis gave the following statement:</p>


<p>“Concord fans — we’ve been listening closely to your feedback since the launch of Concord on PlayStation 5 and PC and want to thank everyone who has joined the journey aboard the Northstar. Your support and the passionate community that has grown around the game has meant the world to us.</p>
<p>“However, while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended. Therefore, at this time, we have decided to take the game offline beginning September 6, 2024, and explore options, including those that will better reach our players.”</p>
<p>In effect, this is a full cancellation of the game’s launch on 23rd August. All players who bought the game through the PlayStation Store or PlayStation Direct will have an automatic refund from Sony – these will take 30-60 days to appear on bank statements, apparently. Steam and Epic will also refund players who are on PC. If the game was purchased physically, you’ll have to talk to the retailers directly, but Sony has sanctioned the refund programme, so you shouldn’t have much trouble.</p>

<p>It’s widely thought felt that trying to do a premium hero shooter when the market is dominated by a small handful of free-to-play titans, like Overwatch, Valorant and the soon to be released Marvel themed shooter, was a misstep. So was launching in the middle of Gamescom with little to no splashy marketing support. It resulted in a concurrent player count that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/">maxed out at 697 players on Steam</a> and has barely scraped three figures on PC in the last few days. With reports and speculation that sales are at around 25,000, it’s a massive underperformance for Sony, and they had to do something to spur it on.</p>
<p>As for the game’s future? Well, going free-to-play is the obvious answer, it just depends how long it will take Firewalk to work microtransactions into the game to shift the business model, and then Sony needs to pick a launch window that gives them a fighting chance.</p>
<p>It’s a real shame, because we enjoyed this alternative to the genre mainstays. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord review</a>, Jim said, “Fun, quickfire game modes and solid multiplayer shooting help steer Concord through an asteroid field of scepticism and unhinged vitriol but the space odyssey doesn’t end here. Like any live service, Concord’s ongoing vitality and potential appeal to new fans will hinge on its post-launch support, content roadmap, and building on Firewalk’s exciting foundation.”</p>

			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is this month's game featured on IGN First, and the exclusive coverage <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGMMK2I30-o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> today with a 22-minute-long gameplay video featuring commentary from BioWare developers. Game Director John Epler talked about the Lighthouse, shown in the first few minutes.</p>
<p><em>The Lighthouse is your base of operations that you inherited willingly or unwillingly from Solas. It is located in the Fade. It's where Solas was able to start planning his rebellion against the Elven Gods millennia ago. Right now, you and your team have occupied it and started to build it, starting to shape itself around your personality. Each of these spaces kind of shapes itself around your companions as they live there, as they basically spend their arcs in those rooms. </em><em>One of the interesting and fun things we've done in Dragon Age: The Veilguard is that if you see the lights on in a room, that companion has something to say. You can see Harding up in that space there, Neve behind you as well as Belara.</em></p>
<p>As the player character moved to the mission, they had to go through the Crossroads. Epler once again discussed what they are exactly.</p>
<p><em>The Crossroads is the area that you spend a lot of time traveling through as you go from area to area. It's also a space that has at one point served as Solas's main base of operations and training ground for his rebellion against the Elven Gods, so as you go through it, you're going to find fragments of the past, things that Solas had done previously that are going to give you a bit of insight into Solas as a character but also into the Elven Gods and their motivations.</em></p>

GameSpot was able to get hands-on with Black Ops 6 during Activision's Call of Duty: Next event, which featured multiplayer and the next Warzone map. Black Ops 6 feels very polished with new action star movement that is a blast to use, but I do worry that it won't take long for high-skilled players to exploit the system and ruin the fun.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Movement for action-hero plays</h2><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 definitely feels like a Black Ops game with its fast-paced action, arcade style, and vibrant maps. The biggest difference this year is Treyarch's new movement system, which further adapts the fluidity and pace of the typical Black Ops multiplayer experience.</p>

Whereas previous entries limited you to just forward dives and sliding, you can now go prone and spin around 360 degrees, making for epic moves that allow you to live out your own John Wick-style action-hero fantasy.</p><p dir="ltr">Omnimovement's reveal worried me as a long-time, old-school player who doesn't bunny hop and rarely slide cancels. I already find myself being outfinessed by high-skill players who can give themselves an advantage in gunfights with these advanced techniques. The thought of my opponents using even more advanced slides and diving sounded worrisome for my future matches. I was also pretty skeptical at how the movement would feel.</p><p dir="ltr">However, omnimovement pleasantly surprised me. It's a well-polished mechanic, and I found myself enjoying the moments where the movement benefited me. This includes reactions like side diving to avoid a grenade or diving backwards behind cover to reload. There were also intense moments of Domination on Skyline, where my team and I cleared the enemies away from the B flag and I dove off a balcony to land behind cover and secure the point.</p><p dir="ltr">These are the type of over-the-top plays I'd only expect to pull off during scripted moments of a Call of Duty campaign. Yet here I am, leveraging these moves and having a great time doing it. It's not quite muscle memory for me yet, and I'm sometimes diving and sliding at the wrong times, but I'm learning how to better chain movements together and make my playstyle more fluid as I rack up additional game time in the beta.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360826-bo6_multiplayer_omnimovement_branded2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360826" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360826-bo6_multiplayer_omnimovement_branded2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360826"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360826-bo6_multiplayer_omnimovement_branded2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Further improving the action is the new Intelligent Movement system. These are optional game settings, which are turned off by default, but I highly recommend everyone try these out. They allow you to customize a lot of basic movements, such as turning on settings for tactical sprint assist and removing the sprint delay, reducing the number of button presses needed to perform certain actions. These not only made my movement feel faster and more fluid, but it meant less input on the thumbsticks, thus it also felt much easier on my hands.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, Black Ops 6's movement is all about timing and decision-making. I've been at an advantage when an enemy launched at me with an ill-timed dive, and I've been gunned down in the same manner when the roles were reversed. So far, omnimovement hasn't felt like it's created a significantly higher skill gap, and casual players should still be able to hold their own against their opponents, but only time will tell if this sentiment will remain true. Right now, it's something optional that allows you to get a bit flashy with your movements, and it doesn't feel like a required skill you <em>need</em> to master. You can easily still win gunfights and find success without ever partaking in the additional movement, at least based on what we've seen so far.</p><p dir="ltr">I remain concerned that it won't take long for high-skill players to master and possibly exploit this movement system to an even higher degree than we already see with Call of Duty's existing slide-canceling and bunny-hopping mechanics. It's easy for an above-average player to find exploits or slide around and break your cameras, and while it's still too early to be certain, Black Ops 6's more advanced movement has the ability to bring one of the highest skill gaps we've seen.</p><p dir="ltr">This year could also be tough for average/casual players who start playing post-launch. Jumping into a new Call of Duty with more complex movement long after players have mastered the movement could make for a more jarring experience than usual.</p><p dir="ltr">On a positive note, the beta includes the omnimovement training course that will also be in the game at launch. This allows you to practice your dives and barrel rolls with coaching narration provided by Black Ops fan-favorite operator, Frank Woods.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Brand-new maps and mostly familiar modes</h2><p dir="ltr">While Modern Warfare 3 released with a map pool consisting of entirely remastered maps, Black Ops 6 is set to launch with a fresh offering of 16 brand-new maps. The first week of the beta includes the same map pool as our hands-on experience at Call of Duty: Next, and it's a pretty good variety of settings with each beta map having a unique aesthetic.</p><p dir="ltr">Rewind is a map that takes place in and around a '90s-themed shopping center with a Blockbuster-style video store. Derelict is a colorful yet rundown train yard, Babylon takes place in ancient city ruins of Iraq, Skyline is a luxury penthouse, and Scud is a desert military outpost.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360828-bo6_multiplayer_action_branded2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360828" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360828-bo6_multiplayer_action_branded2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360828"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360828-bo6_multiplayer_action_branded2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Treyarch kept a focus on core 6v6 maps for multiplayer, so don't expect any large-scale Ground War-style maps for this year's launch. The maps are all small-to-medium-sized with a mostly standard three-lane design that Treyarch is known for designing. Not everyone is going to like that structure, but I appreciate that they're not cluttered or campy maps, and it's never going to take you long to get into the action.</p><p dir="ltr">The beta includes a mix of staple Call of Duty modes, with Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint all in rotation. However, Treyarch also gives us a taste of the new Kill Order game mode. Kill Order isn't massively innovative, but it does add a little spice for those who prefer a more casual Team Deathmatch-style mode. The mode marks one person on each team as an HVT (High-Value Target) player. Regular eliminations still count towards your team's score, but you get even more points by keeping your HVT alive and eliminating the enemy HVT. This mode doesn't get as sweaty as a match of Hardpoint, but it can be a whole lot of chaotic fun.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Gunplay feels satisfying</h2><p dir="ltr">The beta gives a solid offering of weapons to try out. The XM4 is a versatile assault rifle, and the Jackal PDW is a powerful choice for an aggressive submachine gun. The weapons feel mostly balanced for their class, with the one exception being the Jackal PDW--the submachine gun is a bit overpowered in this first week of the beta. Weapon tuning will likely take place during the beta and prior to launch though, so hopefully it's in a better place by the time the game releases.</p><p dir="ltr">The time-to-kill in Black Ops 6 feels consistent and a little faster than Cold War's slower 150-health, but even with the game's return to classic 100-health, it doesn't feel too fast. It's perhaps closer in line with the TTK currently found in MW3.</p><p dir="ltr">The audio and visual designs are highly polished as well. The guns all look and sound amazing to use. Some of the more recent Call of Duty games started with too much visual recoil, which was a combination of smoke and gun wobble that could distract and reduce visibility in gunfights, but thankfully Black Ops 6 doesn't seem to have any major visual recoil hindering your fights. The footstep audio might be a little low, but everything else in action sounds well-tuned.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that visibility is great this year. A problem with recent Call of Duty games, especially early in the betas, was poor visibility with washed-out color palettes and hard-to-see enemies and nametags. However, Black Ops 6 has great lighting and visuals. I never find myself shooting at teammates or squinting to try and tell who's an enemy.</p><h2 dir="ltr">A mostly standard loadout system</h2><p dir="ltr">The create-a-class system is what you'd expect from a Treyarch-developed Call of Duty, but one major difference works towards its goal of providing the best movement. All loadouts now have a dedicated melee slot, so you don't need to sacrifice a secondary weapon for a knife. You also get unlimited tac-sprint with the knife in hand, allowing you to swap to a blade and speed around the map.</p><p dir="ltr">Modern Warfare 3 labeled traditional perks as wearable gear pieces, such as a vest that worked just like the classic Overkill perk to carry an additional primary weapon. Over time, new gear pieces were added in seasonal updates that offered similar perks already featured in the game, and gear pieces became a more confusing way of getting the classic Call of Duty perks you needed for your playstyle. It's nice to see Black Ops 6 go back and streamline perks into the typical three categories. The perks are much of the classic offerings, such as Ghost, Double Time, and, Flak Jacket, but Treyarch does bring back the Wildcard feature from previous Black Ops games, which provides an additional way to customize your loadouts. In the beta, we only have two options: Overkill to carry a second primary weapon and Perk Greed to equip one additional perk. Both feel like good Wildcard options to have. I lean more towards Overkill for my loadouts, but it will likely depend on your playstyle which you choose.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360835-bo6-cod-next-02-mp-0382.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360835" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360835-bo6-cod-next-02-mp-0382.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360835"></a><figcaption>Beta killstreaks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360835-bo6-cod-next-02-mp-0382.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Gunsmith is a lot more straightforward than what we've seen in recent years. There's no worry of advanced weapon tuning, conversion kits, or even an overwhelming amount of attachments like we saw in Call of Duty: Vanguard. It's just a simple Gunsmith customization that allows for up to five attachments. Attachments also feel much more straightforward, with a variety of pros and very few cons.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of getting to choose between earning killstreaks or scorestreaks, Black Ops 6 just offers scorestreaks, which is great to help promote objective play. The beta includes familiar options, with streaks like the UAV, Counter UAV, chopper gunner, and even Treyarch's iconic RC-XD remote-controlled car.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Warzone focuses on small map Resurgence</h2><p dir="ltr">For Warzone, Treyarch was focused on creating a Resurgence map with a story that only its studio could tell. Area 99 is a small Warzone map inspired by Treyarch's most iconic multiplayer map, Nuketown, with a focus on the points-of-interest telling the origin story of how the Nuketown map was created. This includes a manufacturing facility for the Nuketown model houses, a nuclear reactor, a mannequin-assembly center, and an underground bunker.</p><p dir="ltr">At first glance, I thought the map looked too small and drab. I expected more pops of color like we see in Treyarch's multiplayer map design, but Area 99 is a lot of washed-out colors and boring concrete. However, the Nuketown story here is interesting and unique, and the map plays really well for its purpose as a Resurgence map, which is all about facilitating a more frantic and fast-past battle royale experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Area 99 is smaller than Rebirth Island, and it makes for plenty of quick engagements. We only played a handful of matches at Call of Duty: Next, given our short amount of playtime, but each one was met with instant action.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360836-bo6-cod-next-04-wz-0022.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360836" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360836-bo6-cod-next-04-wz-0022.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4360836"></a><figcaption>Area 99 map layout</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4360836-bo6-cod-next-04-wz-0022.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That said, don't expect too many new bells and whistles for this new year of Warzone. Movement is the focus for the developers, and the new features arriving with integration--such as Black Ops 6's omnimovement and the advantage of unlimited tac-sprint with the dedicated melee slot--are among the game's biggest updates. Improved movement and quality-of-life changes can always make the Warzone experience better, but I'm really hoping the developer has more plans up its sleeve for dynamic map changes and special events to help keep battle royale from getting too stale.</p><p dir="ltr">One welcome change, however, is the removal of Warzone's backpack system. There are still dedicated slots for holding important equipment, such as the gas mask, field upgrade, one killstreak, and tactical and lethal equipment, but ditching the backpack means no one can hoard a bunch of game-changing killstreaks and equipment for the final circle. Additionally, armor and ammo satchels are introduced to make sure you can still store enough plates and ammo for your fights now that the backpacks are gone.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Final thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr">Overall, Treyarch's move to the new engine feels like a success, and the extra development time can definitely be felt in the polish of the multiplayer beta. The only issues of note so far are some minor freezing and hiccups with the servers, and that the Jackal PDW needs to be nerfed. While I haven't had enough playtime with Area 99 to give in-depth impressions yet, it already feels like Warzone is getting a potentially solid new map design for the Resurgence modes.</p><p dir="ltr">My biggest concern for Black Ops 6 post-launch is the skill gap that could eventually be created by the movement and offering powerful gun attachments that don't feature any cons, but only time will tell how sweaty this omnimovement will become. For now, it looks as if Treyarch has redefined Call of Duty's fast-paced action with omnidirectional movement, making multiplayer a blast.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft and Apple In Disagreement About Cloud Gaming Again]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-and-apple-in-disagreement-about-cloud-gaming-again/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-and-apple-in-disagreement-about-cloud-gaming-again.971061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-and-apple-in-disagreement-about-cloud-gaming-again/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This argument between Microsoft and Apple is far from new, but it has resurfaced again. Earlier in the year, Apple opened its App Store to game streaming services, such as the commonly used Xbox Cloud Gaming and GeForce Now. This allowed a more seamless integration, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-considering-a-browser-based-app-for-xbox-game-pass-to-bypass-apple-app-store-rules/">users didn't have to use a web app</a> on iPhone and iPad. Despite this, NVIDIA and Microsoft have not made native apps for iOS, which Microsoft has now explicitly explained.</p>
<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer already spoke out about Apple earlier this year, saying that Apple's cloud changes haven't gone "far enough" for Xbox. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In an interview</a> with The Verge, Spencer mentioned "that there's not enough room for us to monetize Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS." Regarding the terms that Apple suggested, he responded with, "You might even say they go the opposite direction in some way, but they definitely don't go far enough to open up competition in the world's largest gaming platform." During that interview, Spencer said he would continue to work with Apple and Google to try and create a solution for this.</p>
<p>In submissions to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Microsoft has raised the point that despite the various changes that Apple made to the App Store guidelines in January, March, and April<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> (as seen in sections 4.7 and 4.9)</a>, it still isn't enough for it to operate a native Xbox Cloud Gaming app on iOS.</p>
<p>After reviewing Apple's guidelines, Microsoft has said that they "still represent an obstacle to Cloud Gaming native apps" as it cannot comply with them in a technical and economical sense if it incorporates games into the Xbox Cloud Gaming services on iOS. Specifically, Apple is asking to make multiplatform services such as Xbox Cloud Gaming and all content, subscriptions, and features available within the app as an in-app purchase.</p>
<p>By asking that, Microsoft opens a can of worms for the third-party game developers who have their games on the service. Microsoft would then have to ask them to recode their games so that they are compliant with the IAP requirement, which is a significant amount of effort for something that may not even be successful.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6c53fc52d5fb4c82ddd66/2024-08-07_Apple_Response_to_Working_Paper_6_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple argues</a> that it is supporting cloud gaming via web apps, citing two articles by the Verge that discuss Microsoft's improvements to Xbox Cloud Gaming performance on iPhone and iPad and the fact that more than 20 million people have used Xbox Cloud Gaming on their iOS platforms. Apple has also claimed that Microsoft has not engaged with them despite multiple efforts to work together to make cloud gaming successful on iOS.</p>
<p>When it comes to the issue of third-party developers having to recede their games, Apple has also argued that point, saying that developers "generally are not having difficulty with the IPA requirement," citing Antstream, a small app developer who was responsible for launching the first iPhone game streaming service with over 1,300 retro titles from different companies.</p>
<p>To try to settle this argument, the CMA has set a deadline for all parties involved to respond to the market investigation before a provisional decision report is released in November. A final report is due next year.</p>

Yet, over many years the studio has slowly updated and changed its underlying systems to not only meet those original expectations from fans and help rebuild trust, but eventually <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-unexpected-success-of-no-man-s-sky-1833920840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-unexpected-success-of-no-man-s-sky-1833920840">surpass those expectations</a></span>. In 2024, <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is perhaps the most definitive game for those seeking a unique space fantasy that lets you explore, catalog, and conquer the great unknown.</p></div><div><p>I respect, but don’t quite understand, the popularity of realistic driving sims like <em>American Truck Simulator</em>. Growing up in Los Angeles, driving around in my free time just to drive was a favorite pastime. There is something about the monotonous act of just cruising down roads with the radio on that feels meditative, but for me at least, doing that in a game just doesn’t hit the same. If you feel similarly then maybe change the setting to space<em>. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2380050/Star_Trucker/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2380050/Star_Trucker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Star Trucker</em></a></span> is exactly that, a realistic driving simulator with the exception of the extra-planetary routes you’ll be undertaking.</p></div><div><p>If you’d rather spend your time with a strategy game that will let you sink dozens of hours into building up your own space empire as you play cutthroat political games then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Stellaris</em></a></span><em> </em>is for you. From the same team behind strategy heavy hitters like the <em>Crusader Kings</em> and <em>Victoria </em>series, <em>Stellaris </em>takes Paradox Interactive’s deftly crafted 4X gameplay and transfers it to a grand galactic theater. If you’ve ever thought that, actually, the political part of the <em>Star Wars</em> prequels was fascinating, you can guide your own rise to power amongst the stars.</p></div><div><p>Space isn’t all that friendly, especially in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/252110/Lovers_in_a_Dangerous_Spacetime/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252110/Lovers_in_a_Dangerous_Spacetime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</em></a></span>. In this co-up adventure, you and up to three friends man your spaceship against the seemingly constant threats of deep space. Communication is key in this joint adventure that requires you to run around your ship and man the proper stations to stay alive. Like any good party game, <em>Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</em> is easy to pick up, hard to master, and just hectic enough to cause the right amount of chaos amongst your group.</p></div><div><p>How hard can it really be to build a rocket? Turns out extremely, but thanks to <em>Kerbal Space Program</em> it can also be extremely funny. The space flight simulation title bases its building and launching of rockets and other spacecraft off of completely realistic physics. The humorous twist are the titular Kerbals, silly looking aliens who are your guinea pigs. The meat of<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/Kerbal_Space_Program/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/Kerbal_Space_Program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kerbal Space Program</em></a></span> is its incredibly intricate building systems that challenge you to make effective spaceships, but your many failures are made easier by the presence of the Kerbals at all times. Sometimes you might find yourself making the most failure prone craft you can just to see how it treats your willing victims.</p></div><div><p><em>Fallout </em>in space. That’s the pitch for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/578650/The_Outer_Worlds/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/578650/The_Outer_Worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a></span>—which is not to be confused with <em>Outer Wilds</em>, another great space exploration title currently not on sale. Developed by <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> creator Obsidian Entertainment, <em>The Outer Worlds</em> brings the studio’s signature player-centric open-world RPG design to a space setting rife with sharp satire and western homages. The ability to choose how you approach situations (be it with a gun or with your words) in many major story beats and more minor interactions creates a living breathing world that makes the player feel truly important in more ways than just being the protagonist of a predetermined story. Running around and uncovering every little detail of <em>The Outer Worlds </em>setting is worthwhile, as its frontier western twist on the space adventure is perfectly pulpy.</p></div><div><p>In the twelve years since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/FTL_Faster_Than_Light/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/FTL_Faster_Than_Light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>FTL</em></a></span><em> </em>released it feels like the roguelike genre has absolutely ballooned in popularity, yet <em>FTL </em>remains one of the absolute best to ever do it. You take control of a spaceship’s crew and make your way to your destination while being constantly attacked by enemies. While staying alive is paramount, <em>FTL </em>is much more management-based as you need to choose the proper crew and equipment as well as direct said crew to stations across these ships in order to avoid defeat. The fast-paced but highly strategic and customizable nature of each encounter makes returning to <em>FTL </em>over and over again a joy.</p></div><div><p>As far as original sci-fi settings go, <em>The Expanse</em> series (both the books and the TV show) are up there. From the mind of writers Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck—under the pen name James S. A. Corey—<em>The Expanse</em> is a gritty realistic version of space filled with high political tensions and space-based class disparity that leads to some incredible story arcs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1708010/The_Expanse_A_Telltale_Series/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1708010/The_Expanse_A_Telltale_Series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Telltale Series</em></a></span> based on the TV show continues that thrilling world in a slightly more interactive form and centers around one of the show’s best characters, Camina Drummer. You shouldn’t feel intimidated if you’ve never read or watched <em>The Expanse</em>, as the game is a great starting point.</p></div><div><p>Space is an unknowable void. It is uncaring, cold, and will kill you. You cannot defeat a force of nature like it. That is the conceit behind <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2341070/The_Banished_Vault/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2341070/The_Banished_Vault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Banished Vault</em></a></span>, a space-faring strategy/management game unlike any other on this list. You control a massive colony ship as it jumps from system to system as it constantly flees for an encroaching plague. Each system has planets and potential resources to find that can prolong your inhabitants’ lives from the inevitability of their deaths. There isn’t a real sense of victory in <em>The Banished Vault</em>, just a sense of ephemeral survival that can quickly be taken from you. This helplessness in the face of space makes for a thrilling gameplay loop that somehow hooks you in, compelling you to try to survive just a bit longer each time. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

No, you did not hallucinate Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy battling Sephiroth. That is, in fact, very real, and part of the first <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>game. You know what else is real? Mickey Mouse being the king of this universe, but also lowkey one of its most prolific warriors. These games are <em>Space Jam </em>for theater kids and Disney adults and they’re on a pretty decent sale right now.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/sub/1000794&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/1000794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>On Steam</strong></a></span><strong>, the entire franchise is on sale as the <em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em> for $69, though it usually goes for $100. </strong>This collection features just about every <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>title, since they’re all mostly canonical and tie in to the confusing overarching story in some fashion. Most of the entries are the full, original games, where possible. Some of the other titles, though, couldn’t be ported without meaningful resources put towards altering the gameplay to fit systems other than where the game first launched. For instance, <em>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</em>, which was released on the DS and made use of the dual screens for gameplay. In the case of games like this, this collection instead has compilations of the cutscenes in high-definition. </p><p>As far as full games, bagging this collection will get you <em>Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, Re:Chain of Memories, II Final Mix, Birth By Sleep Final Mix, Dream Drop Distance HD, 0.2 Birth By Sleep - A fragmentary passage, III, and III ReMind</em>. You’ll also get the HD cutscenes of <em>358/2 Days </em>and <em>Re:coded</em>, as well as the movie <em>χ Back Cover</em>. Now, in case that made no sense, and I’m sure it didn’t, I will do my best to explain what I just said.<br></p><p>The three main games are in there, and the first two are specifically the <em>Final Mix </em>versions, which just means they are the re-releases that featured expanded content. Remember, DLC didn’t <em>really </em>exists in the early 2000s. The first game is not really all that fun (it’s too stiff in my opinion), but the second is like a completely different and much better game. Meanwhile, <em>ReMind </em>is just the third game’s lone piece of DLC, so if you’re interested in where the series will go outside of the story arc that concluded with <em>III</em>, it’s probably worth having.<br></p><p><em>Re:Chain of Memories and Re:coded </em>are (as the titles might give away) remakes of existing games which were ported to consoles. The former is a Gameboy Advance title that adopted a card-based battle system, and the latter was a mobile game that was eventually brought to the DS and then everything else. Meanwhile, <em>Birth By Sleep </em>is a PSP prequel that is probably one of the most celebrated titles in the series, and <em>0.2 Birth By Sleep - A fragmentary passage </em>is a playable prologue for <em>III </em>that picks back up with the fan-favorite character Aqua. I’m giving you all the broad strokes because anything else might literally cause an aneurysm.<br></p><p><em>Dream Drop Distance HD </em>is also a port of a 3DS game, but at the time the handheld was being touted as being able to house console-level experiences, hence why this game was able to make the jump to other systems completely intact. And yes, <em>Dream Drop Distance </em>can be shortened to <em>3D</em>, a point that the series’ creator Tetsuya Nomura and Square Enix were <em>very </em>proud to tout. Everything is canon, everything is convoluted, and I kind of respect it.<br></p><p>I cannot tell you a damn thing about <em>χ Back Cover</em>, as that simply goes beyond my limited understanding of the series. In my defense, I was very hammered the last time anyone tried to explain the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>games to me, and while that was fun, it probably doesn’t help. What I do know though is that <em>χ Back Cover</em> is a film tied to yet another mobile game that presumably does a good job of filling players in on what that side of the story was all about, without forcing anyone to play the game.</p><p>Despite my jests, <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>is a hugely important series to a generation of folks. It’s tremendously obtuse, but it is also <em>so </em>sincere. It taught a generation of kids the power of friendship. It let Woody from <em>Toy Story</em> roast the shit out of its central villain and weaponize the power of love. The main weapon of the game is a literal giant key. And for the price of a single game, you get about two decades worth of the most heartfelt nonsense wrapped in one of the action-RPG genres’ best combat systems. Need I say anything else?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-does-concord-shutting-down-mean-for-you.971052/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-concord-shutting-down-mean-for-you/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you haven’t heard the absolutely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mind-boggling announcement</a> from Sony, you should know that Concord is shutting down completely. They’re not just ceasing ongoing development or canceling future content, they’re going nuclear with the arena shooter. So, what does that mean for you? What does it mean for those who paid for the game?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-still-play-concord">Can You Still Play Concord?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, in canceling the game, they took down the servers altogether. You can’t join a game if you own a copy and still have it installed, and you currently cannot buy it. Sony took down the store page on Steam, and over on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, it’s listed as “Announced” with a release date of 8/23/2024. </p>



<p>In its announcement, Sony said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Concord fans — we’ve been listening closely to your feedback since the launch of Concord on PlayStation 5 and PC and want to thank everyone who has joined the journey aboard the Northstar. Your support and the passionate community that has grown around the game has meant the world to us.</p>



<p>However, while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended. Therefore, at this time, we have decided to take the game offline beginning September 6, 2024, and explore options, including those that will better reach our players.</p>



<p>While we determine the best path ahead, Concord sales will cease immediately and we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased the game for PS5 or PC. If you purchased the game for PlayStation 5 from the PlayStation Store or PlayStation Direct, a refund will be issued back to your original payment method.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While it’s fantastic to hear that those who paid for a copy will receive a full refund, it still sucks for those players who were genuinely excited about the game. While it certainly didn’t sell well, Concord was entertaining, though it didn’t break the mold. The studio was chasing a trend from years prior and was too slow to capitalize.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-concord-return">Will Concord Return?</h2>



<p>It’s certainly possible that Sony will decide to bring Concord back online with a total revamp and a better roadmap. If they do, I suspect it’ll launch as a free-to-play game instead of a paid title. Based on the wording in the announcement, Sony wishes to “explore options” to determine how best to move forward with the project. After all, it spent years in development.</p>



<hr>



<p>According to analysts, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-sales-25000-analysts-estimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord only sold approximately 25,000 copies</a>, which makes it a failure on all accounts. We’re all curious to see how Sony will proceed with this one.</p>

Those who purchased on Steam and the Epic Games Store will be refunded in the coming days.</p><p>Physical refunds are a tad trickier but players can check with individual retailers to obtain a refund. Sony will presumably organise a system with them itself that allows all refunds to be processed fully. "Once refunded, players will no longer have access to the game," Sony made clear.</p><h2>Concord pulled less than two weeks after launch</h2><p>Concord arrived August 23, 2024, meaning it has been removed from sale just 11 days after launch and taken offline for all players a mere two weeks after. Even those who bought Concord will no longer be able to play after September 6.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p>Its launch was nothing short of disastrous, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">analysts telling IGN it has likely sold as few as 25,000 units</a>. It debuted to a tragic 697 peak concurrent players on Steam, a number that made the 12,786 players of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue">was dubbed a disappointment by Warner Bros.

                <p>The Tony Hawk Pro Skater social media accounts have gotten a refresh for the franchise's 25th anniversary and fans are now ablaze with speculation.</p><p>No official news of any kind has been released, but Tony Hawk Pro Skater accounts on X/Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook all got a facelift with a 25th anniversary logo (Thanks <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-pro-skater-fans-are-excited-after-this-social-media-refresh" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>). All the images have a 2024 copyright water mark, which suggest Activision has renewed the franchise's copyright. The update has fans wondering if a Pro Skater 3 and 4 remaster is on the horizon.</p><p>The most recent game in the franchise was Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, which released back in September 2020. It remade the original two games adding a robust create-a-park feature, online multiplayer, and several new skaters. Vicarious Visions developed the remake, but became <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vicarious-visions-is-no-more-as-merger-with-blizzard-is-now-official/1100-6502400/" data-ref-id="1100-6502400">Blizzard Albany shortly after release</a> upon merging with the World of Warcraft and Overwatch developer.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-shutting-down-sony-offering-full-refunds.970992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that live-service hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down effective Friday, and that all players who have purchased the game will be entitled to refunds.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Sony says that it's been "listening closely" to&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>feedback. The studio says that while many of&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s qualities "resonated" with its player base, "other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn't land the way we'd intended".</p>
<p>For that reason, Sony says it's taking&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>offline on September 6th, which is this Friday. The company says that it will "explore options, including those that will better reach our players".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/concord-shutting-down-combat.jpg?itok=eZnIGRb0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/concord-shutting-down-combat.jpg?itok=3u7WxvAI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Concord&nbsp;</em>will be no more beginning this Friday.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to taking the game's servers offline, Sony says it'll be offering "a full refund for all gamers who have purchased the game for PS5 or PC". That's everyone who bought it, since&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>isn't available on any other platforms.</p>
<p>If you bought it either from the PlayStation Store or from PlayStation Direct, you'll be issued a refund "back to your original payment method".</p>
<p>Things are a little different if you purchased <em>Concord&nbsp;</em>from other platforms. Steam players will be issued a refund "over the coming days", as will the Epic Games Store. Physical retailers, meanwhile, will have their own refund processes to which you should refer if you bought the game from them.</p>
<p>Once you've received your refund, you won't have access to&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>anymore, which suggests that Sony isn't just going to be taking this one offline for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Sony taking&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>offline is a stunning blow to a game that was supposed to be one of the cornerstones of the studio's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-comments">live-service approach</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, Sony revealed that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-revised-its-live-service-ganes-plans-with-only-6-games-coming-by-fy-2025">release just six</a> of its previously-planned twelve live-service games before the end of the 2025 fiscal year, and since&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>is presumably one of those six games, its failure should probably cause Sony execs to do some serious soul-searching.</p>
<p>It's remarkable that Sony is choosing to take&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>offline less than two weeks after its launch, but given that the game attracted <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">just shy of 700 concurrent players</a> at its peak (on Steam, that is), it's a decision that makes some sense. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>
