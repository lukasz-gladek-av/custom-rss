The writer also talked about why he believes Borderlands 4 represents the "Simpsons era" for the team.</p><p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/gearbox-talks-borderlands-4-exploration-fixing-the-meme-humor-and-entering-the-series-simpsons-era/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to VGC</a>, Clark said Gearbox was "of course" aware of the feedback from Borderlands 3 regarding its jokes and general tone. "We took all the valid criticism on board. We're creating an entirely new world, and we want to have a tone that fits the new planet we're on."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official New Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Borderlands 3's world of Pandora was like "the Wild West," but the planet of Kairos for Borderlands 4 is a "totalitarian world." As such, "Having everybody making jokes every minute wouldn't totally feel right," Clark said. This follows on from the game's narrative director saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-narrative-director-doesnt-want-skibidi-or-hawk-tuah-jokes-in-game/1100-6528514/" data-ref-id="1100-6528514">fans should not expect Skibidi toilet or Hawk Tuah jokes in Borderlands 4.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, senior project producer Anthony Nicholson told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/" data-ref-id="1100-6532503">GameSpot </a>that Gearbox is "really proud" of its past titles and the jokes and general humor in them. However, Nicholson said the world is different today, in 2025, and while Borderlands 4 aims to be "very humorous," the humor is trying to be more grounded.</p><p>"We now make sure that the Vault Hunters themselves are the ones who are driving [the jokes] and they're the ones who are being [funny]. So when we say [Borderlands 4] has grounded humor, we mean it's more situational comedy between [the Vault Hunters] as opposed to pulling things out from the real world and things like that [like the series used to]," Nicholson explained.</p><h2><strong>Simpsons era</strong></h2><p>Clark went on to say that Gearbox is entering its "Simpsons era" with Borderlands 4, in that the studio has written so much material over the years that it's a big job to try to find new storytelling.</p><p>"We're in the writers' room, and somebody will have an idea on how to finish a mission, and someone will be like, 'We did that in Borderlands,'" he said. "We're always trying not to repeat ourselves; that's why our villains are so different. We're always trying to keep it fresh."</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 launch lined up for sometime later. The game's standard edition costs $70, not $80--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-is-happy-the-game-is-not-80-and-has-no-paid-early-access/1100-6532526/" data-ref-id="1100-6532526">this makes Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford very happy.</a></p>

                <p>Nintendo has released the first major post-launch patch for its Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a>. Patch Ver. 1.1.1 is primarily focused on bug fixes, rather than adding any substantial new content.</p><p>Like most first-party Nintendo titles, Mario Kart World felt very refined and polished at release, with GameSpot calling it a "massive, sprawling sequel that playfully expands and iterates on the qualities that made Mario Kart 8 Deluxe such an enduring success," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/" data-ref-id="1900-6418371">in our review</a>. Still, some bugs still slipped through the cracks, like ones that occasionally prevented items from being used, crashed the game after watching a replay or doing an Online Play race, or couldn't properly control your character in Free Roam. You can check out the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list of patch notes</a> below:</p><h2>Fixed Issues</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue where items were no longer able to be used.</li><li>Fixed an issue where sometimes controls were inoperable when selecting a character and trying to start Free Roam from the “Free Roam” map.</li><li>Fixed an issue where sometimes the game shut down when watching replay after a race.</li><li>Fixed an issue where sometimes the game shut down after a race in “Online Play.”</li><li>Fixed an issue where rate fluctuations were sometimes displayed incorrectly in “Knockout Tour” and “Online Play.”</li><li>Fixed an issue where it was easy for a communication error to occur when trying to join Friends playing “VS Race” or “Battle” in “Online Play.”</li><li>Fixed an issue where you sometimes slipped through the wall before the finish line of “DK Spaceport.”</li><li>Fixed an issue where you sometimes couldn’t return to correct position after falling of the course between “Airship Fortress” and “Bowser’s Castle” while gliding.</li></ul><p>If you were hoping that Ver. 1.1.1 of Mario Kart World would add some new content to Free Roam or any of the other modes, you're out of luck. At this time, Nintendo has not revealed any post-launch update plans for Mario Kart World outside of these bug-fixing patches.</p><p>This update is out now and should automatically download. If it doesn't, make sure you're connected to the internet and press the + or - button on your controller over Mario Kart World's game icon. From there, navigate to the Software Update sub-menu and choose to update "Via the Internet."</p><p>Mario Kart World is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2. There's a lot to discover in the game, including the iconic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-decades-old-nintendo-easter-egg-has-surfaced-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6532489/" data-ref-id="1100-6532489">Totaka's Song easter egg</a> common in Nintendo games and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-harkens-back-to-super-mario-64-for-unlocking-free-roam-mirror-mode/1100-6532313/" data-ref-id="1100-6532313">Mirror Mode</a> that flips the entirety of the Free Roam open world.  </p>

It's a fairly small update, mainly consisting of bug fixes for combat and boss fights, along with one balance adjustment that increases the chance of obtaining weapons with the Madness status ailment.</p>

But it begs the question: How have fluctuating trade relationships impacted the company’s U.S. rollout? And what challenges might it face in the future?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A controlled launch">A controlled launch</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/switch-2-screen-punctures-raise-questions-over-hardware-packaging">a few non-tariff related hiccups</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the initial rollout of the Switch 2 has been successful, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/switch-2-tops-3-5-million-sales-in-four-days-to-deliver-nintendo-s-biggest-console-launch">selling more than 3.5 million units</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> its first four days on the market, according to Nintendo.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many consoles were secured via pre-order, despite Nintendo </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/u-s-tariff-pause-could-give-nintendo-time-to-amass-a-switch-2-stockpile">initially delaying</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> them in response to the new tariffs unveiled by the Trump administration in early April. The pause — which the company lifted April 24 — was a short-term play, however.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Just pausing pre-orders, but not doing anything else, just buys you time to observe,” said Joseph Fitzgerald, managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although Nintendo went full steam ahead with its plans following the pre-order pause, many consumer goods companies have been taking more long-term wait-and-see approaches to tariffs, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/prologis-warehouse-outlook-tariffs/745829/">some stockpiling inventory</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to delay more drastic actions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s unclear how Nintendo handled the initial tariff shock beyond the pause, as the company did not respond to a request for comment. However, according to Sally Peng, senior managing director and leader of export controls, sanctions and trade for the Asia-Pacific region at FTI Consulting, it may have built up a certain amount of Switch 2 inventory ahead of launch to ensure it could meet the initial rush.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Strategizing for the long term">Strategizing for the long term</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is no quick fix to stave off the impact of tariffs for consumer electronics makers like Nintendo, however.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just moving a single company’s production operation would be challenging enough, according to Fitzgerald. It takes roughly nine to 12 months to move production to different geographies, he said, and that’s just the start. Companies often want to be using a facility for five to 10 years to be confident it can meet demand and quality standards sufficiently for a device like the Switch 2, he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the level of complexity required to shift production, consumer electronics makers in North America are putting a lot of “calories” into rebalancing, Fitzgerald added. Locations that are receiving the most attention include Latin America, eastern Europe and countries in Southeast Asia beyond China.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moving production to the U.S. is another option, but complications remain even if a company like Nintendo were to invest in such a move.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“You end up having to have this discussion around, hey, can you also mirror our supply chain in this location, or are you going to continue to provide from an outside the United States location, and what is our cost difference?” Fitzgerald said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Relocating a company’s own production footprint is challenging enough. But game console makers rely on thousands of components and coordinate with large partner ecosystems to make devices that can be sold at consumer-friendly prices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“That Tier 2, Tier 3 alignment in these locations is really the biggest thing that’s under threat when you’re kind of vacillating in policy,” Fitzgerald said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The total supply chain costs of different tariff strategies will determine which long-term gambits electronics manufacturers make in response to a shifting global trade environment. These line items include procurement, logistics and labor costs, among others.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“So, if we look at all these three costs together and together as a landed cost, it’ll be much healthier to make your decision in times of uncertainty, which is kind of the understatement of the year,” FTI’s Peng said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is some precedent for successfully completing this type of supply chain retooling, according to Peng, who highlighted apparel and footwear as a sector that is ahead of many other industries in this regard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Very many years ago, they already figured out that other than labor costs, duty costs or tariff costs are a big part of their total cost,” Peng said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The real challenge comes next">The real challenge comes next</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although Nintendo weathered the tariff onslaught during the Switch 2’s launch, the real test for the console’s first year lies in the months ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like other consumer goods makers, Nintendo will need to bring in orders during the summer’s peak shipping season to prepare for holiday demand. Due to the current trade environment, that will mean either rush ordering to take advantage of the Trump administration’s current tariff reprieve or eating higher shipping costs when and if currently paused tariffs go back into place.</span></p><p>Image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The holiday season drives hardware and software sales for the video game industry. Sales in the fiscal quarter ending Dec. 31 accounted for 37% of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240206e.pdf">Nintendo’s global sales in 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, per Supply Chain Dive calculations. Roughly 60% of U.S. revenue for the company, which does not publicly report regional earnings, comes from sales at the end of the year, former Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/reggie-fils-aime-nintendo-makes-60-of-u-s-revenue-during-holiday-season">said in 2018</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo is expecting</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-expects-the-switch-2-to-sell-15-million-units-in-nine-months"> to sell 15 million units</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of the Switch 2 globally over the next eight months. But to reach that mark, it must contend with a potential return of the Trump administration’s country-specific reciprocal tariffs next month to meet its U.S. sales forecast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tariffs on imports from China have been lowered until mid-August while other country-specific duties are paused until early July. Even with the reprieve window, which has led to a pickup in shipments, imports are expected to drop 6.2% year over year in June and 8.1% YoY in July, per </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/import-cargo-levels-expected-to-see-surge-during-pause-in-tariff-increases">the National Retail Federation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with even more drastic reductions expected for the rest of the year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Reducing shipments due to higher tariffs or slower demand won’t create a silver lining of saved costs for Nintendo, though, according to Peng. New console rollouts are planned so far in advance that the company likely already has the material to produce more consoles, Peng said. Meanwhile, production in China and other countries in Southeast Asia targeted by Trump’s tariffs has slowed down in the first half of 2025, she added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“So, we’re not just talking about finished goods not being able to ship. They already sunk a lot of costs into preparing the material or securing the material,” Peng said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given the tariff-driven uncertainty, Nintendo and other consumer electronics makers are being forced to make atypical decisions during this time of year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“How aggressive do I go in terms of chasing those back orders? And do I only plan to fulfill supply for, say, 30 days at a time, which inherently limits my max capacity that I can fulfill,” Fitzgerald said. “So any launch, I would assume, has a longer backlog fulfillment period because companies are going to inch along in that fulfillment process due to uncertainty.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The potential Nintendo advantage">The potential Nintendo advantage</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo has remained confident in its ability to meet demand in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-doesn-t-expect-production-issues-to-impact-switch-successor">face of production challenges</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, even as tariffs continue to rankle supply chains. While not immune to duties given its production footprint in Vietnam and China, as well as being a Japan-based company, Nintendo holds a unique position in the video game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since Nintendo’s success with the Wii console, first introduced in 2006, the company has broken away from its major competitors (Microsoft and PlayStation) with a distinct development strategy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the last two decades, Nintendo deprioritized processing speeds and graphical fidelity for unique hardware mechanics such as motion controls and portability. This approach is part of a more family-focused product strategy for Nintendo. In contrast, Microsoft and Sony continue to primarily target the 18-34 demographic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because of its strategy — and its video game consoles generally— there is a built-in demand protection, even if tariffs fuel higher prices. Nintendo has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-maintains-nintendo-switch-2-pricing-retail-pre-orders-to-begin-april-24-in-u-s/">committed to its initially announced price of $449</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for the Switch 2, but it said console accessories will experience price adjustments due to “changes in market conditions.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Video games are unique because there’s only one of that platform, right? And you’re not really competing [with other businesses],” Fitzgerald said. “They’re a category of one unto themselves.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is especially true for Nintendo, whose best-selling first-party games are exclusive to its console. Sony and Microsoft, meanwhile, have released first-party titles on other platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, because Nintendo’s console release cadence is not on the same cycle as Xbox and Playstation, which often launch new generations at the same time. Therefore, it can stand alone among the big three console makers this year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Supply Chain Dive are sibling organizations under Informa TechTarget.</span></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Most surprisingly, though, Nintendo Switch 2 owners with Donkey Kong Bananza can use GameShare to let a Switch 1 player join their game and play as Donkey Kong's companion, Pauline. This means that technically, a Switch player who maybe hasn't upgraded to Nintendo's latest console can still check out the game.&nbsp;</p><p>During the Donkey Kong Bananza Direct, Nintendo revealed that you can share a second Joy-Con 2 controller, or a second set entirely, to let another player control Pauline separately from Donkey Kong. They can unleash Vocal Blasts using the Joy-Con 2 Mouse controls. And, with GameShare, you only need one copy of the game to participate in the co-op action because you can share Donkey Kong Bananza with another Switch 2 owner. This can be done locally, even to a Switch 1 player, or via an online connection to another Switch 2 owner using GameShare via GameChat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>GameShare is already a nice consumer-friendly feature, and something we're glad has returned from the DS era in the Switch 2 generation. But the fact that it can be used to play alongside someone on Switch 1 is impressive (especially as people are still in the process of tracking down a Switch 2 to upgrade to Nintendo's latest console).&nbsp;</p><p>This section of today's Direct was quick, so there are likely some details still to learn about how this GameShare feature works specifically with Donkey Kong Bananza.

After all, if you're playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> right now, you <em>know</em> Nintendo is going all-in on its musical history right now (it has always, but right now, we're eating). We heard many a classic DK track during the Direct, but one in particular stood out to us.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, it's the DK Rap folks. Originally composed by Rare's Grant Kirkhope for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, it's made numerous appearances throughout Donkey Kong's life, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a> and beyond, and it's back once again in Bananza.</p><p><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEee42ub-Hw">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You'll hear it at around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/YVUidGTR8xg?si=LBDQwDyQDU_qSMR2&amp;t=780">13 minutes in</a>, when the Direct is covering the music player. The beat is unmistakable, but if you're still unsure, you'll here that classic "D.K. Donkey. Kong" shortly after.</p>
<p>Interestingly, on the music player, the song <em>might</em> be titled 'Getaway', so it may be a remix of some kind, and we've just heard a little snippet? It could also just be a totally different track, and the DK Rap is playing on top. We'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>While we've heard a few original songs, including that lovely new vocal theme, and some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a> arrangements, but we can't wait to see what else we'll hear in game.</p>
<p>While Bananza seems to be stuffed full of homages, there's tons of new stuff to be excited about, too, including a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-gets-a-new-amiibo-nintendo-details-how-they-work-in-dk-bananza">new amiibo</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-features-two-player-co-op-and-you-can-even-gameshare-to-switch-1">co-op (with GameShare)</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/check-out-donkey-kong-bananzas-all-new-kong-cast-members-and-animal-transformations">some new Kongs</a>, and transformations.</p>

<figure><a title="DKB Direct" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d0cc56d142177/dkb-direct.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, well, well. We're just fresh from taking in everything that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/watch-donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-live">Nintendo's <strong>Donkey Kong Bananza</strong> Direct</a> has shown us about the incoming Switch 2 game, and there's quite a lot of very exciting things to discuss!</p>
<p>Amongst these are the game's all-new Kong cast members alongside Donkey Kong's brand new 'Bananza Transformation' abilities. As shown in the action-packed 15-minute Direct (which has now got us properly buzzing for a game some of us weren't 100% sold on), this new iteration of DK has a bevvy of smart tricks and evil faces up its furry sleeves.</p>
<p>We got a look at a handful of new characters to add to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVedHG4bRSg">the burgeoning cast of Kongs</a> that've accumulated over the decades. Here it's the turn of the apparent villains of the piece, 'Void Company'. These three brand new characters are <strong>Void Kong</strong>, the leader guy, <strong>Grumpy Kong</strong>, who seems quite angry about something, and <strong>Poppy Kong</strong>, who likes to stretch.</p>


<p>According to the Direct, these villains are blocking up the sinkholes that Donkey Kong and his sidekick, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/say-hello-to-pauline-in-donkey-kong-bananza">Pauline</a>, need to use to travel down through the worlds that make up the game's amazing-looking levels. We are, after all, on an adventure right to the earth's core, and so the miasma being inflicted by sinkholes must be cleared by our heroes. Sounds like a job for a big, smashy ape and a singer, alright.</p>

<p>Also shown off were Donkey Kong's all-new 'Bananza' transformational abilities. We are loving the look of these and the fact they can be switched between freely when you've got them activated (by collecting up golden coins). It seems as though this game is going to go large on letting players mess around, experiment, and break things as they see fit.</p>
<p>The gameplay introduced three transformations, each one based on one of the game's 'Elder Kongs' (that's boss dudes to you and us). So, we've got <strong>Ostrich Bananza</strong>, a flying transformation that allows you to drop egg bombs on foes. Then we have <strong>Zebra Bananza</strong>, a speeding variant of DK which can blast across fragile surfaces. And finally <strong>Kong Bananza</strong>, which is a souped-up version of DK that can do even more damage than normal.</p>


<p>Bananza transformations work on a timer, so you can't run wild as you'd like, but we sure do like the look of how crazy this new adventure seems to let players get. And we already can't wait to use DK's new swing ability to leather Void Company around the chops with a big old chunk of concrete. In a non-violent way, you understand.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-reveals-pauline-is-dk%E2%80%99s-companion-throughout-the-game-new-gameplay-details.1222008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-pauline-gameplay-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo kicked off today with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg&amp;t=2221s">Donkey Kong Bananza Direct</a> presentation, which showcased a bunch of new gameplay details about the upcoming adventure, but perhaps most importantly, revealed that the Odd Rock character we met when the game was first revealed back in April, isn't a rock at all - it's Pauline.</p>
<p>It's not the Pauline we know from Super Mario Odyssey, though—it's Pauline as a young child, with dreams of becoming a singer. Before that can happen, however, she needs to make it back to the surface. Stopping Void Kong and his crew from reaching the planet's core and getting Pauline back to the surface seems to be the driving narrative force in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Direct 6.18.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVUidGTR8xg?start=2221&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The direct showcased how Pauline and DK will work together, with DK using his strength to pound, grab, smash, and throw nearly everything around him, using the game's environmental destruction core gameplay concept to carve new paths, and create new paths by reassembling bits of the environment in some cases.</p>
<p>While Pauline uses her voice to manipulate the environment to solve puzzles, and with the help of Giant Elders teaching Pauline and DK their Bananza-powers, Pauline can transform DK into three new forms. The first transformation is Kong Bananza, which makes DK a bigger, stronger gorilla, capable of smashing parts of the world that normal-sized DK can't, and if you can believe it, causing even more chaos.</p>
<p>The other two transformations are Zebra and Ostrich Bananza. When DK transforms into his Zebra form, he's much faster, can run along water, and run across platforms that would otherwise crumble under normal DK, who wouldn't be fast enough to make it across without falling.</p>
<p>Ostrich Bananza gives DK the ability to fly, reaching heights DK otherwise wouldn't be able to reach, and drop egg bombs on enemies as you take to the skies.&nbsp;You can swap between each transformation, and activate them whenever you like, so long as you have a full Bananergy-meter, an energy meter you fill by collecting gold.</p>

</figure>


<p>We also got a look at a few of the collectibles players will search for, like Banandium Gems, which can also be collected in smaller Banandium Chips form. There's also gold, collectible fossils, and challenge courses to find to earn more Banandium Gems, which can in turn become skill points, which was another major gameplay reveal.</p>
<p>DK has plenty of abilities players can take advantage of, whether that's smashing the environment, using chunks of the world to surf along the ground or on water, or double-jump, and they can all be upgraded through earning and spending skill points.</p>
<p>Pauline is also a playable character in Donkey Kong Bananza's two-player co-op mode, though it doesn't look like she's capable of getting off DK's back. All she can do is send vocal blasts out to various parts of the environment, helping DK out in puzzle solving and combat.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza also supports game share with other Nintendo Switch devices, which means that you can play the co-op mode with a friend, even if that person doesn't have their own copy of Donkey Kong Bananza. Game share works with Switch 2 devices locally or over online play, though it seems to only work with Switch 1 consoles through local game sharing.</p>
<p>The full direct was nearly 18 minutes, and in that time Nintendo showed off a lot about Donkey Kong Bananza, including plenty more depth than the game's first previews showcased.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Nathan Birch previewed the game</a>, he wrote, "<em>I spent most of my time with Donkey Kong Bananza thinking about the possibilities presented by its mechanics. The tools are certainly there for puzzles that would require you to, say, mould the terrain in specific ways using your fists, explosives, and other tools to reach a goal. There’s a lot of potential here, and it seems likely the demo I played only showed a portion of DK’s full bunch of abilities.</em>"</p>
<p>This direct made it clear that there's plenty of potential in DK's abilities, and it'll be interesting to see in the full game how far Nintendo takes them all. In the meantime, we await that full release on July 17, 2025.</p>

I have learned, in preparation for this article, that this arcade classic had a different name in the U.S. “<em>Speed Buggy.”</em> Pah-tooie. Ew. No. It’s <em>Buggy Boy</em>, and it was—until 2025—the only racing game that recognized the vital importance of driving a car on two wheels. Now that <em>Mario Kart World</em> has revived this core conceit, it’s time to give Tatsumi Electronics’ all-time classic the recognition it deserves.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196646,196452" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Honestly, what is it with you Americans and your determination to choose a completely rubbish version of something the rest of the world does differently? The imperial system? Fahrenheit? Putting your dates in an entirely random order? And <em>Speed Buggy</em>?! No. It was <em>Bagī Bōi </em>(バギーボーイ) in Japan, and that just flat-out translates to <em>Buggy Boy</em>. <em>Speed Buggy</em> was a 1973 crossover cartoon with <em>Josie and the Pussycats </em>for Hanna-Barbera. The matter is resolved. I accept your apology.</p><p><em>Buggy Boy</em> was first released as an arcade game in Japan in 1985, including in a cockpit cabinet with a three-screen display. Come 1987 it was ported across to the Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC, before being realized in its perfect version in 1988 for the ZX Spectrum, Amiga and Atari ST. It was then that a 10-year-old John Walker played that game until the digital tyres (yes, <em>tyres</em>—“tires” means to get sleepy) wore thin. </p><p>Because my dad was flawed, we had an Atari ST instead of an Amiga, and as such were left with all the crappy gaming magazines and the desperate, unconvincing cry of “But it’s used by professional music producers!” But at least I also had <em>Buggy Boy</em>, the first game to understand that all vehicular racing is improved when tipped on one side.</p><p><em>Buggy Boy</em> was, as you might suspect from the year it was released, a relatively simple racing game—relative to today. At the time, it was positively intricate, primarily because of the clutter on the roads. Rather than your generic racetrack of games like <em>Pole Position</em>, empty save for the presence of other cars, on the mean non-streets of <em>BB</em> you were faced with all manner of obstacles, from logs and rocks to barriers and piles of bricks. At the same time, the five different tracks were covered in flags to drive into and banners to drive under, to score extra points, and—most importantly—means by which you could cause your car to both jump <em>and</em> flip up on its side onto two wheels.</p><p>It’s so important to remember that this is a full seven years before <em>Super Mario Kart</em> would appear on SNES, and while <em>Buggy Boy</em> was a single-player game with a single car on the tracks, I find it impossible not to trace a lineage. The madcap nature of <em>Mario</em>’s courses, while certainly born of <em>F-Zero</em>, still feel somewhat inspired by <em>Buggy Boy</em> to me. And yet I never hear a soul mention this game, ever.</p><p>Just the ability to jump, I think, marks out <em>BB</em> as special. Cars—and stay with me here—cannot jump. They can be <em>launched</em>, certainly, but their ability to hop up into the air by means of driving over a log has yet to be recorded in nature. It’s a gloriously silly feature that too many racing games would have eschewed, in favor of “realism.” But nothing was better than when you drove over a slanty small rock in the road and tipped up on two wheels.</p><figure id="" data-id="ab5ccfb55879f493166e85b71a26e05f" data-recommend-id="image://ab5ccfb55879f493166e85b71a26e05f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1065" data-height="757" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The buggy on two wheels in front of piles of bricks?

It had that <em>Mario Kart</em>-like map to keep you focused, and have I mentioned how much I love going up on two wheels?</p><p><em>Buggy Boy </em>has never received the love and recognition it deserves. Where are the modern remakes? The arcade classic celebrations? The misguided attempt to reboot the franchise as a first-person shooter? Let this be the game’s clarion call.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza is the next big Switch 2 game, landing firmly within "launch window" status next month. Nintendo took the wraps off DKB with a rapid-fire presentation detailing its story, features, Amiibo support, and more, and altogether it looks like a dang hoot. Donkey Kong can go Super Saiyajin or turn into a zebra, there's a cabal of evil capitalist Kongs, he collects <em>Bananergy</em>. High marks across the board. The story elements, though, appear to raise some pretty serious questions about our understanding of Donkey Kong lore. That's right, I said "Donkey Kong lore" with a straight face. Buckle up, kids.</p><p dir="ltr">The Donkey Kong Bananza presentation opened with introducing young Pauline, a budding singer who we know from Super Mario Odyssey would go on to be mayor of New Donk City. In this game she looks no more than 10 years old or so and hangs off DK's back as a companion character. Pauline has a dream, and DK is being exploited by his capitalist overlords, so together they head toward the planet core to make a wish. All completely normal so far.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, the presence of a young Pauline implies that this is a prequel of sorts. DK has been rehabilitated from his villainous persona in the original Donkey Kong for years, but buddying up with Pauline as a little girl suggests that there was more to the story than we knew. As of the time when DK grabbed her and carried her to the top of a tower and forced Jump Man (aka Mario) to rescue her, they had a history. They were old friends! The mind reels.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517074" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517074"></a><figcaption>In Soviet Russia, monkey has person on his back!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">But then, the Bananza presentation threw another curveball by revealing that you can meet Cranky Kong. Now wait just a damn minute. What the hell is going on here?</p><p dir="ltr">As DK enthusiasts may recall, Cranky Kong is canonically the <em>original</em> Donkey Kong: The DK we've been playing throughout the Donkey Kong Country games, the one who is pals with Diddy Kong and the rest, is actually his more charismatic grandson. It was Cranky Kong who grabbed Pauline and climbed the tower and squared off against Jump Man.</p><p dir="ltr">So you may start to see the problem here. If old Cranky Kong is in this game, Pauline should be an adult. If Pauline is a kid, then Donkey Kong should be a slightly younger Cranky Kong who, 10 or so years in the future, will grab her and climb a bunch of girders. Having a fully-aged Cranky Kong and a young girl Pauline appear in the same game makes <em>absolutely no sense</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">There are ways to make it work. Donkey Kong Bananza could imply some kind of time-travel element in which Cranky Kong was sucked back into the past to meet his younger self. That possibility seems bananas, but frankly no more so than anything else we've seen from this game.</p><p dir="ltr">The more likely possibility in my mind, though, is that this version of Donkey Kong, Pauline, and Cranky Kong are entirely separate and distinct from the precious original continuity. Donkey Kong Bananza appears to be a sort of DK reboot, remixing familiar elements into a new continuity that is not bound by any of the storytelling conventions of the original. In other words: We've entered the DK multiverse.</p><p dir="ltr">Or maybe Nintendo is just making it up as they go. I may be overthinking this.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong makes the discovery of the century on Ingot Isle in the form of special golden bananas, but just <span>as he's about to enjoy all that potassium, a sudden tempest over the island sends him deep into the underground. Here, through extraordinary circumstances, he teams up with Odd Rock, who we learn is actually Pauline, a character whose lineage goes way back to Donkey Kong's beginnings. The duo learns that if they reach the planet's core, they will be granted a wish: Pauline wants to become a singer, and Donkey Kong wants to enjoy the golden bananas. So the two set off into the underground core.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Nintendo says each layer of the underground presents a new biome and unique scenery to enjoy, and if today's Direct is any indication, we can expect lava stages, ice ones, tropical levels, and more. As the two venture through layers of the planet, they discover Banandium Gems, which are golden bananas you'll find throughout the game. Some are simply visible and easy to collect; others are buried in walls, the ground, and elsewhere, and Donkey Kong will have to use his various moves to collect them. You can even receive them as rewards for completing Ancient Ruin challenges, which include time-limited battles, obstacle courses, side-scrolling stages, and more.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And speaking of moves, Donkey Kong has all kinds of tools in his arsenal in Donkey Kong Bananza.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Donkey Kong and Pauline's Moveset</span></h3><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/false"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/false" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><span>He can punch and smash through enemies, the ground, and most things he can get his hands on with incredible force. This destruction can lead to special discoveries or set off chain reactions that can drastically change the scenery around you.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Dive Punch lets Donkey Kong smash deep into the ground, while Roll Forward lets him roll at high speeds, which can be combined with jumps and punches, to extend traversal mechanics. With Hand Slap, Donkey Kong can collect nearby items and discover hidden ones using Sonar. Tear Off lets Donkey Kong grab a chunk of terrain and, well, tear it off. He can then throw this chunk at enemies or the environment to discover new pathways. Tearing turnips out of the ground will also lead to finding new items. Chunk Jump can be used to double jump and reach new heights. It's clear there's a lot of discoverability and exploration tied to chaining together Donkey Kong's various moves, and I'm excited to see what kind of tech players make of this.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If you throw chunks of softer material, you can stick them to surfaces and pile them up, helping you reach new heights and secret areas. And finally, Donkey Kong's Turf Surf lets you slide through levels on chunks of terrain, carving out new paths and taking out enemies along the way. Pauline has her own powers, too, including Make Music; with this, Pauline can show you the way forward and remove strange seals left behind by the evil Void Company.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Collectibles</span></h3>

<p><span>&nbsp;As you work through the environment, you'll discover not only Banandium Gems, which lead to Skill Points that you can use for different upgrades like better sonar and stronger punches, but Banandium Chips, too. These banana slices can be traded for Banandium Gems at the Chip Exchange. You can exchange the Gold you find in your adventures at the Stuff Shop for useful items, and you can trade Fossils at local style shops for additional outfits and more for Donkey Kong and Pauline. Both Donkey and Pauline can be customized with different outfits, and you can even change the color of Donkey Kong's fur.&nbsp;</span></p><p>You can find additional Banandium Gems and Fossils by opening up Treasure Chests, which contain Treasure Maps that lead to these collectibles and more. Today's Direct revealed that the game tracks which Fossils and Banandium Gems you've collected, too, making it easy to stay on top of what you need to do if you're looking to find everything.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bananza Forms and The Void Company</h3>

<p>Donkey Kong will get help from the DK family, including Cranky Kong and his rhino companion, Rambi, and the Giant Elders that call the subterranean home. These Elders possess ancient powers that Pauline can help Donkey Kong utilize. If you collect enough gold, your Bananergy meter will fill up, and once it's full, you can transform into different Bananza forms, including the massive gorilla Kong Bananza, the speedy Zebra Bananza, and the flying Ostrich Bananza form. There's likely even more forms waiting in the full game. These forms have limited use, and you'll need to fill up your Bananergy meter to use them again. However, you can swap forms on the fly.&nbsp;</p><p>These Bananza forms will be essential to taking down the Void Company, "the mightiest mining operation both above ground and below," according to Nintendo. Grumpy Kong creates gigantic corporate soldiers, while Poppy Kong is responsible for subterranean information <span>gathering. Void Kong is in charge of both of them and the entire company, and this company is behind the banana-stealing maelstrom threatening Ingot Isle. The company has blocked off routes to the lower layers to stop anyone wishing to thwart their plans to reach the core and receive a wish. Donkey Kong and his pals will face off against massive enemies guarding these sealed routes, and you'll need to utilize Donkey Kong's entire arsenal of moves to defeat them.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Getting Around</span></h3>

<p><span>As you progress through Ingot Isle's underground, you might want to double back for collectibles and more. Subterranean Eels (Eelevators) can be used to fast travel between different layers, and they can also "Teeleport" you to different areas within a single layer, too. When you need a break from the action, find a bed for a quick (and sleepy) getaway. Here, you can listen to new and classic tunes via the Music Player, and as you progress through the game and defeat enemies, you'll earn more music discs for this player.&nbsp;</span></p><p>You can capture memories from your adventure with<span> Donkey Kong Bananza's robust Camera Mode, too, which includes different angles, filters, and more.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Co-Op and More</span></h3>

<p><span>If you're looking for some co-op fun, Donkey Kong Bananza includes plenty of ways to do that. You can share a second Joy-Con 2 controller, or a second set entirely, to let another person control Pauline separately from Donkey Kong. They can unleash Vocal Blasts using the Joy-Con 2 Mouse Controls. And with GameShare, you only need one copy of the game because you can share the game to another player on their Switch 2 to get them in on the action. This can be done locally, even to a Switch 1 player, or via an online connection using GameShare via GameChat.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If you need extra help in the game, the Assist Mode will automatically guide you toward the objective and halve the damage you receive.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Outside the main game, there's a mode called DK Artist, reminiscent of the Super Mario 64 title screen. Here, you can use Joy-Con 2 mouse control to rotate a sculpture of Donkey Kong, carve material out of him (or add some back on), paint it, and more. The Direct shows off unique Donkey Kong sculptures and<span> others inspired by art in the real world. You can change the lighting, too, and add special effects for a quick photo op.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Amiibo</span></h3>

<p>Mortal Kombat 1</p>

</article>
<p><em>Variety</em> states it has confirmed with Warner Bros. that there were no layoffs or executive departures as a result of the restructuring. Earlier this month, Warner Bros. Discovery <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-split-two-companies-streaming-tv-1236423250/">announced</a> it would be split into two publicly traded companies to combat declining business: WBD Global Networks and WBD Streaming &amp; Studios. The games division now sits under the latter umbrella, which is led by CEO David Zaslav. &nbsp;</p><p>This restructuring comes on the heels of what’s been a tumultuous year for Warner Bros. Games. Despite the massive success of titles like 2023’s Hogwarts Legacy, it has since endured the significant commercial failures of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/06/a-new-report-details-how-a-troubled-development-led-to-suicide-squad-kill-the">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and, to a lesser extent, MultiVersus and Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions. Mortal Kombat 1, despite <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mortal-kombat-1-sales-top-5-million-copies-as-netherrealm-keeps-trucking-forward-">selling over 5 million copies</a> since its launch last September, was also considered an underwhelming sales performer compared to previous entries. All four games launched in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Warner Bros. <a href="https://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_earnings/2025/q1/earnings-result/WBD-1Q25-Earnings-Release.pdf">Q1 2025 financial report</a> stated revenue in the games division decreased 48 percent, naming Suicide Squad's failure as one of the primary factors. Former Warner Bros. Games chief David Haddad stepped down from the company in January. A month later, in February, the publisher shut down three of its games studios: MultiVersus developer Player First Games (after <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/24/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer">acquiring it</a> less than a year prior), Middle-earth/F.E.A.R. developer Monolith Productions (resulting in the cancelation of its in-development <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2021/2021/12/09/monolith-open-world-wonder-woman-game-in-the-works">Wonder Woman game</a>), and support studio Warner Bros. Games San Diego.</p><p>As for what's next in the pipeline, Warner Bros. Games recently launched Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition and announced a mobile RPG called DC World Collide. A Switch 2 port of Hogwarts Legacy arrived on June 5. Beyond this, its future slate of titles is unclear.&nbsp;</p><p>[<em>Source: </em><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/"><em>Variety</em></a>]</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a Direct presentation, Nintendo detailed more on how the new game will play, beyond the punching and rock deformation previously shown.</p>
<p><strong>Spoilers follow</strong>, if you're looking to keep surprises to yourself.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong is joined by a little purple rock companion during Bananza, but now Nintendo has revealed this character is in fact baby Pauline.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oops-nintendo-accidentally-reveals-surprise-character-appears-in-donkey-kong-bananza">Pauline's inclusion was accidentally leaked by Nintendo</a> itself back in April, but now her role in the game has been officially unveiled.</p>
<p>Pauline is the damsel in distress in the original Donkey Kong game, meaning her inclusion here is not only a fun throwback, but means Bananza could act as something of a prequel.</p>
<p>She's more recently been seen as the mayor of New Donk City in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, singing the theme song Jump Up, Super Star! (as well as a rather <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-8-deluxes-final-wave-of-dlc-arrives-next-week">sassy inclusion as a racer in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's DLC</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-mario-kart-world-character-tier-list">more recently also in Mario Kart World</a>).</p>
<p>It's her singing ability that characterises Pauline's inclusion in Donkey Kong Bananza. By learning songs acquired from the Giant Elders (who look to be musically themed), Pauline can sing to transform Donkey Kong. These transformations include a zebra to run over water and an ostrich to fly and reach hard to reach areas, though they'll require gold to build up Bananergy.</p>
<p>The Direct also includes multiple vocal songs, presumably sung by Pauline. She can also be controlled by a second player in co-operative mode.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>DK's new antagonists | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The antagonists of the game, meanwhile, are the Void Company: Grumpy Kong, Poppy Kong, and leader Void Kong. This trio is responsible for stealing DK's bananas, beginning the game's story. Cranky Kong and his rhino Rambi will also feature.</p>
<p>As DK explores (and destroys) more of the subterranean worlds, he'll collect Banandium Gems - the big golden bananas. These are found by exploring, or by completing challenges in hidden Ruins, and are used to improve stats. The independent Ruin arenas, along with the free-form exploration, hint at an almost <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>-esque influence (though progress is more linear).</p>
<p>Other inclusions in Donkey Kong Bananza are multiple outfits for both DK and Pauline (each with benefits), fossils to collect, a music player to enjoy Pauline's singing from the soundtrack, and a photo mode.</p>
<p>And… was that the DK Rap?! <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dk-rap-composer-explains-why-nintendo-didnt-credit-him-in-the-super-mario-bros-movie">Composer Grant Kirkhope previously explained to Eurogamer why he wasn't credited for the song's inclusion in the Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, but it's inclusion in this new game is a surprise.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza will also include an Assist Mode, just like the most recent DK platformers on Switch, to make gameplay a little easier.</p>
<p>Another slightly odd addition is DK Artist mode, where players can carve Donkey Kong's face using the Switch 2's mouse mode. It reminds me of the Mario face-pulling in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, a Donkey Kong and Pauline amiibo figure is on the way to celebrate the game's release, while DK-themed amiibo support will have some fun benefits in-game.</p>
<p>"Yes, everyone might have been expecting Mario, but Bananza's brawny obliteration is far better suited to his one-time enemy," wrote former Eurogamer editor Tom Phillips during his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">hands-on preview of Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>The game will release on Switch 2 on 17th July, yet already some fans have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananzas-secret-in-game-language-has-already-been-decoded-months-before-launch">deciphered its secret language</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Nintendo revealed a whole fistful of new info about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> in a new Nintendo Direct, the 3D platformer reboot coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 17th July.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Direct 6.18.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVUidGTR8xg?start=1894&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Golden bananas are, apparently, the discovery of the century, with Ingot Island the hub for mining operations at the very start of the game. And then the baddies show up. In the resulting kerfuffle, DK teams up with Odd-Rock… except it turns out that within that rock is noneother than Pauline, whose been reimagined as a wannabe singer.</p>
<p>The solution to both their wishes and woes –&nbsp;that is wanting bananas and stardom and not having them, respectively –&nbsp;is to go deeper and deeper underground to try to reach the planet’s core. Digging down through the ground reveals a world filled with subterranean biomes layered on top of one another, all somehow still being lit by the sun. It definitely doesn’t really feel like you’re underground when DK is rampaging across a sunny beach…</p>
<p>DK can run, jump and climb up and around pretty much anything, but he can also smash, grab and bash. He can punch his way through and deform vast swathes of the world, digging through the world and wrecking stuff on the way. All of this destruction can lead to new discoveries.</p>

<p>DK has a powerful Dive Punch move to punch down through the ground, do a forward roll to move at pace, hand slap (or foot slap) to collect nearby items and reveal a sonar pulse, and tear up chunks of terrain and stuck items, and then swing it at enemies. Heck, he can even jump while holding a chunk and then use it to propel him to a double jump, or Turf Surf</p>
<p>Intriguingly there’s a toughness value for the various objects. Tougher materials can smash through lighter stuff more easily, while softer materials could be blobbed together. Of course, explosive materials will go boom and blow great big holes and craters in the world.</p>
<p>All of this also applies to the battling as well, with some enemies having tough exteriors to smash through to get to their inner forms and be defeated.</p>
<p>Pauline isn’t just along for the ride, clinging onto DK’s shoulder, and her singing can break through certain purple seals blocking progression.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of creatures of different species that you’ll meet on the way, and Cranky Kong and Rambi are knocking around in these underground layers. Each world is looked over by a Giant Elder, each of which possess a Bananza Power that Pauline can learn to sing, transforming DK into even more destructive forms, such as Kong Bananza, the speedy Zebra Bananza, and the flying Ostrich Bananza (who can also drop egg bombs from above).All of this is time limited and requires you to collect enough gold to fill up your Bananergy.</p>
<p>The Void Company is what stands in your way, with Grumpy Kong, Poppy Kong and Void Kong the evil trio who are racing you to the planet core. They’ve created a bunch of powerful foes to guard the routes down to the lower layers, which you’ll obviously need to defeat.</p>
<p>The Banandium Gems are the most prized golden banana gem collectibles, either found in the open world or earned from completing challenges that include combat challenges, side-scrolling platformer sections, and much more. These Gems can be spent to increase DK’s stats and power of his abilities, like improved sonar or new skills.</p>
<p>A 2-player co-op mode allows the second player to control Pauline in an asymmetrical co-op mode, so she can shout and blast enemies in a mode similar to Super Mario Galaxy co-op on the Wii. This all works via GameShare, as well.</p>
<p>And then there’s just a random mouse mode called DK Artist, letting you carve and paint your own sculptures.</p>
<p>It all looks significantly more ambitious and intriguing than the smaller slice of game that was on show during the April Direct and Switch 2 hands on events. We’re definitely keen to see more when the game launched next month on 17th July.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/18/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Our world is eternally on a knife’s edge, separated from demon incursion by the thinnest of membranes. If you’ve played anything remotely Persona-adjacent, you will know this well — it’s the core premise of all Megami Tensei games, and Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army is no different.</p>
<p><iframe title="Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fxVXcGlpDHs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite the name not really giving it away, this is technically a remaster of Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army. Tell me your game is Japanese without telling me it’s Japanese, in 11 words or more, if you please…</p>


<p>While SMTDSRKvtSA is technically the third game in the series, you don’t need to have played the first two, especially as this game kicks off with Raidou becoming Raidou. Once you get past the tutorial, where you learn how to swing a sword, fire a pistol and ultimately summon a demon (or a devil, as the terms are used interchangeably throughout the game for no reason whatsoever), you are bestowed the moniker Raidou Kuzunoha XIV.</p>
<p>The 14<sup>th</sup> of your name, Raidou of clan Kuzunoha is always the last line of defence, living in the shadows so that humanity can live in the light, blissfully ignorant of the horrors behind the veil. Your boss, the three-legged crow god Yatagarasu (an occasional demon you can befriend in the SMT/Persona games), tasks you with becoming a detective in the capital, Tokyo, and helping those plagued by the supernatural in the fictional year Taisho 20 (Showa 5 or 1931 in our timeline, since Emperor Taisho died in 1926).</p>


<p>It’s a really cool premise, and this is a great Atlus title if you’re in the market for something shorter than the usual 120h+ romp that is the Persona series. Fans will recognise all the usual mechanics, from demon fusion to the effective mascot Jack Frost, which are always welcome. As with the other SMT games, the ability to chat to demons is also back, with some actively giving you side missions as you go about your quest.</p>
<p>So what is that quest, exactly? You are asked by a young lady to kill her before she is abducted by some mysterious, red-cloaked demons. Instead, you set about trying to find and rescue her, as mysterious forces (and plenty of zombies) stand in your way.</p>
<p>This brings us to combat, which is always a core part of SMT-adjacent games. Along with the usual demon capture and negotiation stuff, we have a completely new take on battle.</p>

<p>Rather than the usual turn-based combat, each encounter is a real-time melee; you have up to two demons at your side, who automatically attack enemies, drawing on your MP to cast powerful spells. Your mana is constantly replenishing as you attack, meaning that you are actually more of a support character in all but the boss fights. This is where the tactics really come into it; Raidou has access to some basic elemental magic and can command his demons to perform specific actions, but having an army at your disposal with different strengths and weaknesses, and adjusting Raidou’s build to the task at hand, is vital to your success.</p>
<p>This all helps combat feel fresh and fluid, especially when you consider the regenerating MP bar is new to the remaster. Previously, you’d have to stop and rest to recover your MP, which seriously threw off the pacing. Now, you feel like an unstoppable badass, and truly worthy of a name as epic as Raido Kuzunoha XIV.</p>
<p>But for all its fluidity, combat also has a massive flaw: there is little to no point in using heavy attacks, as the light attacks are the only ones that drain MP. There is no way your heavy attack will come close to what these demons put out when they’re throwing massive fireballs across the room, and if you can have literal Thor summoning lightning bolts at an enemy that’s weak to lighting, you’re going to want to have all the MP that Thor requires, aren’t you? Trust me when I say you can get through the whole game &nbsp;without using heavy attacks.</p>

<p>So how does the rest of the game play out? I’m pleased to say, very well.</p>
<p>It’s an intriguing and morish story, backed by an excellent, funky soundtrack. It’s great fun exploring Tokyo and using your demons to solve problems, whether that’s Alp reading people’s minds and whispering in your ear or Obariyon punching a car out of the way so you can pass. The characters you meet are colourful and the world seems pretty well lived in. The story is too short to say any more than this, sadly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are also a few areas that are a little shaky — the graphics are gorgeous when in cutscenes, but far from perfect the rest of the time. The eyes are stylised, so we can overlook that, but the teeth are just jarring.</p>

<p>There’s also the curious inclusion of a poorly explained lunar system and the mahjong mini game that was cut from Western releases of SMTDSRKvtSA. The game simply assumes you know how to play mahjong and runs with it — while there are explanations if you go digging in your cat’s journal, Raidou Remastered does a poor job of explaining mahjong. As someone who has played a lot of card games over the years, and sat down watching YouTube videos on how to play mahjong, I was still left flummoxed as to how it worked in Raidou.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I have minor gripes like the game giving scant detail when you fuse or meet a new demon — all of which have real-world mythology that the kind of people who like these games like knowing about. A few times I found myself pausing the game to look up a new demon on Wikipedia because I couldn’t find the in-game bio. But all told, these aren’t things that should hold you back from playing.</p>

<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155145/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Never let it be said that Atlus is afraid of finding new ways to capitalise on its flagship <strong>Shin Megami Tensei</strong> franchise—for quite a while now, there have been significantly more spinoff ‘SMT-adjacent’ games than mainline entries. Still, that’s certainly not a bad thing, as the company has clearly come up with a lot of fun and interesting approaches to the tried and true JRPG gameplay, whether through the turn-based SRPG style of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/shin_megami_tensei_devil_survivor_overclocked">Devil Survivor</a> or the action-RPG flavour of <strong>Raidou</strong>.</p>
<p>The first Raidou game, <strong>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army</strong>, came out back in 2006 for the PS2 and was itself a spinoff of the Devil Summoner series for the Sega Saturn. Blending action-focused gameplay with an interesting 1930s-inspired alternate universe setting, it stood out to fans of the broader franchise, even if Raidou’s modest sales also ensured that it never caught on in the same way <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_3_portable">Persona</a> did.</p>
<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156936/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, Atlus is giving this lost classic another shot with a comprehensive remaster treatment for modern platforms, billed as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army</a>. Though there are some aspects of it showing their age, Atlus has overall done an excellent job of making Raidou shine in the best possible light.</p>
<p>To get one thing out of the way, Raidou Remastered really strains the definition of what a ‘remaster’ can be, in a good way. Atlus wasn’t content to just give this one a cheap resolution bump and a couple quality-of-life updates. Even though it’s clear that this was ultimately built on the bones of a PS2 game, many aspects of Raidou have been thoroughly reevaluated and redesigned to make for an overall more enjoyable and modern feeling game. Some fans of the original may baulk at changes to the combat system or demon fusion, but I think all the tweaks and additions here have sanded down most of those rougher and antiquated design elements that made the original such a product of its time.</p>
<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156951/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For its story, Raidou Remastered places you in the role of Raidou Kuzunoha XIV, a fresh teenage graduate of a mysterious organisation of Devil Summoners who live in the shadows to protect the world from supernatural danger by using their otherworldly connections. Raidou (and his talking cat companion, Gouto) is assigned to Tokyo to study and work at a detective agency while he keeps an eye on things there, and soon finds himself unravelling a broader conspiracy after working a kidnapping case in which a legion of red-uniformed soldiers spirits away a teenage girl.</p>
<p>It's a much darker narrative than you’d find in a Persona game, but not quite as dark as something from mainline SMT, and I really appreciated how downright <em>wacky</em> it gets the farther in you go. And while the overall plot feels a bit simplistic in places—character development is particularly shallow here—I felt myself drawn into its curious setting and quirky atmosphere. The newly added voice acting is a great addition here, too, giving these characters a bit more dimension and making for much more interesting cutscenes.</p>
<p>Unlike its more well-known brethren, SMT and Persona, Raidou isn’t a turn-based RPG that sees you assembling demon parties to help you safely navigate dungeons. Instead, this is more of a detective story in which you spend your time tracking down leads, collecting clues, and honing your theories, interspersed with plenty of fights with hostile demons.</p>
<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156948/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Admittedly, the detective side of the gameplay loop can feel simplistic and fetch quest-y as you mostly just run from point A to point B to progress the plot, occasionally having to find a specific NPC or interact with something in the environment to keep things moving.</p>
<p>And though mechanics like the time management and Social Link systems from Persona would’ve felt out of place in a game with a much darker tone such as this, I couldn’t help but feel there was something missing with this detective work—it certainly feels like the most outdated aspect of the loop.</p>
<p>Things get far more interesting when you find yourself in a combat encounter, and it’s here where Atlus clearly did the most work to rehab the gameplay. Raidou’s headlining gimmick is that it’s SMT with action-packed hack-‘n’-slash combat, but the combat in the original release was pretty rough around the edges due to the fixed camera view and Raidou’s clunky movements. To address this, Atlus redesigned the battle system to borrow several elements from <strong>Raidou 2</strong>'s combat, resulting in something far more satisfying and interesting to play.</p>
<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156940/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat encounters (which are no longer random) see Raidou dropped into a small arena with up to two partner demons to help him defeat foes locked in with him. These partner demons will each independently fight and use skills, which draw resources from a MAG (MP) shared pool. MAG is topped up primarily by Raidou, who can combo enemies with light attacks that replenish some MAG and heavy attacks that dish out a lot more damage. Raidou himself can also use cooldown magic skills to exploit elemental weaknesses and keep the team in fighting shape.</p>
<p>Though the Press Turn system doesn’t feature here, exploiting enemy weaknesses is still critically important. Not only will doing so place enemies into a brief stun state, but it’ll open them up to taking extra damage and doling out extra MAG the more you pummel them. Combat thus becomes a delicate and thrilling dance of mixing light and heavy attacks to best optimise your damage output and MAG reserves while strategically stunning and disabling different foes in the field.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed how dynamic this system is, as it somehow manages to stay simple while having a lot of depth that encourages player agency and expression. Swapping out demons to adjust to shifting battle conditions, dodge rolling away from attacks, and constantly switching between your various means of attacks leads to fights that are energetic, smooth, and tense in equal measure. In many ways, this feels like how I'd imagine Atlus’ take on a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/devil_may_cry">DMC</a>-style character action game, and I hope that this isn’t the last time we see this combat system in a ‘new’ SMT-adjacent game.</p>
<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155149/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>When you’re not in combat, character progression is primarily handled via various forms of the SMT series' famed Demon Fusion. After recruiting new demons from combat encounters and growing their stats and abilities a bit, you can initially fuse any two to make a more powerful one that retains characteristics of its predecessors. Not only does this keep your team feeling fresh as you constantly burn and add new demons to your repertoire, but it gives you a great feeling of progression as each new fusion makes Raidou that much more lethal on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Demon Fusion has also been reworked to make it simpler to search for potential fusions and easier to pass on skills and traits to new demons, sidestepping many of the more frustrating aspects of how this system worked originally. Plus, Atlus has retroactively added a few dozen new demons here from SMT releases that came after, giving you a lot more options as you work to fill out your compendium.</p>
<p>Demon Fusion has always been one of the most satisfying means of team-building in an RPG and I’m happy to report that Atlus hasn’t lost a step with its implementation here—it adds a lot to the replayability and makes the combat system even more interesting as you gain access to more demons to play around with.</p>
<figure><a title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156930/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a remaster, Raidou Remastered obviously has some much fancier visuals, but it’s also clear that this was a game initially released on PS2. The pre-rendered backgrounds are gone and have been replaced by much more vibrant 3D environments, but many scenes still stick to a fixed camera angle that can awkwardly change perspective with no warning. The character and demon models have been redone, but there’s also a stiffness to their movements and lifelessness in their eyes that betrays their origins on humbler hardware.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say that Raidou looks bad; in fact, I would say it looks a decent bit <em>better</em> than the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shin_megami_tensei_iii_nocturne_hd_remaster">SMT 3</a> remaster Atlus did a few years ago. That buttery smooth 1080p 60fps gameplay looks great in motion, and the combat sequences especially look excellent. Even so, there’s only so much Atlus could do to jazz up a PS2 game without a complete overhaul on the level of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_3_reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>.</p>
<p>(Also, even though I put most of my time into the Switch 2 version, you can still pick this up on the base Switch if you wish. That version runs at an uncapped frame rate that typically hovers around 30fps, while the image quality will drop to the Switch 1 screen's resolution of 720p in handheld mode. Aside from the longer load times, it’s otherwise the exact same game and it feels like a solid port that fits well on the Switch hardware, though the Switch 2 version is obviously the superior pick if you want the best possible experience.)</p>

<p>Regarding its music, Raidou Remastered pulls equally from both Persona and SMT with its mixture of bouncy jazz for most environments and heavy rock for the combat. Overall, there’s quite a lot of depth here and I enjoyed how it manages to simultaneously feel like an OST that’s unmistakably descended from SMT while still managing to carve out its own identity.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army is a wonderful retread of a forgotten classic, smartly polishing up its best parts and modifying its worst parts to make for an overall more enjoyable experience. Though the visuals are just 'okay' and the detective gameplay can be a bit plain, the action-packed combat, reworked demon fusion, and interesting story all come together to make for a gripping adventure.</p>
<p>I’d recommend you pick this one up if you’re curious and you think it may be up your alley. I’ve never played anything quite like Raidou, and it offers a very unique take not just on the standard SMT formula, but action RPGs on the whole.</p></section>

<p>Sculpt and paint using mouse mode</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo's recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Direct shed a load of light on the upcoming platformer, and one of the coolest new additions is undoubtedly <strong>DK Artist</strong>.</p>
<p>Channeling some serious <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> energy (in which you could mess around with a 3D model of Mario in the title screen), this mode lets you paint and distort sculptures to your heart's desire, and includes familiar characters like Mario and Bowser. Using the Switch 2's mouse capabilities, you can paint directly onto your sculpture, chip away at it, or even add new elements entirely.</p>
<p>You can change the lighting or add some rad banana effects to make your designs shine even more. Honestly, it looks really cool, and it's the sort of thing we could see ourselves losing hours of time too; particularly if more base designs get added as DLC later down the road.</p>
<figure><a title="DK Artist 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4ba7631179c60/dk-artist-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>The Direct also revealed that Pauline will play a critical role in Donkey Kong Bananza, with co-op multiplayer allowing an extra player to use her remarkable singing prowess to attack enemies and chip away at the environment.</p>

			<p>A Data Link Between Worlds. That’s what I went away with after my brief 30-minute hands-on session with Bandai Namco’s upcoming monster-taming JRPG, Digimon Story: Time Stranger. Despite only dabbling with the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-review/">Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</a> on the PlayStation Vita, Bandai Namco assured me that Time Stranger would be just as standalone as other titles in the franchise.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Central-Town-Introduction_EN_1-1456x819.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The art and character designs were among the first things I picked up when diving into Digimon Story: Time Stranger. With Suzuhito Yasuda returning as the character designer, the animated portraits and character profiles look like the highest definition versions of some of his previous works with Bandai Namco. The character models stand out among the muted colors of the digital realm, giving this JRPG a distinctive charm. Symbol encounters make their debut, with enemy Digimon being visible on the field to help pick and choose your fights rather than being at the mercy of random encounters.</p>
<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger’s narrative focuses on the twin worlds of real-world Japan (Shinjuku and Akihabara, primarily) and the digital realm that the Digimon call their home, some eight years in the past. While my brief demo only focused on the latter, Bandai Namco hinted that it would be possible to go back and forth between the two as the story progresses. Whether there are be any time hijinx and events taking place in the past cascading into the future, and vice versa, is a mystery they’d like to leave until release. One of Digimon Story: Time Stranger's recent story trailers centered around a citywide explosion at the beginning of the story, leading to the player getting transported into the digital realm, so surely there must be something worth going back to.</p>

<p>Each Digimon offshoot brings a different gameplay style altogether. Those who played the most recent Digimon Survive would remember that entry for its visual novel storytelling and strategic grid-based battles. Here, Digimon Story: Time Stranger takes after the earlier Digimon Story titles with your typical party- and turn-based encounters. With players bringing in four Digimon at a time in addition to guest characters, there’s a lot to juggle in combat, but thankfully, the Digimon themselves are streamlined, at least in one way. Digimon have a few available skills to pick from, at least in the introductory hours of the game. Most are inline with attacking with the given element of that particular monster, while others come with buffing and debuffing skills to turn the tide of battle. Digimon can also use an item before taking action, freeing up a command that might otherwise be spent recovering health after a vicious boss attack.</p>
<p>With nearly a dozen different elements and seven attributes (Bandai Namco only showed off Data, Vaccine, and Virus, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Free and perhaps Variable making a return), there are a lot of variables to consider when testing an attack's effectiveness. Enemy affinities remain a mystery until attacked with a particular element, upon which it shows off whether the attack is only partially effective or upwards of 250-300% effective, depending on if you’re targeting both the enemy’s weakest element and attributes.</p>
<p>With over 450 digital monsters in the roster, there’s going to be plenty for new and returning players to discover for the first time. Part of the charm of Digimon is its non-linear evolution chains, so two players can play through Digimon Story: Time Stranger and come out with vastly different party compositions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/digimon-story-time-stranger-shows-off-vibrant-digital-world-and-quality-of-life<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the titles at SGF I was most excited to check out was <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger.</em> Having loved the previous two <em>Digimon Story</em> games I was excited to see a new location, new story, but more of the same JRPG goodness.</p>

<p>I got to sit down and play 30 minutes of <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger,</em> starting with the protagonist, Aegiomon, and Inori first reaching Central Town in the Digital World. After a brief cutscene of the characters making their way through a sewer to a ladder, the party emerges in Central Town.</p>

<h2>Central Town Is Alive With Digimon</h2>

<p>I was blown away by just how much was going on in this city. From where you emerge, you can see at least three dozen digimon, of levels from Baby up to Mega, some hanging around having conversations, some watching over the city, and others working as store owners or guides.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-bar-scene.jpg?itok=19gvX6HX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-bar-scene.jpg?itok=X8WxfCGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How many can you count? Astamon is serving drinks at the bar for Xros Wars fans</figcaption></figure><p>It was a feast to the eyes, and as a fan of Digimon, I was even more excited to hear that every Digimon that I could see in and around Central Town was one I could obtain for myself through scanning or digivolution.</p>

<p>With a variety of colorful characters, different themed Digimon exploring relevant environments, and active movement, it really made the city feel alive.</p>

<p>Exploring the city, there was a shop to purchase stat-changing equipment from, attacks to purchase for your Digimon, and food for the Digifarm. Plenty for you to spend your hard-earned cash on. I didn't get to dig much more into that, but a lot of it was the standard RPG array of items and elemental attacks of varying power.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> Overworld Combat And QOL</h2>

<p>Leaving Central Town on a Pegasusmon's back, it was my new goal to reach the top of a large tower. Entering a space with aggressive Digimon, there were a few things that I was shown.</p>

<p>The first was that there were a variety of supplies and crates that I could destroy with my Digimon to obtain the item.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digiattack.jpg?itok=9m6HNF5S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digiattack.jpg?itok=a7j_dO8I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Defeat weak Digimon instantly while reaping the benefits</figcaption></figure><p>Digimon now spawn in the overworld, as opposed to being random encounters. On top of that, I was surprised when I initiated my first battle… and it was over just as soon as it had started. A new Quality of Life feature in <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is that if you're up against Digimon that are less powerful than your own party by a certain amount, you'll win automatically.</p>

<p>What's even better about this is that not only is EXP still earned, but you get scan data for the Digimon you face too.</p>

<p>When you encounter a Digimon that you don't kill immediately, you'll get launched into turn-based combat. Here you can perform basic attacks or lean into your Digimon's special abilities. This is where I experienced the least difference from prior <em>Digimon Story</em> games, but also it's Shin Megami Tensei style combat, where there's a focus on using special attacks and swapping between a variety of unique creatures. It doesn't need to totally reinvent the genre to be a good combat system.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-combat-conclusion.jpg?itok=vaRjZlXx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-combat-conclusion.jpg?itok=6oaGvcod 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another major Quality of Life improvement is that combat speed can change. You can have 1x, 2x, 3x, and 5x battle speed. When you know your Digimon, what combos of abilities are strongest, and are maybe doing some experience farming this speed up will be a saving grace.</p>

<h2>Boss Battles Have Evolving Moments</h2>

<p>There were two places where combat showed off some unique aspects that I experienced as I was fighting against Parrotmon, a boss/titan at this point in the story.</p>

<p>The first of these changes involved Parrotmon directly. Partway through the battle, Parrotmon brought its wings in towards its body, protecting itself as it started to charge up electrical energy with its head. A new white bar appeared below its health; this was a gauge that I needed to take down by specifically attacking its head instead of its body, otherwise it would unleash a powerful attack.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-parrotmon-combat.jpg?itok=OzSdi9MQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-parrotmon-combat.jpg?itok=G7-f9kuH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This added dynamic element created a reason to prioritize powerful attacks, turning the battle momentarily into a sprint as opposed to being a marathon.</p>

<p>The other change is how the tamer is involved in a battle. The first of which is in item usage. Instead of an Item being used, and taking up a Digimon's turn, the Tamer has their own 'action' that they can take. If an item is used, the Digimon whose turn it is is still able to perform an ability, but it will take a rotation of all of the Digimon before your Tamer can use an action again.</p>

<p>This came in clutch while I was using Tankmon in the battle against Parrotmon. Tankmon has a powerful attack that will leave him paralyzed for a turn. Just before it was Tankmon's turn, I was about to use a restorative item with the Tamer, readying Tankmon for another powerful attack, while still getting to deal heavy damage with a Kyuubimon.</p>

<p>A second way that the Tamer is involved is with a powerful X-Art (Pronounced Cross Art). While battling, you'll earn points by hitting your enemy with type advantage attacks, and avoiding being hit with moves that are strong against your Digimon. Activating this ability stacked three turns' worth of every buff on my entire party.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-x-art.jpg?itok=N50H5BSA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-x-art.jpg?itok=DnaQ9qzQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>X-Arts will subtly let you know when it's ready to be activated</figcaption></figure><p>This was another time, this time created by the player, to set up your most powerful Digimon to attack in quick succession to capitalize on the boosts that you receive.</p>

<p>One thing that wasn't clear about X-Art is whether this kind of ability is one that can be swapped out, or you can expand from having one option to multiple.</p>

<h2>Creating And Digivolving Your Partners</h2>

<p>Digimon are at the core of this experience. At any time in your party, you can have three active members and three reserve members. There are also spaces for guest party members who are part of combat, but can't be controlled by the player. You can also have 999 additional Digimon in your storage. You can freely transfer Digimon in and out of your party whether you're in a city or out in areas where you can fight wild Digimon. I got to see Aegiomon and Minervamon as guests in this session.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-converting-digimon-data.jpg?itok=a64pZFBe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-converting-digimon-data.jpg?itok=Pwy5sSkM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In combat as you attack a Digimon their weaknesses and resistances will slowly be revealed</figcaption></figure><p>Digimon in your party, whether they're active or in reserve, will all gain full experience in battle, which is a lovely touch.</p>

<p>Encountering Digimon in the wild, you'll scan them. Once you've scanned them to 100%, you can convert that data into a Digimon of that type for yourself. Additionall,y you can scan to 200% and the Digimon that you create will have boosted stats as well as a higher maximum level potential.</p>

<p>An aspect of Digimon raising that I didn't get to see as part of the gameplay demo was the Digimon farm so we'll have to look for more than that in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Digimon Has Never Looked So Good</h2>

<p>Walking around the world, seeing Digimon interact with one another, and most frequently during the battle scene, was just how good the Digimon in <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> looked.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-kyubimon.jpg?itok=O0IR81zm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-kyubimon.jpg?itok=GfTBjksC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I was most impressed with seeing Zudomon up close, his bulkier model looking really well-defined in Central Town, and Kyuubimon in the middle of battle. The boss battle took place under dark cloud cover, but Kyuubimon's flaming elements glowed bright. This not only looked more realistic, but also made me think of other interesting fire or water elements of different Digimon and how they'll be represented.</p>

<h2>References Everywhere</h2>

<p>You can tell that the developers are fans of the source material by how even that small slice of the world was overflowing with references. The Digimon 02 Rookies could be found near the Trailmon station, Tamers Rookies were hanging out in an alleyway, and even Arukenimon and Mummymon were seen together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-adventure-02-reference.jpg?itok=icktb10K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-adventure-02-reference.jpg?itok=QxT2s_Le 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In the middle of a conversation you might notice the cast of Digimon Adventure 02 in the distance</figcaption></figure><p>Outside of the specific references to groups of Digimon, if there's a Digimon that you're a fan of from specific Digimon media ,then chances are that Digimon is here. We've seen Digimon as early as <em>Digimon Adventure</em>, all the way up to <em>Digimon Xros Wars: The Young Hunters Who Leapt Through Time</em>.</p>

<p>It isn't entirely clear if we'll see any Digimon from <em>Ghost Game</em> or characters like Pulsemon or Herrismon from mobile games, and I think it would be safe to assume we won't see any <em>Appmon</em>.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I went into <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> as a lifelong Digimon fan, and someone who has been poring over released footage and assets, and I was still blown away by what I got to see. The world is full and thriving with Digimon life. Packed full of new Digimon (like Tankdramon) and references that Digimon fans will always smile to see.</p>

<p>I hope they are hiding some <em>Ghost Game</em> Digimon, and that we'll get to see more of the Armor Digivolutions (including some non-canonical ones).</p>

<p>The release of this game can't come any sooner.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warner-bros-creates-gaming-divisions-for-top-ip-including-mortal-kombat-and-harry-potter.1221906/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-restructure-divisions-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. Games has announced that it will restructure itself into divisions based around its four main IPs, with three studio heads already appointed to oversee the new divisions.</p>

<p>According to a Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the four divisions will be based around the key WB properties, namely&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>, the&nbsp;DC universe, and&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>. The three new studio heads will all report directly to WB gaming head J.B. Perrette.</p>

<p>If you feel like you've identified a number discrepancy in this announcement, you're not wrong, but there's a simple explanation. Both&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;</i>will be overseen by a single studio head, namely WB Montreal head Yves Lachance. NetherRealm's Shaun Himmerick will be&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>and DC's steward, while WB New York's Steven Flenory will work on the publishing and tech side of things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/batman-arkham-knight-warner-bros.jpg?itok=OhBHeGSf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/batman-arkham-knight-warner-bros.jpg?itok=axEdBZ40 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. has reorganized its gaming department into four key divisions.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Variety, no employees have been laid off as part of this change, which comes as a pleasant surprise after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jagex-layoffs" rel="nofollow">spate</a> of "structural realignment" <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">operations</a> we've seen in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">recent months</a> (and over the last couple of years, as a matter of fact).</p>

<p>The change also comes after former Warner Bros. gaming head David Haddad <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow">stepped down from the company</a> a few months ago. His departure follows a couple of rather embarrassingly high-profile failures for the company's gaming segment, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">flop fighting game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">MultiVersus</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">large-scale letdown&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></a>.</p>

<p>As Variety notes, it's not clear whether this change is intended to be a permanent replacement for Haddad's leadership or whether it's a stopgap while the company tries to find a successor for him.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-warner-bros.jpg?itok=FSCfp-pd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-warner-bros.jpg?itok=DA6P0PYb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>was one of two major letdowns for Warner Bros. last year.</figcaption></figure><p>As you might have guessed, these failures <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-financials-2024-revenue-falls" rel="nofollow">led to a "disappointing" financial year</a> for Warner Bros., which is likely why the company has chosen to reorganize around its key franchises (although it should be pointed out that both of its major flops last year were based, at least in part, on some of those franchises).</p>

<p>The studio's poor performance could well also have been a factor in the closure of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow"><em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>developer Monolith</a> earlier this year, along with&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>developer Player First Games and regional division WB San Diego.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what this means for Warner Bros.' gaming operations in the long run. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Switch 2 owners will soon have another big Nintendo game to play. During <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/687451/nintendo-direct-donkey-kong-bananza-gameplay">its latest Direct presentation</a>, the company showed off plenty more of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">a 3D platformer that launches as a Switch 2 exclusive on July 17th</a> — and it’s looking like a surprisingly robust experience.</p></div><p>In the new game DK teams up with a younger version of the singer Pauline — who apparently has been hidden inside of a rock for some time — and travels to an underground realm that seems kind of like Nintendo’s take on Hollow Earth. Despite being below ground, the game takes place in a varied and diverse world, with beaches, mountains, and icy locales. There are even giant elder characters and <em>Breath of the Wild</em>-style ancient ruins with unique challenges.</p><p>The Direct was primarily focused on gameplay, which in <em>Bananza</em> is built around destruction. DK can smash up the environment, tear of chunks of terrain to use as a weapon, and also, uh, turn into a number of different animals. The game’s “banana transformations” let DK transform into creatures like an ostrich (so he can fly) or a zebra (so he can run so fast he can even sprint on water). These powers utilize a substance called “bananergy.” There are also other abilities that can be unlocked through a skill tree. Maybe the most important: you can purchase new outfits for both DK and Pauline. So even though it mostly plays like a platformer, it appears that <em>Bananza</em> has significant role-playing elements.</p><p>There’s a two-player co-op mode where one person controls Pauline, and the multiplayer supports GameShare, so you can play on two different consoles using only one copy of the game. <em>Bananza</em> also has a bonus mode where you can sculpt rocks using the Switch 2’s new mouse controls.</p><p><em>Bananza</em> was first revealed during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Nintendo’s big Switch 2 unveiling in April</a>. It’s the second major first-party release for the console, following <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>, which launched alongside the new console. <em>Bananza</em> is the franchise’s first 3D platformer since the Nintendo 64 era, and is the first mainline entry since <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17301860/nintendo-switch-ports-wii-u-obsolete">Tropical Freeze</a></em> more than a decade ago.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
