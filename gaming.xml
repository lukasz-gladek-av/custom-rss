			<p>Earlier today, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on the latest Nintendo Switch 2 market analysis from DFC Intelligence. The analysts reckon it'll become the fastest-selling console ever with 15 million units sold in 2025, although the impact of the tariffs, should they be here to stay, is impossible to fully predict.</p>
<p>When we received the report, we also got the opportunity to speak with founder, CEO, and principal David Cole to learn more about their insights on the Nintendo Switch 2 and the potential impact of the US tariffs on the whole games industry.</p>
<p><strong>Hello, David. Were you expecting that $450 price, or were you, maybe, like many other colleagues, waiting for Nintendo to announce a $400 price?</strong></p>
<p>We were concerned about the tariff issue before the announcements. Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts. They get parts from all over Asia that go into the system. With tariffs going into effect, we were concerned the price would be $500 or more, so when it came in at $450, we were actually pretty happy. $400 would obviously have been the best-case scenario, but we thought $450 was a solid market price.</p>
<p>Obviously, when they <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Friday that they were going to put the pre-orders on hold, that's a whole new ball game. Clearly, this is an ongoing issue that I think everybody's trying to figure out. We met with Nintendo executives last week and they were confident in the pricing, but it's an economic environment that nobody can really predict. The decisions are made out of Japan on that pricing and it has to tie closely into what they feel they can lose.</p>
<p>Nintendo is a public company that's very much dependent on hardware sales to, if not generate a profit, at least not generate a loss. They're not like Microsoft, which has taken a big loss on hardware just to try and build an installed base. Nintendo doesn't tend to do that, so we are very concerned about the issue of, will they be forced to increase the price? Will they limit their manufacturing? Right now, they're cranking up the manufacturing and building up the inventory. They have quite a bunch of Nintendo Switch 2 inventory ready for launch, but going forward in the next few months, they may start to scale back on manufacturing a little bit.</p>
<p>There just may be another case of shortages, hopefully not as bad as what we saw with the<br>
PlayStation 5, but they may start to control inventory more, which would affect our topline forecasts because there would not be enough units to meet demand.</p>
<p><strong>That makes sense. It looks like they didn't factor in the tariffs for their initial Nintendo Switch 2 pricing. In your report, you're expecting a 20% price increase over the next couple of years. Were you referring to the Switch 2 or just generally across the industry?</strong></p>
<p>I think we're looking at prices on hardware, accessories, and software. Everything is set to increase and we've modeled that in our forecast. There will be declines in prices hopefully within the 2-year period. Obviously, it's a changing environment out there. The latest news I heard was that there would be a 90-day hold on these tariffs, but I think that's probably fake news. People are speculating every which way, which makes it very difficult to forecast accurately, knowing that it can really hit on two, with fewer products getting manufactured where they scale back on accessories.</p>
<p>Obviously, they have things like a camera and all kinds of different accessories. One of the first things they'll do is probably scale back on how much inventory is produced because they definitely don't want to build up inventory. You get a situation where the cost of manufacturing is higher and the cost of passing that on to the consumer is higher. You also have consumers knowing that this tariff price increase is probably temporary, so prices will hopefully come down. I'm going to wait a few months. Now that they've announced that $450 price, it's going to be tough to roll it back. That's a real catch-22 because I think if they were forced to increase the price and pass that on to consumers, a lot of consumers would look at it and say "Well, they announced the $450 price. They're increasing it because of the tariffs, but I'm just going to wait and wait till the prices roll back." It's a real catch-22.</p>
<p><strong>I was wondering if you think Microsoft might be forced to raise the price of the Xbox consoles. Of course, it's a US company, but the consoles are not actually manufactured in the United States.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. The impact is far-ranging and it's not just the video game industry, it's all consumer products, so you have this huge macroeconomic situation where prices are increasing across the board. The video game industry is definitely not isolated in this issue.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I think that that is going to be a huge change for the game industry. In the past, people said Nintendo was kind of their own ecosystem and not really competing with what Sony and Microsoft are doing. Now, they are stepping up to say "Hey, we're going to be a platform for serious AAA third-party game publishers." They've realized that the audience is expanding and they're definitely going after it. There's a real potential to shake up.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Indeed. You believe that the Nintendo Switch 2 could potentially engage more directly with the PlayStation and Xbox fanbases compared to the original Switch, right?</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. We've done all kinds of research on that topic because what we've seen is really that the Switch had nice penetration among PlayStation and Xbox owners who are looking for a second system. If you bought a PlayStation, instead of buying an Xbox, you tend to buy a Switch. Even among the core PC gaming community, if you're a big PC gamer, you know a lot of those games you play are going to be available on the PlayStation and Xbox, but you go buy a Switch because the products that Nintendo puts out aren't available anywhere else.</p>
<p>I think what you see with the Nintendo Switch 2 is Nintendo really focusing on that audience with a lot of third-party content and features like mouse controls. It's pretty interesting how they're able to offer a unique platform that in many cases for these core users is a secondary platform, but could become more and more of a primary platform, especially now that you can get a lot of sports titles and more mature titles like Cyberpunk 2077. Then you have products from FromSoftware, which I thought was really interesting. <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They're bringing Elden Ring to the Switch 2</a>, but they're also announcing <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-duskbloods-will-feature-over-12-playable-characters-fromsoftware-isnt-abandoning-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an exclusive title from From Software</a>, which was interesting because Sony has been investing and partnering heavily with From Software (they made an acquisition late last year to become <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-becomes-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest minority shareholder in From Software's parent company</a>). That's a pretty big feather in Nintendo's cap to have such an exclusive.</p>
<p>At the same time, of course, they have that core Nintendo fanboy base that goes along with whatever Nintendo is putting out in most cases. I think that is going to be a huge change for the game industry. In the past, people said Nintendo was kind of their own ecosystem and not really competing with what Sony and Microsoft are doing. Now, they are stepping up to say "Hey, we're going to be a platform for serious AAA third-party game publishers." They've realized that the audience is expanding and they're definitely going after it. There's a real potential to shake up, more on the console side, not so much on the PC side, where you'd still see the Nintendo Switch 2 Switch as a secondary system.</p>
<p><strong>In addition, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> a while ago that they would bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms. The Nintendo Switch 2 seems a perfect fit for that, especially with the mouse-like controls.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. It gives options to people who may want to play in different ways. Some people want to play with a controller and then you got a huge audience that loves to play with mouse controls. They're delivering more versatility.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the new Nintendo console may eat more into the Xbox base or the PlayStation's?</strong></p>
<p>Well, the Xbox base is pretty weak right now, so I think it's going to eat more into Sony's PlayStation base. Microsoft's strategy remains unclear. They're focused on diversifying across platforms, they're looking at what kind of new hardware form factor to deliver. The PlayStation 5 is the really competing console platform right now out there. Whether that changes when Microsoft announces something new remains to be seen, but right now, it's really going directly after the PlayStation base.</p>
<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 is doubling down on the handheld capabilities. Just yesterday, Phil Spencer teased an Xbox handheld once again, and there have been rumors even of PlayStation considering another handheld. Do you think there is space in the market for new PlayStation and Xbox handhelds, or is it just getting saturated with the Steam Deck and other PC handhelds?</strong></p>
<p>The problem with Sony and Microsoft, with both the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series S|X, was that they were basically just power upgrades. They were more powerful versions of what came before, and they didn't really shift the market dynamics, so I think both Sony and Microsoft are scrambling, knowing that this is an era where portable gaming is huge. They don't really have an option for that. Sony tried major efforts with the PSP and the PS Vita back in the day, but they just were not able to gain any market traction. Sony has clearly said the PlayStation 5 is on the downtail of its life cycle. They've missed forecasts the past two years and it did great at launch. Now, sales are not weak, but they're not as strong as Sony expected and they've come out and said it's clearly on the decline.</p>
<p>The question is, what answer will Sony and Microsoft have in terms of new hardware? Do they reinvent their systems to become more like a Switch with a portable option? Nintendo has had 30-plus years in portable gaming devices, while Sony's had some failed experiments. The track record is not strong for either of those companies. They need to try and come up with something, but whether they can, that's the open question right now.</p>
<p><strong>Returning to the Nintendo Switch 2, one of the big shocking points of the reveal was, of course, the pricing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially for Mario Kart World at $80 (€90 in Europe)</a>. Some people are still a bit shocked. Do you think it may be more of an exception than the rule?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it's going to be more of the exception rather than the rule. There's already quite a wide range of price points. Third-party titles are coming in and they're not going up to that price range. There's a lot of flexibility on pricing with types of software. Nintendo said that Mario Kart World has a huge amount of content and they think consumers are willing to pay $80 for it. Most people will probably buy the $500 bundle that includes the Switch 2 and the game, so that breaks the price down to $50.</p>
<p>The price will probably drive a lot of sales of that bundle. They're also doing a lot of these upgrade packs, which I think are a really interesting concept. They're going to use that whole upgrade model to enhance the existing games for the Switch, adding new features and then either sell it for $10 to $20 or give it away if you become an online subscriber, so there's just all kinds of flexibility in the business model.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the tariffs could even impact software pricing?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Obviously, hardware has more of a direct impact, but you do have a lot of issues on the software side. Pricing could increase. Whether the publishers will eat that cost or not remains to be seen. I think it could show up in less discounting on products. One of the great things in the video game business is that you don't have to buy a game on day one; you could wait a while, and the price would come down. You might see an impact on that. I don't think it'll be as great as with hardware, but it definitely could have an impact.</p>
<p><strong>Analysts from Media Research <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-a-smash-hit-says-analyst-high-retail-prices-are-meant-to-drive-digital-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thought</a> that part of the reason Mario Kart World was priced at $80 was to drive users toward digital purchases, which are $10 cheaper. Do you agree?</strong></p>
<p>It could be, but I really don't think so. One thing you have to consider when buying digital titles on Nintendo, especially when they're full games like Mario Kart, is it doesn't have a lot of onboard memory to store these games. Clearly, Nintendo is hoping to sell more of its proprietary memory cards. Digital buying on the Switch is growing, but I don't think Nintendo is necessarily trying to drive that any more than would naturally be the case.</p>
<p>They probably realize that people who buy physical copies have a higher price tolerance than people who buy digital games. They want the physical part to decline as much as possible, but at the same time, having a physical presence is still great.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think the Game Chat feature will be a major factor in the success of the Nintendo Switch 2? It seems like they're making a big thing out of it this time around.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We were talking to all our headset clients and saying, "You got to look at the Nintendo Switch 2 and putting headsets out for that because I think it is going to be pretty big." Having a younger audience, Nintendo has always been a little intimidated by chat and the can of worms that can potentially open. They've taken a slower approach to that, but I think it's clear with what they're doing with the Switch 2 that they're going all in on the chat.</p>
<p>I'm sure they are spending a lot of time ensuring that parental controls and all that good stuff make the chat system robust but also safe. When you're in that business, same with Roblox and other companies that target a younger audience, you have to be very careful in those areas, but the chat is a much-needed feature and I think it'll be extremely appreciated by the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>The BAFTA Games Awards 2025 has wrapped, and all the trophies have been handed out. Sitting at the top of the table is Astro Bot, one of 2024’s most popular titles. It claimed no fewer than <strong>five </strong>BAFTA Awards, securing the winning spot in some of the most competitive categories, including the prestigious ‘Best Game’ slot.</p>



<p>It was joined by games like Helldivers 2 and Still Wakes the Deep, both of which landed multiple awards during the show.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-astro-bot-on-top">Astro Bot on Top</h2>



<p>Astro Bot has claimed the BAFTA Awards for some iconic categories:</p>



<ul>
<li>Best Game</li>



<li>Game Design</li>



<li>Family</li>



<li>Audio Achievement</li>



<li>Animation</li>
</ul>



<p>The results at the <a href="https://www.bafta.org/awards/games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BAFTA Games Awards</a> in London follow months of similar circumstances for Team Asobi’s wonderful platformer.</p>



<p>Still Wakes the Deep also had a nice spree at the BAFTAs, securing the following wins:</p>



<ul>
<li>New IP</li>



<li>Performer in a Leading Role</li>



<li>Performer in a Supporting Role</li>
</ul>



<p>Still Wakes the Deep was one of my top games of 2024, boasting some intense horror sequences that unfolded during a tense fight for survival aboard a besieged Scottish oil rig. </p>



<p>Helldivers 2 was able to grab the BAFTA Awards for Music and Multiplayer, while Hellblade II landed Technical Achievement. There’s a special nod reserved for Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, which received the BAFTA Award for Game Beyond Entertainment, which given the game’s backstory, is deserved through and through.</p>



<p>To my surprise, Vampire Survivors won Evolving Game, an award that I thought would for sure go to Hello Games and No Man’s Sky. Balatro managed to secure the award for Debut Game, and Thank Goodness You’re Here, the star-studded and bizarre comedy title, won the award for British Game.]</p>



<p>Stay tuned to Insider Gaming, as I was at the BAFTA Games Awards and secured some exclusive interviews with some of the biggest names in gaming.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-iv%E2%80%99s-2025-roadmap-unveiled-%E2%80%93-new-expansion-in-2026.1158822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard has announced the roadmap for <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lets-you-claim-boss-powers-for-yourself-next-season-ptr-opens-today/">Diablo IV</a>, as the<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/"> Age of Hatred</a> continues for the rest of the year, with the next big expansion for Diablo IV not coming until sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>Diablo IV started 2025 with the current season, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-witchcraft-adds-the-armory-witchy-powers-and-a-new-storyline-on-the-tree-of-whispers/">Season of Witchcraft</a>, which will come to an end later this month, with the Belial's Return season picking up the baton. Following that will be the Sins of the Horadrim season, and then closing out the year will be the Infernal Chaos season.</p>
<p>Each will bring a new set of limited updates that players can grab before they're gone, along with permanent additions to the game, like new lair bosses coming in the Belail's Return season, and new nightmare dungeon activities in the Sins of the Horadrim season.</p>
<p>The latter will also be when players on consoles will be able to plug in their keyboard and mouse setups, as support for that control scheme on consoles will arrive sometime this summer. There will also be new collaborations with other series in both the Belial's Return season and the Infernal Chaos season, and the former will likely feature a few special add-ons as Blizzard celebrates Diablo IV's two-year anniversary.</p>
<p>Of course, the new expansion that'll be coming in 2026 will be what brings the most change to the game when it arrives next year. The first major expansion for Diablo IV, Vessel of Hatred, arrived a little over a year after the game's original release. This new expansion is spreading that time difference further, so it'll be interesting to see how players react to it once they see how much bigger, or smaller, it is from the last one.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Diablo-IV-2025-Roadmap.png"></a></figure>

<p>For now, Blizzard teases that the new Diablo IV expansion will include leaderboards and a new ranking system. According to the roadmap image Blizzard showed off, that's about all we know about the expansion, which you can check out for yourself above.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound.1158819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, the crowdfunding campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-coming-courtesy-of-steamforged-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em></a> went live. This tabletop adaptation of Arrowhead Studios' satirical sci-fi shooter was an instant success on Gamefound, reaching its funding goal 12 minutes after going live.</p>

<h2>The <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> Gamefound Campaign</h2>

<p>On its official <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/steamforged-games/helldivers-2-board-game" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> brings the fight for managed democracy to gaming tables. Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> videogame, it is a co-op experience for 1-4 players. Players choose one of four classes, mission difficulty, and a planet on which to deploy.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-board-game-captain-miniature.jpg?itok=2W4PN7Fq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-board-game-captain-miniature.jpg?itok=jLMAShhj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From there, you and your squadmates must manage your ammunition, prioritize targets, strategically use action cards, utilize different weapon types and stratagems, and heroically extract from the mission area. According to the campaign page, a single game takes 120-180 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>The base version of the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> includes many game pieces and elements that fans expect: damage dice, <em>Helldivers</em> miniatures, stratagem boards, and various status effect tokens. As for enemies, the base game only supports the insectoid Terminid enemies.</p>

<p>Thankfully, developer Steamforged Games included various expansions at different pledge levels and as add-ons. These include the Patriot Exosuit expansion, bringing mech power to the squad, and various boss enemies like the Bile Titan, Factory Strider, and Impaler. Finally, there is an Automatons expansion, bringing the robotic terrors of Malevelon Creek to the game.</p>

<p>There are three pledge levels for the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em>. They are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£61.00:</strong> The base version of the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em>.</li>
	<li><strong>Galactic Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£92.00:</strong> The base game, the Patriot Exosuit expansion, and two mystery expansions set to be announced at a later date.</li>
	<li><strong>Hell Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£246.00:</strong> The base game, Patriot Exosuit, Impaler, Bile Titan, Factory Strider, Automaton, and mystery expansions</li>
</ul><p>In addition, anyone who backs the crowdfunding campaign will receive a Gamefound exclusive <em>Helldivers</em> commemorative turn tracker coin at no additional cost.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> campaign has raised&nbsp;£383,714, more than six times its initial funding goal of&nbsp;£60,000. The campaign concludes April 22.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> is coming up to its second anniversary but it still has a good bit of gas in the tank. Earlier today <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/blizzard">Blizzard</a> shared its <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189529/the-age-of-hatred-persists-diablo-iv-2025-roadmap">roadmap for the game</a> across the rest of the year, though obviously we're a quarter of the way through that already. The game is currently in its seventh season, with its eighth, Belial's Return, starting sometime this month. This one, unsurprisingly, adds Belial, Lord of Lies as a boss, alongside a couple of bosses from Vessel of Hatred as "part of the updated Lair Boss system."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This is the part that isn't as fun though: that season will also be bringing in an "IP collab." That's obviously a bit of a red flag, given how much <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> has fully lent into just ignoring the laws of its own universe with its own crossovers, but the blog post does note that the collab will feature "universes that complement its dark themes." Universes, plural, because season ten, (we'll get there) also features a collab.
</p>
<p>
Season nine, Sins of the Horadrim, starts in July and runs through to September, will bring in new powers, Nightmare dungeon activities, dungeon escalation, and an earnable pet. Aww! Then there's the aforementioned tenth season, which'll include the second collab of the year, as well as new chaos powers and an Infernal Hordes update (oh, and another earnable pet). There'll be some quality of life updates throughout the year too, like the Battle Pass and Seasonal Journey getting a refresh to help them "evolve in ways that are more rewarding."
</p>
<p>
There's no new expansion on the way this year though, with the roadmap noting the next one will be coming in 2026, alongside a new ranking system, leaderboards, and, uh, new something, that bit is obfuscated by some flames. Oops! Blizzard should take a look at that, can't read what's been burned away.

            <p>
Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Hades 2's appearance in last week's Switch 2 Direct showcase</a>, developer Supergiant Games has confirmed the roguelike sequel will launch for the platform - as well as the original Switch - as a timed console exclusive.
</p>
<p>
Supergiant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-is-getting-a-sequel-the-princess-of-the-underworld-is-heading-our-way">announced a second Hades was in the works</a> at the tail-end of 2022, and it eventually entered PC early access in May last year. It's all change this time around too, with the original game's dashing protagonist Zagreus stepping aside so his sister - Melinoë, Princess of the Underworld - can take the spotlight as she embarks on a quest to defeat Chronos, the Titan of Time. With a little help from the Olympian Gods, of course.
</p>
<p>
Since entering PC early access, Supergiant has steadily expanded and refined <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, building on the formula that helped its predecessor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is-hades-and-now-we-chat">earn the title of Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2020</a>. And, now, following last week's confirmation of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> release, the studio has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G3wbCIUVqs">appeared in the latest instalment of Nintendo's new Creator's Voice series</a> to introduce the game to a new audience and confirm - via a quick on-screen message toward the end of the video - that Hades 2's 1.0 release will come to Switch 2 as a timed console exclusive.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="The God-Like Rogue-Like Returns – Hades II – Creator's Voice | Nintendo Switch 2" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>The God-Like Rogue-Like Returns – Hades II – Creator's Voice | Nintendo Switch 2</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs?autoplay=1" title="The God-Like Rogue-Like Returns – Hades II – Creator's Voice | Nintendo Switch 2">
</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G3wbCIUVqs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
That announcement appeared to cause a little bit of confusion, however, and Supergiant <a href="https://x.com/SupergiantGames/status/1909686305342328902">took to social media</a> shortly after to clear up a few details. "Hades 2 v1.0," it wrote, "will launch simultaneously on our Early Access platforms (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hades-ii">Epic Games Store</a>), Nintendo Switch 2, and the original Nintendo Switch." The only remaining question for now, then, is exactly when 1.0 will show up - but that's still TBA. All Supergiant has said so far is that early access will "continue during 2025", and that it doesn't have a specific end date "at this time".
</p>
<p>
The wait, though, should be worth it. Hades 2 was already looking special when it debuted last year, with Eurogamer contributing editor Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">calling it a "game I already love" in his early access review</a>. So expect good for its eventual launch on Switch and Switch 2.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-eden-new-fps-from-reikon-games-launches-on-may-6/">Metal Eden</a> is an upcoming single-player FPS game from developer Reikon Games and publisher Deep Silver. It will launch on May 6, 2025, and today, a free demo was released so players can try the game for themselves.</p>
<p>Players will be able to check out the opening two missions of the sci-fi shooter "<em>for an unlimited period from today</em>," the studio wrote in a press release. So, even after the game is out, you'll be able to give it a try before buying and jumping into the full game.

The movie was happening in front of me on a big screen. I could see Jack Black and others dancing about in CG worlds, but the moment it left the screen and entered my eyeballs, it slipped back out of my brain. I had to force myself to absorb and comprehend what was happening. Luckily for me, not much actually happens in this bad movie.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> is a (sort of) live-action adaptation of <em>Minecraft</em>. But how do you adapt a video game with no real story or characters into a 100-minute movie? The answer is to lazily make Minecraft another world that real human beings travel to and then eventually leave. Truly, the hallmark of any bad video game movie is when it can be summed up with “Yeah, it’s like that 1980s <em>Mario Bros.</em> movie with Dennis Hopper.”</p><p>But hey, I can stomach a lazy setup if the rest of the movie wins me over. And early on, things were looking good. The first 20 minutes or so of this movie contain some genuinely great jokes that made me and the rest of the theater laugh. We get to meet some of the characters, like the young, awkward Henry and his older sister, Natalie, who has become his mother-figure after their real mom died. The two of them end up in a small town in Idaho because it was their mom’s dying wish. Thanks, mom! As this happens, we are introduced to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jason-momoa-jack-black-friendship-1851775031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jason-momoa-jack-black-friendship-1851775031">Jason Momoa’s washed-up video game pro</a></span> who owns a game store and is a huge loser. </p><p>Also, Danielle Brooks is there as Dawn, a character who spends most of the movie doing nothing, saying little, and being wasted. After a fun introduction to the characters, including Jenifer Coolidge’s surprisingly horny and very funny side character Marlene, our four main heroes are zapped into the world of <em>Minecraft</em> and the movie collapses because Jack Black’s Steve becomes a part of the story.</p><p>Can one actor save a movie? Maybe. Can one actor ruin a movie? Yes. And that’s what Jack Black does in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>. I’m not sure what the hell Jack Black is doing in this movie. I don’t mean why he was cast—he’s a funny, popular dude with a solid track record—but I mean, what is the idea behind his performance in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>? In fairness to Black, Steve is a nothing character in the game, just the name of its default skin. So he and the writers and director had to basically create Steve’s personality from the ground up. Yet, what they all decided to do was make Steve one of the most annoying characters ever to appear in a movie.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jack-black-minecraft-movie-lapis-lazuli-1851772162&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jack-black-minecraft-movie-lapis-lazuli-1851772162">Jack Black is dialed up to 12 at all times in this film</a></span>. Every moment Black is on the screen, he is screaming, yelling, dancing, doing weird voices, or using slang. Sometimes, he’s doing all of that at once. It doesn’t work, and within 20 minutes or so of him being a part of the movie, the kids in my theater stopped laughing at his behavior. His performance in<em> A Minecraft Movie</em> is like someone doing an impersonation of Jack Black based entirely on a YouTube compilation of his “Wackiest Moments.” It’s not only annoying and tiring; it’s also not funny. It also makes it hard to connect with Steve, who is one of the main characters in this movie and one of the few with an actual character arc.</p><p>I almost left the movie early when, at one point, Jack Black, readying his newfound friends for battle, says: “We need to mine. We need to craft. <em>We need to Minecraft.</em>” Fuck off. I’ve only got so many hours in my life, and I don’t need them wasted.</p><p>As for what actually happens in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, it’s got the most basic plot involving an evil person with no personality or interesting quirks who wants to destroy everything. But to do that, they need a shiny MacGuffin, and guess what? Our intrepid heroes need that same MacGuffin to get back home. Solving this conflict involves an hour of running and walking around CG worlds that look like <em>Minecraft </em>if you installed an ugly, realistic texture pack. Occasionally fights happen or conversations between characters occur, but the movie doesn’t linger on any one part long enough for you to care or develop any attachment to anything.</p><p>Technically, the CG in this movie is impressive. Real characters are perfectly integrated into the digital world. And when a <em>Minecraft </em>character leaves the video game world and enters the real world, he is seamlessly incorporated into the live-action sets. Good stuff. Too bad all the designs are hideous and don’t match up with the actual sound effects ripped from the game, which feel like the filmmakers attempting to remind you that, yes, this is still <em>Minecraft</em>. Promise.</p><figure id="" data-id="aa16d44c391459fe6f58a480f10881fd" data-recommend-id="image://aa16d44c391459fe6f58a480f10881fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->WB</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa16d44c391459fe6f58a480f10881fd" data-recommend-id="image://aa16d44c391459fe6f58a480f10881fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The best part of this movie is a subplot involving Coolidge’s vice principal character, who is newly divorced and falls in love with one of the <em>Minecraft </em>villagers who leaves his world and enters our own. Every single time the movie cut away to show us more of that story, I was disappointed that I wasn’t watching a movie about them instead. It’s also heavily implied that she fucks the villager. Enjoy the movie, kids! (And enjoy that amazing voice cameo at the end. Seriously, I was stunned. Won’t spoil it here. But’s it perfect.)</p><p>Now, I know some will say I’m being too harsh. This is a movie for kids, after all. So what? I’ve seen plenty of good kids movies. <em>The Lego Batman Movie</em> is one of the best DC movies ever made. It’s really funny, has strong character moments, a good plot, and doesn’t lazily dump Lego characters into the real world.</p><p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> just isn’t very good. Will kids like it? Sure, but generally kids also aren’t the most discerning audience, either, and that’s fine. I’m not saying kids can’t enjoy this movie. I’m just saying it’s a bad movie if you are an adult looking for something funny that doesn’t contain the worst Jack Black performance ever committed to celluloid. I’d recommend people go watch <em>School of Rock</em> and play <em>Minecraft</em> with some buddies instead of watching this crap. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Warhorse Studios has announced that hardcore mode will come to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 next week. The studio took to Twitter to share the announcement, as well as a picture of 10 perks that protagonist Henry can seemingly inherit:</p><ul><li>Numbskull</li><li>Somnambulant</li><li>Bad Back</li><li>Bashful</li><li>Picky Eater</li><li>Sweaty</li><li>Menace</li><li>Heavy Footed</li><li>Punchable Face</li><li>Hangry Henry</li></ul><p>While their effects haven't been revealed, they all have negative connotations within Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and will have adverse impacts on Henry as he moves around the world. For example, Picky Eater could mean that Henry might reject certain kinds of food, which can be troublesome when players are trying to refill his hunger meter.</p><p>Like the first game, navigation tools are strictly limited in Hardcore mode. For example, Henry's compass is gone, and his position on the map is no longer shown. Players will have to rely on traditional ways of going from place to place, like looking at surroundings.</p><p>One developer even said that they added an <a href="https://x.com/SirTobi28?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1895203949701144829%7Ctwgr%5Ec0f430aeece823145981c4725ee6c3bf3a7e6515%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fkingdom-come-deliverance-2-star-map-data-night-sky-navigation-hardcore-mode%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accurate star map</a> of early summer 1403 and implemented it into the game, which could help players navigate around.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-new-hardcore-mode/1100-6528915/" data-ref-id="1100-6528915">game's roadmap</a>, a paid expansion is due in Summer 2025 with a quest called Brushes With Death, in which Henry goes on a new adventure with a mysterious artist. In Autumn 2025, another paid expansion called Legacy of the Forge sees Henry explore the legacy of his adoptive father, restore Kuttenberg's forge, and become a master blacksmith. The roadmap ends in Winter 2025 with Mysteria Ecclesia, where Henry explore the Sedletz Monastery and goes on a covert mission to stop the spread of a deadly illness.</p>

		<p>Poncle Games has announced that the PlayStation versions of Vampire Survivors will not have the cross-save feature due to a legal issue. This legal issue is that the cross-save feature on PlayStation would have required Poncle to share partner information, which is something the studio is saying it is unable to share. There is still a miniscule chance of cross-save coming further down the line, but this will require more discussion with PlayStation. The full statement is below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire Survivors - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oG4Sx0HlX3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We’re sorry to say won’t be able to bring the Vampire Survivors Cross-Save feature to PlayStation 4/5 alongside our next update. Last month, we told everyone that Cross-Save would be available on PlayStation 4/5, PC, Xbox, Android and iOS alongside our next free VS update in April. But at last minute, we’ve run into a legal issue on PlayStation we weren’t aware of that requires us to share info on our partners that we’re unable to. The chances of Cross-Save coming to PlayStation consoles are now very slim, but not impossible, so we’re going to keep working alongside PlayStation to resolve these problems. We’re so sorry to build up any anticipation for this feature on PlayStation only to change plans at the last minute Cross-Save will still be available on PC, Xbox, Android and iOS in the next few weeks, with Nintendo Switch following at a later date (+ Apple Arcade if we can do so without breaching any privacy commitments).&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>PS: for anyone wanting Cross-Save just to unlock trophies, it’s worth noting that PS Trophies are automatically disabled on a platform level for all games when using a save file from another platform”</em></p>

<p>The cross-save feature will still be coming to PC, Xbox, Android, and iOS in the next game update. It will also be available on Switch later on down the line too.</p>

            <p>
It's another week, and with that comes word of the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> update. The patch isn't ready quite yet, but in a new <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-apr-8/">update check-in</a> post, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/firaxis-games">Firaxis</a> shared that the game's next update is coming April 22nd, just a couple of weeks away. There's a few big changes coming too, so how about we just jump right in. First up is a change to resources. There'll be ten new resources coming to the game, all of which will get their own new narrative events for starters.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Resources will now crop up differently thanks to a "newly added randomized resource generation system." You'll still get key resources in every age, but past that there'll be a wider variety available on the map. Certain resources will also now only be findable on certain continents or hemispheres, with Firaxis hoping that this "gives your maps a little bit more personality and motivation to explore." Treasure resources will also be getting passive effects too.
</p>
<p>
Then there's the changes coming to food. A lot of Civvers (that's what I call Civilization players, I think it's gonna catch on) apparently found that rural population and food wasn't really worth investing in past a certain point, so Firaxis is making some tweaks to make population growth scale "much more smoothly across your campaign, even deep into later Ages. And, growing beyond 8 or 9 rural Population is now very achievable; doing so won’t take hundreds of turns."
</p>
<p>
This update introduces an endless play mode too, so you can keep going with your campaign once you've finished the modern age thanks to a new Just One More Turn option. There's a returning feature from previous Civ games too, Teams Multiplayer, and a bunch of other additions like a repair all option, less natural disasters, and overall quality-of-life improvements.
</p>
<p>
Firaxis also took the time to assure us all by promising that previously mentioned features like auto-explore and new map types are still in the works too, they just won't be in this update. In the meantime, just keep Civving (that's a new verb I just made for when you're playing Civilization, I think it's gonna catch on) it up!

                <p>Nitrome, the developer behind Shovel Knight Dig, has announced a new game called Mouse Work. It is exclusively built around the use of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-joy-cons-have-mouse-like-functionality/1100-6530529/" data-ref-id="1100-6530529">Nintendo Switch 2's mouse controls</a>.</p><p>Mouse Work really embraces the "mouse" idea. It's a party game in which players use Joy-Con 2s in mouse mode to control mice and complete minigames. We see a few of these minigames in action in its debut trailer, such as ones where players pick up and stack boxes, paint the lines that appear on a canvas, close annoying pop-up ads on a PC desktop, shoot asteroids in space, guide rock climbers up a wall, and more.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdhvAqS4bjA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RdhvAqS4bjA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In Mouse Work, each of these minigames is billed as a job that players must complete to earn Cheddar, the game's in-game currency. Players can then use Cheddar to buy new cosmetics for the mouse cursors that players control. The official description reveals that the whole game can be played in either solo or co-op. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/part-time-ufo/" data-ref-id="5000-479012">Part-Time UFO</a> is the title that most immediately comes to mind as a comparable game.</p><p>Mouse Work is notable for being the first built-for-Switch-2 indie game announced in the wake of the system's reveal last week.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> 11.1.5 update is landing April 22, and with it new features like a boss rush mode and the return of Battle for Azeroth's Horrific Visions. However, what players are perhaps most excited about is that the update will finally bake in a UI alternative to one of the game's most popular (and, in the opinion of many WoW players, required) add-ons.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed in a <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24186695/patch-1115-arrives-on-april-22" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, patch 11.1.5 will officially add the Cooldown Manager to the game's customizable UI, giving players far more control over tracking their character's various abilities and buffs. Players will be able to better track their utility cooldowns with a special bar, see easy-to-read meters showing the time remaining on buffs, and more easily watch out for the essential abilities coming off cooldown. It's something the game's default UI has been sorely missing for quite some time, resulting in players turning to free third-party add-ons to meet their needs, specifically an add-on called WeakAuras.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Warcraft/status/1909652467798712806" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The 11.1.5 Content Update goes live April 22!<br>🕷️ Nightfall campaign<br>📊 Cooldown Manager UI Update<br>✨ Winds of Mysterious Fortune Leveling Event<br>🔮 Horrific Visions Revisited - May 20<br>⚔️ Dastardly Duos Event - June 3 <a href="https://t.co/HTgj7RHHbo" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/HTgj7RHHbo</a></p>  — World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1909652467798712806?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">While the Cooldown Manager won't offer quite as much granular customization as WeakAuras (which can get very complex), it does offer much of the basic functionality and benefits of the add-on, minus all the hassle. It's not the first time Blizzard has sought to improve its UI and make it so add-ons feel like less of a requirement. As part of the game's Dragonflight expansion, Blizzard dramatically overhauled the MMORPG's UI and introduced far more customization to it than ever before, significantly reducing the need for players to install popular UI add-ons like Bartender. Over time, Blizzard has continued to update the UI to make it far more usable right out of the box.</p><p dir="ltr">No doubt many players will still use WeakAuras due to how highly customizable it is, but for players who are more casual and don't feel like spending hours setting up WeakAuras for each of their characters, the default Cooldown Manager will be a great alternative.</p><p dir="ltr">As for actual content coming as part of 11.1.5, things will kick off on April 22 with a new scenario and quests revolving around the Flame's Radiance, a new Renown faction that will see players defending Hallowfall from invading Sureki forces. In addition to new cosmetics and a tabard that will change visually as players rise through the Renown ranks, players will also unlock buffs that will make them stronger while in Hallowfall and Azj-Kahet. A leveling event that will grant 20% more XP, as well as a hefty Renown reputation buff for Dragonflight and The War Within factions, will also begin April 22.</p><p dir="ltr">Battle for Azeroth's Horrific Visions feature will return on May 20, allowing players to once again battle through Old God corrupted versions of Stormwind and Orgrimmar to earn not only up to Heroic level gear but also new cosmetics and enchants. Then on June 3, Blizzard will introduce a new feature called Dastardly Duos, a boss rush-style mode that will see players battling against two or more bosses from the game's past at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">WoW's 11.1 update, Undermine(d)</a>, released February 21 and saw players travel to the fabled goblin city, though the Race to World First to clear the Mythic difficulty of the game's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-exploiters-cleared-new-mythic-raid-first-using-grey-items-got-banned-and-then-did-it-again/1100-6530118/" data-ref-id="1100-6530118">Liberation of Undermine raid was disrupted by a group of exploiters</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid/">Metal Gear</a>'s grim and competent special ops protagonist Solid Snake was only grim and quiet thanks to strict tech limitations restricting what his creator, Hideo Kojima, could do with him. Kojima made the comments in a recent interview with Japanese magazine An-An (which <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metal-gear-solid-snakes-silent-tough-guy-personality-was-influenced-by-technical-limitations-of-the-first-game-kojima-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton </a>translated) and said the severe hardware restrictions of the MSX2, which Metal Gear first released on, meant he couldn't get too ambitious with his new creation's emotional profile.</p><p dir="ltr">"It was 1986 when I entered the game industry," Kojima said. "Games still couldn’t speak. Characters did not have voices. Kanji fonts weren’t supported, and you could only show one katakana character at a time. Solid Snake, the protagonist of my debut title Metal Gear (1987), was born as a silent ‘tough guy’ because of these circumstances."</p><p dir="ltr">Those circumstances had changed by the time Kojima and Konami developed Metal Gear Solid in 1998, when Snake had a voice actor and more things to say. However, by that point, Kojima had made Solid Snake's stoic gruffness part of the character's personality. He said he envisioned Snake as a character similar to James Bond or Lupin the Third, delivering "snappy lines" when the situation called for them. Kojima also said he attributed much of the character's popularity to David Hayter's voice work in the English version and Akio Otsuka's in the Japanese release.</p><p dir="ltr">Hayter reprised his role as Solid Snake (and sometimes Big Boss) in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, The Twin Snakes, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, along with a few spin-offs. While his personality remained largely the same, Konami experimented with a more involved role for Snake over the years, with Snake being rather chatty in some games and unusually reticent in others, such as Metal Gear Solid V. However, Kiefer Sutherland voiced Solid Snake in that game.</p><p dir="ltr">His personality in the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake won't change, though--at least in the main campaign. Konami confirmed that the studio is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/30/23742786/metal-gear-solid-delta-3-snake-eater-remake-voice-actors-no-changes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">re-using Metal Gear Solid 3's original voice track</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/">Metal Gear Solid 3: Delta</a>. Hayter, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gears-david-hayter-seemingly-teasing-new-performance-as-snake/1100-6526906/" data-ref-id="1100-6526906">teased new voice work in October 2024</a>, though whether it's for a new Metal Gear game or some sneaky new additions to Metal Gear Solid 3 is anyone's guess.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch.1158687/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Even though it's been in early access for almost a year now, at time of writing, the full release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-second-update-tweaks-major-core-combat-mechanics/">Hades 2</a>, set to arrive sometime later this year, is easily one of the most anticipated releases for 2025.</p>
<p>However, just like the launch of the original Hades, players on Xbox and PlayStation consoles will have to wait to play the full release. During a Creator's Voice video from Nintendo published on Tuesday, Supergiant Games confirmed that Hades 2 will be a Nintendo console-exclusive game at launch.</p>
<p>That means when it arrives at the still unannounced release date, it'll be available on PC, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2. If you don't have any of those devices and only play on a PlayStation or Xbox console, you'll have to wait a little longer to check out the full release of Hades 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="The God-Like Rogue-Like Returns – Hades II – Creator's Voice" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hades 2 was one of the many <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/">third-party games confirmed for Nintendo Switch 2</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 direct last week, though it was not confirmed to be one of the launch titles for the console, as we're still without a release date for the full game.</p>
<p>It arrived on PC in early access on May 6, 2024, and at the time of writing, that one-year anniversary is less than a month away. It wouldn't be the biggest surprise if we didn't have to wait too much longer to hear more about when the 1.0 version of Hades 2 is ready to release.</p>
<p>The original Hades spent almost two years in early access, and while it's entirely plausible the same could happen here, all signs point to Hades 2 being ready for its full launch far ahead of that timeline.</p>
<p>Hades 2 is the first sequel Supergiant Games has ever done, with each of its previous projects being one-and-done titles that have all added to its mythical status as an indie developer that simply does not miss. Early access players are already loving Hades 2 and can't wait for the full release. It is almost surely a lock for one of the games that'll be a part of 2025's Game of the Year conversation.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-time-does-blue-prince-release-start-date-times-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Prince</a> is far from the traditional puzzle title. Dogubomb’s debut project puts you in the shoes of an heir to Mount Holly Manor and features tabletop card game and roguelike exploration elements. The simple objective is to explore all 45 rooms of the house and discover a secret 46th room, but there is a twist.</p>



<p>Each door opens to one of three rooms, and the choice is yours. The floor plan resets at the end of each in-game day, changing the house layout. It’s up to you to discover tools and permanent upgrades to solve the mystery behind the disappearance of a children’s book author and more secrets along the way. And If there is one thing puzzle fans also love, it’s trophy hunting in games. </p>

<p>Every room in Mount Holly Manor features some puzzle, tool, or blueprint to discover. Yet, what makes Blue Prince so unique is that players don’t need to complete every challenge. Every player will experience their own journey based on the map layout. However, this list of achievements applies to everyone and can be completed by following the steps below. </p>



<p>In total, there are eight standard achievements and eight secret achievements. While we have this list of achievements, Dogubomb has remained tight-lipped on what trophies will be available. Yet, completing every achievement above should put you on track to acquire every trophy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/john-carmack-defends-ai-amid-backlash-over-microsofts-generative-quake-ii-demo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>The current generative <em>Quake II</em> demo represents a slight advancement from Microsoft's previous generative AI gaming model (confusingly titled "WHAM" with only one "M") we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/microsofts-new-interactive-ai-world-model-still-has-a-long-way-to-go/">covered in February</a>. That earlier model, while showing progress in generating interactive gameplay footage, operated at 300×180 resolution at 10 frames per second—far below practical modern gaming standards. The new WHAMM demonstration doubles the resolution to 640×360. However, both remain well below what gamers expect from a functional video game in almost every conceivable way. It truly is an AI tech demo.</p>

<p>For example, the technology faces substantial challenges beyond just performance metrics. Microsoft acknowledges several limitations, including poor enemy interactions, a short context length of just 0.9 seconds (meaning the system forgets objects outside its view), and unreliable numerical tracking for game elements like health values.</p>
<p>Which brings us to another point: A significant gap persists between the technology's marketing portrayal and its practical applications. While industry veterans like Carmack and Sweeney view AI as another tool in the development arsenal, demonstrations like the <em>Quake II</em> instance may create inflated expectations about AI's current capabilities for complete game generation.</p>
<p>The most realistic near-term application of generative AI technology remains as coding assistants and perhaps rapid prototyping tools for developers, rather than a drop-in replacement for traditional game development pipelines. The technology's current limitations suggest that human developers will remain essential for creating compelling, polished game experiences for now. But given the general pace of progress, that might be small comfort for those who worry about losing jobs to AI in the near-term.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Sweeney says not to worry: "There’s always a fear that automation will lead companies to make the same old products while employing fewer people to do it," Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1909314230391902611">wrote</a> in a follow-up post on X. "But competition will ultimately lead to companies producing the best work they’re capable of given the new tools, and that tends to mean more jobs."</p>
<p>And Carmack closed with this: "Will there be more or less game developer jobs? That is an open question. It could go the way of farming, where labor-saving technology allow a tiny fraction of the previous workforce to satisfy everyone, or it could be like social media, where creative entrepreneurship has flourished at many different scales. Regardless, “don’t use power tools because they take people’s jobs” is not a winning strategy."</p>

I’m nowhere close to finishing it. The average play times seem to range from 15-25 hours to “beat” the game, but people have kept play for double that to explore every nook and cranny. But I’m far enough to begin “getting” what’s so special about it and can see why it’s being praised by early critics. <br></p><p><em>Blue Prince</em> has a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/blue-prince/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/blue-prince/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic score of 92</a></span> with reviews from just over 20 outlets so far. That puts it at the top of the aggregating site’s ranked list for 2025, and just one point ahead of <em>Split Fiction</em>. This year’s other top-rated games so far include <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, and fellow puzzle adventure <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em>. <em>Blue Prince</em> is much harder to talk about than those games, though, in part because explaining too much can ruin the joy of discovery what’s so great about it, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/outer-wilds-is-one-of-the-best-games-ive-ever-played-1835801654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/outer-wilds-is-one-of-the-best-games-ive-ever-played-1835801654">similar to <em>The Outer Wilds</em></a></span>. </p><p>It’s enough to know the basic premise: you’re exploring a mansion that will be bequeathed to you from a dead relative if you can discover its hidden 46th room. Every time you hit a doorway you can select from a set of rooms to “draft” on the blueprints (Get it? <em>Blue Prince</em>?) for it to appear on the other side. This will impact what resources, clues, and additional doorways you find inside. Once you deplete your “stamina” for the day you go home and rest, coming back the next morning to a completely blank slate to be drafted all over again with the help of everything you’ve learned and new room types you’ve unlocked.</p><p>“Later runs in <em>Blue Prince</em> are less about puzzle solving or deckbuilding, and more about excursionary quests into the house to solve certain puzzles (“Can I somehow get the Boiler Room to connect to the Laboratory?”) or information gathering sessions as you try to piece together a message obliquely scattered across all but one room in the mansion,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://astrolabe.aidanmoher.com/blue-prince-raw-fury-review/?ref=astrolabe-newsletter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://astrolabe.aidanmoher.com/blue-prince-raw-fury-review/?ref=astrolabe-newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes Aidan Moher</a></span>. “It’s about unravelling the spooled mystery behind the mansion and its titular blue prince, a fascist nation, and the cost of freedom. It’s not so much about solving puzzles as it is about understanding the link between agency, experience, and story. Journey before destination.”</p><p>This might not sound like everyone’s cup of tea, but a really nice bonus for <em>Blue Prince</em> is that the it’ll be practically free for millions of players who are already subscribed to Game Pass on Xbox and PC or PS Plus on PlayStation 5. “Polished indie puzzle game with simple mechanics but bold ideas on a subscription service” recalls last year’s<em> Animal Well</em>, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-review-metroidvania-puzzle-2024-goty-1851465730">strong 2024 GOTY contender</a></span> in its own right. But there are two notable distinctions. Calling <em>Blue Prince</em> a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/features/what-the-heck-is-a-metroidbrainia-introducing-the-newest-genre-on-the-block&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/what-the-heck-is-a-metroidbrainia-introducing-the-newest-genre-on-the-block" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metroidbrania</a></span>” would probably make people who use that genre nickname mad, and also <em>Animal Well </em>was <em>only</em> on PS Plus. This time around, players on every platform get to take advantage of a a big day-and-date get for subscription services (except Switch). </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-blizzard-tells-ign-whats-coming-to-diablo-4-in-2025-and-2026-including-new-expansion-new-ranking-system-and-finally-leaderboards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 is set to be a big year for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, Blizzard’s near two-year-old action role-playing game, and that’s despite the delay to its second expansion from this year into 2026. It’s set to launch Season 8 later in April, with Season 9 currently due out in the summer, and Season 10 later in the year. Each will improve the game in key ways, addressing fan feedback and adding long-requested features. And then, looking into 2026, Blizzard will launch Diablo 4’s second expansion, following on from last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred">Vessel of Hatred</a>, add a new ranking system, and, finally, leaderboards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, for the first time ever, Blizzard has published a Diablo 4 roadmap of content, providing fans with the kind of long-term insight into what to expect from the game they’ve never had before. There are even teases for upcoming IP collaborations thrown in there for good measure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why is Blizzard doing this now, and what, exactly, are the juicy details on Diablo 4’s upcoming updates? IGN sat down with game director Brent Gibson to quiz him on all that and more in an exclusive interview to coincide with the roadmap, below.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/06/d4-roadmap-r7-fp01-1-1743949275184.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Diablo 4's 2025 roadmap touches on 2026. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> This [roadmap] is new for Blizzard's Diablo team, right? So there's got to be a reason why you're doing it now for the first time. What are the factors that have gone into you making that decision?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson:</strong> We've never really been in the position to deliver on a roadmap with the game up until now, right? So when we released the base game, we were getting an influx of feedback from the community on what we should be going after. And so we were in this very reactionary, like, let's stay on top of the big emerging issues that are coming out with the game. And we wanted to be in a position by this year to be able to be more proactive and be in a spot where we can predict out to a year on some of our ambitions and what we want to go after, and be able to do it confidently, knowing the types of things we wanted to commit to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so the value of a roadmap is us getting out there saying, 'hey, look, these are the things that we want to go after. We hear you.' We really want to make sure we're going after the things that really matter during the seasons, and create consistency and quality in those releases. And so for the first time, we're actually in a spot where we can see out into that future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>When I think of Diablo historically, it's not as a live service game. It was more, you paid for the game and you had the expansions, and the expansions were a big deal, almost like mini-releases. But for Diablo 4 it does feel different. It feels like more of a live service<strong>. </strong>So I wonder if that creates more of a condition for a roadmap to be appropriate for Diablo 4 as opposed to the previous games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson:</strong> It does. There's a reason why they're called roadmaps, because it literally is a road leading to what we want to do in 2026 with the expansion. A lot of the strengthening of our core from season to season are things that we're building upon, to taking those bigger swings in the expansion itself. And so it's important to us that there is that connectivity. That it is all working out in order and in a plan. And so even though it's not always very transparent about what that plan is, we're hoping that the roadmap is something that shows players those steps that we're taking, so that when we get to the point of announcing the expansion, all those pieces come together.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Do you feel like the audience now when it comes to live service games is hungrier than ever for constant content and constant transparency? Needing to know what's coming at any given moment, and wanting a relentless release of updates? I've been watching the Marvel Rivals team and it's just incredible with the pace of their updates. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-says-its-feeling-social-media-pressure-to-keep-the-game-as-exciting-as-it-has-been-since-december-announced-big-season-3-shake-up">they've just said a new hero every month</a>. Is this just the way things have to be now if you're operating a successful life service? Is it more brutal than ever?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>I definitely feel like gamers are more hungry than they've ever been. And even if you delivered on their appetite today, that appetite will shift tomorrow. And so you just have to be in a really good spot to adapt to that situation. Because a lot of times too, what's important this month is going to be completely different three months from now. The priority of things can shift very, very quickly based on another game release or the state of your own game. Or maybe we've discovered something really cool and we want to be able to get it in there to change the formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so it is definitely a new way of developing. It is definitely high interaction with the community. The interesting thing about Diablo is that we have a lot of different community types, right? We have our casual players, we have our hardcore players. They all fall into subdivisions of types of players inside of that. And so what we look to do is season upon season, look at the things that are important to some of those groups and go after them with focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you take a look at something like what we're doing in Season 8, we know we have a ton of boss lair feedback and so we're adding in the quality of life improvements for those players where that is a big focus of their gameplay type, or we might shift to nightmare dungeons when we're in Season 9. And so it's an opportunity for us to address different groups at different times, leading to an expansion where we're going to be addressing everybody all at once with something big.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>And that's a really nice lead into my next thought on this, which is you are trying to do it all with Diablo 4. It's not just live service with seasons as we're familiar with live service games, but you're also building big paid expansions on top of that. I can only imagine the challenges you must face trying to do everything with Diablo 4 to keep it interesting and everyone engaged. I know the original plan was for an expansion every year, but that's obviously not happening. Is that one of the byproducts of having to do all of this stuff all at the same time, and also trying to do an expansion as well, when most games don't have to think about doing both of those things?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>Yeah, we've learned a lot about what it means to do both at the same time. I feel like we've done a good job at trying to not be beholden to the plan. And so if we needed the extra time for the expansion based on everything we learned on Vessel of Hatred, we're taking the time to focus on the expansion in a responsible way. We don't want to push it out 10 years. That's crazy. But the adjustments you've seen are because of key learnings and the feedback that we're seeing. And some of the strategy you're seeing with what we're doing with seasons is to bring consistency and control in one area so that we can get a little more aggressive in another area. And so the roadmap is a really good example of that where you can see that consistency, while also shifting our focus from activity type to activity type to refresh things for different style of players that have feedback for the game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>So let's let's dig into the roadmap a little bit<strong>. </strong>'Dungeon escalation' — what are we getting there?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>So you'll notice with the roadmap as we make our way out further into the year, the words are fancy and they have some meaning and they have intent. You could see in that season that the word 'dungeon,' we're going to be focusing on dungeons here, right? You got new nightmare dungeon activities that are in this mix as well. We know that nightmare dungeons, or dungeons in general is the bread and butter of Diablo, is playing that procedural content. And based on a lot of feedback, variety and challenge is one of those things that is a major ask for bringing nightmare dungeons back into the spotlight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so even though I'm not going to share the details that far out, you can see that the spirit of our intent is going to address that part of our game. The idea there for that season is about challenge and variety and that's the goal that the team has, and they're in development of that right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Part of the sentiment among the core community is that Diablo 4 isn't hard enough. Is that season about addressing some of that feedback?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>Yeah, and it's not exclusive to that season. We met as a team at the very beginning of the year and bringing challenge back into the spotlight is something that we're focusing on over the course of all the seasons. And how does a statement like that apply from activity to activity in our game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You're seeing with Season 8, we're bringing a lot of challenge back into the boss lairs, and trying to make sure that difficulty is something that we're keeping an eye on, while also not losing sight of accessibility. Because this is a game where we got a lot of people come in just to blast and relax. And so we don't want it to be an experience that is hard at the sacrifice of fun. But we know that areas in our game that we can tackle that in a way that will be good for the casuals and great for the blasters, and we should be in a good spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>It must be a really tricky balancing act.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>Yeah. If we did that to the game as a whole, it would not service our goal. This is one of the reasons why our difficulty system has such a wide band in it, all the way from easy to the later stage in Torment. The goal isn't to just say we're dialing everything up. That is not the case. It is to take a look at the progression of a character and look at those spots where we can create an additional spike that is appreciated by the audience that just needs that one last little push, right? And so that's the way that we've been looking at it, is more of like, how does the entire curve play across our broader audience, and not sacrificing one audience for the other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Console keyboard and mouse support also caught my eye. How come it took so long?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>I can't answer on why it took this long from a deep level. But it's one of the things that the players have been asking for quite a bit, and now that we are starting to get into the groove with the ongoing development of the game, we're in a spot where we can start addressing issues like that and bring something new to the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My son was super happy because he's converted to a keyboard and mouse guy but he loves his console. And so, being in a position where we can create more access to all different types of players is very important to us. Accessibility is huge for us. We put a ton of attention on it. We don't want the hardware to be the barrier. So we implement anything we can to create that quality of life, and I think this is going to be a pretty big one in that season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>I know this is probably not something you can talk deeply about, but people get excited by new IP collabs, and there's two of them in there. People might think of silly stuff, start talking about Microsoft stuff, Activision stuff and all sorts. Is there anything you can say about what people can expect, or maybe how you approach them and what's right and what isn't right for Diablo 4?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>When you think about Diablo, it is one of <em>the</em> dark fantasy IPs, right? And as developers, we're also fans of lots of other IPs that are that power fantasy of being in that dark gothic universe. So you can imagine that there's a pretty heavy influence that is even beyond Diablo itself in that regard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the heart of the game we're role-playing through those dark fantasies. And so I think something you can expect is us reaching out to other IPs that fit really well inside of our universe, and we can do some really cool cosmetic stuff and make it really exciting. But it's not anything that is actually going to betray the brand, right? We talk a lot about, 'hey, when's the French Fries sword coming?' We are avoiding the French Fries sword at all costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so we really selected the collaborations we're looking at very carefully. Even though I don't want to expose what we're doing coming up, it is one of those things where it's like it, it's going to be fun, it's going to be super cool, it is totally Diablo. And so once it goes live, hopefully you'll log in and check it out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>I play a lot of Call of Duty and COD has this thing where the mil-sim fans are like, 'I hate that there are lizards and dragons and fairies and unicorns shooting me.' In the context of everything that's happened with Activision Blizzard in the last couple of years, some fans are worried that's going to happen to Diablo. But from the sounds of things it's not going to end up like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>No. That is absolutely counter to our goal. And so when we're looking at these things, we take a really hard look at making sure that the things that we're bringing to the table, our fans are also fans of. So there's never a moment where you're like, 'wait, really? That's in there?' And so we're holding the line on that. I say holding the line, but we're all aligned on it. There's no question that this is the way that we want to approach it. And the one we have coming up in Season 8 is pretty cool and very spot on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Is there anything in September to December that players should be excited for or should be keeping an eye out for?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>Season 10 is a really good example of us taking a hard look at not only the activities that need to get refreshed because their role has maybe waned in popularity, but also looking at the things that are working really well and continuing to invest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Infernal Horde is one of the most popular activities in the entire game. People really enjoy playing it. They put tons of hours into it. So we're going to take the opportunity to also give it a little bit of love and put a little more player choice options out there for you to have in the experience and plus that up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so very similar to what we did with Helltide very early on where it's like, yeah it's going well, but we're still gonna do something more. Not only are we shoring things up, but we're gonna continue to push some of our activities forward. Season upon season, I really like the idea of us keeping our house in order as we're making our way through the 2025 year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>So now the juicy stuff. Before we talk about new expansion, there's a new ranking system and leaderboards in 2026. Finally! I mean it's next year, but still at least it's coming and we know now. What can you tell me about the leaderboards and the new ranking system?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>I can talk about it philosophically. I remember having the conversation: 'we want to be able to say leaderboard when we come out with this roadmap, even if it is a year out, right?' The important thing to us is that players know that we're listening, but we want to make sure that we get it right. Doing a leaderboard is really, really challenging. When we took a first stab at it with Gauntlet, we learned a lot of things with Gauntlet. We had a lot of new power being injected into expansion one, so that led us to take a breath and see where we're at with classes and bring that back into harmony. And now that we're here, we're like, 'OK, what's the right way to do this?'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we're investing into leaderboards as we move forward. I won't exactly say how. That will be revealed as time passes by, but we want to work with the community on getting to a place where we've done it right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we also know that leaderboards speak to the very upper echelon of our players, and so we want to also introduce something that speaks to everybody. And so this is where we want to have a system that also tells you, 'hey, as you're playing, as you're building your character, how are you doing? Where do you sit rank wise with the rest of the world?' And being able to have a very casual, friendly understanding of am I good or not? Am I doing good or not, right? And so it was important that we deliver both parts of that equation together so that there is something for everybody. And then there's that hard, aspirational go get it at the very end as well. I am super excited about the designs that we've been talking about, and we've been iterating on this for quite some time, and hopefully in the near future we can talk some details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Exciting. OK, new expansion. Is there anything that you can say about that, for the fans?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Brent Gibson: </strong>I definitely can say that there's a lot coming in the expansion. What we did with Vessel of Hatred was fantastic and just the beginning. And as we've learned from that. We feel like we're even more on the money with what we need to do with the second expansion. We have a whole team dedicated to getting ready to start announcing stuff over a really great campaign, to let you know what's going in on this. We're paying attention to it right now. The team is just like, that is priority number one. And so they've been putting all their heart and energy into making sure that it is the best release we've had.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on what we're talking about before, we're taking that time to steady the core season to season so that this expansion is the biggest expansion we've delivered yet. So, feeling really great about it. I'm dying to talk more about it. Can't at this time, but hopefully very soon we can revisit this chat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
