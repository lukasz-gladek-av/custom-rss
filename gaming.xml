                <p>It looks like buildcrafting is going to be a major feature in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a>, as Gearbox claims that the game has more skills per character than the previous two main games put together. At Borderlands Fan Fest, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford and chief creative officer Randy Varnell were on stage to reveal more details about the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-story-trailer-shows-off-the-sinister-timekeeper-and-claptrap/1100-6532590/">following the debut of a new story trailer</a> that put the spotlight on the sinister Timekeeper.</p><p>"You'll find more skills per character than in Borderlands 3 and 2 added together, it's a lot of complexity and depth per character," Pitchford said. "We're working late on Fridays for you," he added.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>According to Varnell, the skill trees are so varied that players could take the same character and action skill into a fight and still be able to fulfill different roles in a firefight. This is a big departure from Borderlands 3, where action skills were generally tied to certain playstyles and didn't offer much room for improvisation.</p><p>As for the overall numbers, players could be looking at a very in-depth system for all the skills they can play around with. For example, Borderlands 2 had up to 10 skills per skill tree for each character, while Borderlands 3 offered four skill trees and up to 20 skills for each one across various tiers. A lot of these skills focused on buffing characters when certain actions were performed, with reduced ability cooldowns, rapid healing, and action-skill enhancements being offered for the right build.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with the standard version of the game priced at $70. A Switch 2 version is also coming at a later date.</p><p>"This feels like a Borderlands game through and through where enough has changed for me to feel like this is an improvement over Borderlands 3, but it's not so different that I can expect huge and sweeping changes," Jordan Ramée said in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">Borderlands 4 preview</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developer Build a Rocket Boy has reportedly started the layoff process at the studio, after an underperforming launch.</p>
<p>The report, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">written by IGN</a>, states the developer has informed staff the redundancy process has begun, with sources claiming over 100 employees could be impacted.</p>
<p>A source who wished to remain anonymous told IGN the 45-day consultation process had begun, which according to UK law kicks into effect when over 100 layoffs are planned within a 90-day window.</p>

<p>This news comes after a launch which disappointed many eager fans waiting to play the game that had, originally, been touted as a rival to Grand Theft Auto. The game, since its release, has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">plagued with bugs, performance issues</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-crashes-caused-by-a-memory-leak-developer-says-as-it-remains-committed-to-ensuring-all-players-have-a-great-experience">crashes</a>, and what many have called 'dated design'. Right now MindsEye is rated Mostly Negative on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-hotfix-planned-for-pc-this-week-but-console-players-may-have-to-wait">though a hotfix has been released</a> to improve the game for those still eager to give it a try. However, even after the patch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-mindseye-has-abject-technical-performance-even-after-its-latest-patch">things are still far from perfect</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">CEO of Build a Rocket Boy suggested negative reviews had been paid for</a>, though the publisher of MindsEye <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-publisher-doesnt-believe-negative-comments-were-paid-for-despite-developer-suggesting-otherwise">did not share this belief when asked by IGN</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">Eurogamer's review of MindsEye</a>, writer Rick Lane wrote: "although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-developer-reportedly-prepping-for-layoffs-after-botched-launch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>THQ Nordic has announced their 2025 Digital Showcase will take place on 1st August, featuring a bunch of the games that will be featured, and potentially teasing more about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/darksiders-is-back-watch-the-teaser-now/">the upcoming Darksiders project</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="THQ Nordic | Save The Date 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-UWm3y-ndc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Included in the trailer were clips of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/reanimal-revealed-by-the-makers-of-little-nightmares-tarsier/">Reanimal</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/11/wreckreations-new-trailer-is-all-about-building-tracks-racing-together/">Wreckreation</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/14/wreckfest-2-content-update-1-brings-tracks-cars-patch-notes/">Wreckfest 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/see-the-first-gameplay-trailer-for-titan-quest-2/">Titan Quest II</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/the-eternal-life-of-goldman-is-a-platformer-with-a-wonderful-ligne-claire-art-style/">The Eternal Life of Goldman</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/is-the-gothic-1-remake-a-gothic-revival-or-a-gothic-ruin/">Gothic’s remake</a>, and maybe one or two more that I missed.</p>
<p>OK, so it doesn’t seem that Darksiders is included in the trailer itself – the dark fantasy imagery would be more Titan Quest II – but they do tell everyone to “saddle your horses” in the trailer blurb. You know who rides horses? The four horsemen, of course.</p>
<p>“This year’s showcase promises a feast of world premiere announcements, fresh updates on previously announced titles, and a few surprises we didn’t hint at already… or did we?” the company writes.</p>

<p>The stream will kick off<span dir="auto"> Friday 1st August 1st &nbsp;at 12:00 PM PDT / 3:00 PM EDT / 8:00 PM BST / </span><span dir="auto">21:00</span><span dir="auto"> CEST / 10:00 PM EEST.</span></p>

            <p>Sorry, we're not done yet, CD Projekt has said about a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> update that also represents that same phrase, it being about the third patch to be labelled the final one the game'll be getting. Update 2.3 was originally set to be dropping on this week, but now it's been delayed so the devs can make it about the same size as its predecessor.</p>
<p>Yeah, they're probably adding more stuff to the pile of new things we never thought Cyberpunk'd still be getting at this stage. We're multiple encores deep in the Samurai gig at this point, but hey, the crowd's still having a great time.</p>

<p>"We initially hoped to put Update 2.3 in your hands on June 26th," the studio wrote in a post addressed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SX5CJ2hN_c">choom nation</a>, "However, we'll need some more time to make sure we're happy with it — we're aiming for a scope similar to Update 2.2. We'll update you further as soon as we can!"</p>
<p>So, no new details about what to expect in this next patch, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oh-it-turns-out-cyberpunk-2077-is-getting-one-more-update-after-all-and-its-not-too-far-away">was announced</a> alongside Cyberpunk making its debut on a certain new console made by a company often associated with the profession you enlist if your loo's clogged. Well, aside from the fact it's apparently going to about as beefy as its predecessor, the previous holder of the 'last Cyberpunk patch, for realsies' title.</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes, an infectious digital virus can be a good thing, like when your brainrot spreads to all your friends’ video game consoles and they finally play a game you’ve been yelling about for a decade. Last week, after the previews went up for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677"><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></a></span>, I looked on my shelf for my copy of <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em>, the excellent, underrated 2016 RPG that marries monster-taming and a detective serial story. I was devastated to see that I no longer had the game, so I went to PlayStation Network to buy it there, only to find Bandai Namco had apparently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.siliconera.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-appears-to-have-been-delisted-in-north-america/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.siliconera.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-appears-to-have-been-delisted-in-north-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delisted the game from PlayStation’s online stores in 2018</a></span>! Thankfully, it’s been ported to PC and Switch, and I found the Switch <em>Complete Edition</em> that contains both the base game and its parallel story follow-up, <em>Hacker’s Memory, </em>was on sale <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V42555Q?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-switch-pc-sale-hacker-memory-1851784914&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B07V42555Q" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">on Amazon</a></span> for $25, which is half off. Now I’m infecting all my friends with my same brainrot by gifting them copies, and others have been joining in on the collective playthrough because FOMO is a powerful influence. Even better, the <em>Complete Edition</em> is currently on sale for $4.49 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-complete-edition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-complete-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">through Fanatical</a></span>.

Though the game is built upon the same mythology as the rest of the series, <em>Cyber Sleuth </em>is a standalone story that anyone can enjoy. Admittedly, the turn-based battles are pretty rote (<em>Time Stranger </em>is a pretty big improvement, based on what I played at Summer Game Fest), but their simplicity means they don’t get in the way of the real meat: the detective story and dense monster-taming mechanics.</p><p>Even if you’re not looking for a critter collectathon, <em>Cyber Sleuth</em>’s biggest draw is its <em>Persona</em>-esque vibes and its elaborate mystery. As the title suggests, you play as a digital detective who is investigating a virtual reality world called EDEN, where users are logging in and ending up in a comatose state in the real world. The titular digital monsters are also running rampant through the program, and as the lines between real and digital begin to blur, it’s up to you and your friends to get to the bottom of the calamity that threatens both worlds. It’s got a lot of moving parts, but it all comes together in a really satisfying fashion by the end of its roughly 50-hour run.</p><p><em>Hacker’s Memory</em>, meanwhile, is a parallel story that follows a hacker who is dealing with all this nonsense from a different perspective, and is best played after <em>Cyber Sleuth,</em> as its story overlaps with the original. It’s another 50 hours or so of digital detective work, and while it’s not quite as impactful, it’s still a great, meaty addition to a game that deserves more players. With sales this cheap and <em>Time Stranger </em>on the way, there’s never been a better time to give one of the best <em>Digimon </em>games a shot.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-switch-pc-sale-hacker-memory-1851784914]]></content:encoded>

Yang writes, "why should New Yorkers have all the fun?&nbsp;Now through the timeless magic of video games, anyone can&nbsp;don't rank Cuomo!" The game quickly gets tricky, with entries not in English or ballot positions that swiftly move around, all with a time limit to ramp up the pressure. Despite this, it's pretty forgiving, giving you opportunities to try again if you mis-click or run out of time.</p><p>Yang wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/radiatoryang.bsky.social/post/3lsa4bx2frs2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a> that the mods of the "NYC" reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1lhmn09/hey_i_made_a_free_little_web_browser_game_for_new/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deleted a link</a> to the game, which is very funny but also coincidentally highlights how contentious this race has been. The <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2025/06/pro-cuomo-pac-responsible-nearly-half-all-outside-spending-across-all-nyc-primary-elections-year/406209/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monied Cuomo camp</a> has gone on a campaign to discredit Mamdani, who has the best chance of taking him on, while everyone else has been <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/cuomo-opponents-remind-new-yorkers-sexual-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desperately trying to remind voters</a> that, whoever you favor, you don't have to rank Cuomo just because you've heard his name before.  </p><p>Through how frequently Cuomo's name slipped under my mouse cursor, Yang's game points to how hard Cuomo is working to make New Yorkers feel like they have to vote for him. But the game also highlights the way in which NYC's ranked choice system gives voters more options than just "vote for a bad guy" or "stay home." More than just hoping your preferred candidate wins, you can use your ranked choice ballot to actively cast a vote <em>against</em> a candidate you dislike. Our political system can look like more than just sighing heavily and holding our noses. If you're in NYC, Tuesday's primary is a small chance to put a different system into action. </p><p>Both <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/andrew-cuomo-fight-and-deliver-party/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cuomo</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/03/eric-adams-reelection-independent-00267865?ref=fast-politics.ghost.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Adams</a> will likely end up on November's mayoral ballot regardless of how Tuesday's primary goes, though the <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/04/03/working-families-party-general-election-candidate-mayor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Working Families Party</a> has plans to challenge them there too. So whatever happens Tuesday, things are far from decided. If you're in NYC and haven't voted yet, please (safely) brave tomorrow's heat to do so, and encourage those you know to do so too. And if you aren't a New Yorker, you can live our horrors, but also our joys, vicariously through a video game from the comfort of your computer.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/siivagunner-youtube-channel-high-quality-rips"><h3>SiIvaGunner Is An Elaborate Game Music Joke Collective And One Of The Best Parts Of YouTube</h3></a><p>SiIvagunner started as YouTube elaborate in-joke about game music on YouTube and has evolved into a volunteer, Discord-managed democratic artist collective.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-update-scylla-sirens-new-song"><h3>New Scylla Songs!</h3></a><p>"Now we've got you in our tentacles"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/dont-rank-cuomo-video-game]]></content:encoded>

It’s not your traditional hunting experience--it’s more akin to Pokemon than it is traditional Monster Hunter games--but the series earned positive reviews thanks to its strategic turn-based combat and charming cast of characters. There are over 100 Monsties--the name for monsters in these games--to join forces with in each game, and the majority of them are rideable.</p><hr><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-four-discontinued-donkey-kong-lego-sets-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6532560/">All Four Discontinued Donkey Kong Lego Sets Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-preorder-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530595/">Donkey Kong Bananza Game &amp; Amiibo Bundle Available At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-carries-nintendo-games-again-including-new-switch-2-exclusives/1100-6532451/">Amazon Carries Nintendo Games Again, Including New Switch 2 Exclusives</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-bogo-50-off-movie-sale-includes-brand-new-4k-blu-ray-steelbooks-box-sets/1100-6529351/">Amazon BOGO 50% Off Movie Sale Includes Brand-New 4K Steelbooks &amp; Box Sets</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Shadow Labyrinth is an enigma.</p><p>It should be simple enough to describe: It's a "2D action exploration &amp; combat platformer," or "2DAECP"--which is Bandai's Namco official description and its way of saying "metroidvania" without mentioning a word made by combining two rival games' names--in which a mysterious amnesiac follows a small yellow robot through a labyrinth of tough battles and tight platforming. Like other games in the genre, the path here is well-trodden; there's side-scrolling exploration across a big map that opens as you unlock new abilities, and lots of enemies to fight along the way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Shadow Labyrinth Maze Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>What you won't expect, however, is the story Bandai Namco is telling around the Metroi--sorry, 2DAECP--it has devised. It's known that this game directly ties into the Pac-Man-themed episode of Amazon Prime's animated Secret Level series, but it's the rest of the lore that turned my head during a recent virtual preview session. The 2DAECP space is crowded right now, but Bandai Namco may have found a way to rise above the rest with Shadow Labyrinth; you'll just have to brush up on your gaming history.</p><p>Before that, though, let's dig into the meat of what you're going to be doing in the game. My preview gave me access to a portion of combat and platforming challenges, with two boss fights waiting for me at the end. I began, naturally, with the exploration section, which dropped me into an area known as the Land of the Fugitives.</p><p>The core gameplay on offer here in Shadow Labyrinth is standard 2DAECP fare; I had multiple paths to explore, each with their own trials and tribulations, until I found what I was looking for and headed back to where I began. The demo gave me three different branches, each holding the piece to a key I needed to advance, but each also centered on one of three unique challenges: combat, platforming, and puzzle-solving.</p><p>The combat trial was a gauntlet of weird large-headed enemies wielding knives and swords. Shadow Labyrinth's combat is easy to pick up--one button delivers quick sword strikes, the other a more powerful move that briefly depletes a stamina bar--but far from simple to master. These enemies are devious, with some trapping me in a corner and whipping me to death, while others would aim to shoot not where I was standing, but where they predicted I would be; they were about 50/50 in that regard. I found the trial challenging without being frustrating, and it felt great to get through the final wave and get the key piece.</p><p>The environmental puzzle, while fine, didn't leave as much of an impression on me, but the platforming was the most challenging and rewarding part of the whole demo. It feels like the developers put a ton of thought into trying to predict how players would approach each level, and then they designed their obstacles around that, rather than just placing enemies and traps on each stage. This meant I had to strategize, think before moving, and approach each dangerous obstacle with care; the game actively punishes mindless traversal, and that's how a game like this should be.</p><p>I also enjoyed the "D-Line" parts of the stage--or when my traversal turned into a small game of Pac-Man, and I had to travel on lines of light in order to proceed. These provided a welcome shot of variety during exploration, with a chaser of nostalgia for classic Pac-Man gameplay to boot.</p><p>Nostalgia is at the heart of Shadow Labyrinth, and it's here that I'll now address the absolutely bonkers story framing all of the exploration and fighting. As the Amazon Prime show established, the small yellow robot named Puck is trying to escape the world it's trapped in, and he must recruit warriors to do so. I play as Swordsman No. 8, the eighth attempt at escape and victory, and together we explored and fought our way through.</p><p>That's only scratching the surface, though, as there are layers to this tale that I never expected. For example, were you aware, dear reader, that every classic sci-fi game Bandai Namco ever made was part of a <a href="https://ugsf-series.com/en/" rel="nofollow ">single canonical timeline</a>? Before this preview event, I knew nothing of it, but Bandai Namco claims it has always operated on this timeline in secret--the veracity of this claim is up for debate, but damn if it isn't interesting either way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4519133-shadow-labyrinth-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519133" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4519133-shadow-labyrinth-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519133"></a><figcaption>Meeting the Bosconians.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4519133-shadow-labyrinth-2.jpg"></figure><p>As Shadow Labyrinth sits toward the end of this potentially-decades-old story, it is filled with references and allusions to games that came before it. A few examples:</p><ul><li>The tribe of friendly human characters I encountered are called the Bosconians.</li><li>The queen refers to my character, whose identity is still a mystery at this point, as a Galaxian.</li><li>She also references a potential foe named Emperor Galaga.</li><li>The Pac-Man robot's name, Puck, is a reference to Puck-Man, which was Pac-Man's original name.</li><li>Enemies encountered during the demo included Pookas and Fygars from Dig Dug.</li></ul><p>These are the less overt examples that some may not pick up on, while other references are much more obvious. I fought two different bosses during this demo, one at the end of the exploration part and the second from the specific save file provided by Bandai Namco. Both of them directly referenced a previous Bandai Namco project; first up was G-HOST, a small pink ghost-looking creature stuck to a machine controlling massive hooks that crashed on top of me. Pac-Man is pretty important to the lore, of course, so it's not surprising to see one of his ghostly enemies appear here.</p><p>The other boss, meanwhile, blew the "self-referential" concept wide open. This was a hulking beast of a humanoid monster wearing a distinct Jason Voorhess-esque white mask and named Jen. If your horror bells are ringing, that's because Jen was the damsel-in-distress of the Splatterhouse franchise, and her hero, Rick Taylor, wore a distinct Jason Voorhees-esque white mask as he tore demons and humanoid monsters in twain. Splatterhouse doesn't appear on the timeline I shared earlier, so how deep into the Bandai Namco vault is Shadow Labyrinth planning to go?</p><p>There is no shortage of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-metroidvania-games/2900-4005/">metroidvania games</a> out there at the moment--and there are more coming with both Hollow Knight: Silksong and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond set to launch new entries this year. How, then, can a game enter this crowded space and stand out? Bandai Namco may have cracked the code with Shadow Labyrinth: Make the story so incredibly wild that it can't be missed. It helps that the 2DAECP surrounding this bonkers tale is fun and challenging, so you'll be encouraged to keep traveling deeper down this Pac-rabbit hole.</p><p>I didn't know what to expect when dropping into Shadow Labyrinth for this preview event. After my time playing, I still don't know what's coming, and the game is all the more appealing for it.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> team has delayed its upcoming 2.3 update.</p>
<p>This update was casually announced earlier this month, when CD Projekt revealed  "we are planning another part for the game". At this time, the update was slated for a 26th June release, with more details to come closer to that date.</p>

<p>However, with three days to go before that aforementioned release, CD Projekt has said it needs "more time" to make sure it is totally happy with it.</p>
<p>"We're aiming for a scope similar to Update 2.2," the Cyberpunk 2077 team <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1937135894978253112">wrote on social media</a>. Thanking the community for its patience, the developer said it will "update [us] further as soon as we can", so stay tuned.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-22-adds-new-secrets-expanded-customisation-options-and-more">Cyberpunk 2077's 2.2 update was released towards the end of last year</a>, and included various new features and quality of life improvements, as well as what the developer teased as "secrets". These, it turns out, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-night-city-infiltrated-by-balatros-giggling-joker-in-22-update-secret">included a little nod to Balatro</a>.

<p>Rumours that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-cdpr-isnt-actually-finished-with-cyberpunk-2077-announces-another-update">Cyberpunk 2077 would be getting more content started making the rounds earlier this month</a>, when a LinkedIn post from a developer at Virtuous was circulated online. This post said the developer was working on Cyberpunk 2077 DLC, something that hadn't been announced yet.</p>

			<p>With the Switch 2’s launch came <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/gamecube-games-join-nintendo-switch-online-exclusive-to-switch-2/">a new library of games for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a>, Nintendo finally bringing GameCube games to the subscription service in a way that is honestly pretty great. And with a new generation of console has come a new generation of recreation controller from Nintendo, a thoroughly authentic GameCube controller that’s been updated and&nbsp;kitted out with direct support for the Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>It honestly looks fantastic, a true GameCube controller in all its multi-coloured glory, and with modern innards it can be wireless without a double AA battery bay, and still have a thick rumble motor. Putting it side-by-side with an original controller, the sticks feel nigh on identical in use, there’s the same internal springy twang from the chunky analogue triggers, but there’s also the tightness of a new controller for things like the D-Pad (which is still small and impractical, but slightly less mushy). It’s very nice.</p>



<p>And for the GameCube library that will gradually grow on Switch Online, it’s perfect. It’s things like having analogue triggers for air braking in F-Zero GX, like having the Y button right next to A so you can boost without employing some bizarre claw grip on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/16/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review/">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> (or more likely modifying the button layout in the emulator).</p>
<p>But that’s its one and only real use on Nintendo Switch 2. Perhaps the most disappointing thing with this recreated GameCube controller is that controllers have moved on so much in the last 25 years. There’s a standardised form with triggers and shoulder buttons on both sides, with multiple menu and system buttons, with clicking analogue sticks… and the GameCube controller just cannot keep up without some hefty modification.</p>

<p>Nintendo goes halfway. There’s the Switch Home, Capture and the new C button, as well a sneaky little ZL button, all flush and colour matched on the top side of the controller where you can’t normally see them while playing.</p>

<p>That helps with using the Switch 2 system, but not far enough that this is universally compatible with modern games. So many games use stick clicks these days, and this would absolutely affect how the GameCube sticks feel were it implemented here. More annoying is that there’s no – button, which is so commonly used for a game menu or map alongside the + or Start button. That tiny ZL could easily have been made to match the Z button on the right side, as well. Additionally, outside of games that support a traditional game rumble – namely the Switch Online library and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate – the way that HD Rumble is transmitted to controllers is incompatible with this gamepad.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s just as Nintendo said it would be. This is almost exclusively useful for Nintendo Switch Online’s new library of GameCube games, where it will be the best way to play thanks to the quirky face button layout. It’s just less expected when the GameCube pad looks much more like a modern pad, compared to the funky tri-point N64 controller.</p>
<p>And that’s what dramatically shrinks the gamepad’s value, in my opinion. You can find cheap GameCube-like controllers from the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate craze that don’t adhere so strictly to the design and have all the system buttons. Sure, they’re bound to feel cheaper, they’re less accurate to the original design, but they also don’t cost £59, and can be used more properly for more Switch games.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 GameCube Controller is a great-feeling recreation of a classic gamepad, furnished with some extra hidden buttons to make it a shade more modern, but it’s too limited to use outside of the Switch Online game library.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6a5af47b64c4/mario-kart-world-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are back with the latest look at the UK physical charts, and, what do you know, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has found itself in pole position for the third week running.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 biggie may be leading the pack once again, but its supporting cast still follows closely behind it, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> all landing in the top 10. Oh yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is still putting in a strong performance too, moving up to fourth and proving no other pesky series entry will be enough to harm its seemingly endless sales pull.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">RAIDOU Remastered</a> makes its chart debut at eighth, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> continues to climb back towards the top 10 ahead of its Switch 2 expansion arriving next month.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the full top 40 for this week, with platform breakdowns for all of the titles available on other consoles as well as the Switch and Switch 2:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/343?utm_source=MergeMail&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=mergemail-campaign-439411">latest patch</a> for <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-controversial-267-pve-mode-will-at-least-be-given-for-free-to-edge-of-darkness-owners/">Escape From Tarkov</a> adds plenty of fixes and improvements based directly on feedback from players, addressing several highly requested quality of life features, fixes for enemy AI in both PvE and PvP, and audio.</p>
<p>Developer Battlestate Games says that the "<em>audio engine systems and its individual subsystems have been significantly expanded to provide a more immersive Escape from Tarkov experience.</em>"</p>
<p>Battlestate Games warns that while the patch "<em>has gone through several stages of testing,</em>" it still isn't the final version, so players could still experience "<em>unexpected audio behavior in various situations</em>."</p>
<p>The studio is releasing this patch as another stage in its testing for these fixes, adding that "<em>this stage is necessary to collect feedback and do more tests on a diverse variety of players' hardware and software. We are already preparing a set of fixes for the upcoming updates and your feedback and detailed issue reports will help us in refining and stabilizing the system for all players</em>."</p>
<p>Here's the full list of fixes coming for audio, AI, and the quality of life improvements for Escape from Tarkov from the latest patch notes:</p>
<h3>Audio</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Readjusted the sound subsystem that checks for obstructions between the listener and the source:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Improved the sound processing between the listener and the source when the source was behind obstacles: uneven terrain, rocks, vehicles, crates, and other environmental elements;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed several issues where various sounds were processed and muffled incorrectly;</em><br>
<em>Improved the sound penetration processing inside and outside interiors with walls of different thickness</em></li>
<li><em>Improved the sound penetration processing between floors of buildings and on stairways;</em></li>
<li><em>Improved the occlusion of interactive windows and doors;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Reduced the loudness of bushes in first and third person;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed the cause of the missing announcer warnings upon using the interactive buttons in The Lab;</em></li>
<li><em>Improved the sound occlusion on various locations to enhance the detail.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Improved the interaction of bots with doors;</em></li>
<li><em>PMC bots will now try to avoid areas where the location Bosses initially spawn and are less likely to engage in combat with them;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed several issues where bots could walk down stairs or other uneven surfaces faster than usual;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed the causes for bots appearing in the air or in the ground;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed the specific situations in which bots would tilt their weapons upwards for no reason;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed the issues in which Boss guards and PMC bots were friendly to each other;</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed several issues in which The Goons would appear on multiple locations at the same time in PvE.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Quality of Life</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Added an item search window with the ability to find items in stash by category or by name;</em></li>
<li><em>Eyewear and masks with the flash protection stat now reduce the glare effects from light sources. Items with this stat have also been rebalanced;</em></li>
<li><em>Added the display of in-game raid time when pressing the [O] key by default;</em></li>
<li><em>Added the ability to automatically convert currency if not having enough when purchasing an item;</em></li>
<li><em>Added the highlighting of attachments that are available for purchase from traders on the weapon build screen;</em></li>
<li><em>Added the ability to pin the tasks at the top of the list on the task tab;</em></li>
<li><em>Added a warning when attempting to start a raid with a task item in the inventory;</em></li>
<li><em>Rebalanced the sensitivity and zooming ability of optical sights;</em></li>
<li><em>Improved the usability of specific optical and thermal sights;</em></li>
<li><em>Added nape protection for Redut series body armor (Redut-M, Redut-T5). The cost of these armors has been adjusted;</em></li>
<li><em>Transition to another location will now count for all tasks with an objective to survive and extract;</em></li>
<li><em>Rebalanced the operation of the RShG-2 rocket launcher.</em></li>
</ul>

            <p>Ashly Burch has played numerous video game characters, one of her most famous being Aloy in Guerrilla's Horizon series. Earlier this year, footage leaked showing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-experimenting-with-ai-powered-playstation-characters-ironically-chooses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate">Sony employee engaging with an on-screen AI version of the Horizon lead</a>. The employee asked the AI Aloy a number of questions, such as "how are you", to which the character replied she was ok, before she shared some Horizon lore. </p>
<p>The whole thing raised a few eyebrows, especially considering Aloy is a character growing up in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by rogue AI-controlled machines.</p>
<p>Burch herself released a video following this leak, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-forbidden-west-actress-ashly-burch-responds-to-sonys-controversial-ai-aloy">developer Guerrilla had been in contact with her to say the "demo didn't reflect anything that was actively in development"</a>. She additionally added Sony "didn't use any of [Burch's] performance" for the demo. But, how would she feel if AI <em>was </em>used in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-casually-confirms-horizon-forbidden-west-sequel">the next Horizon game</a>?</p>

<p>"For me, I think that AI as a tool to make things easier on devs would be a great thing. Like, I think I've heard someone say before something like, 'oh, if we used artificial intelligence to help with clean up between the mo-cap stage and importing it into the actual game engine, that could be amazing'. So, things that help streamline the development process [and] help make people's jobs easier, I think is great," Burch told Eurogamer.</p>
<p>That being said, for Burch, "in terms of if someone asked me 'can we make a replica of you that players could interact with ad nausium'," she would "<em>really</em> have to know how [the developer] was going to protect against me saying something awful". This is, of course, something Epic got into hot water with earlier this year, when its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-now-lets-you-chat-with-darth-vader-using-generative-ai-speech">use of AI to recreate James Earl Jones' voice for Fortnite's Darth Vader saw many using the technology to get the Sith lord to cuss</a>.</p>
<p>Burch believes the use of AI "would have to be a conversation" with those involved. "It's such a new technology, so it's difficult to know what applications developers would want to use it for," she said, before adding: "Guerrilla really cares about performance in its games, and I think a universe where Guerrilla just replaces every single actor they have with a robot is not going to happen."</p>
<p>However, Burch says there are some studios who do want to use AI to "generate what they want when they want".</p>
<p>"So, it becomes a conversation of 'what do you want to use this for, what are you trying to get out of this technology. Are you trying to <em>replace </em>my performance? Or are you trying to streamline your process or trying to find out in the pre-production phase how things would sound in my voice?' I think it becomes a 'use case' thing for me."</p>
<p>Burch additionally wants others to get the chances she did when she was starting out as a video games actor. She says she wants others to be able to have this same experience as she has, to say "I want to be a games actor" and to then be able to develop their skills and do just that.</p>
<p>"A lot of those characters that I cut my teeth on, like doing callouts in a MOBA, those things are at risk of being replaced," Burch said.</p>
<p>"I think that kind of work is essential for people to be A) able to make rent, and then B) be able to hone their craft and get better. It's important to me that actors continue to have the opportunity to act," Burch closed, although she appreciates that as a "tool devs can use", AI could have its place.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Confirms It Will Be At Gamescom 2025]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has confirmed through <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1937133550869876827">a post on X</a> that it will be attending Gamescom 2025, which likely means another showcase from the company sometime between August 20 and 24.<a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1937136830014754891"> Bethesda</a> and the <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24215994">World of Warcraft team at Blizzard</a> will also be attending the event.</p>
<p>We've had a Gamescom showcase from Xbox each year since 2021, with last year's attendance including <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-3-days-of-livestreams-for-gamescom-2024/">multiple livestreams for Xbox games</a>. While we don't yet know what we'll see at this year's show, there are a few games we should look forward to seeing.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest</a> event the company hosted, we now have a clearer idea of what's due out in the fall from Microsoft, meaning there's a good chance we'll learn more about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, which is currently set to release sometime before the end of the year. It could also be where we get the official announcement of the recently leaked <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-leaked-ahead-of-announcement/">Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition</a> VR headset, and potentially some VR ports of Xbox games.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/">The Outer Worlds 2</a> could very likely get one more big marketing push before its October 29, 2025, release date. The same is likely for the recently announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle DLC</a> that's due out on September 4, 2025.</p>
<p>There's also a strong chance we'll see more of <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/">Black Ops 7</a>, after Xbox capped off its Summer Game Fest showcase with this year's entry in the Call of Duty franchise. Each game in the series is usually out sometime between October and November, so it's likely we'll get a release date reveal during whatever showcase Xbox hosts.</p>
<p>There's also a chance we see a release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, which was also featured during the SGF event that Xbox hosted. We got a release window with its SGF trailer, so it's possible we'll get a proper release date with a new trailer for Gamescom 2025.</p>
<p>And now that we have a release date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, it wouldn't be a surprise if Team Ninja and Platinum Games have a new gameplay trailer set for Gamescom 2025, and potentially a show-floor gameplay demo for those in attendance.</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out that even if Xbox doesn't host a livestream event, however unlikely that may seem, its attendance at Gamescom 2025 does make it likely that anything we've seen from the company that we know is coming this fall will likely be available to demo ahead of that fall release date.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll find out more official information soon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-sales-reach-1m-as-dev-shares-fun-stats.1225764/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Funcom has announced that the game has reached a major sales milestone since its release earlier this month, and the studio has also shared some fun stats to commemorate said milestone.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>&nbsp;has sold a million copies since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-delayed-june" rel="nofollow">its launch on June 10th</a>. This figure also makes the game the fastest-selling Funcom title; as the studio points out, it took&nbsp;<em>Conan Exiles</em>, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s spiritual predecessor, around a year to reach the same figure.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s peak player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">189,333</a> on Steam has easily outstripped&nbsp;<em>Conan Exiles</em>' <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/440900/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">53,402</a>, and&nbsp;the newer game also has a 24-hour player peak of 174,003, so there are still plenty of people interested in it almost two weeks after launch.</p>

Next time, you'll know to pack a sturdier umbrella.</p>

<p>Players have crafted 517,585 ornithopters between them, and over 6 billion grams of spice have been consumed across&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>'s player base as well, proving the franchise's age-old adage true.</p>

<p>It's worth checking out the full infographic to see some other fun&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>numbers, so here it is in all its glory!</p>



<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>is, it's a survival game set on the desert planet of Arrakis, which is central to the plot and setting of Frank Herbert's influential&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>series (as well as director Denis Villeneuve's movies, of course).</p>

<p>The game takes place in an alternate timeline in which messiah figure Paul Atreides was never born and in which a civil war between the Atreides and Harkonnen factions rages. You play as a Bene Gesserit agent searching for the nomadic Fremen, who have disappeared in this timeline.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. The game is also due to come to consoles at some point in the future, although we don't know exactly when just yet.</p>

            <p>Blood. Blood. Bloooooooooddddddd. Sorry, I've just watched Rebel Wolves show off the first look we've gotten at someone playing vampire RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnwalker">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, and I think it's rubbed off on me a bit.</p>
<p>To be fair, you can't blame the group of ex-Witcher 3 devs for having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-the-witcher-3-devs-vampire-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-gets-a-trailer-looks-witcherish">put together a game</a> that looks to use the B word more often than someone who's just gotten a nasty paper cut while handling some packets of the red stuff at a blood bank.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>During a livestream this weekend just gone - June 21 to be exact - the devs delivered about 21 minutes of design director Daniel Sadowski demoing a "work-in-progress" pre-beta build of The Blood of Dawnwalker. He spent most of that time showing off a mid-game quest in the game's biggest city, Svartrau, which boasts four boroughs. Also, in true medieval European fashion, it's got a castle so big that even William the Conqueror would say 'phwoar'.</p>
<p>Rescuing your family from that fortress, dubbed Griefberg and currently ruled by a powerful vampire called Brencis, is the key to the game's main quest. You'll need to recruit help or find ways to make it easier to storm, while a timer ticking down in days next to the objective, showing you how long you've got left to plan before it's too late.</p>

<p>As for the quest Sadowski was showing off here, the main point of emphasis was the game's calling card - a day/night cycle that changes gameplay, with Coen's half-human/half-vampire nature making missions play differently depending on the time of day. For example, if you've got to get into a cathedral to look for clues, you might waltz in and meet a priest during the day, while at night, you'll have to use your sneaky vampire roof jumpy powers to break in and find spooky people up to no good.</p>
<p>I'm interested to see which I'll prefer when I get my hands on the game, but Sadowski was keen to emphasise that the choice and consequence goes beyond just having two options for each mission, with various paths depending on what you do and how exactly you opt to approach the scenarios the game lobs your way. One thing I am pretty sure of is that I'll be pretty bad at Dawnwalker's Kingdom Come Deliverance 2-ish sword combat at first, given fiddly directional attacking and blocking tends to really expose my unfortunate inability to press parry exactly on cue.</p>
<p>The demo ended with Coen getting into a boss battle with an elderly vampire called Xanthe and her blood guards, and towards the end of it, he just goes pop. No, seriously, Xanthe has a skill called boiling blood, and if you don't beat her quickly enough, Coen gets blood explosioned. As in, he explodes into a big splatter of blood. Clean up on aisle seven.</p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker's still on for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-the-vampire-rpg-from-former-cd-projekt-folks-is-coming-out-2026">a 2026 release</a>, so you've got a bit of time to mentally prepare to face the Dracula version of being Thanos snapped.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-former-witcher-3-devs-vampire-rpg-shows-off-a-guy-being-blood-explosioned-by-a-flying-old-lady]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Actor Ned Luke, who played Michael in GTA 5 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-trio-want-fans-to-petition-for-one-last-dlc-story-together/1100-6532595/" data-ref-id="1100-6532595">wants to come back in a new DLC for GTA Online</a>, has revealed the one mission in the game that was "hands down" the worst to perform.</p><p>Responding to someone online who posted a clip of the yoga mission from GTA 5's campaign, Luke said he <a href="https://x.com/ned_luke/status/1935524554127945819" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">agreed</a> with the commenter and that it was "hands down the worst to shoot." Luke added that he "sweated my ass off for eight hours" during the filming process.</p><p>The <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Did_Somebody_Say_Yoga%3F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Did Somebody Say Yoga?"</a> mission in GTA 5 has Michael joining his wife Amanda and yoga instructor Fabien for a yoga session at their home. The player must match button presses in time and order to complete the objective; failing triggers a fail screen telling you that "Michael failed to achieve enlightenment."</p><p>While Luke might not have enjoyed this one scene, he's previously spoken positively about his experience making the game overall. He's asking fans to petition Rockstar to bring him and his co-stars Steven Ogg (Trevor) and Shawn Fonteno (Franklin) back for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-trio-want-fans-to-petition-for-one-last-dlc-story-together/1100-6532595/" data-ref-id="1100-6532595">another heist mission in GTA Online</a> featuring all three of them.</p><p>Many have theorized that Michael may appear in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-actor-from-gta-5-also-be-in-the-new-game-ned-luke-weighs-in/1100-6520046/" data-ref-id="1100-6520046">Luke himself dodged the question</a>. "I'm not in... we don't... GTA 6 is unknown things right now. Just to make that clear," he said when a host introduced him as "Michael from GTA 5 and GTA 6."</p><p>Luke has also told fans that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-will-be-worth-the-wait-so-just-be-patient-gta-5-actor-says/1100-6529201/" data-ref-id="1100-6529201">GTA 6 will be worth the wait</a> and that fans can trust that Rockstar Games will deliver something impressive when the game finally launches in May 2026.</p>
