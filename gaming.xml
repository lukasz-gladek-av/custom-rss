            <p>Remedy were “thrilled as Finnish people can be” to <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/remedy-and-annapurna-announce-a-strategic-cooperation-agreement">announce yesterday</a> that they’ve secured funding for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/control-review">Control</a> sequel in a co-financing deal with Annapurna, who are also helping the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> studio bring their connected universe to “film, TV, and beyond”.</p>
<p>While I’m pretty jazzed to see what the coffee-addled minds that brought us <a href="https://youtu.be/qAtWVCKKOHk">Threshold Kids</a> can conjure up under that tantalising ‘beyond’ label, I’ll skip the speculation from now. Here’s the skinny from Remedy’s communications director Thomas Puha:</p>

<blockquote><p>What does that mean for you, our dear fans? Above all it means Remedy is able to make Control 2 exactly the game we want it to be, while we now also have an incredible partner to extend our IPs to other mediums. We are also going to be publishing Control 2 ourselves. When I look at all the games we have in the pipeline, the future of Remedy is incredibly exciting. You can trust us to keep bringing you incredible video game experiences.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here’s what Sammy-Sammy Lake-Lake had to say about it. I can call him that because we’re mates*:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m absolutely thrilled (yes!) by this opportunity to expand the story of Alan Wake and our whole Remedy Connected Universe to mediums beyond games, and to build all of this in close collaboration, games, film, TV, and other mediums as well, as one unified vision. I trust Annapurna are the perfect partner for us to make this dream come true.”</p></blockquote>
<p>*Not actual mates</p>
<p>This does all mean that AMC’s Alan Wake show won’t be happening, however. "We have moved on from AMC amicably as their rights to Alan Wake expired,” Puha told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-shows/remedy-confirms-the-alan-wake-amc-tv-series-is-dead-as-it-confirms-new-partnership-with-annapurna-to-develop-and-produce-control-and-alan-wake-franchises-for-film-and-television/">Games Radar</a>.</p>
<p>Annapurna are, of course, them behind games like beloved<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc"> space</a> puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a>, secret best game ever made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>, and we-saw-the-internet-coming-em-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray">Stray</a>, all published under their Annapurna Interactive label. On the other side of the coin, Annapurna have a mixed reputation for looking after partner developers. A couple years back, People Make Games put out a <a href="https://youtu.be/xDPzZkx0cPs">report</a> about “Three Indie Superstars Accused of Emotional Abuse”, all of whom had published games under Annapurna Interactive, who were allegedly unsupportive during the highlighted cases.</p>
<p>Remedy’s most recent game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, which had<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-fastest-selling-remedy-game-but-yet-to-turn-a-profit"> yet to turn a profit</a> as of this February. “A stylistic tour de force and one of the most unique and confident horror games in recent years,” decreed Katharine (RPS in peace) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-review">her review</a>. “It might not hit every beat perfectly, but Remedy's daft and over the top sense of humour help bring much-needed levity to its genuine thrills and jump scares.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-2-how-does-the-game-industry-survive-beyond-2025-<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We're back, and I mean that in a very literal sense. We've just returned from Gamescom 2024 where this (rather fatigued) editor had a wonderful time catching up with old faces and new.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of our week was spent flitting between the business areas, chatting all things video games with developers, publishers, studio leaders, and pretty much anybody PR would let us in a room with. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/program/gamescom">Our ongoing Gamescom coverage is right here, so do tuck in</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Outside of the show, the flags were cracking, the bratwurst was sizzling, and the Kolsch was flowing. I know, because that's pretty much all I could hear from my hotel room in Alter Markt. Yes, I chose to slap myself in the middle of a market square bustling with interlopers whose sole purpose in life was to prevent me from sleeping. Yes, it was a colossal mistake. Yes, I resent everyone involved. Will I learn from that fatal error and book a room in a more sedate location next year? Look, I'll give it a shot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mistakes are opportunities for growth, and that rather fortuitously brings me onto the subject of this edition of Patch Notes: how can the game industry learn from its own repeated failings to ensure we don't just 'survive until 2025,' but thrive in the years beyond?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a question I desperately needed to answer heading to Gamescom. I'd seen the phrase 'survive to 2025' tossed around on social media, and it seems to imply all the industry needs to do is collectively endure until the turn of the year. At that point, I suppose, the chaos that has dominated the news cycle since 2023 (layoffs, funding woes, and studio closures) will dissipate into the aether.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A warm sun will rise on a rejuvenated industry, ushering in a new era of stability and prosperity. Those who remain will breathe a collective sigh of relief, safe in the knowledge that, this year, things will be different. It feels like optimism bordering on wilful disbelief.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many of those I spoke with at the show agreed. There was a sense the industry too often surrenders itself to a vicious cycle of growth and collapse perceived as unavoidable. It isn't–but only if we learn, and I mean really learn, from our mistakes. To help us do that, I collected reams of advice from industry experts that might hopefully allow us to break the cycle.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The view from the show floor: Long term survival will demand creative clarity, frequent reality checks, and the slow demise of capitalism">The view from the show floor: Long term survival will demand creative clarity, frequent reality checks, and the slow demise of capitalism</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If the question is 'what do we do about capitalism?' then you're into a very different set of economic, philosophical, and political issues," says Ustwo Games lead producer John Lau.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He suggests the industry needs to address the "incentivisation structures" that are currently in place on a commercial level in order to survive. It's a big ask, but on the upside, building incentivisation structures is exactly what developers do for a living.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What is it we can do to identify where things aren't working and then slowly chip away at those things? If that feels too big, I would say it's about understanding you are at the mercy of these forces," he adds. "You cannot ignore them. You cannot ignore the fact you're in a commercial industry. Therefore you must educate yourself. One has to build commercial literacy–among colleagues and co-workers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Building literacy means fully engaging with the issues that have smashed through the industry like a wrecking ball. Burying our heads in the sand is no longer an option. "You can't just say 'hey, look, I'm an artist. I'm making art. I've got big ideas.' Yes, that's fantastic. But the image of a game developer as a lone artist [is outdated]," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If that's what you're doing, you are leaving yourself incredibly vulnerable to these flawed, dysfunctional structures. You have to understand the commercial environment you're working in is part of the problem–as much as [the creative question of] 'how do I make a person feel this way?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hooded Horse chief product officer Ashkan Namousi says longevity is rooted in sustainable business practices. It's a soundbite we've heard often. Mainly when companies are punting thousands of workers out of the door in pursuit of "sustainable growth." But for Namousi, a sustainable enterprise is one governed by leaders who aren't over-zealous, under-prepared, and dancing to the intoxicating tunes of external stakeholders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's about always focusing on effectiveness and cost effectiveness, and trying not to get carried away with unfettered creativity and ambition–without reflection and without control," he says. "[That ambition] is constantly fed into by other stakeholders who want a stake in what you do. They almost way you to say 'I need $20 million,' because they think if you're going to have 400 percent ROI, so they'd much rathe go in with $20 million than $2 million so they can take a bigger share of revenue, they can have a bigger buyout, they can get the IP–all that jazz.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Focus on being effective and creating new ideas for you and your company. Stay focused on 'what is the kind of game you're making? What is the target audience?' Don't just take any deal that comes your way. Believe in your creative vision and the potential of the game. You also need to have a reality check. What happens if it doesn't [find success]?"</span></p><p>Image via Gamescom</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If we don't knock it out of the park and haven't prepared accordingly, the cycle will repeat. Atari CEO Wade Rosen believes its almost human nature to lean into the perceived inevitability of it all, but feels we can dismantle the wheel by fighting that urge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's knowing [you should] stash some cash away for a rainy day and not just immediately plow it back into development or projects and assume that's going to project into the future. It's really looking more to the future than the past, and understanding that the past is not the most accurate predictor–especially the short term past," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's realizing that when things are good, they're not always going to be good. And when they're bad, they're not always going to be bad. And having enough cash in the bank to survive those downturns without having to drastically cut teams, but that also means having the discipline to not drastically increase teams as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Money is the problem, then? Or at the very least, how it's perceived and distributed across the industry. Glowmade co-founder Jonny Hopper says we need to be "realistic" about spending, especially when–as was the case during the pandemic–it feels like investing massive sums of cash is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>the</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> golden ticket to exponential growth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Certainly, when you're [a small studio] money is terrifying. I think you need to get comfortable with that," he adds. "What's happened is, we've seen some really big players–and COVID started it because there was massive demand–send money flooding [into the market]. Everyone was sat at home playing games, and suddenly there was loads of money and loads of demand."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hopper feels we're now in a period of "readjustment," but reiterates we have to learn from that era of flagrant, unadulterated spending to avoid falling back into old habits when the good times come around again. When investors are whispering sweet nothings in your ear, promising you the world and decadent amounts of ROI, it's vital to remember precisely what you set out to achieve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Have clarity about your vision," says Rebellion art director Ryan Greene, explaining how to stay on the straight and narrow during production. "Know what you want to make. How much time it will take to make. And the person power you'll need to make it. Make the game you can make, and not necessarily the game you want to make. It takes a lot to do that. To really distill the soul of your game and then focus on it. Don't get distracted by other stuff."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Words to live by? We'll let you decide.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Status Report: The headlines that matter">Status Report: The headlines that matter</h2><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/microsoft-and-activision-blizzard-accused-of-bad-faith-bargaining-by-raven-software-union-workers">Microsoft and Activision Blizzard accused of 'bad faith bargaining' by Raven Software union workers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Microsoft's merger with Activision Blizzard turned into something of a PR nightmare. The company had to defend itself against accusations of rampant monopolisation from regulators and convince the masses that a $68.7 billion splurge would be a Very Good Thing. The 1,900 layoffs that followed probably didn't do the company any favors in that regard, but the labor neutrality agreement it signed with Communications Workers of America in 2022 was a clear and obvious win. It has enabled multiple unions to arise unimpeded within Microsoft's hallowed halls, but are those developers actually being heard? The unionized workers at Activision Blizzard subsidiary Raven Software would say 'no,' and have now filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board expressing as much. Is Microsoft about to turn a huge win into a colossal loss? Let's wait and see.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-is-shutting-down-in-november-then-reopening-as-a-paid-game">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is shutting down in November, then reopening as a paid game</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">How very Nintendo.

<p>Epic Games is giving away three <strong>free </strong>Fallout games on PC through the Epic Games Store until September 5. This one-stop collection features Fallout, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, and it’s the perfect introduction for anyone wanting to explore the origins of this stellar post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-the-beginning">Back to the Beginning</h2>



<p>Fallout debuted in 1997 exclusively on PC, followed up shortly after with Fallout 2. In 2001, Fallout Tactics was released as something of a spin-off title, but it kept much of what made the original games so enjoyable and popular.</p>



<p>It’s a far cry from the action RPG elements that you might be used to from the ‘modern’ games, but anyone wanting to explore the birth of this legendary franchise should at least <strong>try </strong>Fallout and Fallout 2.</p>



<p>Until September 5, you can secure this trio of titles on Epic Games, and once you’ve picked them up, they’re yours to keep forever. It’s not the first time they’ve been offered for free, but it’s another solid opportunity to pick up three great games without paying a penny for them.</p>



<p>Fallout is still experiencing rampant popularity following the success of the Fallout television show that debuted on Prime Video in April. The series saw millions of players find their way into the series and titles like Fallout 76 broke all-time high player count records.</p>



<p>Will you be landing the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/bundles/fallout-classic-collection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fallout classic collection on Epic Games</a>?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I’m really struggling with <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> – struggling to put it down, that is. <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a>’s latest live service gamble is a fun, frenetic hero shooter touting beautifully polished gunplay and a persistent story told through weekly character-focused cinematics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Launch Trailer I PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQB_2FF2G1o?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To say the odds are stacked against Concord would be an understatement. Not only is this a new IP and a new developer (<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/firewalk-studios">Firewalk Studios</a>), it’s going up against some gnarly juggernauts while also daring to eschew the zero-cost entry of its free-to-play rivals. After years spent throwing money at loot boxes and time-hungry battle passes, paying a one-time fee feels weirdly refreshing in the knowledge that every piece of playable content will be instantly unlocked when it becomes available without needing to grind out challenges against the clock or scrabble for in-game currency.</p>


<p>At launch, Concord features a total of 6 modes, 12 maps, and 16 Freegunners. Each of the game’s space-faring mercenaries has their own unique kit, slotting nicely into one of several loose archetypes. For example, 1-OFF – the Concord crew’s cleaning-obsessed robot – can use his primary weapon and deployable gadget to suck up enemy projectiles, charging his high-damage trash grenades in the process.Meanwhile, Vale’s loadout is a little more straightforward, packing a punchy sniper rifle, trip mines, and a high vertical leap that can give her the drop on unsuspecting enemies below.</p>
<p>There are a number of interesting deviations away from the established hero shooter formula, such as the omission of “ultimate” abilities. Considered a subgenre staple, their removal encourages players to focus on the core kit of each hero and how they synergise with squadmates, instead of trying to line up a table-turning set piece with a single, well-timed button press.</p>


<p>This also benefits the quicker tempo of Concord’s game modes, which are more akin to those of a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> game rather than <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. Takedown is your bog standard team deathmatch with Trophy Hunt copying COD’s Killed Confirmed match rules, only awarding points if players retrieve the glowing node left behind by downed enemies. Meanwhile Area Control and Signal Chase are more objective-focused with teams battling to claim territory then defend it from invaders. Concord also features a more competitive “Rivals” playlist – in Cargo Run and Clash Point you fight across multiple rounds with no respawns</p>
<p>It’s a decent amount of content for players on day one with more maps, modes, and Freegunners on the way. A couple of additional arenas may have been nice though it seems Firewalk Studios has focused where it matters most, presenting a cast of heroes that all feel fun to play. Firing weapons and using abilities is seamless, with all but a couple of Freegunners being able to perform evasive dodge manoeuvres and a double (or even a triple) jump. Firefights take on an even more tactical dimension thanks to Concord’s tight level designs, weaving together open spaces, crowded interiors, and vertical climbs to great effect.</p>
<p>The desire to master your favourite Freegunners will keep you coming back match after match, unlocking rewards as you progress. However, customising your crew is one of the only areas where Concord disappoints at launch. There’s a real lack of interesting cosmetics and accessories with most unlockable skins being recoloured versions of each hero’s base appearance. As a premium game, Concord doesn’t need to flog glitzy costumes to wring cash out of its players, though it wouldn’t hurt to have at least a few eye-catching designs for each Freegunner.</p>

<p>Something you will want to focus on unlocking is the different “Variants” for your favourite heroes. Each one adds a perk-like Combat Trait that can change your playstyle. For example, Lennox I will reload his equipped gun when dodging, whereas Lennox II grants an extended magazine for both of his weapons. Hopefully, as Concord rolls out its roadmap of new content and features, we’ll get more ways to deeply customise our crew’s visuals as well as how they play.</p>
<p>Hopefully we’ll get to know them better, too. Each week, Firewalk will add a new in-game vignette, cinematics that look to fill in some of Concord’s backstory. With the second of these videos having only just debuted, precisely how much these will enrich the overall experience remains to be seen. So far, we’ve been treated to some banter between crewmates and some light probing into the game’s wider lore. Speaking of which, Concord features a meaty codex called the Galactic Guide, a space map teeming with planets, travel routes, characters, and other info for those who want to immerse themselves in this sci-fi universe. As hooked as I am, the overwhelming mass of lore entries and walls of text don’t feel like an intuitive way of presenting this sprawling archive of world-building.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Remedy has announced a new partnership with Annapurna Interactive on various projects, starting with Control 2. The sequel will be co-financed (with an even split) between the two companies, even though the IP remains in the hands of Remedy, which will be self-publishing Control 2. But the deal is also important because it aims to bring Control and Alan Wake to film and television, leveraging Annapurna's expertise in those mediums.</p>
<p>Tero Virtala, CEO of Remedy Entertainment, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>At Remedy, our primary focus continues to be what we do best—crafting industry-defining video games that have earned us global recognition. Now, the time is right to expand the reach of Remedy's beloved franchises to an even broader global audience through film, television, and more. In Annapurna, we have found an outstanding partner who shares our ambition and passion for immersive storytelling. We are excited to see them bring the universes and characters we have created to life in new mediums, thanks to this unique deal.</em></p>
<p>Hector Sanchez, Annapurna's President of Interactive and New Media, stated:</p>
<p><em>This deal with Remedy isn't just about adapting great games—-it's about breaking new ground in how companies can collaborate. By backing Remedy's move toward self-publishing, we're putting our faith in their vision. We know from experience that Remedy is a first-class games development partner, and we’re excited to share their work with an even wider audience by bringing the Control and Alan Wake universes to film, television, and beyond.</em></p>
<p>Creative Director Sam Lake added:</p>
<p><em>I’m absolutely thrilled (yes!) by this opportunity to expand the story of Alan Wake and our whole Remedy Connected Universe to mediums beyond games and to build all of this in close collaboration, games, film, TV, and other mediums as well, as one unified vision. I trust Annapurna are the perfect partner for us to make this dream come true.</em></p>
<p>Control 2 is currently getting close to starting production, so it may be another couple of years before we see its release. Meanwhile, the Finnish studio continues working on Codename Condor (a Control multiplayer spin-off) and the Max Payne 1&amp;2 Remake, while Kestrel (a live service game) was <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-cancels-co-op-multiplayer-game-project-kestrel-formerly-vanguard-will-focus-on-alan-wake-and-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> in May.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Concord 1-OFF Guide: Tips, Variants, and Abilities]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-1-off-guide-tips-variants-and-abilities/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-1-off-guide-tips-variants-and-abilities.968025/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-1-off-guide-tips-variants-and-abilities/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>In this <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> 1-OFF guide we’ll be giving an overview of the Northstar crew’s resident robot cleaner. At first, it’s not entirely clear what his role on the battlefield is, and with 1-OFF being such an easy target for enemies to hit, they’ll make short work of him if you fail to grasp the basics of his nuanced loadout.</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - 1-0FF Abilities Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dMesmz2wpgA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>1-OFF slots nicely into the tank archetype of character. Thanks to a meaty health bar and abilities designed to soak up damage, he’s a great pick for players wanting to wade into the frontline, drawing attention away from more vulnerable teammates as they lay down support fire. Like Emari, he’s particularly useful when locking down zones in objective-based modes such as Area Control and Signal Chase.</p>


<h2>Concord 1-OFF Guide: Loadout</h2>
<p><strong>CC-1898 Industrial Vacuum</strong></p>
<p>1-OFF’s primary weapon does what it says on the tin. Pulling the trigger while aimed toward enemies will vacuum up any incoming bullets and projects, effectively nullifying any damage they might do.</p>

<p><strong>Pressure Blaster</strong></p>
<p>Switching weapons will turn 1-OFF’s vacuum into an air cannon that shoots a constant stream that’s most effective at mid range. The damage output isn’t particularly great though it can help pick off stragglers and cause panic.</p>
<p><strong>Air Barrier</strong></p>
<p>When deployed, this vent-like gadget emits an air geyser that swats away bullets and projectiles, acting somewhat similarly to 1-OFF’s vacuum.</p>
<p><strong>Trash Bomb</strong></p>
<p>A powerful thrown grenade that will also push back enemies caught in its blast radius. The more projectiles 1-OFF vacuums, the more grenade charges you’ll have.</p>

<h2>Tips on how to play 1-OFF</h2>
<ul>
<li>When a match starts you’ll want to be in the vanguard, ideally supported by a Jabari or Daw who can dish out health and keep you in the fight.</li>
<li>Create a protective barrier for your team by aiming your vacuum where enemy fire is at its most concentrated. Deploy air vents near objectives and in tight spaces, allowing viable pathways for squadmates to retreat.</li>
<li>Switch to the Pressure Blaster when you have the upper hand in a teamfight to help overpower the remaining enemies. Making sure both of 1-OFF’s weapons are regularly reloaded between bouts of actions.</li>
<li>Don’t forget to use your Trash Bombs. Save them for situations where you’re fighting at close range, in tight spaces.<br>
1-OFF doesn’t have a double jump or dodge, so your mobility options are limited. If you need to retreat, don’t turn your back to the enemy team – walk backwards while using the vacuum and air vents.</li>
</ul>


<p>Each playable hero in Concord has one or more Variants, defined by perk-like abilities that can change their playstyle. These can be obtained by completing in-game challenges with plans for more to be added to the game regularly.</p>
<p><strong>1-OFF Variant 1: Trash Dispenser</strong></p>
<p><em>More Trash Bombs with higher damage.</em></p>
<p>This Concord 1-OFF guide has covered the basics of using this unique, fun-to-play tank hero. Sadly, the game’s practice range doesn’t do a great job of demonstrating how certain Fregunners work so you’ll need to get some in-match experience. His loadout won’t appeal to damage-focused players though 1-OFF is relatively easy to pick up and slots nicely into most team compositions.</p>

<p>As a long-time fan of the extraction shooter genre, I love to see new projects enter the scene and give the top dogs a run for their money. We need more variety and more evolution within the genre. One studio that aims to shake things up is Fun Dog—an indie studio working on their first major project: The Forever Winter. I’ve been eyeing this one—especially—for a while, and now the team has finally unveiled its Early Access release date for The Forever Winter!</p>



<p>We don’t have to wait long<span>. The Forever Winter launches into Steam Early Access on&nbsp;<strong>September 24,&nbsp;</strong></span>approximately three weeks from this writing. </p>

<iframe title="Declaration of War - The Forever Winter EA Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2izSjSXoq8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>According to the release date announcement, we’ll choose from one of five characters, each with a unique personality and playstyle—similar to a hero shooter, I would say. However, the core focal point of the game remains the same: We enter the battlefield as scavengers, track down loot, complete quests for either one of the warring factions, and extract before things go haywire.</p>



<p>Furthermore, as part of the announcement, the team revealed the intended price for The Forever Winter. The game will normally cost <strong>$29.99</strong>, but they’ll launch with an early adopters discount, which brings the total down to <strong>$27 for a limited time</strong>.</p>

<p>Speaking of popular shooters, following a rapid decline in player numbers, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant appears to be on borrowed time</a> not long after its release!</p>

Further content will be added to the game throughout the Early Access period.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Fun Dog Studios:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In <em>The Forever Winter</em>, players are a scavenging survivor, leading a community of like-minded individuals who only want to be left alone. Unfortunately, AI controlled factions like <a title="Games > Europa [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/europa">Europa</a> and Eurasia control all of the world’s existing resources, and are at constant war with each other to secure more. This means the player must navigate these battlefields to collect the needed resources for their communities to survive.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Prepare for Hell</strong> – Players join up at the community hub where they can buy from vendors selling weapons, pharmaceuticals, and additional gear to prepare for the maze ahead, accept missions or dirty jobs from NPCs and rival factions and more.</li><li><strong>Player-Versus-Environment-Versus-Environment Scenario System</strong> – Enemies have their own goals and agendas, operating in coordinated groups, and undertaking full-scale battles. Enemy AI deploys enemies in squads based on their current objectives, with each squad reacting differently to player <a title="Genres > Action [2,134 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. As the player gets more powerful or makes a bigger mark on the battlefield, the enemy will deploy more (and stronger) firepower to counter. And players will never be stronger than the enemy.</li><li><strong>Brace the Cold Challenges Ahead</strong> – While surviving is always the primary goal, players can earn more XP, gear and money by taking on quests. Each quest has varying threat levels commensurate with their risk and reward: harder quests give larger reputation rewards that increase your faction standings, earn more credits, and get rewarded with more powerful gear.</li><li><strong>Increase Skills and Gear Up to Survive</strong> – Spend accumulated resources between sessions to level up health, speed, accuracy and reload speed that give you a fighting chance against The Forever Winter’s relentless enemies.</li><li><strong>Prioritize <a title="Genres > Stealth [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">Stealth</a> and Teamwork</strong> – Coordinate with your squad to outsmart enemies and avoid detection to gain the upper hand, or tactically plan battles and ambushes to win guerilla engagements. Just don’t take the enemy head-on. You won’t live to tell the tale.</li><li><strong>Death is Just the Beginning (Again)</strong> – If your squad dies, the run’s over. And death is unforgiving. If you fall in battle, you’ll lose everything in your inventory for that session, and have to start over from scratch. Build up a stash back at base between sessions to keep the upper hand in the future.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Declaration of War - The Forever Winter EA Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2izSjSXoq8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sometimes those are for commenting (<a href="https://aftermath.site/commenting-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have those!</a>); sometimes, for sites that are particularly prominent (or are full of themselves), they'll take the form of publicly-available editorial guidelines.</p><p>While those might <em>seem </em>necessary, I have recently encountered evidence that they can all probably be replaced by just three rules. And that any website without rules should probably institute the same three.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/MarioBrothBlog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The evidence comes courtesy of Supper Mario Broth, the quite frankly <em>exceptional </em>social media account</a> responsible for posting all the best Nintendo trivia and tidbits.

It's tough working with hard facts in the public eye because, as humans, we all make mistakes.

			<p>Diablo IV's <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-gamescom-qa-diablo-is-the-healthiest-its-been-since-launch/">next expansion</a> isn't far away, with the release date being officially set for October 8, 2024. However, before that happens, players will experience Diablo IV on the PTR (Public Test Realm) from September 4 through September 11. In this version of the PTR, players will experience the new character progression, which has experienced many changes. There are also major updates to the loot system (Sacred items will no longer drop and existing ones will be marked as Legacy items), the Paragon system (all Paragon Levels will be shared across all your characters on the same Realm), and new Difficulty Tiers (Normal, Hard, Expert, and Penitent) that replace the old World Tiers. Then there's the Torment difficulty, which will be tied to progression in the Pit.</p>
<p>Those who choose to participate in the PTR for Diablo IV will also be able to experience the new Class Skills and Passives, the new Paragon Boards (each class receives an extra one), and the brand-new Runeword system.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV | Campfire Chat 2.0 PTR Update | August 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ux9zeqdMF-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Runewords are essentially a way for Diablo IV players to craft their own skills. There are two types of Runes called Ritual and Invocation. Runes of Ritual specify the actions you need to take to trigger the Runes into working, whereas Runes of Invocation gives you a powerful effect once you have done the actions to trigger it. For example, BacJah is a Runeword composed of Bac and Jah. The former stipulates that the character gains 50 Offering (a new resource used for Runewords) every 5 meters traveled; the second that upon gathering 500 Offering, the next Evade is replaced with the Sorcerer's Teleport skill.</p>
<p>Indeed, Runewords can provide access to Skills from other Classes, as well as increasing your movement speed and other stuff. There will be 17 Runes of Ritual and 28 Runes of Invocation available at launch. Beware that outside PTR 2.0, Runewords will be exclusive to owners of <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-gamescom-qa-diablo-is-the-healthiest-its-been-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vessel of Hatred</a>. The <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/diablo4/24130178/the-2-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know?blzcmp=blizzard-news#Runewords" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on the Blizzard website details all of the hotfixes and tweaks made to each class.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pubg-battlegrounds-director-discusses-the-importance-of-the-games-community<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>PUBG: Battlegrounds celebrated its seventh anniversary this year, and it’s still going strong. The free-to-play battle royale shooter has welcomed millions of players from around the world during those seven years, and the development team has been focused on releasing new content and updates to keep that massive community engaged.</p><p>“The key thing that I’ve learned over the past seven years is how important fans are,” said Taehyun Kim, Production Director of PUBG: Battlegrounds. “Our game has been serviced globally and it has been played in many countries and by many people around the world. So we keep looking for ways to satisfy diverse countries and diverse fans.”</p><p>Kim has been a member of the PUBG team since its initial phase of development in 2016. He worked his way up to Production Director, where he is now responsible for guiding all aspects of the game’s progress. We got a chance to sit down and chat with him in Cologne, Germany, where he and his team were on hand for gamescom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Throughout our discussion, Kim stressed how vital he thinks it is for developers to stay in contact with their player base. He’s even been going out of his comfort zone to engage with fans publicly in new ways.</p><p>“I had a livestream with Korean users, and it was really, really challenging,” Kim said. “I’m a developer, not a professional emcee, so I was afraid. ‘Oh, what if I make a mistake in front of this many people in real time?’ But I think, of course it is difficult, but I need to keep challenging myself and I have to continue this effort.”</p><p>That effort is one of the reasons he came to Cologne. He attended PUBG: Hot Drop Cologne, an in-person event that allowed fans to meet the game’s devs, partners, and other special guests. It was one of the first times Kim has had direct contact with Western players, which is something he wants to continue to improve at.</p><p>“I’m Korean, and I’m more comfortable speaking in Korean, so I have been communicating with Korean users using livestreaming,” he said. “But that was kind of my preparation to more effectively communicate with Western and English-speaking users. Currently we are looking forward and we are looking at different ways to more effectively communicate with our users around the world. So starting with this gamescom, we are going to keep continuing this effort to communicate with our fans.”</p><p>Of course, building a community relies on more than devs connecting with players. It’s also about allowing players to form connections with each other. August was Clan Month, which added weekly clan challenges and a new rewards system. It also allowed players to join the fan clans of eight popular esports teams. It all builds to a special tournament at the end of the month, when clan members get the chance to team up with professional players.</p><p>“For the clan system, what we want to offer to our players is to create an environment where they can create a new community and they can enjoy the game together, they can complete the missions together, and get the rewards together,” Kim said. “So doing this, they can enjoy the game with more fun with their squadmates and their clan members.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/27/pubg-key-art-1724780420723.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Kim and his team also know that for a community to stay active, they need updates and new content. He stressed that he and the dev team have a clear design philosophy and are very careful about what actually gets incorporated into the game.</p><p>“Through our communication events in Korea, I’ve learned that what is more important is not to do something big, but to do something consistently,” he said. “Our theme is survival, so we do not want to undermine this core gameplay.”</p><p>With a player base as huge and diverse as PUBG’s, player feedback comes from every corner of the world. Different players want different things, some of which directly contradict each other. So Kim and his team have to always keep that design philosophy in mind.</p><p>“For us, community feedback is very important, but we are getting a lot of feedback from many countries and from many types of users,” he said. “Sometimes, feedback is very different, even for just one feature. So we think what is important is we need to incorporate the feedback which is more relevant to our game and also we need to set a benchmark that the incorporation process should not undermine our core gameplay.”</p><p>As always, PUBG: Battlegrounds has plenty for players to look forward to. A zombie mode is on the way, an upgrade to Unreal Engine 5 is in the works long-term, and Kim said there are plans for plenty of other things that he can’t reveal yet. If you want to get in on the action, you can download PUBG: Battlegrounds for free on PC, PS4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and a mobile version is available on iOS and Android.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle.967833/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, the actual play series <em>Dimension20</em> wrapped up a live show tour through the UK and Ireland. During this tour, they performed their latest actual play, <em>Dimension20 Time Quangle</em>. For those who couldn't be there in person, Dropout will be bringing the show to VOD.</p>
<h2>The Dimension20 Time Quangle VOD announcement</h2>
<p>The announcement of Dimension20 <em>Time Quangle</em> coming to VOD happened via a trailer on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi9jQrvdAuY">Dropout YouTube</a> channel. The trailer itself shows footage from different venues on the tour, showcasing both audience reactions and the performers' showmanship.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension20-time-quangle-brennan-lee-mulligan-screenshot.jpg?itok=6zL3aqLQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimension20-time-quangle-brennan-lee-mulligan-screenshot.jpg?itok=qBGQrgmr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Dimension20 <em>Time Quangle </em>actual play's central gimmick is that it features characters, players, and locations from different Dimension20 series. Every show is effectively a self-contained improvised remix of <em>Dimension20</em>, with characters, locations, being shuffled around.</p>
<p>As host Brennnan Lee Mulligan says in the trailer, "What if I told you that not only do you not know who we are going to play or what setting it's in, we don't f--king know who we're gonna play or what setting it's in?"</p>
<p>It's an enticing hook since the anthology series has spanned multiple genres. They include <em>Nevermore</em> (Horror), <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-fantasy-high-junior-year-trailer-highlights-new-looks-for-bad-kids-and" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Fantasy High</em></a> (School Drama) and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em></a> (80s action movie).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the anthology-style presentation makes <em>Dimension20</em> stand out from other actual plays like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a> and <em>Legends of Avantris</em>. The liveshow stars Brennan Lee Mulligan as the GM, Ally Beardsley, Emily Axford, Brian Murphy, Zac Oyama, Siobhan Thompson, and Lou Wilson as the players.</p>
<p>According to the video description, the first two shows of <em>Dimension20 Time Quangle</em> will be released September 12 and September 19 on the premium subscription streaming platform, Dropout. The remaining shows will be coming to the platform December 2024.</p>
<p><em>Dimension20</em> is only one major show available on Dropout. The <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/awards/dropout-emmys-game-changer-dimenson-20-ineligible-1235996243/">Emmy-nominated</a> streaming service contains extensive episodes of improvised comedy shows like <em>Make Some Noise</em> and Game Changer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231635/emudeck-machine-steam-machines-crowdfunding<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve once dreamt of building Linux-based game consoles called Steam Machines. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019#:~:text=%E2%80%94Ashley%20Carman-,23.%20Steam%20Machines,-Valve%20Corporation">They flopped</a> — but the dream eventually became reality <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22579747/valve-steam-deck-steam-machines-editorial">as the handheld Steam Deck</a> instead. Now, a particularly noteworthy Steam Deck enthusiast is reviving the idea of a console-sized Steam Box, one with his own retro gaming twist.</p><p>Rodrigo Sedano is the founder of <a href="https://www.emudeck.com/">EmuDeck</a>, a program beloved by the Steam Deck community. It automatically installs, configures, and enhances emulators for Nintendo, Sega, Sony, and other retro consoles so they work beautifully on Valve’s handheld.</p><p>Now, he wants to make it even easier. He’s preparing to sell you a console-shaped custom gaming PC preloaded with that entire Steam + EmuDeck experience, plus a wireless controller, all ready to go. </p><p>He’s calling them EmuDeck Machines, and he’s <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/emudeck-machines-retro-emulation-console-pc#/">currently crowdfunding the idea on Indiegogo</a> for prices starting at around $400 — with an incredibly ambitious promise to ship them in December of this year, just four months from now. </p><p>They’ll house (weak) Intel N97 or (stronger) AMD 8600G chips in a Sega Dreamcast-inspired shell, with four USB ports around front for additional wired controllers or peripherals. By overclocking the AMD 8600G’s integrated Radeon 760M graphics, he claims he can get what looks like Steam Deck-beating performance out of his pricier $700 model:</p><div><figcaption><em>EmuDeck Machine configurations.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: EmuDeck</cite></p></div><p>There are lots of reasons to wait before putting money down on a crowdfunding campaign, though. While I love EmuDeck, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsj/details/experience/">he seems to have</a> other software design, web design, and management experience, he admits to <em>The Verge</em> that he’s never shipped a hardware product like this before. </p><p>He says his US and EU partners are telling him that getting FCC and CE certifications should only take one month. His current prototype is just a Mini-ITX board in a wooden box, while he waits for his potential case manufacturing partners in Spain to deliver the Dreamcast-shaped console case he’s dreamt up. He’s planning to assemble the PCs himself, as a family business of sorts.</p><div><p><strong>A note on crowdfunding:</strong></p><p>Crowdfunding is a chaotic field by nature: companies looking for funding tend to make big promises. According to a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/fulfillment">study run by Kickstarter</a>, roughly 1 in 10 “successful” products that reach their funding goals fail to actually deliver rewards. Of the ones that do deliver, delays, missed deadlines, or overpromised ideas mean that there’s often disappointment in store for those products that do get done. </p><p>The best defense is to use your best judgment. Ask yourself: does the product look legitimate? Is the company making outlandish claims? Is there a working prototype? Does the company mention existing plans to manufacture and ship finished products? Has it completed a Kickstarter before? And remember: you’re not necessarily buying a product when you back it on a crowdfunding site.</p></div><p>But I think it’s at least <em>plausible</em> because he says he’s not necessarily expecting to sell more than 100 of these as a side project — and because he says these PCs will use off-the-shelf parts. It’s a standard Mini-ITX desktop motherboard and chip, in an 8.66 x 8.66 x 2.55-inch chassis. (He tells me they will have an external 155W power supply.)</p><p>Sedano says he’s been building computers since he was 14 and sees this as a hobby, too, but he’s getting serious about it in a few ways. EmuDeck is now a registered limited liability company in Spain (<a href="https://sede.registradores.org/site/mercantil?lang=en_EN">we checked</a>!), and he says he’s locked down several suppliers to make sure he’ll have the components. He’ll offer hardware support and a warranty, he claims.</p><p>He also may not need Valve’s support to make this a reality; the operating system he’s preloading <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">is Bazzite,</a> a promising fork of the SteamOS interface with a different underlying operating system (Fedora). I’ve loaded it on a Lenovo Legion Go and the ROG Ally X at this point, and I’ve been mostly impressed by how well it works. Bazzite founder Kyle Gospodnetich tells me his team gave EmuDeck their blessing, though Bazzite isn’t currently helping EmuDeck tweak the software.</p><p>It’s a little surprising we haven’t seen many Steam Boxes like this before, and Bazzite says it isn’t aware of any others in the works. Perhaps other companies have been waiting on Valve? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022#:~:text=Valve%20hopes%20the%20Steam%20Deck%20will%20inspire%20new%20Steam%20Boxes%2C%20too">The Steam Deck maker told us in late 2022</a> that it’s actually excited for other manufacturers to make small SteamOS PCs — after Valve releases a general image of SteamOS 3 for those manufacturers to use. </p><p>As of this month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">there are signs</a> that Valve’s getting closer.</p><p>If you’d rather tinker instead of looking for a turnkey console gaming experience, you could of course build your own Bazzite box with EmuDeck. Or, add an HDMI dock or hub to a handheld. Or, you could possibly even do <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLnxj1ltd5vk">what YouTuber ETA Prime did</a> and turn an old Steam Deck into a mini PC. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Excited for 2024’s RLCS World Championship? The massive Rocket League event is just around the corner, and competitors are gearing up to take on one another in what will be some of the most intense car-soccer action fans will ever see. </p>



<p>Here is everything you need to know about RLCS World Championship 2024, including its prize pool, dates and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-rlcs-world-championship-2024-prize-pool">RLCS World Championship 2024 Prize Pool</h2>



<p>This year’s RLCS has a massive prize pool of $1,165,500 for which the 16 qualifying teams will be competing for. Here is the official prize pool split:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1st:</strong> $300,000</li>



<li><strong>2nd: </strong>$150,000</li>



<li><strong>3rd-4th:</strong> $99,000</li>



<li><strong>5th-6th:</strong> $84,000</li>



<li><strong>7th-8th:</strong> $66,000</li>

<li><strong>12th-14th:</strong> $22,500</li>



<li><strong>15th-16h:</strong> $12,000</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>On top of this massive prize pool, the winners of the RLCS World Championship will also be able to hold high the historic World Championship Trophy. </p>



<h2 id="h-rlcs-world-championship-2024-official-dates">RLCS World Championship 2024 Official Dates</h2>



<p>Curious as to when the RLCS World Championship 2024 is? <strong>The event, which will be taking place at Dickies Arena in Forth Worth, Texas, will be taking place from September 10-15.</strong></p>



<p>With the event inching closer and closer to fruition, many fans are getting excited to see their favorite teams compete against one another, but what teams are actually competing?</p>



<h2 id="h-teams">Teams</h2>



<p>The RLCS World Championship has 16 teams competing this year. Here is a list of everything team competing:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gentle Mates Alpine</li>



<li>Team BDS</li>



<li>Team Vitality</li>



<li>Karmine Corp</li>



<li>G2 Stride</li>



<li>Gen.G Mobil1 Racing</li>



<li>Spacestation Gaming</li>



<li>OG</li>



<li>PWR</li>



<li>QuikTrip Pioneers Gaming</li>



<li>FURIA Esports</li>



<li>Team Secret</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>Anything</li>



<li>Gaimin Gladiators</li>



<li>Limitless</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-format">Format</h2>



<p>For this year’s format, we get to see eight teams from the bottom 16 seeds compete against the top eight seeds. Although, there will still be a Swiss stage, where all 16 teams will compete against each other. </p>



<p>The top eight Swiss teams will then be seeded into a single-elimination bracket. What is interesting in this year’s tournament, is the top four Swiss teams will start with two chances before the final four, where teams ranked 5th-8th will only have one life when competing. </p>



<p>That extra life definitely gives the top four Swiss teams a heavy advantage, adding quite a bit of pressure against the other teams. This tournament series is already looking to be incredibly competitive.</p>

After it was released on Hulu via streaming, it received numerous awards, set some ratings records for the service, and gained a lot of buzz. Disney-owned 20th Century Studios seems to have realized that they have a winning formula on its hands and are quickly moving forward on the next <em>Predator</em> film, which will be released in theaters this time around. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.avpgalaxy.net/2024/08/27/predator-badlands-filming-in-new-zealand-story-synopsis-lead-character-spoilers/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.avpgalaxy.net/2024/08/27/predator-badlands-filming-in-new-zealand-story-synopsis-lead-character-spoilers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As first reported by <em>AvPGalaxy</em></a></span>, a site with a solid track record reporting on <em>Alien </em>and <em>Predator</em> news, the next mainline <em>Predator </em>film has been filming in New Zealand since July.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-not-tech-issues-according-to-source<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Black Myth: Wukong's delay on Xbox is due to an exclusivity deal with Sony, a knowledgeable source has told IGN, corroborating reporting on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/27/new-report-sheds-light-on-why-black-myth-wukong-isnt-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a> as well as what IGN has heard elsewhere.</p><p>The source denied that Black Myth: Wukong's delay is due to a memory leak issue, which was circulated by Spanish leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1827840322623119683" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eXtas1s</a> after what they said was a conversation with Xbox developers at Gamescom. Because of that, they claimed, Black Myth: Wukong had not been able to pass bug detection tests and was thus delayed indefinitely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>However, IGN understands that no tech issue that would delay Black Myth: Wukong has been reported to Xbox. Rather, the Xbox delay is the result of an exclusivity deal neither Game Science nor Sony have publicized, the source said. The source described the rumors of tech issues on Xbox as "inaccurate."</p><p>IGN has reached out to both Game Science and Sony for comment on these reports.</p><p>The new information follows a series of confusing rumors and contradictary statement stretching back to June. Observers first noted the delay when Xbox Series X|S vanished from the Black Myth: Wukong trailer shown during Summer Game Fest. In its <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a>, Game Science said that it was still optimizing the Xbox version.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PC Games</h3></div></output><p>"We are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards, so it won't release simultaneously with the other platforms. We apologize for the delay and aim to minimize the wait for Xbox users. We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards," Game Science's FAQ read.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-addresses-black-myth-wukongs-delay-on-xbox-series-xs">Microsoft released its own statement</a> on June 21, saying, "We’re excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. We can't comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that."</p><h2>Black Myth: Wukong is a technical monster</h2><p>The rumors of a tech issue were fueled in part by Baldur's Gate 3's Xbox saga in 2023, which saw the Xbox version delayed until December due to difficulties optimizing for Xbox Series S. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-reveals-impressive-optimization-efforts-for-xbox-series-s-port-of-baldurs-gate-3">Larian was eventually forced to remove split-screen co-op from the Xbox Series S version</a> in order to get Baldur's Gate 3 to Microsoft's platform.</p><p>The rumors were given further credence by the fact that Black Myth: Wukong is a technical monster, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc">our review noting that its fidelity was enough to even make a top-end rig with an RTX 4090 sweat</a>. Game Science has apologized for any tech problems players encountered, and today <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-patch-10814860-makes-some-crucial-fixes-and-nerfs-one-boss-in-particular">released a 1.6 GB patch with various fixes and adjustments</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One way or another, Black Myth: Wukong is doing just fine, pushing Steam to an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-lifts-steam-to-37-million-concurrent-players-for-first-time">incredible 37 million concurrent players</a> for the first time earlier this week.

The developer revealed Runewords as an expansion-exclusive feature that will let players combine runes in order to essentially craft new abilities.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux9zeqdMF-g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ux9zeqdMF-g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">To create a Runeword, players will need to combine a Rune of Ritual and a Rune of Invocation. These effectively serve as a resource generator and a resource spender, respectively. The Rune of Ritual will specify a type of action that must be done in order to activate it, with an example being casting a skill with a cooldown. Fulfilling that Rune of Ritual will generate a new resource, Offering, which is then used in turn to activate the Runeword's Rune of Invocation. If a player has more Offering than what the Rune of Invocation requires, they gain Overflow, which grants that Runeword bonus effects that are proportional to the amount of Overflow.</p><p dir="ltr">Only two Runewords will be equipable at a time, and they will use the same sockets that currently are used for gems. The same Runeword can't be equipped twice, and there are three rarities of each rune, with higher rarities being more powerful. Runes can be acquired throughout the Vessel of Hatred expansion, but there will be a specific area, The Undercity, where players can farm for them as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The powers gained from Runewords can have a variety of effects. One Runeword, for example, will grant players access to the Sorcerer's Teleport ability. Another will channel the Druid's Petrify skill, stunning enemies and increasing damage dealt to them. In total, Blizzard said each class will have two skills and one Legendary Aspect represented in the pool of possible Runewords.</p><p dir="ltr">Runes can also be used for crafting. Combining three of the same Rune will create a new rune, with a chance of it rolling at a higher rarity. Runes in conjunction with a Resplendent Spark can also be used to craft certain Mythic Unique items, giving players yet another way to obtain some of the game's most sought after items.</p><p dir="ltr">Runewords are just one of the new features coming in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Diablo 4's first expansion on October 8</a>.

                <p>One of the most popular games at the moment, Black Myth: Wukong, is reportedly not on Xbox Series X|S due to a non-publicized exclusivity clause between Sony and developer GameScience.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-not-tech-issues-according-to-source" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> and <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1829211594108350790" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>, previous claims stating that the Xbox version was delayed because of a technical memory issue were inaccurate. Instead, the game is reportedly currently a console exclusive--at least for now--on PlayStation 5.</p><p>Neither Sony nor GameScience have said anything about possible exclusivity deals, but GameScience said the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-delayed-but-only-on-one-platform/1100-6524046/" data-ref-id="1100-6524046">currently being optimized</a> on Xbox.

"We can't comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that."</p><p>In the past, issues with Series S have prompted delays to other games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819">like Baldur's Gate 3,</a> because of the need to launch both Series X and S versions simultaneously with feature parity. However, that's apparently not what's going on here with Black Myth: Wukong.</p><p>Black Myth: Wukong has become one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-is-now-one-of-the-fastest-selling-games-ever/1100-6526082/" data-ref-id="1100-6526082">fastest-selling games of all time</a>, selling 10 million copies between its launch on August 20 through August 23.
