            <p>Destiny and Marathon developers Bungie are laying off 220 people - around 17% of their total workforce - as studio heads try to offset a financial crisis brought on by "overly ambitious" expansion, individual project "misfires", and a wider economic downturn in 2023. Bungie are also transferring a further 155 roles to parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment, and are spinning out an untitled incubation project - an "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe" - to form a new PlayStation studio.</p><!--more-->
<p>The news follows months of reporting that all is not well at Bungie - the company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-devs-bungie-are-the-latest-big-video-game-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">made an undisclosed number of reductions last year</a>, and were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-face-a-full-sony-takeover-and-more-layoffs-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-flops-according-to-reports">rumoured to be facing a full Sony takeover</a>, with much riding on the fortunes of Destiny 2's Final Shape DLC. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath">Writing on the developer's site today</a>, CEO Pete Parsons gave a compressed account of how Bungie has ended up in such dire straits. "For over five years, it has been our goal to ship games in three enduring, global franchises," he wrote. "To realize that ambition, we set up several incubation projects, each seeded with senior development leaders from our existing teams. We eventually realized that this model stretched our talent too thin, too quickly. It also forced our studio support structures to scale to a larger level than we could realistically support, given our two primary products in development - Destiny and Marathon. </p>
<p>"Additionally, in 2023, our rapid expansion ran headlong into a broad economic slowdown, a sharp downturn in the games industry, our quality miss with Destiny 2: Lightfall, and the need to give both The Final Shape and Marathon the time needed to ensure both projects deliver at the quality our players expect and deserve," Parsons continued. "We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red."</p>
<p>Parsons's comments about "overly ambitious" expansion during the Covid lockdown years continue a depressing theme. Back at GDC, Larian CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-do-we-stop-the-next-round-of-games-industry-mass-layoffs">told me</a> that many CEOs are guilty of short-term thinking and fixating on their own bonuses, with staff further down the ladder regarded as disposable.</p>
<p>Perhaps anticipating such comments, Parsons notes that the layoffs "affect every level of the company, including most of our executive and senior leader roles", though he appears to have kept his job. The integration of other roles into Sony Interactive Entertainment, meanwhile, has helped "save a great deal of talent that would otherwise have been affected by the reduction in force."</p>
<p>Bungie's remaining 850 or so staff will now "focus development efforts entirely on Destiny and Marathon". The latter is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-rebooting-marathon-as-a-pvp-focused-loot-shooter">a PvP and loot-focussed reboot</a> of the shooter that established Bungie as an FPS developer to watch, prior to Halo: Combat Evolved. It was reportedly subject to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">creative leadership shake-up in March</a>. As for Destiny, The Final Shape was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-is-a-bizarre-dlc-and-all-the-better-for-it">well-received</a> and is a "success" in Parson's view, but evidently hasn't done well enough for the paymasters.</p>
<p>Several now-former Bungie developers have shared the news on social media. Among those hit are sound designer <a href="https://x.com/TransientGamers/status/1818671550163263679">Tzvi Sherman</a>, whose credits include Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp, artist <a href="https://x.com/WestonTJones/status/1818683671110730101">Weston T. Jones</a>, formerly of Rooster Teeth, and Marathon engine/SDET producer <a href="https://x.com/the_ragespy/status/1818673183756874159">Daryl Nelson</a>, formerly of Blizzard and The Pokemon Company.</p>
<p>Other developers have warm words for Bungie's leadership. "Inexcusable," <a href="https://x.com/A_dmg04/status/1818668997443023183">wrote</a> global community lead Dylan Gafner, who still has his job. "Industry leading talent being lost, yet again. Accountability falling upon the workers who have pushed the needle to deliver for our community time and time again." Former Destiny 2 community manager Liana Ruppert, who was laid off last year, has <a href="https://x.com/DirtyEffinHippy/status/1818681130306195616">branded</a> Parsons a "liar" and a "thief" and called on him to step down.</p>
<p>Best of luck to everybody affected.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/31/bungie-lays-off-over-200-employees-announces-plans-for-deeper-integration-with-sony<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Bungie has announced layoffs affecting 220 employees. In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath">blog post</a>, Bungie CEO Pete Parsons cites “rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions” as the primary factor while revealing some dramatic changes for the company going forward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These layoffs represent 17 percent of the studio’s workforce and affect every department of the company, with executive and senior leadership roles impacted most. Parsons states that departing employees will receive a “generous” exit package that includes severance, bonus, and health coverage. Bungie also plans to hold employee town halls, along with team and private individual meetings over the coming weeks, to help sort out the next steps. 850 employees remain following the layoffs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I realize all of this is hard news, especially following the success we have seen with The Final Shape,” Parsons writes. “But as we’ve navigated the broader economic realities over the last year, and after exhausting all other mitigation options, this has become a necessary decision to refocus our studio and our business with more realistic goals and viable financials.”</p>

</article><p>Parsons also reveals plans to further integrate Bungie into Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), which <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/01/31/sony-announces-its-acquiring-bungie-for-36-billion">acquired the studio in 2022</a>, to leverage its strengths. Firstly, Bungie is working to integrate 155 roles (12 percent of its staff) into SIE over the next few quarters. Bungie states this has allowed it to save additional talent that would have otherwise been affected by today's layoffs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, Bungie is working with PlayStation Studios to form a new, separate in-house studio that will continue developing one of its incubation projects. Bungie describes this title as, “an action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe.”</p>

<p>Parsons then elaborates on how Bungie found itself in this difficult position. He explains that the team’s goal was to ship games in “three enduring, global franchises” and set up several incubation projects to achieve this aim. However, Bungie found itself stretched thin too quickly. This forced its support structures to grow larger than it could feasibly support, especially given the ongoing development of two big titles in Destiny 2 and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/playstation-showcase/2023/05/24/bungie-is-revitalizing-its-old-shooter-series-marathon">Marathon</a>.</p>

<p>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</p>

</article><p>Parsons also cites this rapid expansion collided with a broader economic slowdown, the sharp downturn games industry, the mixed reception to Destiny 2: Lightfall, and the need to give the recently released The Final Shape expansion for Destiny 2 (which garnered&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/destiny-2-the-final-shape/for-the-guardians">critical acclaim</a>) and Marathon more development time to ensure a high quality. “We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red,” Parsons states.</p>

<p>“After this new trajectory became clear, we knew we had to change our course and speed, and we did everything we could to avoid today’s outcome," Parsons writes. "Even with exhaustive efforts undertaken across our leadership and product teams to resolve our financial challenges, these steps were simply not enough.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today’s layoffs come roughly eight months after the studio <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/30/destiny-2-dev-bungie-hit-with-layoffs-just-15-months-after-playstation-acquisition">cut 100 staffers last October</a>, and the second since it was acquired by Sony. It represents another wave of game industry job cuts that have run rampant since last year, and hopefully the affected staff can land on their feet sooner than later.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Microsoft is <a href="https://discord.com/blog/see-whats-happening-on-discord-directly-from-your-xbox">expanding Discord support</a> on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One with a number of new features - including a consolidated Xbox and Discord friends list - that'll be rolling out to general users in the "coming weeks" following a bit of Insider testing.
</p>
<p>
Starting with that Xbox Friends list, Discord friends who are gaming or chatting in Discord Voice will soon appear in the "Happening now" tab alongside Xbox friends in parties or games. Additionally, if a friend is talking or streaming a game in a Discord server voice channel, that channel will also be shown in "Happening Now".
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, once the update is available, it'll be possible to initiate a Discord call, jump straight into a voice channel, or watch a friend streaming directly from the Xbox Friends list.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Xbox/Discord</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
And on that last point, when a Discord friend is streaming their game in voice, watching directly on Xbox Series X/S or Xbox One first requires opening a conversation's member list in the Xbox guide. From there, select the profile of the person streaming in the call, choose "Watch Stream", and their gameplay will be shown full-screen.

			<p>Sony has just <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/31/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-august-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-fnaf-security-breach-ender-lilies-quietus-of-the-knights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the August 2024 lineup of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. By far, the most exciting addition is LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.</p>
<p>The licensed open-world title released by TT Games in 2022 <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-biggest-lego-launch-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> new sales records for a LEGO game, with 3.2 million units sold in just two weeks. LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga received an eight out of ten score from Nathan Birch in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>In my preview of Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, I worried that the game’s more complex story missions may discourage younger players, and honestly, those concerns were valid. The game doesn’t always explain its objectives as well as it could, to the point even I was confused at times. Of course, parents can help youngsters along via drop-in local co-op, but you’re not always going to be able to head off the frustration and tantrums. That said, I think most kids will have a blast just messing around in the new sandbox stages. TT Games has done a solid job of catering to both sides of the force here – a somewhat more demanding campaign for the parents, and fun sandbox playgrounds for the kiddos.</em></p>
<p><em>And there’s plenty to keep both parents and kids busy. Even given the game’s skimming, it will still take you around 15 hours to play through nine movies worth of story missions, and those looking to collect every brick, stub, character, and vehicle will double or triple that playtime. The Skywalker Saga may be done in theaters, but the game won’t be for a while.</em></p>
<p>The August PlayStation Plus lineup also includes two more games: the dark fantasy 2D action RPG Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights for PlayStation 4 users and the family-friendly horror game <a href="https://wccftech.com/five-nights-at-freddys-security-gameplay-trailer-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Five Nights at Freddy’s Security Breach</a>, which is available on both PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>As a reminder, PlayStation Plus subscribers still have until August 6 to grab July's games (Borderlands 3, NHL 24, and Among Us) for their libraries.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[More Details On The Latest Bungie Layoffs]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/more-details-on-the-latest-bungie-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-details-on-the-latest-bungie-layoffs.941460/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/more-details-on-the-latest-bungie-layoffs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>On Wednesday morning, Bungie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-announces-major-layoffs-and-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced mass layoffs</a> and employee transitions at the company. These layoffs resulted in 220 people being let go, 155 people moved to Sony, and 75 people moved to a new studio. And while the numbers are known, what wasn’t initially known was what specific teams or areas were impacted the layoffs.</p>



<p>“These actions will affect every level of the company, including most of our executive and senior leader roles,” CEO Pete Parsons said when announcing the layoffs. </p>



<p>Some of those levels, Insider Gaming has learned, include quality control, player support, and  developers focusing on art, sound, music, and more. And some areas have been hit more than others.</p>



<p>“My whole team is gone,” former Player Support Analyst Alexandra <a href="https://x.com/_AlexTheGr8r_/status/1818685353462841504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on Twitter.</a></p>



<p>“And I’m affected,” former <a href="https://x.com/TimeSpaceCos/status/1818669347185082660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie merchandise employee Allie said</a>. “I’m so sick and tired of these layoffs. Unionize unionize unionize.”</p>



<p>“[T]here’s nothing i could’ve done to not be laid off. in fact i was literally working so much that so many people told me “you’ll be ok, we need you to train/manage the outsourcers,” Nadia, who worked on music for Bungie, <a href="https://x.com/nadiaudio/status/1818671538918637988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a>.</p>



<p>As far as any senior leader and executive roles, Insider Gaming has yet to confirm any that have been let go as of writing. Should we come across that information, this article will be updated accordingly.</p>



<hr>



<p>What do you make of the scale of the layoffs at Bungie? Do you think more higher-level executives should be held accountable?</p>

<!-- cache hit 61:single/related:d230c168bfb08d7266f4cf7c90fbb9d7 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Microsoft's revenue from Xbox console sales was down a whopping 42 percent on a year-over-year basis for the quarter ending in June, the company announced in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/FY-2024-Q4/press-release-webcast">its latest earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>The massive drop continues a long, pronounced slide for sales of Microsoft's gaming hardware—the Xbox line has now shown year-over-year declines in hardware sales revenue in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/putting-microsofts-cratering-xbox-console-sales-in-context/">six of the last seven calendar quarters</a> (and seven of the last nine). And Microsoft CFO Amy Hood told investors in a follow-up call (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activison-continues-to-boost-xbox-revenues-but-hardware-sees-further-decline">as reported by GamesIndustry.biz</a>) to expect hardware sales to decline yet again in the coming fiscal quarter, which ends in September.
</p><p>The 42 percent drop for quarterly hardware revenue—by far the largest such drop since the introduction of the Xbox Series X/S in 2020—follows an 11 percent year-over-year decline in the second calendar quarter of 2023.</p>
<h2>Peaking too early?</h2>
<p>Microsoft no longer shares raw console shipment numbers like its competitors, so we don't know how many Xbox consoles are selling on an absolute basis. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-shipped-five-times-more-ps5-consoles-last-quarter-than-microsoft-did-with-xbox">industry analyst Daniel Ahmad estimates</a> that Microsoft sold less than 900,000 Xbox units for the quarter ending in March, compared to 4.5 million PS5 units shipped in the same period.</p>
<p>Overall, the reported revenue numbers suggest that sales of the Xbox Series X/S line peaked sometime in 2022, during the console's second full year on store shelves. That's extremely rare for a market where sales for successful console hardware <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/has-the-ps4-peaked-annual-console-sales-are-flat-for-2017/">usually see a peak in the fourth or fifth year on the market</a> before a slow decline in the run-up to a successor.</p>

<p>The older Nintendo Switch, which launched in 2017, is now firmly in that sales decline period of its life cycle. Yet worldwide unit sales for the console declined only 36 percent year-over-year—to 1.96 million units shipped—for the first calendar quarter of the year. That's a less precipitous relative drop than Microsoft is now facing with the much younger Xbox Series X/S.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Annual sales of Sony's PlayStation 5 have continued to rise in recent years, peaking at 20.8 million units for the fiscal year ending in March. But PS5 sales did decline over 28.5 percent year-over-year for the January-through-March quarter, just the third such quarterly decline the console has posted on a year-over-year basis (Sony has yet to post sales numbers for the April-through-June quarter).</p>
<h2>A subscription bright spot?</h2>
<p>Aside from hardware sales, Microsoft's gaming content and services revenue was up a healthy-sounding 61 percent year-over-year for the latest reported quarter. But a full 58 percent of that increase was the "net impact from the Activision acquisition," which you may remember <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/microsoft-finally-owns-candy-crush-as-it-closes-69b-activision-blizzard-deal/">cost the company $68.7 billion dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Given the cratering Xbox hardware revenues, it's not all that surprising that Microsoft is focusing on its (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/microsoft-asks-many-game-pass-subscribers-to-pay-more-for-less/">now more expensive</a>) Game Pass subscription side to buoy the Xbox business as a whole.
</p><figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/xbgpu.jpg" data-height="1080" data-width="1920" alt="Xbox Game Pass continues to be a bright spot for Microsoft's gaming business."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/xbgpu.jpg" data-height="1080" data-width="1920">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Xbox Game Pass continues to be a bright spot for Microsoft's gaming business.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>"I do think the real goal here is to be able to take a broad set of content to more users in more places and really build what looks like more to us the software annuity and subscription business," Hood said during the investor call. "I think we're really encouraged by some of the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass."</p>
<p>That kind of talk suggests the Xbox brand will continue to thrive via Xbox Game Pass, and possibly through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/do-xbox-owners-have-a-right-to-expect-console-exclusives/">Xbox Game Studios games for other platforms</a>. But if these sales trends continue, we may be facing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/what-a-potential-post-xbox-future-could-mean-for-sony-and-nintendo/">a near future where physical console hardware is no longer a core part of the Xbox brand</a>.

It's a hefty 544-page hardcover tome of character illustrations, promotional art, rough concepts, detailed creator commentary, and an interview with series artist Shigenori Soejima, this will be an essential purchase for Persona fans.</p><p>Art books and collectibles based on Atlus games tend to be very popular, and since Persona 5 is the studio's most popular RPG, we'd expect this book to be uniquely popular in comparison to previous Atlus art books and encyclopedias. The Design Works books for each Persona game typically have limited print runs as well, so once they're gone, you'll have to deal with the reseller market in case you don't reserve an order.</p><p>Priced at $73.40 currently, this price will almost certainly change prior to launch; as a reminder, Amazon will only charge you when the book ships out from its warehouse. You'll also be billed the lowest price at that time, so you won't have to worry about losing out on any potential discounts by preordering now.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you haven't played it, Persona 5 tells the story of the Phantom Thieves, high school students who save people from the twisted desires of those around them by awakening the power of their true selves. It's wonderfully weird stuff, and worth checking out. It's available on all modern platforms, and since it has been out for a few years, you can get a pretty good deal on a game that'll keep you occupied for dozens of hours.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Destiny</em> developer Bungie <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced layoffs</a> today, with plans to cut 220 people across the studio, which will include "most of our executive and senior leader roles."</p><p>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons cited "rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions" for the decision, which will affect about 17% of the studio's workforce. </p><p>In addition to the cuts, Parsons wrote that Bungie is "working to integrate 155 of our roles, roughly 12%, into [owner Sony] over the next few quarters.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/31/bungie-lays-off-220-staff/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bungie has announced it is laying off 220 staff, approximately 17% of its workforce, across all levels of the company including leadership roles. Pete Parsons, CEO of Bungie, has released a long statement for the reasons why 220 will be losing their jobs at the development studio. This includes the economic downturn of recent years, and costs relating to Destiny 2 and Marathon exceeding the financial limits of the company.</p>
<p>Pete Parsons has also confirmed that Bungie will become more integrated into Sony Interactive Entertainment, with 12% of roles being moved over to Sony. In addition, Bungie is spinning off a yet unnamed project into PlayStation Studios with the establishment of a new studio to continue work on the project. The full statement can be read below.</p>


<p><em>This morning, I’m sharing with all of you some of the most difficult changes we’ve ever had to make as a studio. Due to rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions, it has become clear that we need to make substantial changes to our cost structure and focus development efforts entirely on Destiny and Marathon. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>That means beginning today, 220 of our roles will be eliminated, representing roughly 17% of our studio’s workforce.  &nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p><em>These actions will affect every level of the company, including most of our executive and senior leader roles.   &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>Today is a difficult and painful day, especially for our departing colleagues, all of which have made important and valuable contributions to Bungie. Our goal is to support them with the utmost care and respect. For everyone affected by this job reduction, we will be offering a generous exit package, including severance, bonus and health coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I realize all of this is hard news, especially following the success we have seen with The Final Shape. But as we’ve navigated the broader economic realities over the last year, and after exhausting all other mitigation options, this has become a necessary decision to refocus our studio and our business with more realistic goals and viable financials.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We are committing to two other major changes today that we believe will support our focus, leverage Sony’s strengths, and create new opportunities for Bungie talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>First, we are deepening our integration with Sony Interactive Entertainment, working to integrate 155 of our roles, roughly 12%, into SIE over the next few quarters. SIE has worked tirelessly with us to identify roles for as many of our people as possible, enabling us together to save a great deal of talent that would otherwise have been affected by the reduction in force.   &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Second, we are working with PlayStation Studios leadership to spin out one of our incubation projects – an action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe – to form a new studio within PlayStation Studios to continue its promising development.  &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>This will be a time of tremendous change for our studio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s unpack how we ended up in this position; it’s important to understand how we got here. </em></p>
<p><em>For over five years, it has been our goal to ship games in three enduring, global franchises. To realize that ambition, we set up several incubation projects, each seeded with senior development leaders from our existing teams. We eventually realized that this model stretched our talent too thin, too quickly.  It also forced our studio support structures to scale to a larger level than we could realistically support, given our two primary products in development – Destiny and Marathon. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, in 2023, our rapid expansion ran headlong into a broad economic slowdown, a sharp downturn in the games industry, our quality miss with Destiny 2: Lightfall, and the need to give both The Final Shape and Marathon the time needed to ensure both projects deliver at the quality our players expect and deserve. We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>After this new trajectory became clear, we knew we had to change our course and speed, and we did everything we could to avoid today’s outcome. Even with exhaustive efforts undertaken across our leadership and product teams to resolve our financial challenges, these steps were simply not enough.  &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>As a result, today we must say goodbye to incredible talent, colleagues, and friends.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>This will be a challenging time at Bungie, and we’ll need to help our team navigate these changes in the weeks and months ahead. This will be a hard week, and we know that our team will need time to process, to ask questions, and to absorb this news. Today, and over the next several weeks, we will host team meetings and town halls, team breakout sessions, and private, individual sessions to ensure we are keeping our communication open and transparent. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Bungie will continue to make great games. We still have over 850 team members building Destiny and Marathon, and we will continue to build amazing experiences that exceed our players’ expectations.   &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>There will be a time to talk about our goals and projects, but today is not that day. Today, our focus is on supporting our people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie has announced layoffs to the tune of over 200 employees as part of what studio head Pete Parsons calls a "new path" for the company.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> made on the Bungie website earlier today, 220 Bungie staffers, or around 17% of the studio's total workforce, will be let go due to "rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions".</p>
<p>Parsons says that despite the success of&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s latest expansion&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>(of which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-final-shape-expansion-leaks">May's major leak</a> was presumably not a part), the decision to lay off hundreds of employees was "necessary" in order to move towards "more realistic goals and viable financials".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-the-final-shape.jpg?itok=w9VANFsY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-the-final-shape.jpg?itok=1FnJ5zeK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie has laid off hundreds of its employees.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as 220 employees being let go, around 155 staffers from Bungie are being integrated into Sony, which Parsons says will enable his studio to "save a great deal of talent" that would otherwise have been let go.</p>
<p>Additionally, although Bungie has seemingly canceled a number of what it calls "incubation projects", one such in-development project, an "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe", will be spun off as a new game to be developed by a newly-created internal PlayStation studio. This project may or may not be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-teases-new-team-based-action-game-set-in-lighthearted-science-fantasy-universe">light-hearted action game</a> revealed by Bungie last year.</p>
<p>These "incubation projects" were, according to Parsons, attempts to expand its work to ship games in "three enduring, global franchises". They would have been headed up by senior execs from existing Bungie teams, but over the course of the last 18 months or so, Bungie leadership realized the incubation project model would "stretch [its] talent too thin, too quickly".</p>
<p>Parsons says that Bungie became "overly ambitious" during this period, and that it was "running in the red". The studio head goes on to say that Bungie did everything it could to "avoid today's outcome", but that it was unable to do so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bungie-layoffs-marathon.jpg?itok=jZ89mOZq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bungie-layoffs-marathon.jpg?itok=kHmFeEAW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie is now focusing all its efforts on&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Parsons says that Bungie still has more than 850 staffers working on&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>-related projects, and that it will share more information about its upcoming projects in the future.</p>
<p>This isn't the first round of Bungie layoffs within the last 12 months. Back in October, the studio reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-reportedly-laid-off-100-employees-due-to-poor-destiny-2-sales-as-more-detail">laid off around 100 employees</a> following poor sales of the&nbsp;<em>Lightfall&nbsp;</em>expansion. Additionally, in February, Bungie's parent company Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">let around 900 employees from various studios go</a>, although Bungie seemingly wasn't among them.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Bungie has in store for the future, but for now, more than 200 of its employees find themselves without a job. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> publisher EA has narrowed down the game's release window slightly, and indicated it will launch after 1st October. 
</p>
<p>
Previously missing from EA's last financial results calendar, the publisher now lists BioWare's upcoming long-awaited RPG as being set to launch in its financial Q3. 
</p>
<p>
EA's first financial quarter of the year ended on 30th June, while its second ends on 30th September. BioWare meanwhile has given The Veilguard a vague "fall" or autumn launch window.

<p>
So, if you're wondering whether to book time off for BioWare's game in September - don't bother. The Veilguard will now launch in autumn, but not before 1st October.
</p>
<p>
The Veilguard's launch window eschews the typical post-Christmas arrival time that BioWare has picked for Mass Effect 2 (January 2010), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a> (March 2011), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a> (March 2012), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect Andromeda</a> (March 2017) and Anthem (February 2019). 
</p>
<p>
Dragon Age Inquisition bucked that trend by being an end of year release, in November 2014. Here's hoping we don't have to wait quite as long as November 2024 for The Veilguard.
</p>
<p>
Other tentpole releases this end-of-year season include Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (25th October) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> (15th November).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As of today, 220 roles in Bungie will be eliminated, removing roughly 17% of their workforce, as reported by Pete Parsons, the CEO of Bungie. This news comes as a blog post on the Bungie website titled "The New Path for Bungie."</p>
<p>These layoffs result from rising costs of development and industry shifts, "as well as enduring economic conditions. It has become clear that we need to make substantial changes to our cost structure and focus development efforts entirely on Destiny and Marathon."</p>
<p>Pete Parsons goes on to say that these layoffs will affect people from all over Bungie. From junior roles to the most executive roles, they will affect plenty of people across the team. To try and compensate the people affected by these layoffs, Parsons has assured that there is a "generous exit package, including severance, bonus, and health coverage."</p>
<p>In addition to the 220 people who are losing their jobs, Parsons goes on to explain two major changes that will be happening within Bungie and how they will affect the company as a whole. The first announcement is their <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-destiny-2-total-sony-takeover-feared-soul-crushing/">deepening integration</a> with Sony Interactive Entertainment. By deepening the integration, it means that 155 roles, which is 12% of the company, will be integrated into Sony Interactive Entertainment in a slow, methodical order.</p>
<p>"SIE has worked tirelessly with us to identify roles for as many of our people as possible, enabling us together to save a great deal of talent that would otherwise have been affected by the reduction in force."</p>
<p>In addition to the wider Sony Interactive Entertainment integration, Bungie has also announced that they are working with PlayStation Studios leadership to create one of their incubation projects. This will be an action game set in a new science-fantasy universe. By developing this game, Bungie hopes to form a new studio within PlayStation Studios to "continue its promising development." This will be the third franchise in addition to Destiny and the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Marathon reboot.</p>
<p>While they have let go of 220 people today in new layoffs, Bungie still has over 850 team members who are working on consistent development for Destiny and Marathon and "will continue to build amazing experiences that exceed our players' expectations."</p>
<p>While Parsons explains how they got into this position, much of it revolving around the negative turnout for Destiny 2: Lightfall, he also expresses how they needed to give both The Final Shape and Marathon "the time needed to ensure both projects deliver at the quality our players expect and deserve." However, as a result of this, he admits they were overly ambitious, with financial safety margins exceeded and their finances beginning to run into the red.</p>
<p>As part of his sign off on the<a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> blog post</a>, he also expresses that they will talk about their goals and projects in the future, but that update will not come today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/31/the-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-august-2024-have-been-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The next set of PlayStation Plus games have been revealed by Sony and it’s a mixed bag of family friendly fun, horror. and dark fantasy. Let’s have a look at what you are getting.</p>
<h5>LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga (PS4/PS5)</h5>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Star Wars™: The Skywalker Saga - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9ldIurDMgo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s time to play through the entire Skywalker saga but you don’t have to always play as a Skywalker, why not play as a Sith lord instead? “Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the most ambitious Lego game yet, and despite the occasional technical mishap it delivers a daring and often delightful romp through the most iconic film franchise of all time,” we said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/02/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">8/10 review.</a></p>
<h5>Five Nights at Freddy’s Security Breach (PS4/PS5)</h5>
<p><iframe title="Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach - Gameplay Trailer | PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BY9-jWQQHgw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>An older game here from 2021 and we did not review it at the time, so here’s something from the PlayStation Blog. “Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach is the latest installment of the family-friendly horror games from Steel Wool Games. Play as Gregory, a young boy trapped overnight in Freddy Fazbear’s Mega Pizzaplex. With the help of Freddy Fazbear himself, Gregory must survive the near-unstoppable hunt of reimagined Five Nights at Freddy’s characters – as well as new, horrific threats.”</p>
<h5>Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights (PS4)</h5>
<p><iframe title="ENDER LILIES - Steam Early Access Announcement Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgJm0BbzQvs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Another game from 2021 and another game we did not review, but we did have a look when it hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/19/ender-lilies-early-access-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Early Access.</a> “When it comes to wowing its audience from the start, few early access titles have done quite as well as Ender Lilies. Sure, there are areas that could be improved, such as the addition of more cinematic cutscenes to aid the story, but even without those, this has the potential to be a masterpiece,” said Emma.</p>
<p>All three games will be available to PlayStation Plus members on August 6th until September 2nd. PlayStation Plus members have until August 6 to the add the July games – Borderlands 3, NHL 24 and Among Us – to their game libraries</p>

Bungie CEO Pete Parsons <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath">made the announcement on the studio’s website</a>, citing the increasing costs of development and economic conditions as the reason for the reduction of staff — a refrain that’s become common in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite">the last two years</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065868/a-dark-shadow-falls-across-the-gaming-industry">prolific video game industry layoffs</a>. Parsons wrote that 220 roles would be eliminated, representing 17 percent of the company’s workforce. </p><p>Additionally, Parsons wrote that Bungie was working to integrate another 155 employees into other departments within Sony Interactive Entertainment. These numbers, combined with the 100 people laid off in October of last year, mean that Bungie has lost roughly 40 percent of its total workforce in the last 12 months. Bungie had around 1,200 employees last year before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938990/bungie-sony-layoffs-delays-destiny-final-shape-marathon">100 people were laid off</a> amid <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938990/bungie-sony-layoffs-delays-destiny-final-shape-marathon">a delay to the big <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> expansion</a>.</p><p>This latest layoff announcement was accompanied by the news that Bungie employees are working on a new game.</p><p>“We are working with PlayStation Studios leadership to spin out one of our incubation projects – an action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe – to form a new studio within PlayStation Studios to continue its promising development,” Parsons wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Parsons offered an explanation for all the news, stating that Bungie grew too quickly and spread its leadership team too thin among its many projects. This had a knock-on effect on the studio’s known projects, resulting in what Parsons called a “quality miss” with <em>Destiny 2</em>’s <em>Lightfall</em> expansion and the delay of its next game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23735830/bungie-marathon-sci-fi-pvp-extraction-shooter"><em>Marathon</em></a>.</p><p>“We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red,” he wrote.</p><p>Parsons wrote that Bungie will continue to focus on <em>Destiny 2</em> and <em>Marathon</em>. “We still have over 850 team members building <em>Destiny </em>and <em>Marathon</em>, and we will continue to build amazing experiences that exceed our players’ expectations.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It said people at "every level of the company" will be impacted, including those in senior and executive roles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Today is a difficult and painful day, especially for our departing colleagues, all of which have made important and valuable contributions to Bungie. Our goal is to support them with the utmost care and respect.

"SIE has worked tirelessly with us to identify roles for as many of our people as possible, enabling us together to save a great deal of talent that would otherwise have been affected by the reduction in force," Parsons continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also working with PlayStation to establish a new studio to spin out one of its incubation projects, which it describes as an action game set in a brand-new sci-fi universe.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This will be a time of tremendous change for our studio. Let's unpack how we ended up in this position; it’s important to understand how we got here. For over five years, it has been our goal to ship games in three enduring, global franchises. To realize that ambition, we set up several incubation projects, each seeded with senior development leaders from our existing teams," said Parsons.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We eventually realized that this model stretched our talent too thin, too quickly.  It also forced our studio support structures to scale to a larger level than we could realistically support, given our two primary products in development–</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marathon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. </span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Additionally, in 2023, our rapid expansion ran headlong into a broad economic slowdown, a sharp downturn in the games industry, our quality miss with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2: Lightfall</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the need to give both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Final Shape</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marathon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the time needed to ensure both projects deliver at the quality our players expect and deserve.

<p>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the latest bricktastic take on that galaxy far, far away, and includes all three of the film trilogies in one package.</p>
<p>"For the most part, the game's film retellings are humorous if simple fun - there's nothing here you can't button mash or Lego brick smash through - and I particularly enjoyed Rise of Skywalker, where that film's often-daft script is well sent-up," our Tom wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-review-a-complete-but-cluttered-collection">Eurogamer's Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga review from 2022</a>.</p>
<p>However, despite this playfulness in the levels, "after a quick tour," Tom felt, the game's "open worlds held less pull".</p> <div>

            <p>
Destiny developer Bungie has laid off another 220 staff, representing roughly 17 percent of the studio's workforce.
</p>
<p>
In October last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">studio laid off 100 staff</a> from its then 1200-strong workforce. That means Bungie has laid off around a quarter of its workforce in the past nine months.
</p>
<p>
The news was shared today in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath">blog post from Bungie CEO Pete Parsons</a>, describing the decision as "some of the most difficult changes we've ever had to make as a studio".

</p>
<p>
"Due to rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions, it has become clear that we need to make substantial changes to our cost structure and focus development efforts entirely on Destiny and Marathon," said Parsons.
</p>
<p>
"These actions will affect every level of the company, including most of our executive and senior leader roles.  
</p>
<p>
"Today is a difficult and painful day, especially for our departing colleagues, all of which have made important and valuable contributions to Bungie. Our goal is to support them with the utmost care and respect. For everyone affected by this job reduction, we will be offering a generous exit package, including severance, bonus and health coverage.  
</p>
<p>
"I realise all of this is hard news, especially following the success we have seen with The Final Shape. But as we've navigated the broader economic realities over the last year, and after exhausting all other mitigation options, this has become a necessary decision to refocus our studio and our business with more realistic goals and viable financials."
</p>
<p>
Parsons added Bungie is committing to two major changes.
</p>
<p>
The first is deeper integration with Sony to "integrate 155 of our roles, roughly 12 percent, into SIE over the next few quarters". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">Sony bought Bungie in February 2022 for $3.6bn</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Secondly, Bungie will move one of its early-development projects - an "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe" - to PlayStation Studios to form a new studio.
</p>
<p>
Collectively, between moving staff and layoffs, Bungie is down-sizing considerably, though Parsons explicitly stated the studio has "over 850 team members building Destiny and Marathon".
</p>
<p>
For the past five years, explained Parsons, Bungie has strived to ship games across "three enduring, global franchises" but has since realised this "stretched our talent too thin, too quickly". This is in addition to a "broad economic slowdown", a "sharp downturn" in the games industry, and a "quality miss with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2-lightfall">Destiny 2: Lightfall</a>".
</p>
<p>
"We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red," Parsons surmised.
</p>
<p>
"After this new trajectory became clear, we knew we had to change our course and speed, and we did everything we could to avoid today's outcome. Even with exhaustive efforts undertaken across our leadership and product teams to resolve our financial challenges, these steps were simply not enough."
</p>
<p>Bungie global community lead Dylan Gafner described the decision as "inexcusable" in a post on X. "Industry leading talent being lost, yet again," he wrote. "Accountability falling upon the workers who have pushed the needle to deliver for our community time and time again."</p> <div>

<p>
These new layoffs at Bungie are just the latest across the industry. In February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">Sony itself laid off 900 PlayStation employees</a> and closed London Studio entirely.

</p>
<p>
Just last week, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-confirms-restructuring-amid-reports-all-staff-have-been-laid-off">Humble Games laid off a number of employees as part of a restructuring</a>, which has since had a knock-on effect to other studios such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/coral-island-developer-blames-humble-games-layoffs-for-leaving-switch-port-in-a-place-of-uncertainty">Coral Island developer Stairway Games</a>.


</p>
<p>
Back in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">Eurogamer reported over 10,000 people had been laid off from the games industry this year alone</a>. <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">That tally</a> is now at an estimated 11,200.


</p>
<p>
In December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-staff-reportedly-worried-about-bungies-future">employees at Bungie were reportedly anxious about the studio's future</a>, describing the mood as "soul-crushing".

As one of two new jobs introduced just a month ago alongside <em>Dawntrail</em>, the community is not thrilled with how quickly Square Enix has simplified the role.

This was a debuff that triggered when using Dread Fangs and required certain actions to extend the debuff timer. The point of Noxious Gnash is that it gives you something to keep track of and reapply every so often. It is supposed to add a layer of complexity to the job by requiring you pay attention to a timer on top of doing your usual action rotation and avoiding area of effect (AoE) attacks during combat. </p><p>In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/e2da42164b4e6c9967ebb2e41d6321a515d36909&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/e2da42164b4e6c9967ebb2e41d6321a515d36909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 4 post on the Lodestone</a></span> (the official <em>FF14 </em>blog) the developers mentioned they had “received feedback pertaining to the busyness of [Viper’s] skill rotation,” and would be looking into tweaking the job in patch 7.05. That came only two days after<em> Dawntrail</em>’s release. Some wondered if the changes would remove positionals (the need to attack enemies from a specific direction). Instead the removal of Noxious Gnash feels like a meaningless change, with the community pointing out that the timer wasn’t all that difficult to keep track of, so it was an odd adjustment for Square Enix to make. Who is this change for? Players aren’t sure, but they’re definitely pissed off. </p><p>More upsetting than the changes to Viper is the worrying trend it represents in terms of <em>Final Fantasy 14</em>’s job designs. The Viper changes over-simplify a job that many were incredibly happy with, and these changes happened just a month after its debut. It’s the fastest a job has received such a change but not the first time jobs have been oversimplified—the healer jobs, especially the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-astrologian-job-changes-1851482090&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-astrologian-job-changes-1851482090">Astrologian</a></span>, have suffered similar fates. With every job becoming simpler to execute it leaves those looking for a challenge no viable option, and with these recentViper changes, the issue is coming to a breaking point.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s also pretty clear that the powers that be at Marvel are ready and willing to spend whatever is deemed necessary to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-doctor-doom-kang-jonathan-majors-1850981679&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-doctor-doom-kang-jonathan-majors-1850981679">right the floundering ship that is the MCU</a></span>.</p><p>The last few years of the franchise have been mired by controversy and relative failures. The “Multiverse Saga” that Marvel’s been trying to get off the ground since about 2020 hasn’t been particularly fertile for the company, despite spending lots of time and money on interstitial Disney Plus shows that started strong and have since petered out. Recently, a number of Marvel movies have also underperformed at the box office, forcing the studio to reconsider its business model. And that’s without touching on the franchise’s notable decline in visual quality—which can be attributed to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/disney-marvel-movies-vfx-industry-nightmare-1849385834&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/disney-marvel-movies-vfx-industry-nightmare-1849385834">Marvel’s long standing mistreatment of its VFX artists</a></span>—as well as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/marvel-studios-drops-jonathan-majors-kang-the-conqueror-1851108924&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/marvel-studios-drops-jonathan-majors-kang-the-conqueror-1851108924">dismissal of Jonathan Majors</a></span>, who was set to play the ongoing saga’s major villain, after being found guilty of domestic abuse.</p><p>In short, Marvel is banking <em>hard </em>on Downey Jr. to fix its ails, and it’s throwing the whole house at him. Considering how much money he and the Russos have made Marvel—their most successful movie grossed nearly $3 billion—it isn’t a particularly surprising move on the company’s part to spend big on them. Despite the acclaim for his past role in the MCU though, as well as the apparent fervor at the announcement of his return at San Diego Comic-Con, many have already taken to poking fun of and criticizing the actor’s drastically inflated salary.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/OHMYDIAZ/status/1818128266445652432&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/OHMYDIAZ/status/1818128266445652432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One reply</a></span> to a <em>DiscussingFilm </em>post aggregating the news claimed that “You can make a whole ass superhero film with his salary.” Others joked about how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/r4yners/status/1818133286545162269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/r4yners/status/1818133286545162269" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheap the movies might look</a></span> given how much of the budget is already being funneled directly to Downey Jr. and the Russos.

<p>Destiny 2 developer Bungie has announced new large-scale layoffs and restructuring to bring down its total workforce.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s official website</a>, Bungie revealed that it’s letting go 220 people from the company, or roughly 17% of the workforce. On top of the layoffs, 155 people will be moved over to Sony while another 75 will be moved to a new studio.</p>



<p>“Today is a difficult and painful day, especially for our departing colleagues, all of which have made important and valuable contributions to Bungie,” CEO Pete Parsons said. “Our goal is to support them with the utmost care and respect. For everyone affected by this job reduction, we will be offering a generous exit package, including severance, bonus and health coverage.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parsons says that the changes to bring the company from 1,300 employees to 850 will “support [Bungie’s] focus, &nbsp;leverage Sony’s strengths, and create new opportunities for Bungie talent”.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-morale-soul-crushing-after-layoffs-and-delays/">Bungie Morale “Soul-Crushing” After Layoffs and Delays</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-why-did-bungie-make-the-layoffs">Why Did Bungie Make The Layoffs?</h2>



<p>As far as how Bungie got to the point of needing to make these mass layoffs and move talent, Parsons says that a number of factors played into the decisions.</p>



<p>“For over five years, it has been our goal to ship games in three enduring, global franchises,” he said. “To realize that ambition, we set up several incubation projects, each seeded with senior development leaders from our existing teams. We eventually realized that this model stretched our talent too thin, too quickly.  It also forced our studio support structures to scale to a larger level than we could realistically support, given our two primary products in development – Destiny and Marathon. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Additionally, in 2023, our rapid expansion ran headlong into a broad economic slowdown, a sharp downturn in the games industry, our quality miss with Destiny 2: Lightfall, and the need to give both The Final Shape and Marathon the time needed to ensure both projects deliver at the quality our players expect and deserve. We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red.”</p>



<p>It’s then said that a change of “course and speed” was needed. Despite doing “everything” they could to avoid the layoffs, it wasn’t enough, according to Parsons.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony for comment on the Bungie layoffs.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/codenames-board-game-buying-guide-and-spin-offs.941355/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/codenames-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Due to its easy-to-teach rules and quick playtime, Codenames has quickly become a recommended choice as one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups"><u>best party board games</u></a> available. While many games in the genre struggle with or don’t even support more than a few players, Codenames thrives with groups of four or more. However, the team behind Codenames didn’t settle with creating the ultimate party game; they also released several iterations of Codenames: Duet, a cooperative version of Codenames for just two players.</p><p>Like other <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">popular board games</a>, it can quickly become difficult to sift through all the various spin-offs and re-releases in the Codenames series. That’s why we crafted this handy guide to walk you through the various versions of the game. It should be noted that, with Codenames, there really isn’t a bad place to start. The different iterations play the same, more or less, but with minor tweaks. Some are better for younger gamers, some for older, and, of course, some have been reskinned to feature branding from popular franchises like Marvel, Disney, and Harry Potter.</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><p id="codenames"><h3 data-toc-title="Codenames">Codenames</h3></p><div catalogid="c274b5f0-9961-4543-8803-c365644e13fe" id="161113"><div id="161113" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Codenames</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $24.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 10+</li><li>Players: 2-8</li><li>Play Time: 15 mins</li></ul><p>Each game of Codenames begins with players forming two teams and placing 25 cards with codenames on them in a five-by-five grid. Teams then choose one spymaster each who will give clues for that game. The rival spymasters sit next to each other and pull a key card that only they can see, which contains the locations of all the spies on a grid representing the 25 cards. The goal of the spymaster is to give one-word clues that will point to as many of their spies as possible. The spymasters take turns giving clues until one team locates all nine of their spies.</p><p>Sure, it all sounds straightforward enough, but the trick is to give clues that will only point to your team’s spies. Selecting the wrong codename may help the other team locate their spies or even end the game by stumbling across the assassin card, resulting in an automatic loss. What makes this simple word association game so ingenious is that spymasters can decide how many codenames they want their team to try and guess. Players can go for an easy clue and a relatively safe number of cards or risk it all with a broad code and ask their teammates to guess at a larger number of spaces on the grid. These decisions should also be weighed against what the other team is doing. Remember, though, spymasters can only give one-word clues.</p><p>While the box says Codenames is for two to eight players, it works best with even-numbered groups of four or more. Luckily, the good folks at <a href="https://czechgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Czech Games Edition</a> created a great two-player version of the game, which we will talk about next.</p><h2>Codenames Spin-offs</h2></div><p id="codenames-duet"><h3 data-toc-title="Codenames: Duet">Codenames Duet</h3></p><div catalogid="1620a968-da01-4926-ac3e-9544983211a0" id="162167"><div id="162167" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Codenames: Duet</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $24.95 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 11+</li><li>Players: 2</li><li>Play Time: 15 mins</li></ul><p>Codenames: Duet plays similarly to the original game, but this iteration is cooperative rather than competitive. Both players take turns operating as the spymaster, trying to get their teammates to guess cards using different sides of the same key. This time, players attempt to uncover their 15 spies without encountering one of the three lurking assassin cards.</p><p>While Codenames is best as a party game, Duet offers the same addictive core gameplay to just two people. Additionally, for players who already have the original, Codenames: Duet introduces 200 new cards that are also compatible with the base game. That said, this version is a standalone box that doesn’t require the original to play, so no worries there. If you’re looking for other great titles to play with just you and another person, see our recommendations for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games"><u>best two-player board games</u></a>.</p></div><p id="codenames-pictures"><h3 data-toc-title="Codenames: Pictures">Codenames: Pictures</h3></p><div catalogid="70ddb08b-b5c8-4640-8771-dc830d75750e" id="205405"><div id="205405" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Codenames: Pictures</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $24.95 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 10+</li><li>Players: 2-8</li><li>Play Time: 15 mins</li></ul><p>As the name suggests, Codenames: Pictures uses images instead of words. This might seem like an arbitrary modification, but it serves several notable purposes. Firstly, images give players more things to describe, opening up even more possibilities for potential keywords. Additionally, the lack of reading potentially lowers the age requirement for Codenames (despite what the box might tell you). For more recommendations on titles targeted at a younger demographic, see our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids"><u>best board games for kids</u></a>.</p><p>Outside of switching to a five-by-four grid, Codenames: Pictures plays the same as the original. In fact, players with both iterations can mix picture and word cards together for a bit of an advanced session. Again, however, Codenames: Pictures is a standalone package that doesn’t require other games.</p></div><p id="codenames-disney-family-edition"><h3 data-toc-title="Codenames: Disney Family Edition">Codenames: Disney Family Edition</h3></p><div catalogid="2fd9713a-f985-4c54-adc9-157ea8f8730f" id="205406"><div id="205406" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Codenames: Disney Family Edition</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $24.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Players: 2-8</li><li>Play Time: </li></ul><p>Codenames: Disney – Family Edition is a themed version of the modern classic board game displaying words and images from the studio’s animated films. Because cards are double-sided featuring words and images, Codenames: Disney can be played like the original title, Pictures, or a mixture of both. Codenames: Disney has a couple more tricks up its sleeve to make it even more family-friendly. The Disney-themed iteration also offers an easier four-by-four grid mode with no assassin card (referred to as a ‘game over’ card in this iteration) to make Codenames even more accessible for younger audiences and new players.</p></div><p id="codenames-marvel-edition"><h3 data-toc-title="Codenames: Marvel Edition">Codenames: Marvel Edition</h3></p><div catalogid="56ed653e-4308-46fa-8d54-ea98dcd7d599" id="205407"><div id="205407" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Codenames: Marvel Edition</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $24.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 9+</li><li>Players: 2-8</li><li>Play Time: 15 mins</li></ul><p>Death, taxes, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-marvel-board-games">Marvel-themed iterations of popular board games</a>. (Hey, I’m not knocking it, as I own my fair share, but you had to know this was coming.) Like Codenames: Disney, the Marvel Edition features images and words from the immensely popular comic book universe. This time, however, the two teams are represented by S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA rather than simply red and blue. Besides that, the Marvel Edition plays the same as either the base game or Codenames: Pictures, depending on which side of the cards you choose to play with. </p></div><p id="codenames-harry-potter"><h3 data-toc-title="Codenames: Harry Potter">Codenames: Harry Potter</h3></p><div catalogid="2b99837c-1e8a-4ef8-b3fc-c9dc48085207" id="205408"><div id="205408" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Codenames: Harry Potter</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $24.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 11+</li><li>Players: 2</li><li>Play Time: 15 mins</li></ul><p>Codenames: Harry Potter is a bit different than the previous two themed entries in that it follows the gameplay from Duet. In other words, rather than being a party game like Codenames: Disney or the Marvel Edition, this Harry Potter iteration is a cooperative two-player title. Like the previous two iterations, however, cards feature both images and words, which offer Codenames: Harry Potter players a bit more variability.

CGE also plans to release an app version of the game for iOS and Android soon.</p><h2>Discontinued Versions</h2><p>There have been several iterations of Codenames over the years, and unfortunately, some of those games are no longer in print. Two examples are Codenames: Deep Undercover and Codenames: The Simpsons Family Edition. The former is an adult-themed version of Codenames complete with sexual references and double entendres. Codenames: Deep Undercover also saw a 2.0 release designed for better balance that is easier to find on retailers like Amazon. Codenames: The Simpsons Family Edition, on the other hand, is yet another themed edition of the popular title. It might not be in print anymore, but it is still easy enough to find from secondhand sellers.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Codenames is one of the best party games on the market. It’s easy to teach and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games-in-2024">plays quickly</a> at around 15 minutes. Despite what the box might tell you, Codenames is best for groups of four or more, but Codenames: Duet and the Harry Potter variant are great for two players. There are plenty of themed iterations for fans of various franchises and even XXL versions for those who want easier-to-read cards.</p><p>Check out our recommendations for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games"><u>best family board games</u></a> for even more titles for all ages.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/braid-anniversary-edition-sold-like-dogst-developer-jonathan-blow-says<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Braid developer Jonathan Blow has said the recently released anniversary edition of the indie puzzle platformer has sold “horribly,” and indicated he is now struggling to employ staff full-time.</p><p>Blow, who also created The Witness, catapulted into the upper echelons of indie video game development after Braid enjoyed enormous success on Xbox Live Arcade in 2008. It’s since become known as one of the greatest indie games of all time, with a number of perfect review scores under its belt.</p><p>16 years later, in May 2024, Blow released a remaster with fully repainted artwork, new puzzles, and in-depth commentary, across PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, Android, and iOS, with the mobile version released by Netflix to those with an active subscription. The Anniversary Edition was announced during Sony’s State of Play event in August 2020.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Braid Anniversary Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>As surfaced by a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jblow-%E2%80%9Cbraid-anniversary-has-sold-like-dog-shit%E2%80%9D.940824/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>, a YouTube channel called “<a href="https://youtu.be/8KR5i98aCy0?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blow Fan</a>” published a compilation of commentary from Blow on Braid, Anniversary Edition’s sales performance, made during a number of livestreams in the months since launch. While Blow fails to confirm a sales figure, the picture he paints here is clear: Braid, Anniversary Edition has flopped.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It has sold like dogs**t compared to what we need to make for the company to survive.</p></div><p>In one stream dated June 17, Blow said Braid, Anniversary Edition had sold “horribly.” “It has sold like dogs**t compared to what we need to make for the company to survive,” he continued. “So the future is uncertain, let’s put it that way.”</p><p>Then, on July 21, Blow was asked again about sales. “No, they’ve been terrible,” he replied. “Utterly terrible.”</p><p>In another stream dated July 22, said releasing Braid, Anniversary Edition on so many platforms “made a difference, but the problem is most of those platforms are f***ing dead now.”</p><p>“Steam is easily still our biggest platform,” he continued. “There would have been something to be said for just not porting to half those platforms.</p><p>“It's a really interesting thing that we did. We did commentary in a way that nobody’s ever done it, at a much more thorough level than anybody’s ever done it. And at some point, you just have to know that what you did was a good thing, even if the world doesn’t really acknowledge it. And this is one of those cases, I think.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/gettyimages-162261302-1722433679785.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Jonathan Blow. Photo credit: EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Then, in a stream on July 27, Blow once again addressed the Braid, Anniversary Edition sales, but this time cast doubt on his company’s ability to employ staff. Responding to a question on how many people at his company were working on the compiler for programming language Jai full-time, Blow said: “None, because we can't afford to pay anyone because the sales are bad."</p><p>“The whole game industry is having a hard time,” he said.</p><p>Blow’s comments have sparked something of an inquest online about why Braid, Anniversary Edition has struggled. In one stream, Blow discounted the impact that bringing the game to conventions and putting it in front of people might have had on the success of the game, saying cons don’t do much to help promote video games. He also said promoting the game on podcasts and YouTube interviews wouldn’t have helped, either. There are others who suggest there was little demand for a Braid remaster in the first place, with the original perfectly playable still all these years later.</p><p>Blow’s studio is Thekla, Inc., which also developed and published 2016 first-person puzzle game The Witness. It is said to be working on a number of unannounced projects, including a VR game.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p dir="ltr">A developer behind one of this year's biggest surprise hits is no fan of so-called forever games. In fact, Palworld community manager John "Bucky" Buckley thinks playing the same title over and over is "not healthy" for anyone.</p><p dir="ltr">Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/palworld-developer-says-playing-the-same-game-all-the-time-is-not-healthy-for-players-or-the-industry/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Bucky chatted with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO38QvKraTQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTuber Going Indie</a> about live-service titles and "dead" games. The developer at Pocketpair explained that there's nothing wrong with people moving on to new games. "I don't think you need to be kind of pushing yourself to play the same game all of the time," Bucky said. "It's not healthy for us. It's not healthy for developers. It's not healthy for gamers. It's not healthy for the gaming media."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO38QvKraTQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NO38QvKraTQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Bucky worries that large companies will continue to push "soulless" live-service games. In fact, one could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-live-service-game-bubble-looks-ready-to-burst/1100-6511171/" data-ref-id="1100-6511171">argue there has already been a live-service game bubble</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Bucky realizes there are games designed to be played for months on end, such as League of Legends, Dota 2, and the MMO genre overall. Thus, the problem is "a lot more people are trying to push gamers to play games that aren't really designed to be played for months on end," Buck explained.</p><p dir="ltr">A solution Bucky has for people is to just check out as many indie games as possible, regardless of how many others are playing it. This isn't a new sentiment for the community manager, either. Earlier this year, the Palworld developer spoke out about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-calls-out-lazy-discourse-around-hit-game-losing-concurrent-players/1100-6521110/" data-ref-id="1100-6521110">the "lazy" discourse about the "Pokemon with guns" game losing concurrent players</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Palworld has been a massive success, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-25-million-players-in-one-month/1100-6521294/" data-ref-id="1100-6521294">reaching 25 million players in its first month</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-it-hasnt-actually-faced-legal-action-from-the-pokemon-company/1100-6524483/" data-ref-id="1100-6524483">Pocketpair hasn't faced any legal action from The Pokemon Company</a>, even though lots of copying allegations were thrown at the game early on. Most recently, Pocketpair announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-and-sony-are-teaming-up/1100-6524828/" data-ref-id="1100-6524828">a partnership with Sony Music Entertainment for Palworld Entertainment Inc.</a></p>

                <p>Destiny developer Bungie has announced a significant round of layoffs, in what is just the latest example of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/#:~:text=In%20just%20the%20first%20two,a%20developer%20at%20Riot%20Games." data-ref-id="1100-6521799">major studio cutting hundreds of jobs</a>. The company also revealed a brand-new game, but it will no longer be developed internally and is shifting to an new internal studio at PlayStation. In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, Bungie executive Pete Parsons confirmed the company is cutting about 17% of its workforce, or around 220 people. Late last year, Bungie had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-touts-bigger-vision-for-destiny-2s-final-shape-but-doesnt-confirm-delay/1100-6518871/" data-ref-id="1100-6518871">round of layoffs</a> affecting more than 100 people.</p><p>"Due to rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions, it has become clear that we need to make substantial changes to our cost structure and focus development efforts entirely on Destiny and Marathon," Parsons said.</p><p>The executive said layoffs are happening at "every level" of Bungie, going on to note that "most" of Bungie's executive or senior leader positions are impacted.</p><p>Everyone affected by the cuts is getting a "generous" package that includes severance pay, a bonus, and health coverage for a period of time.</p><p>Parsons went on to say that, as part of this shift, Bungie is "deepening" its integration with its parent company, Sony Interactive Entertainment. Parsons said about 12% of Bungie's remaining workforce will shift to internal positions at SIE within the next few quarters.</p><p>Additionally, Parsons said Bungie is working with PlayStation to "spin out" of its "incubation projects" to form a new studio within PlayStation to continue work on this game. This is an action game set in a brand-new "science-fantasy" universe," Parsons said.</p><p>"This will be a time of tremendous change for our studio," Parsons said.</p><p>How did Bungie get into the positions to have to make these dramatic changes? Parsons said its original plan was to have several "incubation" projects going on at the same time, each of which had senior development leaders working on them. But this approach didn't work out.</p><p>"We eventually realized that this model stretched our talent too thin, too quickly. It also forced our studio support structures to scale to a larger level than we could realistically support, given our two primary products in development--Destiny and Marathon," Parsons aid.</p><p>Parsons also noted that Bungie's plan to do this ran "headlong" into what he described as a "broad economic slowdown," along with a "sharp downturn" in the video game industry overall, and Destiny 2: Lightfall failing to reach Bungie's quality standards.</p><p>"We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red," he said. "After this new trajectory became clear, we knew we had to change our course and speed, and we did everything we could to avoid today's outcome. Even with exhaustive efforts undertaken across our leadership and product teams to resolve our financial challenges, these steps were simply not enough."</p><p>Following the layoffs and internal shifts, Bungie will have more than 850 employees who are working on Destiny and Marathon, Parsons said.</p><p>This dramatic action comes just after Bungie released Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion, which was positively received by fans.</p>
