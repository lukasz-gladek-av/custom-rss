            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> Season 2 begins today, which means it’s time to jam another syringe into the scarred and bleeding flanks of the Great Marvelbeast and extract a fresh superhero. This season kicks off with Emma Frost, a Vanguard hero with very large hams and a couple of strings to her bow. By default, she fights as a midranged psychic, casting beams, damage-multiplying orbs and crystalline shields. Switch to her diamond form, however, and she becomes a tanky brawler with the ability to grab and slam people out of their ultimates or boot them into walls.</p><!--more-->

<p>That’s your first new Marvel Rivals character in Season 2, out now. The second will be Ultron, the bot with a god complex, who lands in a few weeks. He’s a nimble Strategist who does his dirty work using drones. More details to follow.</p>
<p>There’s also a new map, the Krakoa Hellfire Gala. It’s the kind of high society do where you’d expect to find Agent 47 pushing a mop, eyes peeled for weaponisable suitcases. Hmm, how would a Hitman party level work if all the guests were superheroes? I can’t really see Agent 47 dragging Ultron into a closet and stealing his trousers.</p>
<p>The new Marvel Rivals heroes and map accompany the usual live service avalanche of character skins and balancing or structural changes. There will now be weekly missions in addition to daily missions and challenges. Ranked mode is being given a rigorous rejig: the minimum level for competitive will now be 15, not 10, and players in Eternity and above will only be able to queue alone or in pairs to stop people forming big groups in advance. We can expect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-season-2-will-add-more-team-up-skills-plus-the-usual-new-heroes%E2%80%9D">new team-up skills</a> (and the loss of a couple of older ones). </p>
<p>Possibly most anticipated is the addition of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-performance-bottlenecks-are-a-very-big-problem-agree-netease-but-dont-worry-theyre-adding-a-box">a box that makes your computer go faster</a>. This being the new switch shader compilation mode, an experimental performance-boosting feature which is being added to the game’s launcher.</p>
<p>“Since our launch, we've heard your battle cries through the community and customer service channels,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2767030/view/541101973283275818?l=english">explains a blog post</a>. “Players on various PC configurations have encountered performance stutters and crashes, often due to high memory consumption during gameplay. PCs equipped with 16GB of RAM or less, when faced with excessive RAM usage can force the system to use swap memory, leading to unwanted slowdowns in the heat of battle.”</p>
<p>The switch shader compilation feature promises to “dramatically reduce” the game’s memory usage, “cutting down on severe FPS drops, frozen visuals, and crashes triggered by memory shortages.” The developers caution, however, that it might have a few teething troubles to begin with.</p>
<p>NetEase have elsewhere revealed that from Season 3 onwards, each Marvel Rivals update will only last two months instead of three, which means you’ll get a new hero every month. Which is a lot of heroes. I hope the developers aren’t crunching to meet the demand. NetEase <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">don’t have a spotless track record</a> for looking after their staff.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I’m of the opinion that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-train">Monster Train</a> is one of the best roguelike deckbuilders ever made. Frankly, I prefer it to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/04/slay-the-spire-review/">Slay the Spire</a>, and I think that mixing in tower defence elements was a stroke of genius that allowed the game to become more interesting overall. So, you can imagine that I was pretty excited about the idea of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-train-2">Monster Train 2</a>. You’ll be happy to hear that I adore what I’ve played of the second game so far, and I can’t wait for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/monster-train-2-pulls-in-for-release-in-may/">the full release in May</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Train 2 Release Date Trailer | Coming May 21" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryQ0iFNC5pY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Monster Train 2 takes place after the first game – shocking, I know – and has you teaming up with some former angels who were previously fighting against to try and take out the mighty Titans who’ve taken control of Heaven. It’s basically an excuse to go up to Heaven instead of down to the depths of Hell, but you’ve still got to protect your Pyre to succeed.</p>


<p>The core gameplay loop is very much the same at the outset. You choose two clans to begin with, and then set off on a journey where you place your units and cast spells to try and come out on top in various battles.</p>
<p>You can upgrade your units and spells as you go, and also grab special artifacts that’ll help you gain more universal buffs, or really niche but powerful ones. Where you place your units and the synergies you manage to pick up are essential to actually succeeding, and putting one unit on the wrong floor or wrong position can really mess things up. That’s all the stuff we had last time, so let’s chat about what’s new.</p>


<p>In terms of combat, you can now get room cards and equipment cards. Rooms give buffs on a specific floor, and equipment cards are a new way to give even more buffs to units, with some of the clans really wanting you to focus on them. You can also fuse different equipment cards together to make them even stronger, but while also combining their cost. It means you can make a single card that’ll take a weak unit into one that can solo and entire battle, which is fun.</p>
<p>You’ve then also got the ability to change your Pyre Heart, which allows it to have different stats and different abilities. My favourite lets you click it once per battle to gain three energy, but there are a bunch to unlock and play around with. Then there are random events that give out lroe, train customization, and more. It’s a lot, and it’s all really good.</p>

<p>While I’m going to wait to make my full verdict until I’ve played the final version of Monster Train 2, I’m also still going to be playing this version of it for as long as I can because it’s just so damn entertaining! It’s fluid, the new mechanics all make perfect sense, and there are plenty of interesting builds to mess around with and try and figure out. If you liked Monster Train, you’re going to love Monster Train 2.</p>

			<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will use the power of the PlayStation 5 Pro to offer an enhanced experience over the base hardware running at native 4K resolution.</p>
<p>In a new post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-april-17-with-ps5-pro-enhancements/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, it has been confirmed that the excellent game developed by MachineGames, launching on Sony's consoles next week on April 17th, will be a PlayStation 5 Pro Enhanced game. The optimized console performance on the system will offer higher and more consistent frame rates, native 4K resolution, and advanced ray tracing. Sadly, no other detail has been provided, but it's definitely impressive to learn that the power of the mid-generation refresh system allows for native 4K resolution gameplay in a demanding game such as this.</p>
<p>While Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will likely play best on PlayStation 5 Pro, the game will be perfectly enjoyable on base hardware as well. Besides featuring faster streaming and loading with frictionless loading and SSD optimization, the game will take advantage of the system CPU and GPU to achieve stable 60 FPS with high-quality resolution. Completely new to all versions of the game will be support for the DualSense controller features, such as haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and unique usage of the controller's lightbar, which will provide visual feedback about Indy's current status with different colors.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/minecraft-movies-success-continues-the-trend-of-film-tv-adaptations-bolstering-game-sales-and-engagement/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/">Minecraft movie</a> is the latest video game adaptation to find wild financial success that goes beyond any realistic expectations viewers and industry professionals might have had for it. So it's no surprise that the film has also continued the trend of an adaptation, leading to more game sales.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/what-does-the-minecraft-movie-and">The Game Business</a>, following the launch of the Minecraft movie, daily active users in Minecraft rose 9% week-on-week, according to Ampere Analysis data. Minecraft sales, particularly on Nintendo Switch, went up 25% per Nielsen/GfK data before the movie was released and another 8% after the movie launched.</p>
<p>The Game Business then goes on to show how the Minecraft film is participating in what's now become a trend with film and TV adaptations of video games. Regardless of whether the adaptation is good, engagement and game sales get a nice spike. Some are smaller than others, but the point is that the line goes up in every case.</p>
<p>Even without financial success, like in the case of the Borderlands movie. Critics have panned the Minecraft movie, but it's a major box office success, so game sales and engagement both getting a bump makes sense. Critics also panned the Borderlands film, and it was also a box office failure. It still led to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-movie-may-have-bombed-but-it-still-helped-sell-more-games/1100-6527626/">bump in sales</a> for the Borderlands series. However, as The Game Business does, it should be noted that a 90% discount on Borderlands 3 at the time also helped.</p>
<p>The Fallout TV show led to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-sales/">bump in sales for Fallout 4,</a> and HBO's The Last of Us led to a massive spike in sales for both The Last of Us games. The Super Mario Bros. movie increased the sales of Mario games and Nintendo merchandise. As The Game Business points out, the Gran Turismo movie, the Halo TV show, and the Five Nights at Freddy's film all boosted game sales and engagement for the games they were adapted from.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Minecraft movie is the latest to participate in this trend, and it is another sign that the video game industry is very interested in keeping these adaptations going, just as Hollywood is excited to have finally found a way to mine a new bevy of popular series that'll help fill seats in movie theatres.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-steam-release-date-set-for-the-end-of-april.1161897/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-steam-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infold Games has announced the&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Steam release date, with the cozy open-world adventure on its way to Valve's platform later this month.</p>

<p>Back in February, Infold revealed that&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-steam-confirmed" rel="nofollow">making its way to Steam</a>, and now, in a <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1910543603606446579" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, the studio has confirmed that the game's Steam release date is April 29th.</p>

<p>What's more,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has apparently surpassed 200,000 wishlists on Steam, and to celebrate, Infold is gifting players with 10 of the game's Resonite Crystal currency, which you can use as part of the gacha system. That's on top of the items that were already promised for the 100,000 wishlist goal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-release-date-rainbow.jpg?itok=9y_bMxWv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-steam-release-date-rainbow.jpg?itok=0WHVE9vP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is heading to Steam later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just the Resonite Crystals, either; you'll also be getting 3 Energy Crystals "and more as special gifts", and all you need to do to claim them is to play the game after its Steam launch on April 29th.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like you'll need to be playing&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>on Steam to reap the rewards, either; rather, it sounds as though all players will be getting these rewards, even if they're on console. Huzzah!</p>

<p>Given&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>'s popularity, it's not hard to see why Infold wants to bring it to Steam. The game managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m" rel="nofollow">hit 10 million downloads</a> within its first few days of release, and that number is only going to go up now it's coming to Valve's storefront.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is, it's a cutesy, cozy open-world adventure that emphasizes platforming and minigames over traditional combat (although it's got its own spin on that too).</p>




<p>Playing as Nikki and her companion Momo, you'll explore the world of Miraland, meet its inhabitants, and discover its mysteries. The game has a gacha system, too, through which you can obtain new outfits and clothing pieces for Nikki.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>&nbsp;right now, and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164330/Infinity_Nikki/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam version</a> is set to launch on April 29th.</p>

While the upgrade is free for Switch Online Expansion Pack subscribers, it’ll be $10 for everyone else, making <em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> a $70 game on Switch 2. </p><p>But Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently confirmed to<em> IGN</em></a></span> that that version still won’t include the game’s year-one DLC. The <em>Breath of the Wild</em> Expansion Pass, which contains a harder difficulty mode, more gear, additional side quests, new story missions, and an honest-to-god motorcycle, will still be locked behind an additional $20 upgrade. In other words, anyone coming to<em> Breath of the Wild</em> for the first time on Switch 2 will need to spend $90 for the full experience. The price of saving Hyrule has never been so high. </p><p>Contrast Nintendo’s approach to its eight-year old mega hit with CD Projekt Red’s to <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Both games have sold over 30 million copies. Both games are dense open-world adventures. Both are coming to Switch 2. Both will be $70 there. Except<em> Cyberpunk 2077 </em>will include its <em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion which came out less than two years ago as a “Complete Edition” pack-in at no extra charge. And that’s despite the fact CDPR has to pay a platform fee to Nintendo on every sale. </p><p>In isolation, selling<em> Breath of the Wild </em>DLC  separately on Switch 2 would warrant a “there goes Nintendo again” eye roll and nothing more, but it’s the latest in a series of headscratchers that keeps killing the pre-launch vibe. <em>Mario Kart World</em> and <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </em>are both $80, suggesting most upcoming top-tier first-party games will be as well. <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour </em>is a $10 download instead of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Reggie/status/1910052940242620563&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Reggie/status/1910052940242620563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wii Sports-like pack-in</a></span>.

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is set to release on PlayStation 5 (PS5) on April 17, and with it comes enhancements for the game on the PS5 Pro.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-april-17-with-ps5-pro-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Bethesda went into details on what players with the high-end console will get when they load up the game.</p>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will have native 4K resolution on the system along with advanced ray tracing features. The goal of the optimizations, per Bethesda, is to ensure players “achieve higher and more consistent frame rates”.</p>



<p>“Playing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at a native 4K resolution really is the best way to appreciate the level of detail the team at MachineGames has poured into every corner of the world,” production director John Jennings said via the post. “You could spend hours just walking around the different environments admiring every little thing, from each artifact in Marshall College’s impressive collection to the verdant beauty of Sukhothai’s jungles.”</p>



<h2 id="h-other-ps5-features-for-indiana-jones">Other PS5 Features For Indiana Jones</h2>



<p>Aside from the PS5 Pro enhancements, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5 will utilize the DualSense controller’s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. The controller’s light bar will also give players visual feedback into Indy’s current status.</p>



<p>“For example, when you enter combat, the LED light around the touchpad will turn yellow, or pulse yellow if the NPCs are searching for you,” Bethesda’s Anne Lewis writes. “If your health gets low, the light will pulse red until you heal up. Using a consumable to restore health like food or a bandage will turn the light green for a few seconds.”</p>



<p>Other features on the console include SSD optimization, 60 frames per second, 3D audio, HD rumble, and more.</p>

                <p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is whipping its way onto PS5 on April 17--or April 15 as an early access bonus for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-edition-preorders-are-live-including-a-collectors-edition/1100-6530384/">Premium and Collector's Edition preorders</a>--and several of the new features for the game on Sony's platform have been revealed. That includes the PS5 Pro features that will distinguish it from other console versions, including Xbox.</p><p>Starting in the controller department, the DualSense's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers have been tied to several parts of the game, including combat, exploration, and using Indy's tools. Bethesda added (via the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-april-17-with-ps5-pro-enhancements/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS Blog</a>) that the controller's lightbar is connected to game actions, with some examples being the LED light pulsing yellow if NPCs are searching for you or red if your health is low.</p><p>On the performance side, Bethesda explained that the game will benefit from numerous technical features, like frictionless loading, selective installation, and SSD optimization on PS5 and PS5 Pro. The game targets a stable 60fps on PS5 consoles, and if you find yourself stumped by any of the puzzles, you can consult the Community Game Help hub for tips on how to progress through certain

            <p>In just under a week, PlayStation users will be able to don the iconic fedora and whip of Indiana Jones, with the arrival of the Great Circle on PS5.</p>
<p>Ahead of this, the team has shared a few more details on what players can expect, both in terms of DualSense features and console performance.</p>

<p>On the DualSense side of things, players will notice their lightbar changes depending on what's going on in-game. When Indy enters combat, for example, the light around the touchpad will turn yellow. If NPCs are on the search for Indy, it will pulse yellow, and if his health gets low, it will pulse red.</p>
<p>Performance wise, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> "benefits from frictionless loading", Bethesda said, as well as "selective installation that prioritises your system language (other languages can be installed separately), and SSD optimisation, ensuring a seamless experience with faster streaming and loading".</p>
<p>The game will also come with a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> enhanced label on its release, which will give users higher and more consistent framerates when playing. This Pro also promises image clarity thanks to its native 4K resolution and advanced ray tracing.</p>
<p>"Playing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at a native 4K resolution really is the best way to appreciate the level of detail the team at MachineGames has poured into every corner of the world," production director John Jennings says. "You could spend hours just walking around the different environments admiring every little thing, from each artifact in Marshall College's impressive collection to the verdant beauty of Sukhothai's jungles."</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date-confirmed">make its PS5 debut on 17th April</a>. You can check out <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-april-17-with-ps5-pro-enhancements/">full details on the PlayStation blog</a>.</p>

<p>We awarded Indiana Jones and the Great Circle five stars on its release. "Indiana Jones really feels like he comes full circle (sorry) in this latest adventure. At long last, there's an Indy game that nails both the puzzles and the kind of action we know so well from the films, and it does so with wit, charm and a real eye for spectacle," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/edifier-qd35-rgb-speaker-review.1161861/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/11/edifier-qd35-rgb-speaker-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>While gaming headsets are the number one way for gamers to experience audio, sometimes you want to share it with others. Sometimes you want enough volume to annoy the neighbours, and sometimes you want enough lights to annoy everyone in sight. It’s fair to say that Edifier have achieved both those things with the QD35 Hi-Res Speaker, a Bluetooth and USB-equipped speaker that can serve as a centre point for both your gaming and musical audio.</p>
<p>The Edifier QD35 is monolithic. It’s a chunky black plastic box, with a visible central speaker and tweeter housed in clear plastic so you can see some of its innards. It’s imposing, and, compared to other similarly powered speakers like an Amazon Alexa Studio, or Apple HomePod, thoroughly overpowering.</p>



<p>While it has all of the subtlety of a brick, the QD35 begs for you to look at it. Some of that is due to its industrial styling, and huge Edifier logo on top in bold white font, but really it’s because of the vibrant and customisable RGB lighting. The majority of the front panel can play out a cascade of different colours, in a variety of patterns or styles. It’s very attractive, if you like bright neon lights while you’re gaming, or partying. What am I saying – they’re both the perfect times for bright neon lights.</p>
<p>There’s a single button and two clickable control dials on the right-hand side of the QD35 which control power, inputs, volume, and changing the lighting. Besides those controls, there’s also a 35 Watt GaN charger built in, able to deliver power through USB-A and USB-C ports, and, somewhat oddly, a digital clock.</p>

<p>While that might give it a bit of an old-school vibe – I greatly annoyed my wife by suggesting the QD35 was my new alarm clock – it is actually a handy little readout to have on your desk.</p>
<p>The QD35 can accept a trio of inputs, with Hi-Res Bluetooth available via the LDAC codec, if your device is capable of using that signal. You can also hook it up by USB, taking a direct feed from your computer or similar, or there’s a classic 3.5mm aux input. Whichever you use, they’re all capable of handling high-resolution sound, and they definitely do that with some style.</p>

<p>The output from the QD35 is powerful, clear and has a good level of depth, making the most of its dual driver system. The blurb is clear to point out that the speaker setup is able to handle the mid and treble ranges, with no mention of bass, but despite that, music and audio sound full and pleasingly weighty. That will be because there are bass ports in the rear of the unit.</p>
<p>What it doesn’t tell you is that you need the QD35 to be backed up against a wall to get the best tonal response. If your desk is free-standing, and there’s nothing for the bass ports to fire against, you lose some of that frequency.</p>
<p>I used Apple Music’s lossless downloads for all of my testing, and that meant I could experience the same tracks via all three inputs. The opening piano of Linkin Park’s ‘Up From The Bottom’ rang out with perfect clarity, before the vocals and guitar swept them away with plenty of aggression and bass. You can hear every rasp of Emily’s punchy voice, and you can almost feel Linkin Park’s signature guitar tone. There’s loads of detail, and decent separation between the instrumentation, but I did find I had to tweak the EQ to bring all of the different elements out.</p>

<p>Turning to gaming, and I’ve been playing a lot of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/04/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review/">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, as well as my regular hops into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, and the QD35 did a decent job of firing game audio at me from my desk. The downside when compared to my regular setup is that it’s a single unit, rather than a stereo pair, and I definitely missed that width while playing, especially in Overwatch where directional audio is nigh-on essential. I probably enjoyed the light shows and the clock more than using it for gaming, but the option is there, and it was handy to have the wired connection to my PC, with the availability of Bluetooth for my phone as well.</p>
<p>Discovering that the three inputs are fundamentally all very similar was something of a surprise, as I’d expected the wired options to be clearly superior to Bluetooth. Whether that shows that the LDAC codec is doing an exceptional job, or the wired connection is losing something it’s hard to say, but if you’re looking for a speaker that gives you plenty of detail, the QD35 is a good pick.</p>
<p>Edifier’s Connect app is a great addition for interacting with the QD35, and it does a fantastic job of letting you tune and change different elements of the speaker setup, particularly the lighting. There are also different EQ settings, and you can create your own custom one as well. Beyond that, you can control the speaker from here, turning it off, changing the input, and that’s about it. There is a bank of ‘soothing sounds’ in the app, but these are so short as to be utterly meaningless, and sound incredibly artificial.</p>

<p>The QD35 has got a lot of competition, and depending on your setup you might find them a better fit. For gaming, I’ve always loved Creative’s Pebble Speakers, particularly with the addition of the 2.1 bass unit, and they’re cheap and cheerful, albeit with none of the Hi-Res certification or Bluetooth connections.</p>
<p>If you’re after a pure Bluetooth speaker, there’s a cavalcade of options, from something like the Audio Pro C10 MkII, albeit without RGB, or smart speaker options like Apple’s HomePod 2, if you’re in Apple’s ecosystem. I’m sure there are plenty of houses where the QD35 will be the perfect fit, but personally, I’ll stick with the Pebble and a HomePod. I can’t believe I’m actually saying this, but I might already have too much RGB on my computer.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-sales-4m-update-6</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/enshrouded-sales-hit-4m-as-sixth-major-update-revealed.1161858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-sales-4m-update-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Keen Games has announced a major new sales milestone for open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, and new details about the game's sixth major update have also been revealed.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>has now crossed the four million sales mark. As a reminder, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-sales-3-million" rel="nofollow">passed the three million milestone</a> back in August, which means it's sold another million copies in the intervening eight months.</p>

<p>As for the sixth update, it's called Thralls of Twilight, and it'll bring "new enemies that creep, crawl, and stalk you further", so you'll have to keep your wits about you if you want to survive its trials and tribulations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enshrouded-sales-4m-update-6-enemy.jpg?itok=NUgp6r_1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enshrouded-sales-4m-update-6-enemy.jpg?itok=GPt_Il0m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Enshrouded</em>'s sixth major update is coming in May.</figcaption></figure><p>Due in May, Thralls of Twilight follows on from previous&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>updates like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-pact-of-flame-update-1-0-launch-2026" rel="nofollow">Pact of the Flame</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-souls-of-frozen-frontier-update" rel="nofollow">Souls of the Frozen Frontier</a>, and like those updates, you won't have to pay a penny for it.</p>

<p>Keen Games is promising "more reasons than ever to enter the Shroud"; it'll be "more dangerous than ever before", but venturing into the fog will grant you new resources, so it'll be worth your while.</p>

<p>The update will also bring a brand new weapon customization mechanic, as well as "enhancements to the nighttime cycle" that will include more enemies roaming the world and new nighttime-specific rewards.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait until May for more information, but suffice it to say that Thralls of Twilight is shaping up to be just as significant as previous&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>updates, so if you like the game, you should be excited for this one.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game in which you (and, optionally, other players) must descend into the semi-eponymous Shroud in order to find resources, battle enemies, and uncover its mysteries.</p>

<p>The game is available right now for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Early Access</a>. The 1.0 release is scheduled for sometime in 2026, which is also when you can expect the game to hit consoles.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> will release on August 8th, but shut your yap and don't tell anyone, because developers Hangar 13 and publishers 2K Games appear to have revealed this early by accident. You didn't hear any of this from me. I ain't a rat. I'm not interested in things that don't concern me.</p>
<p>I'll tell you who is a rat - those dirty snitches over at <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/mafia-the-old-countrys-release-date-has-appeared-online/">Very Gorgonzola Computing</a>. They claim somebody put up a Steam blog post that gave the big date away, in advance of a probable reveal at PAX East. The post has now been edited. Find a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lmimffmqt32l">copy of the original on Bluesky</a>.</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country takes the crime-does-pay series back to Sicily in the 1900s. It's going for comparison with the Robert de Niro segments of Godfather: Part 2, in other words. The story follows Enzo Favara, and takes you from a childhood of servitude in Sicily's sulfur mines to a promising career with the Torrisi crime family. It's said to be more action-adventure, less <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> than the previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a>. I don't have any particular thoughts on the new direction beyond that I am unreasonably attracted to the key artwork of the handsome shotgun lying in a crate of absolutely radiant lemons.</p>
<p>The new Mafia is also of interest because it's from the same publisher as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>, which is slated  to launch on consoles this year (GTA 6 PC release date any time, Rockstar). Take-Two will definitely not be publishing them in close proximity. As when deducing the presence of black holes by monitoring the distorted light from nearby stars, it's possible we can whittle down GTA 6's release date by extrapolation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Over 2 million citizens have explored Atomfall’s dangerous biomes, foraging for meat, drinking beer, and bonking druids on the head with cricket bats. The RPG is shaping up to be one of Rebellion’s greatest achievements—if not the greatest—and the developer has a ton of fun facts about the two million Atomfall players who’ve played the game.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-rebellion-most-successful-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall is Rebellion’s most successful launch ever</a>. This is a remarkable stat when you consider the company is probably best known for Sniper Elite. Nevertheless, the attempt to make a British-based RPG set around a nuclear disaster has paid dividends. </p>



<p>Players have spent the first few weeks exploring the land and raising hell. Once you’ve raised enough hell, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-skethermoor-radio-tower-in-atomfall-keycard-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlocked Radio Towers</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-upgrade-weapons-in-atomfall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgraded enough weapons</a>, you need to kick back with a pasty and some tea.</p>

<p>The Citizens of Wyndham (that tannoy announcement lives rent-free in my head) have been having their fill. According to an <a href="https://x.com/AtomfallGame/status/1910679392696611192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">April 11 Rebellion post</a>, over <strong>2 million players have set foot in alternate-history Cumbria</strong>.</p>



<p>During their time, they’ve found nearly <strong>13 million Caches</strong> using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-metal-detector-in-atomfall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Detector</a>, <strong>killed six million enemies with classic Cricket Bat</strong>, ordered over a <strong>quarter of a million pints of beer</strong>, and scoffed <strong>14 million tins of meat</strong>—and counting.</p>

<p>With Atomfall being free on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-atomfall-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a>, these player numbers seem certain to rise. We gave the RPG a glowing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-review-rebellion-curveball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming review</a>, and I honestly hope Rebellion decides to venture down a future path not necessarily filled with Sniper Rifle glare and Nazis.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-editorial-values-policies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hi, <a href="https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it's still Inside Baseball Week here at Aftermath</a>, and because there is nothing more inside baseball than a website posting about its own editorial values in a standalone blog, we're going to do just that.</p><p>You might be reading this wondering what the fuck "editorial values" even are. Allow me to explain! Many websites will find a small, forgotten space on their page (or, more often, buried deep inside their menus) and dedicate it to publicly listing a set of values and rules they think are important and which guide their work.</p><p>It's not a niche pursuit--you can read IGN's<a href="https://corp.ign.com/standards-and-practices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> here</a>, and Eurogamer's<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/editorial-policy#:~:text=The%20content%20that%20appears%20on,in%20our%20dealings%20with%20advertisers." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> here</a>, for example--but we never felt we needed one <em>here </em>because we thought our stances on everything from <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-voice-actor-strike-genshin-impact-destiny-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workers</a> to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI</a> were made clear through our work itself. Turns out that was presumptive of us; not only have we had people asking us from time to time where they can find our values, just so they can check them out (true inside baseball sickos, we salute you!) but it was also a case of us forgetting that while our core audience know who we are, there are plenty of people who only learn about Aftermath through a Google search or from being sent a link to a story, and so might have no idea what we stand for.</p><p>In which case, here are our official Editorial Values:</p><blockquote><p>Aftermath rejects balance and performative impartiality as journalistic virtues. We strive to recognize the full humanity of those we cover, and strive for all reasonable fairness in our coverage. Honest reporting can be painful to subjects, and we recognize the effects such reporting may have on them. We take seriously our responsibility as journalists and strive to mitigate all unnecessary harm our reporting may cause.</p><p>Aftermath rejects the “view from nowhere” in favor of honest, individualized editorial voices. We employ any and all rhetorical devices in our writing, including opinion, humor, and sarcasm. At the same time, we recognize that our words and tone have consequences, whether or not we intend them to. We strive at all times to be humane, whatever form our editorial content takes.</p><p>Aftermath is an independent media organization, beholden only to our readers and ourselves. We do not let PR, advertisers, or companies dictate or influence our coverage. We take good faith reader feedback seriously and strive to incorporate it whenever feasible.</p><p>Aftermath values diversity in editorial content and personnel. We strive to uplift under-served individuals and voices in our editorial content. We strive to use anti-oppressive language and promptly correct such instances where we might fall short.</p><p>Aftermath values human-created journalism.

			<p>Across all 14 chapters of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a>, there are 103 notes you can find and read that add more context to the story and the individual events each chapter focuses on.</p>
<p>South of Midnight's story is where the game shines brightest, so it's worth your time to go out and look for all of them in each chapter.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 4</h2>
<p>Chapter 4 is a lot simpler than some of the other chapters, since there's only three notes to find here.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Grocery List</strong> - After clearing the first combat encounter of the level, you'll hit a lamppost on the path, as you hear Hazel talk about getting closer to the church. Go left at the lamppost, Strand Push the branches in your path and then go left again when you see the small house. Use your newly acquired grapple to hook around the back of the house you just saw, where a Floof knot and a note on top of a barrel await you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lay Off Buddy</strong> - Once you've grabbed the previous note, before leaving this area entirely, head inside the house you veered left at, and you'll find another Floof knot, with this note on the bed.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Lord's Day</strong> - Once you've made it to where the church sits, before heading up to it, cut straight across the cemetery in front of you, and jump over the wooden fences. Look to the back right corner of the cemetery where you'll find a hollowed tree, and this note inside.</p>
<p>That's all the notes in Chapter 4. If you've been following along with these guides, you'll have found 17 out of 103 by now. Only 86 more to go.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps-plus-prices-rising-some-regions/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps-plus-prices-are-rising-in-some-regions.1161816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ps-plus-prices-rising-some-regions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The price of PlayStation Plus will increase in dozens of countries. As of the writing of this text, the increase in subscription value will be applied in South American countries, such as Brazil, as well as in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/ps-plus-price-hikes-strike-even-more-countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Oceania</a> and certain Asian countries, including Malaysia, China, Singapore, and Thailand.</p>



<p>In South America, this increase has generated outrage on social media. It marks the second increase in subscription value in less than two years. PlayStation issued a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/20250410-psplus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">vague justification</a>, claiming that all PS Plus tiers have become more expensive due to “global market conditions.”</p>



<p>Analyzing the new prices, it seems that PlayStation’s goal is to align subscription prices with those in the United States. The 12-month PlayStation Plus Extra, for example, is sold for $99.99.</p>



<p>Existing users in <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/br/aumento-preco-ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brazil</a></strong> will now pay R$546.90 (a 12% increase), which is equivalent to $92.67. This price globalization movement disregards macroeconomic factors such as disparities in purchasing power and the differing levels of inflation in various countries.</p>



<p>Overall, the increases ranged from 8% to 21% among the different subscription tiers. It’s worth mentioning that the quality of the games added to the catalog has indeed improved in recent months. Notable inclusions include High On Life, Robocop: Rogue City, and the announcement of <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-playstation-plus-game-catalog-games-announced-for-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hogwarts Legacy</a></strong> yesterday. Additionally, two games were released Day One on the service: Blue Prince, the indie hit of the moment, and Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage.</p>



<p>Currently, no information has been released about a possible PS Plus price increase in North America.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">It was late 2020 when Universal Studios Japan first let guests inside its Super Mario World area of the park, with rides and a slew of minigames based on the Super Mario franchise. Unlike most theme-park experiences, this one was about collecting coins and stamps, competing against fellow visitors, and aiming to top the leaderboard. A pared-down version opened at Universal Studios Hollywood in 2023, cementing the idea that Universal was continuing forward with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/theme-parks-are-turning-into-real-life-video-games-and-minions-land-at-universal-studios-is-the-next-step/1100-6517195/">gamification of its theme parks</a>. In May, the company's newest theme park, Universal Epic Universe, will unveil its own Super Nintendo World--complete with a Donkey Kong Country section.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot was recently given the chance to tour Epic's new Super Nintendo World and, of course, to play in it. While those who have visited Hollywood's Super Nintendo World will find parts of this new Florida location familiar, the land has been completely redesigned and is much larger. Not only does the latest iteration bring in the Donkey Kong Country ride and mini-land that opened in Japan last December, but it also brings the beloved Yoshi's Adventure dark ride. More importantly, though, it brings new challenges and ways to play in the land--and more coins to earn.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The rides</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">The standout of the new land is the Donkey Kong Country rollercoaster, Minecart-Madness. Imagine blazing through one of the minecart levels from the video game franchise. That's what you're getting with Minecart-Madness, which is not a traditional rollercoaster. Instead, it's made to simulate the feeling of being in a minecart that jumps from track to track as it avoids peril at all costs.</p><p dir="ltr">If you were lucky enough to visit Universal Studios Japan since the ride's opening, you know it's a unique experience. In fact, the creatives at Universal Studios essentially had to invent a new type of ride to properly simulate the feeling of being in a minecart. That said, it adds an excellent thrill to Super Nintendo World, which was, thus far, all dark-ride attractions (style of theme park ride that sends riders through a series of animated sets aboard different types of ride vehicles).</p><p dir="ltr">If you're not a fan of rollercoasters, though, there's plenty for you to ride. Like every version of the land, Orlando features the Super Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge ride, which is meant to simulate the world of Mario Kart. You walk through Bowser's castle, see how he created his various minions and monsters, and then strap in for a race against some of the best drivers in the Mushroom Kingdom via the use of augmented-reality goggles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474774-img_4211.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474774" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474774-img_4211.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474774"></a><figcaption>Pikmin spotted on the Minecart-Madness roller coaster.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474774-img_4211.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The other ride in the land, which is not in the Hollywood version, is the aforementioned Yoshi's Adventure ride, which is aimed at a much younger audience. On it, you basically ride on Yoshi's back through a series of themed settings. There's not much to it, other than it's a very pleasant and relaxing ride.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The games</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">The games are where Super Nintendo World shines, though. If you read our coverage of<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8-things-to-know-about-super-nintendo-world-before-you-go-to-universal-studios/1100-6511778/"> Super Nintendo World</a> back when it opened at Universal Studios Hollywood, you know about collecting coins and stamps to ultimately access a boss fight against Bowser Jr. However, that's not overtly explained within the land, so it's up to the guests to explore and find ways to earn coins using the Power Up Bands. Given they cost over $40, it's a good thing Universal continues adding stuff to do with them.</p><p dir="ltr">With the addition of Yoshi's Adventure and Minecart-Madness, there's plenty more to do with them. For instance, there are several Yoshi eggs hidden in the Yoshi's Adventure ride. To obtain the golden-egg stamp, you'll have to find them all and push the appropriate button on your ride vehicle to have it tallied to your overall Super Nintendo World score.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474775-img_4204.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474775" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474775-img_4204.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474775"></a><figcaption>A large G found in Donkey Kong Country.

The best minigame in this section requires you to find the giant letters that spell out Kong littered throughout the land. In the games, the Kong letters have given extra lives, unlocked special levels, or even been used as save points. In the Donkey Kong Country land, they earn a stamp and coins to help propel you to the top of the leaderboards. Additionally, there is a banana slot machine located in the area that simply takes a swipe of your Power Up Band to activate. You could earn anything from stacks of bananas to extra life balloons. What you collect determines how many coins get added to your overall score.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also hidden puzzle pieces to find, several boxes with hidden Donkey Kong logos on them to scan, a golden banana at the climax of Minecart-Madness, and a game based on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-jungle-beat-was-much-more-than-a-platformer/1100-6530130/">Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat</a>. Yes, they turned the 2005 GameCube game, which came with a bongo drum peripheral, into a theme-park experience--complete with massive drums to drum along with and collect coins. Honestly, this might be the coolest game Super Nintendo World has to offer, as who actually expected a tribute to a GameCube title?</p><p dir="ltr">As you might expect, you can also earn extra coins from repeat rides of any of the attractions. If you're looking to top the leaderboard, though, keep line times in mind.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The theming</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">This is, arguably, the most important thing at play here, especially in the Donkey Kong Country section. After all, Yoshi's Adventure easily fits into the Super Mario Land section of the park. Walking into Donkey Kong Country, as someone who first played this franchise back on the Super Nintendo, was as incredible as the first time I wandered into Super Mario Land.</p><p dir="ltr">The area is built to look like you are entering a Donkey Kong Country game, from the music and the design right down to the banana-flavored treats and the Donkey Kong meet and greet. It's hard to properly explain the feeling of being inside of a video game you grew up playing, but it's like no other.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474777-img_4207.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474777" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474777-img_4207.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474777"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong's home in Donkey Kong Country, as well as where you can meet him.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474777-img_4207.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That, of course, can also be viewed as a downside. After traversing all Donkey Kong Country had to offer, I wanted more. Isle of Berk, the How to Train Your Dragon section of Epic Universe, is so massive--it's the largest land in the park--and that's what I wanted for Super Nintendo World, if only to make way for even more Donkey Kong. The Mario section of the land has plenty of room and stretches out in every direction when you walk in. I want that feeling for Donkey Kong Country, which is a fraction of the size of the expansive Mario section. After all, the franchise is alive and well with a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> title, Donkey Kong Bananza, on the way. Maybe they could eventually expand to include more character meet-and-greets or even another ride. Where can I meet Cranky Kong?</p><p dir="ltr">Then again, maybe they could also extend into a new franchise under the Nintendo umbrella. Where is our Legend of Zelda land and ride?</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless, Donkey Kong Country meets the hype and, in most cases, exceeds it. It establishes Epic Universe as the home of North America's definitive Super Nintendo World (sorry, Hollywood) and creates even more ways to play and win. Plus, the banana-flavored DK Crush Sunday, served in a giant waffle cone inside of a collectible DK barrel mug--if you pay for the upcharge--is pretty delicious.</p><p dir="ltr">Orlando's Super Nintendo World, and Epic Universe as a whole, opens to the public on May 22. In addition to Super Nintendo World and Isle of Berk, the park boasts original lands and rides based on the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and the Dark Universe of Universal Monsters.</p>
