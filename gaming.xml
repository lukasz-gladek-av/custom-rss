		<p>Square Enix has confirmed that Visions of Mana will be released on August 29th, and pre-orders are now live across PC and consoles. Visions of Mana was announced in December, making it the first mainline Mana entry in 15 years, and today Square Enix has released more details alongside the game’s release date.</p>
<p><iframe title="Visions of Mana | Launch Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Io4_CfCLlW4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>When it comes to the Vision of Mana characters we already know of Val and Hinna. Val is Hinna’s lifelong friend and soul guard, accompanying her on the journey to the Tree of Mana.&nbsp; Additional characters include Careena and her sacred beast companion Ramcoh, Morley of Etaern, the Moonlit Parish, Palamena who is the young Queen of Illystana, Capital of the Deep, and carer of her brother Iain, and Julien who is the custodian of Verdeus Borough. All of these characters, bar Hinna, are playable in the game.</p>
<p>Previously, we were introduced to Pikuls, giant wolf like steeds you can ride to traverse the land at speed. Pikuls are not the only creatures capable of carrying the party though. Vuscavs are turtle like creatures that allow the party to cross the seas, and the legendary Flammie can take to the skies and soar through the air. All three creatures will help you explore and find the secrets of the open world, which is also fraught with dangers.</p>
<p>Combat is a key aspect of Visions of Mana, and it is real time combat. The Ring Menu makes its return to the series, with moves equipped in this menu the only ones that can be used in combat. That will mean switching out moves for others to get the best advantage against the various foes that pose a danger to Hinna, Val, and the rest of the group. Battle parties will consist of three characters, each one with their own skills and abilities that can provide different supports. Characters are not limited and their class can be changed through the use of Elemental Vessels. These vessels can be used for combat and exploration, with the power bestowed by them unlocking new areas in the world. Each class has its own special, elemental attacks, weapons, and moves. You can equip any character with any vessel, allowing for experimentation in combat.</p>

That means you’ll continue to see your dynamic or regular background when you’re not scrolling through different games.</p><p>Previously, Microsoft only let you view game art with the default Xbox Home background. Now, you can keep your background <em>and</em> view game art without having to decide between the two. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146171/the-xbox-ui-is-getting-better">Microsoft first started testing</a> this feature in April, and you can see how it looks in this embedded post from my colleague Tom Warren.</p><p>To enable this option, head to your Xbox’s Settings menu, and then select <strong>General &gt; Personalization &gt; My Background</strong>. From there, choose <strong>Show selected game art</strong>. You can also now update your dynamic background color without changing the color of your profile.</p><p>Microsoft is rolling out a few other updates, too, including the ability for your Xbox to remember up to 10 Wi-Fi networks, saving you from having to set up the network information and passwords all over again each time you move your console from one place to another. </p><p>It’s also rolling out a controller update that allows the Xbox Adaptive Controller to have “expanded support for more connected USB accessories,” with each port now supporting up to 12 buttons, a second stick, and a hat switch, plus more stable audio connections for headsets plugged in to an Elite Wireless 2 gamepad. </p><p>Additionally, Microsoft is making <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/26/24112659/xbox-cloud-gaming-mouse-and-keyboard-support-preview">mouse and keyboard support</a> in Xbox Cloud Gaming available to everyone and will now allow players to self-manage game data and cloud saves for titles played on their browser, Xbox’s website, or the Xbox app on Samsung TVs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> is out in under 10 days, but some players must be in for a surprise if they expect to be able to jump in straight away. As it turns out, most players on Steam haven’t even progressed far enough in the original game to access the DLC - something publishers Bandai Namco have now issued a friendly FYI about.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with developers FromSoftware’s other Soulsborne games, you probably weren’t expecting a straightforward “pick the DLC from the menu” kind of approach to booting up Shadow of the Erdtree. (<em>Laughs in Artorias of the Abyss</em>.) And rightly so: the upcoming expansion is hidden away behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/to-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-you-must-defeat-some-of-elden-rings-toughest-bosses">two of the game’s harder bosses</a>, including one right at the end of one of its more easily missable areas.</p>
<p>Those bosses are Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood. The former is fairly easy to find - if less easy to beat - as he’s the main threat in the vast region of Caelid and one of the five shardbearers you can choose to take down to advance in the main story. (You’ll have to kill at least two, but can fight as many as you like.)</p>
<p>Mohg, meanwhile, is less obvious. Spoilers abound ahead! He’s found in the <span tabindex="0">Mohgwyn Palace</span>, which can only be reached by <span tabindex="0">using a teleporter in the secret Consecrated Snowfield region</span> - accessible by <span tabindex="0">collecting two halves of a secret medallion spread around the rest of the Lands Between</span> and using it to <span tabindex="0">travel on a mysterious lift to the frosty realm</span>. From there, you’ll need to <span tabindex="0">defeat a nearby NPC invader</span> to <span tabindex="0">activate the teleporter</span>. That’s just to get to <span tabindex="0">Mohgwyn Palace</span>, mind - then it’s a case of actually fighting your way through the fairly lengthy level and <span tabindex="0">defeating Mohg himself</span>. Phew! (Luckily, the nearby area is a great place to level up - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/psa-please-leave-my-horrible-silver-frog-sons-alone-as-you-grind-for-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">unless you're a frog fan</a>.)</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Given all that, it’s perhaps not all that surprising that almost two-thirds of Elden Ring players on Steam haven’t defeated Mohg, going by Steam achievement stats as spotted by Twitch streamer <a href="https://x.com/CohhCarnage/status/1800313422535364790">Cohh Carnage</a>. Around 38% of players have the achievement for besting the boss, while over 62% don’t have it. Bandai Namco shared the post as a “friendly PSA”, emphasising the need to have bested Mohg in time for the DLC.</p>
<p>As we already know, the entrance to Shadow of the Erdtree’s new area will be the <span tabindex="0">withered arm hanging from the cocoon behind the arena where you fight Mohg</span> - the <span tabindex="0">physical body of DLC-centric character Miquella, brother of Malenia</span>, who appeared in the original teaser for the expansion.</p>
<p>In other words, if you’re hoping to play Shadow of the Erdtree when it releases on June 21st, but are one of that 62%, you’ll need to get a wriggle on and take down Mohg asap. We do know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-more-elden-ring-dlc-after-shadow-of-the-erdtree-says-souls-boss-miyazaki">there won't be another Elden Ring DLC</a>, at least, so you've got all the time in the world to get through it. Good luck!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177048/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-set-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="a3JiZZ">Ravensburger’s successful trading card game, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-lorcana"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>, is getting its fif﻿th set — <em>Shimmering Skies</em> — and it includes lots of top-tier characters you’ll want to collect. The set includes two starter decks with characters like Wreck-it Ralph, Elsa, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24175403/new-donald-duck-movie-short-diy-duck">Donald Duck</a>, to name a few. There’s also The Great Illuminary, a new location card set in a “radiant ballroom.”</p>
<p id="aDn5AD"><em>Shimmering Skies</em>, announced Wednesday in a livestream, includes gameplay mechanics that’ll be further explained closer to the release date: Aug. 9 for local game stores and Disney properties, and Aug. 23 for mass market retailers. For now, enjoy these peeks at the new cards.</p>
<p id="mmjt9n"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/14/18095040/ralph-breaks-the-internet-review-wreck-it-ralph-disney"><em>Wreck-it Ralph</em></a> makes its <em>Lorcana</em> debut with several character cards including two Vanellope von Schweetz cards and Ralph himself. The Vanellope von Schweetz, Random Roster Racer card is especially exciting, granting players the ability to rush, aka challenge a turn. There’s also a Donald Duck card, an Elsa rush card, and (most exciting to me) a Kronk card that slates him as head of security. </p>

<p id="E1JNim">As for non-character cards, players will have two new locations and a new action, You’re Welcome, which lets you shuffle the chosen card into your deck and draw two. Locations include the ballroom, mentioned earlier, and Bad-Anon, Villian Support Center where villain characters can work on improving themselves.</p>
<p id="sliWX6">Check out the rest of the new cards below, or browse the previous set, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24141466/disney-lorcana-ursulas-return-madrigal-family-encanto-cards"><em>Ursula’s Return</em></a>, to hold you over while you await the new decks.</p>

The three-part series launched back in 2020 for $19.99, and while the first part of the trilogy has been free since 2021, Dontnod has made the adventure available in its entirety for free during June in honor of Pride Month for the past couple of years.</p>

<p id="NJB2xc">Focusing largely on how your decisions impact the unfolding narrative, <em>Tell Me Why</em> tells an engaging story while staying light on mechanics. Fans of Telltale’s adventure titles, or Dontnod’s seminal adventure, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/29/7945795/life-is-strange-review-xbox-one-ps4-360-ps3-PC-episode-one"><em>Life is Strange</em></a>, will feel right at home. </p>
<p id="llzrJx">As with previous entries in the Dontnod catalog, the dialogue is occasionally cringe-y and can be a bit heavy-handed in its delivery, but the game still displays a <a href="https://www.tellmewhygame.com/resources/">surprising amount of literacy</a> surrounding the lived experiences of trans people. </p>
<p id="3zJW7p">If you’re a fan of some of Dontnod’s other adventure titles, or you’re just looking for a thoughtful and emotional game to play during Pride Month (or any month, really), you should take a minute to add <em>Tell Me Why</em> to your backlog. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177061/twilight-of-the-gods-zack-snyder-netflix-animated-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9R2Gwg">Zack Snyder’s long-in-development Viking series, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22527795/zack-snyder-twilight-of-the-gods-cast-netflix-anime"><em>Twilight of the Gods</em></a>, finally has a trailer and a release date. The first look at the series is full of Viking violence, and plenty of blood, and the show is set to hit Netflix on Sept. 19. </p>
<p id="hEDvSD"><em>Twilight of the Gods</em> follows Leif, who is saved from a battlefield death by Sigrid, a warrior who he later marries. However, on their wedding night, the pair are attacked by Thor, setting them on a journey through hell and across the many treacherous lands of Norse mythology. </p>
<p id="OOegQG">The trailer is a little lighter on those plot details, but it does have some pretty impressive action. The series is animated by French studio Xilam Animation (<em>Chip ‘n’ Dale: Park Life</em>), and looks reminiscent of shows like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23435354/dragon-prince-mystery-aaravos-season-4-review-netflix"><em>The Dragon Prince</em></a>, with brief flashes of action from series like <em>Samurai Jack</em>. The characters look slick and unique, while the action itself looks beautiful, well-choreographed, and plenty bloody.</p>
<p id="0F1CAp">The series is co-created by Zack Snyder, Jay Oliva (<em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em>), and Eric Carrasco (<em>Foundation</em>). Snyder directs the first and last episode, while Oliva, Andrew Tamandl (<em>Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous</em>), Tim Divar (<em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em>), and Dave Hartman (<em>Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire</em>) direct the rest. </p>

This new DLC has its own leveling feature by way of Scadutree Fragments, which can be combined at a Site of Grace to increase the damage you do and reduce the damage you take.</p><p>These can be found throughout the Land of Shadow and will be a vital part of reducing the difficulty level of your expedition through this dangerous realm.

Here, you’ll see a ton of Albinaurics you can take out. Most of these little guys are passive until you attack them, meaning you have plenty of options for taking them out as you see fit.</p><p>Your best course of action is to use an AOE spell to destroy them all very quickly, then rush back to the Site of Grace to rest and repeat the process. This will net you thousands upon thousands of runes per run, making this one of the very best rune farming spots in the entire game.</p><figure id="" data-id="618018dde72c05e2ab6714bd8e0d8895" data-recommend-id="image://618018dde72c05e2ab6714bd8e0d8895" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A shrouded Elden Ring protagonist stands in a grassy, rocky environment with several Albinaurics behind them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A shrouded Elden Ring protagonist stands in a grassy, rocky environment with several Albinaurics behind them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="618018dde72c05e2ab6714bd8e0d8895" data-recommend-id="image://618018dde72c05e2ab6714bd8e0d8895" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A shrouded Elden Ring protagonist stands in a grassy, rocky environment with several Albinaurics behind them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Moreover, if you have the Golden Scarab talisman (found in the Abandoned Cave in Caelid), be sure to equip that as well to further improve the amount of runes you receive per run of this farming method. Efficiency is key, after all!<br></p><p>Feel free to level up as high as you’d like to be before starting Shadow of the Erdtree. There is no wrong answer. Just be aware that you can’t un-level your character, so if you think you’ll regret anything, we still recommend stopping between levels 120-150 to ensure you’re ready for the Land of Shadow without being over-leveled. <br></p><p><em>Find more </em>Elden Ring <em>tips and other coverage from us </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/elden-ring&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/elden-ring"><em>here</em></a></span><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s not attempting to be a one-to-one, brick-by-brick recreation of the expansive open-world RPG or even an abridged version. Think of it more as a Shakespeare for Kids spin on the sci-fi adventure, except instead of translating the Bard’s iambic pentameter into contemporary English, it’s taking the familiar bones of a Lego adventure game and putting a pre-historic robot-smashing twist on it.</p><p>It was a bit of a shock when Sony revealed that it’s bringing <em>Horizon Lego Adventures</em> to Switch as well as PlayStation 5 and PC, but playing it for roughly half an hour at Summer Game Fest, it quickly becomes clear that it’s the perfect fit for Nintendo’s handheld hybrid. Out this holiday, the game features two-player co-op and was designed to be playable with just one joystick so that multiplayer would be an option right out of the box with players using an individual Joy-Con each. </p><p>Tim Symons, franchise development lead producer at Guerrilla Games and the person who led me through my demo, seemed thrilled to be making a childhood dream of sorts come true. He joined the Dutch PlayStation studio five years ago after more than a decade at, surprise, Nintendo. He also loved playing with Lego as a kid and confided in me that his favorite set he never actually got to have was the giant pirate ship called the Skull’s Eye Schooner (he wasn’t alone, that was also the set I coveted while incessantly browsing the home catalog back in the day). </p><figure id="" data-id="504bf97be0f7618aae4516b3a2453651" data-recommend-id="image://504bf97be0f7618aae4516b3a2453651" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aloy fights machines out in the wild.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“For us, it’s super exciting to make a Nintendo game for the first time, right?” Symons told me. He said that, rather than make the game for PS5 and scale it down, both versions were made simultaneously. “We do it actually all at the same time, in parallel, so we have a dedicated team of engineers optimizing all this for Switch, but it will be exactly the same.”<br></p><p>Instead of two-player split-screen, both heroes, selected from Aloy, Varl, and two others, share the same game space and follow one another around through verdant, post-apocalyptic forests, villages, and caves. Players have a single projectile attack—a bow and arrow in Aloy’s case and a spear in Varl’s—with the option to pick up additional limited-used power-up abilities during the course of exploring each level. Machines you encounter still have weak points like their counterparts in the original PlayStation 4 game, but there’s no pausing to target specific pieces or using Aloy’s abilities to override and control them. </p><p>She does still have her Focus though, which can be used to highlight interactive objects and other useful info on each level, and you can still deploy makeshift traps by lighting things on fire, blowing up ice barrels, and taking advantage of other elemental effects. I didn’t really see the traditional build mechanics of a Lego game put to use, with much of the exploration and combat feeling more like a stripped down version of<em> Horizon</em>, complete with a light upgrade skill tree, than something reimagined in the world of Lego. You can fight cultists and pick them up and throw them into one another, though. </p><figure id="" data-id="cd5bb037f8429af8bfc67b29dbb15086" data-recommend-id="image://cd5bb037f8429af8bfc67b29dbb15086" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aloy fights a machine inside a cauldron.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This narrower focus can make <em>Horizon Lego Adventures</em> feel simplistic but still compelling. Movement and action control well and the crunchy, tactile feel of Lego is everywhere, from stop-motion animations to the fact that everything in the game was designed out of real pieces first, a requirement by the Lego company.</p><p>“They’d be checking it all to make sure every brick is real,” Symons said. “It’s all  their brick library, essentially. So we’re just rebuilding the game in Lego, which was a cool challenge because we were inspired by the movies. The movies are also made fully out of Lego and we have a bit of stop motion animation because we didn’t want to bend the plastic. We want to be true to the actual product.”</p><p>Even the <em>Horizon </em>story has been re-tuned to introduce the goofy, irreverent humor the other Lego games and movies are known for. Ashly Burch returns to voice Aloy and you can tell she is having a lot of fun re-interpreting the character and her story through comedic moments that vary from slapstick to knowing parody.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="79347bd433ddf0433b3a217e69279ad1" data-recommend-id="image://79347bd433ddf0433b3a217e69279ad1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aloy customize's her hut.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Horizon Lego Adventures</em> feels specially designed with the Switch in mind, it will have some bells and whistles on its home platform of PS5, including a 60fps performance mode. There’s also a bevy of customization options with light settlement-building mechanics and costumes from other Lego franchises and themed sets that can be unlocked over the course of the game. The main campaign runs about eight hours and Symons promised post-story content and other unlockables would keep players busy beyond that.<br></p><p>I peppered him with a few more questions before my session ended. How did Hermen Hulst, managing director of Guerrilla back when<em> Horizon </em>shipped and now co-CEO of PlayStation, react when he first played the new game? “He loved it,” Symons responded, chuckling. What’s Symons’ favorite Lego game? “The Marvel one is pretty good because there’s so many different playstyles,” he said. And finally, does this new partnership mean Aloy might eventually come to the next <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>? “That’d be nice. If you speak to Nintendo and they want to invite us let me know.”</p><p>It’s clear that <em>Horizon Lego Adventures </em>is a carefully selected touch point to get the <em>Horizon</em> brand into more people’s hands, especially kids’, thanks in part to an abridged story that tones down some of the dark parts of the source material (I bet we’ll see some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-real-gameplay-ps5-pc-trailer-1851526168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-real-gameplay-ps5-pc-trailer-1851526168">more <em>Horizon </em>Lego sets as well</a></span>). At the same time, based on playing the opening stages, it seems like an obvious recommendation for any parent like me who loves <em>Horizon</em> and has kids who want me to play games with them. In that way, it feels similar to the purpose <em>Minecraft Dungeons</em> served for parents who love <em>Diablo</em>-inspired dungeon crawling. Whether <em>Horizon Lego Adventures </em>will manage to justify itself as a game that stands alone on its own two feet remains to be seen. <em>Minecraft Dungeons</em> certainly did that. I hope <em>Horizon Lego Adventures </em>can too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Everything To Know So Far</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Season_4_Reloaded">What to expect from Season 4 Reloaded</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 4 added a new battle pass with the Kar98k marksman rifle and Superi 46 submachine gun, but players can expect two new weapons to arrive with the midseason update. Season 4 Reloaded introduces the sledgehammer melee weapon and the Reclaimer 18, which is a rebrand of Call of Duty's popular SPAS-12 shotgun. These weapons will be available to unlock for free with in-game challenges.</p><p dir="ltr">Two "redacted" events were teased for later in the season. One doesn't give a date or any details, with all information listed as "most secret," while a second "top secret" event is bookmarked for June 19-26. One of these is likely related to the leaked-but-still-<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-call-of-duty-crossover-with-fallout-reveals-vault-dweller-skins/1100-6523789/" data-ref-id="1100-6523789">unconfirmed crossover with Fallout</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Modern_Warfare_3">Modern Warfare 3</h2><p dir="ltr">Two more core 6v6 multiplayer maps arrive. Incline is a brand-new mid-sized map, which is themed as a snowy outpost map set in the mountains of Warzone's Urzikstan. The second map is Das Gross, a gory reskin of the popular Das Haus map, which is described as having orange mist, preternatural tendrils, and flapping tentacles.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also brings more game modes. Players can expect a headshots only TDM playlist, and the return of MW2's Havoc mode, which is a TDM variant that rotates random game modifiers throughout the match, such as low gravity, crossbows only, swapping to third-person mode, and having an Advanced UAV always on.</p><p dir="ltr">For Zombies, the Season 4 Reloaded won't include a new story mission, but it will introduce "Unstable Rifts," to Urzikstan. These new rifts let players fight waves of zombies, and completely clearing an Unstable Rift will offer the reward of immediate refreshes on all weapon and schematic cooldowns.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4317885-mwiii-s4-announcement-006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317885" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4317885-mwiii-s4-announcement-006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317885"></a><figcaption>Das Gross map variant for Season 4 Reloaded</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4317885-mwiii-s4-announcement-006.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">The midseason update for Warzone is a bit of a mystery. There are "Redacted" modes and powerful classified weapons that are teased to arrive at some point. The weapons are described as being "impressive and rare weaponry" meant to deal with "enhanced threats across the battlefield." This could mean the return of zombies in Warzone, or possibly something new like radioactive ghouls if there truly is a big Fallout crossover happening.</p><p dir="ltr">One confirmed addition for Season 4 Reloaded is the Runaway Train public event, which will alter the endgame of matches to require players to survive the match on Urzikstan's train.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone_Mobile">Warzone Mobile</h2><p dir="ltr">Thanks to Warzone Mobile's shared progression, the sledgehammer and Reclaimer 18 weapons will also arrive in the mobile version.</p><p dir="ltr">More limited-time modes, weekly challenges, and battle-royale map changes are announced for Season 4 Reloaded, and players can also expect updates to the event store and the Keep.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the Season 4 Reloaded news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> has been officially announced, and here are all of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/">our highlights from the big reveal</a>, including details on the campaign, multiplayer maps, and Treyarch's new omnidirectional movement system.</p>

		<p>Dontnod Entertainment’s narrative adventure game, Tell Me Why, is available for free on Steam and the Xbox Store. This offer will last until the 1st of July. Dontnod has a history of offering <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/01/tell-me-why-free-to-keep-pride-month-xbox-pc-download-links-steam/">Tell Me Why at no cost</a>, a gesture they repeat to celebrate Pride Month.</p>

</ul>
<p>Tell Me Why tells the story of a trans man and his twin sister revisiting their past and the traumas they went through together. Giving the full game away is a nice away to celebrate Pride Month and show support for LGBTQIA+ communities, hopefully getting more people to engage with a mature story told from a perspective that is very rarely seen in video games.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/27/tell-me-why-review-episode-series/">Tell Me Why Review</a></h2>
<p>We had some rather positive things to say about the game when it released last autumn. In our Tell Me Why review, Alan said: <em>“Reining in on the supernatural, Tell Me Why is a more nuanced, intimate and mature story that explores family trauma that challenges our memories and relationships, while making another bold step in representation for video games.”</em></p>

            <p>When I was a kid, one of my absolute favourite things to do on the PC was to mess around with a free virtual Felix - like the cat from the cat food adverts - who would roam around the Windows XP desktop, chasing balls of string between program windows and curling up to take a nap on the taskbar. I have no idea where the game came from - a dream, perhaps - but 30 years later, I still think about it as a perfectly formed way to lose hours on the PC without actually doing anything.</p>

</div>
<p>For that reason, a first glance at Weyrdlets initially had me worried. It’s more of a game than that virtual cat simulator, but scratches that same moreish itch of drifting into a zen-like state while watching a virtual pet just wander around and do its thing on your monitor screen. It seems like the kind of thing I could lose hours to without realising, looking up from the slightly clay-like animals’ idle digging for treasure to find night has turned to day or that it’s still 3pm, but the date has skipped forward.</p>
<p>Developers Weyrdworks seem to understand that there’s a dangerously distracting appeal to staring at colourful little oddballs just doing their thing, so they’re aiming to flip that power of procrastination into something a bit more productive. As well as being an Animal Crossing-style life sim you can casually mess with around whatever else you’re doing - with your pets able to use the treasure they collect to buy new clothes, snacks you can feed them and items to decorate their adorable island home with - Weyrdlets can also be used as a productivity tool, letting you set timers, create to-do lists and log a daily reflection in the company of your desktop pal using a set of handy widgets.</p>

<p>The life sim elements are all a lot less demanding than something like a Tamagotchi, though you’ll still need to chuck your pet a bit of food, give them some fuss and keep them active unless you can stand the guilt of seeing a sad little face hover on your screen. You can send off some encouragement in a bottled message to another player’s screen too, which is a cute Kind Words-like social touch.</p>
<p>It’s a neat mix of much-needed wholesome distraction and actual real-life utility that I can’t help but be drawn to - even if I know, deep down, that I’m far too much of a sucker for cute virtual critters to truly hone my focus on working while there’s a fun little lizard there to pet.</p>
<p>Weyrdlets <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366060/Weyrdlets/">has a demo on Steam now</a>, if you’re curious to try it out yourself, with the full thing arriving on July 23rd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gets-skyline-valley-map-expansion-today-caravan-outposts-in-fall-2024-playable-ghouls-in-early-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few weeks ago, Bethesda Game Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-map-is-getting-bigger-thanks-to-the-addition-of-skyline-valley-shenandoah-national-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Skyline Valley Fallout 76 update on the public test server. Today, the studio is launching the patch (around 27GB on Steam) on live servers.</p>
<p>This is the first expansion to the open world map. Whereas previous new locations, such as Pittsburgh and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-gets-stunning-first-teaser-trailer-fallout-76s-boardwalk-paradise-shown-in-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlantic City</a>, brought players elsewhere, Skyline Valley introduces a whole new area to the Appalachian map. More specifically, Bethesda has added the Shenandoah National Park area toward the south, below the Great Divide. Here, Fallout 76 players will find Vault 63, which is inhabited by non-feral ghouls.</p>
<p>The leader of Vault 63 is Hugo Stolz, who the developers described as having a 'particularly charged personality'. He's a friendly example of a new ghoul type called the Lost, who tend to be wary of outsiders. Throughout the new storyline, players will have the opportunity to either befriend or betray Stoltz.&nbsp;The new fearsome foe added with Skyline Valley is a trio of supersized robots called Storm Goliaths, developed by Vault 63.</p>
<p>There's also a hefty chunk of new quest content, twelve new quests to be exact, as much as the previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-steel-dawn-update-released-ahead-of-schedule-by-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steel Dawn</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-steel-reign-update-patch-notes-legendary-crafting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steel Reign</a> updates combined. There are new factions, new creatures, and new rewards. Lastly, a new public event called Dangerous Pastimes takes place in Skyline Valley. In this event, players take on the role of a storm chaser who needs to power up a big lighting rod to kickstart an electrical light show. The update kicks off Season 17 as well, which is themed around camp rewards.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/F76_Season17_CommunityCalendar_03-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Bethesda Game Studios also teased the next Fallout 76 update. Called Milepost Zero, it will be released this Fall, expanding Skyline Valley with brand new experiences. For example, the Blue Ridge Caravan Company has established a trade route on Skyline Drive and will need the adventurers' help to defend their Brahmin caravans. Funnily enough, the Brahmin can be slapped on the back to make them run a bit faster for a while.</p>
<p>Running missions for the Blue Ridge Caravan Company will eventually unlock a caravan outpost for the player character. Bethesda likened this to Skyrim houses in that the outpost can be decorated and host exclusive vendors.&nbsp;The Fall update will also add the Mischief Night Halloween-themed event, but the most exciting new feature might just be playable ghouls, which are coming to Fallout 76 in early 2025, likely on the heel of the excitement for Cooper Howard, the ghoul character played in the TV show by Walton Goggins.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 76: Skyline Valley Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yHLtDrbLqw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ghouls can be unlocked at level 50 when a quest will allow them to undergo the mutation process. Ghouls have unique benefits against radiation as well as 'dozens' of unique Perk cards to be used in addition to the existing Perks. The flip side is that the character's new appearance might not sit too well with some of the factions.</p>
<p>Lastly, Bethesda teased that the addition of Ghouls is linked to a new challenging endgame activity that will be detailed later this year. Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-passes-20-million-players-milestone-bethesda-is-planning-future-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 million player milestone</a>, it's clear that support for Fallout 76 is here to stay.</p>

For melee users, Preceptor Miriam will walk over to the room if you stay hidden in the corner beside the door.</p>
<p id="GgFgrS">When Miriam has gotten closer to you, you can jump out of the room and hopefully attack them to death. If they’re still alive and teleported away, we recommend climbing the ladder to the rafters above. From here, you can land a jump attack and take them out. After they’ve been defeated, you’ll receive the <strong>Magic Downpour sorcery spell</strong>.</p>

  <p id="Nwkw4q"><strong>Nokron</strong>,<strong> Eternal City</strong>, an area below the Liurnia region of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, is home to a couple bosses (Regal Ancestor Spirit and Valiant Gargoyles) and a few quintessential items such as the Mimic Tear Ashes, larval tears, and the Fingerslayer blade. Nokron is also important to the <em>Elden Ring </em>lore, as the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22982931/ranni-questline-renna-radahn-nokron-eternal-city-three-sisters">Ranni’s quest</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23001617/fia-questline-quest-hug-ending-dagger-location-hold-you">Fia quest</a> pass through the area.</p>
<p id="r9dtTL">Read on to find out how to find the <strong>Nokron entrance,</strong> make your way to the<strong> Siofra Aqueduct</strong> via the Regal Ancestor Spirit and Valiant Gargoyles, and how to get the Mimic Tear Ashes.</p>

<hr id="8qSAUD">
<h2 id="jgzO2U"><strong>Nokron entrance location</strong></h2>
<p id="9ju0Jf">To get into Nokron, <strong>you must first defeat </strong><a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge"><strong>Starscourge Radahn</strong></a>, a powerful boss located by Redmane Castle in Caelid. Once slain, Radahn’s control over the stars will wane, allowing a meteor to crash land in eastern Limgrave.</p>

<p id="EpC2wX">As you enter Nokron, you’ll be greeted with a large cavern full of gothic architecture. Drop down onto the roof below and take notice of the square platform to the right. This can be a tricky jump, so brace yourself. Sprint along the thin rooftop and quickly jump to the right to land on the platform. Continue along the path where you’ll encounter<em> </em>another jump to a different building. Collect the loot off of the corpse here to receive the <strong>Ghostflame Torch</strong>.</p>

<p id="XLyK5t">After you’ve received your items, head down the stairs and continue along the path to find a corpse with a <strong>golden rune (7)</strong>Ahead of you is a classic boss door that leads to the <strong>Mimic Tear</strong>.</p>

An easier way to defeat the Mimic Tear is to enter the area with <strong>nothing equipped</strong> and <strong>reequip all of your equipment after the boss spawns</strong>. Once defeated, you’ll receive <strong>two larval tears</strong>,<strong> </strong>the <strong>Silver Tear Mask</strong>, and the <strong>Mimic Tear Grace</strong>.</p>

It’s early days for <em>Starfield</em>’s official mod support, but what’s on offer right now is a very promising direction for Bethesda’s big ‘ol space sim. </p><h2 id="h4121"><a id=""></a>Mod load order, explained</h2><p>If you’re new to modding, you’ll need to wrap your head around “load order,” which, as the name implies, is the order your mods load in. </p><p>Load order isn’t arbitrary. In fact, if you get the order wrong, you could break certain mods or the game entirely. There isn’t a perfect science to getting the right load order, either, but there are some general rules of thumb you can apply. Just be prepared to readjust your load order in case things go wrong. <br></p><figure id="" data-id="60fa56df0a3e467c261852aa953c90f2" data-recommend-id="image://60fa56df0a3e467c261852aa953c90f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu in Starfield shows active mods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu in Starfield shows active mods." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60fa56df0a3e467c261852aa953c90f2" data-recommend-id="image://60fa56df0a3e467c261852aa953c90f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu in Starfield shows active mods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Generally speaking, you’ll want to start your mod load order with any major patches, such as community-made patches. After that, you want to try and conceptualize which mods are likely to affect more of the game. Adding a new gun, for example, is a small addition, so that can go last. A mod that radically changes companion relationship mechanics, however, might be more substantial, as would something that affects weather or lighting. </p><div><h4> Download the Creation Kit on Steam to make your own mods  </h4><p> If you’re up to the challenge of making mods yourself, be sure to check out the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722710/Starfield_Creation_Kit/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722710/Starfield_Creation_Kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Starfield: Creation Kit</em> on Steam</a></span>.  While creating your own mods is way outside the scope of this guide,  this is the tool you’ll need if you want to get started making your own  creations in Bethesda’s massive galaxy.  </p></div><p>To change your load order, you’ll need to be in the Creations menu. Press Y (or T on keyboard) to look at your current mods and their order. LB (or X on keyboard) will let you change the load order. You can save or restore a load order configuration by pressing the view button or C on keyboard.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627"><em>Starfield</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>To check the load order while in-game (note: you can’t change load order while playing <em>Starfield</em>), head to the pause menu and select Creations. If you’re encountering issues with certain mods, this is the first thing to check. If you’ve got a lot of mods loaded into the game, it might even be worthwhile to have your phone or a pen and paper handy to jot notes down about what works or doesn’t work with certain mod orders and combinations.</p><h2 id="h4122"><a id=""></a><em>Starfield</em>’s Creation Mod categories, explained</h2><p>When you launch into the Creation menu, you’ll see a Netflix-menu-like structure for mods. It’s not the most helpful sorting structure if I’m being honest and is a pain to navigate (especially on PC). </p><p>Fortunately there are some helpful mod categories which have some overlap. They are as follows:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Audio<br>Body<br>Cheats<br>Creatures<br>Dungeons<br>Environmental<br>Followers<br>Gameplay<br>Gear<br>Homes<br>Immersion<br>Misc<br>Outpost<br>Overhaul<br>Planets<br>Quests<br>Ships<br>Skins<br>UI<br>Visuals<br>World</p></blockquote><p>These aren’t exclusive categories. And mods like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/f12f2e21-c1ba-48df-a0f7-dcead71a98f8/Better_Dynamic_Weather&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/f12f2e21-c1ba-48df-a0f7-dcead71a98f8/Better_Dynamic_Weather" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainsymods’ “Better Dynamic Weather”</a></span> will appear under Environmental, Gameplay, Immersion, and Visuals. </p><p>To sort by category, press Left ctrl on keyboard or left trigger on controller. From here you can choose among the different categories (as well as curated, featured lists of mods). You can also sort each of these alphabetically or by date of publication. </p><p>Unfortunately, you can’t sort by price. As you will have noticed, many mods in <em>Starfield</em>’s creation kit cost real money by way of a premium in-game currency you can purchase. This guide won’t wade into the debate over paid mods, but if you see a <em>Fallout</em>-esque lightning bolt symbol on a mod with a number, that means the mod costs real money. </p><h2 id="h4123"><a id=""></a>Installing, changing, and managing mods</h2><p>Modding any game, even ones with dedicated mod storefronts like <em>Starfield</em>, is a process of trial and error. Some mods will work, others won’t. Some will sound great on paper, but might not live up to your expectations.</p><p>To install a mod, you’ll need to add it to your library (you’ll see the option for this under each mod’s page). In the Load Order menu, you can tick and untick each mod to toggle whether or not it’s active. You can also disable a mod from its individual mod page if you have already downloaded and activated it.</p><figure id="" data-id="30528882a772fc5bb20cd70f513cb380" data-recommend-id="image://30528882a772fc5bb20cd70f513cb380" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu in Starfield shows an item that allows for mod editing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu in Starfield shows an item that allows for mod editing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30528882a772fc5bb20cd70f513cb380" data-recommend-id="image://30528882a772fc5bb20cd70f513cb380" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu in Starfield shows an item that allows for mod editing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you start up a game after changing mods, you will get a prompt telling you that some mods changed. It will ask you whether or not you want to load with or without the mods you previously used. Also, some mods might require configuration within the game to work as expected. “Headshot kills any actor,” for example, will place an item in your inventory that opens a menu to configure its options. </p><hr><p>While opinions may vary (and rightly so) on the quality of <em>Starfield</em>’s vanilla offering, the arrival of official mod support is sure to allow for vast and unexpected changes to Bethesda’s massive galaxy. I know I’m already feeling quite tempted to tweak the experience with a handful of mods and go for another deep dive myself.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The day is finally upon us! After many years of massive content updates, culminating in one of the best online experiences around, it’s time for Fallout 76 to expand further. This time, to the south! But what’s new in Fallout 76 Skyline Valley?</p>



<h2 id="h-every-added-to-fallout-76-with-skyline-valley">Every Added to Fallout 76 With Skyline Valley</h2>



<p>The most significant addition to Fallout 76 to date is the map expansion, which includes Skyline Valley—the southern reaches of the map—in an area known as <strong>Shenandoah National Park</strong>. It includes new points of interest to explore, idyllic C.A.M.P. plots, and a brand-new vault, Vault 63!</p>



<p>The expanded map is definitely the highlight, of course, but that’s not all. Skyline Valley includes an additional <strong>Public Event, Dangerous Pastimes</strong>, and a unique boss type, <strong>Storm Goliaths</strong>. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-does-fallout-76-season-17-include">What Does Fallout 76 Season 17 Include?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>I truly cannot believe we’re already on Season 17 of Fallout 76. It doesn’t feel like that long, but here we are, toiling away in a brand-new zone, with unique challenges and rewards to unlock.</p>



<p>In this season, which features a Pioneer Scouts theme, we’ll enjoy four months of regular events, challenges, and updates, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gold Rush</li>



<li>Double Mutations</li>



<li>Double Score</li>



<li>Double XP Weekends</li>



<li>Fasnacht</li>
</ul>



<p>As for rewards, you can earn camping-themed items and cosmetics, which you can check out in greater detail here:</p>

<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fallout-76-skyline-valley-lost-treasures-bundle">What’s In the Fallout 76 Skyline Valley Lost Treasures Bundle?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Should you wish to start off this season and map expansion the right way, Bethesda is now selling the Skyline Valley Lost Treasures Bundle for $29.99. It includes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Weather Control Station (Skyline Valley)</strong></li>



<li><strong>V63 Power Armor &amp; Jetpack Paint</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vault 63 Door Display</strong></li>



<li><strong>Moe the Mole Plushie</strong></li>



<li><strong>V63 Chassis Display Frame</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lightning Rod Pose</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While certainly nothing game-altering, it’s a fun way to continue supporting the post-apocalyptic online game and enjoy a few in-game items and cosmetics with your friends!</p>

                <p>The CWA--the largest media labor union in the US--recently filed a claim with the National Labor Relations Board against what it describes as a "Microsoft supplier," stating that the company laid off an entire team of QA workers for trying to unionize.</p><p dir="ltr">According to a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/communications-workers-america-files-unfair-labor-practice-charge-against-lionbridge" rel="nofollow ">CWA news post</a> announcing the claim, the Idaho-based team included 160 workers that were all let go by the company, Lionbridge Technologies. The company allegedly told workers that their project had ended, necessitating the layoffs. The news post claims that teams assigned to the same project in Mexico and Poland continued to work on it after the Idaho team's dissolution. The project was specifically associated with Activision, which is owned by Microsoft.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time that Lionbridge has been accused of union-busting activity. <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2016/unionized-microsoft-supplier-to-close-lab-one-month-after-completing-first-contract/" rel="nofollow ">Back in 2016</a>, the company laid off all union-affiliated employees after inking contracts with a group of temporary workers. At the time, the company's attorney blamed the layoffs on "reduced demand."</p><p dir="ltr">In the past two years, Activision owner Microsoft has made moves that appeared to signal some openness towards labor action in the long-union-free gaming industry. Back in 2022, the company formally recognized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qa-workers-at-zenimax-studios-have-become-the-gaming-industrys-largest-union/1100-6510268/">a QA union</a> at Bethesda and ZeniMax of around 300 employees, which was then the biggest video-game union in the US.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has reached out to Activision for comment, and we will update this piece accordingly if we hear back.</p>

<p data-characters="282" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There aren’t enough typing games in the world. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-typing-of-the-dead-overkill-is-real-and-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Typing of the Dead</em> spin-offs</a> are excellent examples of their incredible potential, but not enough developers and publishers have taken note. I need to give my home row a thrashing, and <em>FromSoft Word</em> gives me the challenge I need.</p> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false">I’ve already oversold it. <em>FromSoft Word </em>is a typing thing inspired by <em>FromSoftware’s</em> penchant for punishing games. Don’t expect something like Typing Souls, however. Don’t even expect it to be structured. Instead, prepare to be punished for your typos as you attempt to fill a white textbox…</p> <p data-characters="59" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Textbox is apparently not a word. I guess it’s two words.</p> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">However, that’s what you get: a big, blank text document and aggressive-sounding music. That’s exactly how I work most days, but normally, my misspellings are just attacked by squiggly red lines. At worst, my editor berates me (they don’t). In <em>FromSoft Word</em>, I get the echo-y death sound effect along with the words “You Made a Typo.” Harsh. I don’t even get to dispute word usage.</p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="true">But while my game will end if I try to use the King’s spelling of favorite, it doesn’t care about whether or not I can place a comma. In that sense, it’s less brutal than my own self-criticism.</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">Speaking of criticism, while <em>FromSoft Word</em> allows you to export text while you still live, the moment the game over screen hits, you lose the ability to access what you’ve written. This alone means that it won’t become my new word processor of choice. A humiliating loss may be more true to the <em>Souls</em> series, but even <em>Elden Ring</em> allows me to return to my point of death to atone for my failures.</p> <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="false"><em>FromSoft Word</em> comes to us from Steven Nass and Peter Henningsen at Woe Industries.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/12/developer-league-of-geeks-goes-into-hibernation-due-to-economic-situation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The game developer League of Geeks, known for creating titles such as Armello, Solium Infernum, and Jumplight Odyssey, has announced an indefinite hibernation. This move is a response to the economic uncertainties within the industry and comes after the company reduced its staff by 50% at the end of 2023.</p>
<p><iframe title="Solium Infernum - Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IvQA1P3Akrk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The complete statement from Co-founders and Directors Trent, Blake &amp; Ty can be read below.</p>
<p><em>“With over 13 years under our belt as an entirely independent studio, and the economic situation in games being what it is right now, we have made the decision to put LoG into hibernation for the foreseeable future and take some extended time off. The vast majority of our team have moved on to exciting new endeavours and those who remain are going to take a well deserved break over the next few months.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re not sure when (or if) we will resurrect this great beast, but we’re incredibly proud of all we’ve achieved, both in the experiences we’ve crafted together, the great developers who made LoG a world-class development environment, the peers we inspired along the way, and of course, those community members who believed in what we made, how we made it, and supported us fiercely in those convictions. Now it’s time for rest, some play, and other opportunities. As for our games… They will remain online and will be supported during this period.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Solium Infernum</strong> remains in Open Critic’s Top 10 games of 2024 (#20 on Metacritic!), and we are incredibly proud of where the game is now. Unfortunately, its sales revenue cannot fund further active development or DLC. However, we do love our Hellish strategy game and have a couple of treats up our sleeve still, some bug fixes and minor content. So I’m sure we’ll find an opportunity to get a lil update or two out.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Jumplight Odyssey</strong> has, as of this point, not found workable and timely investment that would reinstate development on the title. We would love nothing more than to see this project finished, but unfortunately, development will remain on hiatus. We are aiming to bring it out of Early Access at some point in the next 12 months. This is unlikely to be the fully realised v1.0 release we had originally planned, though we will try to find some way to tuck the game in with our limited, remaining resources. In brighter news, we will be releasing the Jumplight Odyssey OST for FREE, complete with expanded and remastered tracks, on Steam (and other platforms) in the next week or so!</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Armello</strong> will continue to cruise along as it has for the past few years, rotating seasonal content and providing a hit of heroism for our furry adventurers. The Armello Board Game won’t be affected in any way by this. That’s in the caring hands (paws?) of King of the Castle Games and we’re around for anything they need. Though admittedly, they’re all over it! You can find posts with more information relevant to each game in their respective Steam communities.”</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metallica-headlines-fortnite-as-it-introduces-a-new-music-themed-battle-mode-and-fresh-concert.899487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/metallica-headlines-fortnite-as-it-introduces-a-new-music-themed-battle-mode-and-fresh-concert<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
The next musical stars to join Fortnite are Metallica, via an all-encompassing arrival set to land across the game's various modes. 
</p>
<p>
Most obviously, Metallica will headline the game's next Fortnite Festival season - the Rock Band-esque mode made by Harmonix. Not only will Metallica's four members be unlockable as skins in the mode's next Festival Pass, but tomorrow's game update notably adds a new competitive way to play Festival: Battle Stage. 
</p>
<p>
Here, 16 players face off against each other via a song chosen at random, with your Overdrive operating as an attack power to take other players down a peg. Or, you can team up with a four-person party of friends and pick specific tunes to fight over.
</p>

<p>
Metallica will also feature in what sounds like an old-school Fortnite music concert - it's been a while! - set to be made available at a range of times over the weekend of 22nd and 23rd June. 
</p>
<p>
This means if you're busy, or if you want to replay the event, you can log in at 7pm or 10pm UK time on Saturday 22nd, or 4am, 3pm, 7pm or 10pm UK time on Sunday 23rd to watch. 
</p>
<p>
In battle royale, mythic guitar items will be added which look to be a traversal item. "Use one to create a lightning arc in the sky that your squadmates can ride," Epic Games says. "One your descent, come crashing down to bring the beginning of an enemy's end." Each match's lategame Loot Island will also now rift in with a Metallica look, inspired by the band's stage on the M72 World Tour. 
</p>
<p>
And finally, there's a new Rocket Racing track, appropriately themed with volcanic lava. New quests will also offer a Metallica-themed car.
</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, plenty of Metallica music is coming to the game to buy as Jam Tracks, playable in most modes. As of tomorrow's update, Jam Tracks can also finally become playable as lobby tunes - which is music to my ears.
</p>

			<p>In early June, Sony offered <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-june-2024-spongebob-extra-premium-bonus-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some “bonus” titles</a> for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers</a>, but we’re also getting a regular mid-month update as well. Extra subscribers can look forward to Monster Hunter Rise, Crusader Kings III, Football Manager 2024, Far Cry 4, and more. Meanwhile, Premium subscribers can jump into Daxter, Lego Star Wars II, and more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFpsplus26.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Here are your <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-june-monster-hunter-rise-football-manager-2024-crusader-kings-iii-after-us-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS Plus Extra headliners for June</a>…</p>
<p><em><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong> (PS4, PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftech’s review – “Once players get past the poor onboarding experience, Monster Hunter Rise might offer the series' best entry for first time players while series veterans will fly over the competition with the new Wirebug mechanics. The ways that Capcom has streamlined the onboarding and pre-hunt experiences to give players more time to focus on the actual hunt itself show that Capcom wants to respect the player's time, especially when they're trying to get three friends together for an afternoon of hunting.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Crusader Kings III</strong> (PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftech’s review – “Crusader Kings III pulls off a difficult dual victory, bringing a new level of depth, charm, and polish to the franchise, while also making it far more approachable than it’s been before. Some aspects of Crusader Kings III still aren’t as user-friendly as they could be, but overall, this is a worthy heir to the throne.”</em></p>
<p>Here are the other games available to PS Plus Extra subscribers this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>After Us</strong> (PS5)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Anno 1800</strong> (PS5)</em></li>

<li><em><strong>Football Manager 2024</strong> (PS5)</em></li>

<li><em><strong>Monster Energy Supercross – The Official Videogame 6</strong> (PS4, PS5)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Police Simulator: Patrol Officers</strong> (PS4, PS5)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, here are your PS Plus Premium Classics and a bonus PS VR2 game:</p>

<li><em><strong>Daxter</strong> (PS4, PS5)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Sony now offers three tiers of PS Plus – Essential, Extra, and Premium.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-prices-increasing-all-tiers-september-2023-ps-plus-essential-saints-row/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The price for all three tiers have gone up</a>&nbsp;for those subscribing for a year, but the monthly cost hasn’t changed.

I sure did. In fact, the meanest thing I can say about it is that there wasn’t enough of it – I finished its five levels and final boss battle within a single evening. But as if in response to my hunger for more of PlayStation’s newest mascot, developer Team Asobi has opened the floodgates in Astro Bot, a game that looks to be everything I loved about the Playroom, but galaxies more of it.</p><p>I played a 45-minute demo of Astro Bot at Summer Game Fest Play Days over the weekend, and what a blast it was! What Astro’s Playroom got right, and what Astro Bot continues to absolutely nail, is making it wildly fun to just run around and be Astro. Everything is tuned precisely to feel just right: his movement speed, his jumping height and distance, the exact way he smashes little crates and zaps enemies with feet lasers, the density of obstacles in my path and the exact way each stage follows a linear path but branches and loops back on itself to allow room for secrets. Running through a single level in Astro Bot clicks my brain cells into a flow state where I am constantly moving and always have an objective in mind, but don’t feel overwhelmed by my options. I love smashing stuff; I love jumping over stuff; I love bouncing off stuff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Where Astro’s Playroom had five major levels themed loosely around PlayStation 5 components, Astro Bot sends our little hero cruising through space atop a giant DualSense controller, hopping from planet to planet in search of his lost bot buddies. I’m told Astro Bot has around 80 levels to visit, all bursting with hidden bots, puzzle pieces, boss battles, goofy power-ups, coins, and little challenges leading to delightful secrets.</p><p>I saw five levels in my playthrough. One, a lush area with clear pools, pink flamingos, and rolling green hills in the distance, was full of water-based mechanics. I swam through little reefs of colorful fish, slid down a giant water slide, and unzipped giant water bubbles to unleash the flood inside. There, Astro could inflate like a little robot bubble to drift quickly up to higher areas, a skill especially useful underwater. In another level themed around a construction zone, Astro flung paint around to uncover hidden platforms, sucked up metal items with giant magnets, and equipped some kind of dog jetpack to zoom across long distances his usual hover wouldn’t normally clear. </p><p>Another level centered around a boss fight with a giant octopus wearing boxing gloves. To compensate, I got ahold of a pair of my own frog-themed gloves that let Astro punch enemies at a distance and swing like a monkey from certain overhangs. Another (wildly minor) criticism I had of Astro’s Playroom was that some of its power-up/vehicle sections frustrated me due to cumbersome movement mechanics as they tried to showcase the PS5’s unique features. Freed from that obligation, Astro Bot is better able to focus on giving me new toys that are just pure fun to use. Quick, solid, alternating punches using R1 and R2 made me feel like I was Goku-fighting the octopus, and I sent him packing.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Astro Bot Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The final two stages I tried were special challenge levels designed to test my platforming abilities. One of them tested my ability to dodge rapidly spinning enemies on crumbling platforms, while another forced me to execute sections of tricky jumps in limited periods of time. I managed to finish both in the demo time allotted, though not without some struggle on the first one. It’s hard to gauge just from these two stages how high the difficulty of Astro Bot’s platforming will eventually scale. But what pleased me the most about them was how the fast respawn time and overall brevity of the stages made trying again and again and again so easy and enjoyable. I found myself thinking, “Just one more try,” more than once, only to try two, three, ten more times. There was a moment toward the end of the demo where I stopped, looked around, and realized everyone else had left the room already. Just one more try…and I nailed it.</p><p>And yes, Astro Bot looks to be a nostalgia-fest. Sure, when compared to Playroom, I think Astro Bot seems a bit more focused on being an excellent platformer rather than reveling in PlayStation history. But that’s to its benefit - levels like the watery/flamingo one don’t need to have references to Bloodborne every two feet to keep me happy. Rather, Astro Bot’s PlayStation celebration largely resides with the bots I’m rescuing through each level, some of whom are dressed up like favorites such as Ratchet, Rivet, PaRappa, and more. And I have reason to suspect fans of PlayStation’s biggest franchises might be well-rewarded for finishing certain levels. When I beat the octopus, for instance, I rescued a bot pair clad as Kratos and Atreus, who then flew off to an icy-looking planet I couldn’t access in the demo. If my reading is right, we might be in for a full-blown God of War-themed level in the full game, and perhaps more besides.</p><p>When Team Asobi first started making the Astro games, it was easy for me to mentally make a shorthand comparison of their work to Nintendo’s long history of platformers. Both have similar throughlines, especially with how the two make games that feel like touchable, experimental toys and how both emphasize playfulness, joy, and surprise. But I’m pretty well convinced Team Asobi is beyond chasing Nintendo’s pedigree. Built on the foundation of Astro’s Playroom, Astro Bot seemed poised to elevate the Astro games into a league all their own, if they weren’t there already. You’re telling me they’ve got 80 levels of what I just played? Sign me up to fly with Astro and crew.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

But there will be even more on the way later, via free DLC.</p><p>Speaking to IGN, Team Asobi studio head Nicolas Doucet told us there were plans for eventual free DLC for Astro Bot, coming “soon” after launch. He says it will be based around adding more challenge levels to the game – shorter levels focused on specific platforming challenges – but that won’t be the only component.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Doucet didn’t share more details about what else might be coming in these DLC additions, but we can throw some guesses out there. For one, both of the challenge levels we played in the preview were centered around rescuing a bot in a PlayStation character costume, so it only seems logical that more DLC means more character cameos that won’t appear in the base game. Given that there are apparently around 150 PlayStation character cameos already, it will be interesting to see how deep the cuts go here.</p><p>Beyond that, we can hope that we’ll also see more large, character-themed levels both in the base game and the DLC. While playing Astro Bot in our hands-on preview, we rescued a Kratos and Atreus bot via a boss battle, which led to them flying off to an ice-covered world. For this reason, we suspect there will be at least one God of War-themed level in Astro Bot, and perhaps even more character-themed levels beyond that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Astro Bot Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>“The hammer and the two Odin's Ravens kind of give it away, but what happens inside that world is TBD,” Doucet said. “Please play it when it comes out.”</p><p>Doucet told us that PlayStation “completely opened the doors” to whatever characters Team Asobi wanted to include in the game, and internal studios even sent requests pouring in for their characters to be featured. In our demo, we saw Ratchet and Rivet, PaRappa, Kratos, Atreus, Jak, and the Traveler from Journey. I’m told PaRappa’s pal Lammy also made an appearance, but we missed her.</p><p>Astro Bot getting free DLC makes sense, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astros-playroom-gets-surprise-update-ahead-of-astro-bots-release"><u>Astro’s Playroom also got a little love recently</u></a> in celebration of the Astro Bot announcement. If you open up Astro’s Playroom now, a number of new objectives have cropped up throughout its PlayStation-themed worlds, all leading up to a countdown to Astro Bot’s September 6 release date.</p><p>You can catch up on the rest of our interview with Doucet from Summer Game Fest <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-astro-bots-developers-are-still-pushing-the-limits-of-ps5-tech">right here</a>, as well as our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-first-hands-on-preview-worlds-of-fun">full hands-on preview of Astro Bot</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-preview-lets-do-a-silly-one<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The very pitch of a LEGO Horizon game was always bound to be delightful. LEGO games have been historically well-regarded for their self-referential humor and family-friendly gameplay, and Horizon: Zero Dawn was a game of the year contender when it came out in 2017. With LEGO Horizon Adventures, it’s like someone at Guerrilla called everyone from Zero Dawn into the room, pointed at the game, said, “Hey, let’s do a silly one.” And then, when everyone agreed to this ridiculous idea, they proceeded to treat that silly one with the same level of craft and care with which they treated the other Horizon games. </p><p>LEGO in video game form has never looked so gorgeous, or felt so satisfying to tear apart. Aloy kicks up little footprints of LEGO dust as she walks. Barrels she shoots with her trusty bow burst apart into little LEGO bits.  Cloth capes on NPCs are patterned with striking detail, while sunlight glitters off brick water and LEGO grass strands go up in translucent LEGO flames when hit with a fire arrow. Sure, it's cool that we can see the pores of Aloy's skin in Horizon: Forbidden West, but Horizon Adventures is a great reminder that interesting style choices - like making an entire world out of LEGO - can be visually stunning as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>LEGO Horizon Adventures loosely - and I do mean loosely - follows the story of Zero Dawn, and lampoons it at every opportunity. For instance, you might remember Zero Dawn's intro involving a child Aloy finding her Focus in an Old World ruin. In Horizon Adventures, Rost just hands it to her in a cheerful mockery of its supposed rarity. Aloy, played by Ashly Burch in full goblin mode, revels in the self-aware script: she's obsessed with finding out who her mother is and convinced it will solve all her problems. You know, just like in Zero Dawn. The best part is, this character shift <em>works</em>, perhaps because Aloy never took herself too seriously to begin with. She and JB Blanc (Rost) are clearly having a great time with these lines, and I'm told most of the original voice cast was up for the challenge of reprising their same roles, but with the goofiness dial turned up to 11. And the LEGO humor extends to visual gags, too. I laughed out loud when I realized Aloy in stealth mode hiding in tall grass was simply transforming into the grass bricks themselves.</p><p>Horizon's dino-hunting mechanics translate nicely to LEGO's simpler, family-friendly style, and it helps that its monsters were already made up of a bunch of breakable components to begin with. Aloy can use her Focus to identify enemy weak points, then fire away at those specific bricks for bigger damage. Her basic attacks all use her bow, but she can find limited-use power-ups as she explores that will let her spice up combat by, for instance, letting Aloy set things on fire. Some of these attacks are practical, but others are goofy, like one ability I found that let me build an enemy-damaging hot dog stand. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>LEGO Horizon Adventures First Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Anachronistic, LEGO-themed goofs are rife throughout Horizon Adventures. Like a kid playing with a toy room LEGO set, occasionally I ran into pieces that didn’t quite belong, like some random generic LEGO NPCs that showed up among a group of Nora villagers. Nowhere is the customizable LEGO-ness of it all more evident than in Mother’s Heart, Aloy’s home base where buildings can be customized with everything from Thunderjaw heads to dino-themed roller coasters. Outside of Mother’s Heart, there’s not as much an emphasis on building as I’ve come to expect from other LEGO games, though there are some structures out in the wilderness you can assemble as you pass by for a bit of flavor and in-game currency rewards.</p><p>Aloy herself can play dress-up with a wide variety of outfits ranging from Horizon-themed costumes to totally unrelated LEGO cast members. And every member of Mother’s Heart can be chucked into the dress-up room and fashioned up in the same way, too. If you want a Mother’s Heart full of little LEGO cowboys, by golly, you may have it.</p><p>While I played the tutorial solo, half of my demo took place in co-op mode, where I played as Aloy’s friend Varl. Almost everything Aloy can do, Varl can too. He wields a spear that functions very similarly to her bow, and while there are some distinctive power-ups for each of them, they’re both just as good at taking down dinos. Co-op can get a touch chaotic with two players in the mix, especially once you start lighting things on fire. But I’m excited to have the option at all, available both in couch co-op (which I played) and online. </p><p>With my back-to-back demos at Play Days last weekend covering both LEGO Horizon Adventures and Astro Bot, I briefly felt I had stumbled into a Nintendo appointment by mistake. Sony clearly wants to <em>play, </em>and LEGO Horizon Adventures presents a massive toy box to tinker, fuss around with, and most importantly, laugh about. The Horizon series may be mechanically complex and about (among other things) the very serious and real dangers of humanity destroying itself. But to Guerrilla’s immense credit, Horizon is not above being lovingly dismantled, brick by brick, by its own creators. All the better for us that the result is such a joyful, family-friendly adventure.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?
