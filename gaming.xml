                <p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has laid off a number of employees at its Red Storm studio, which has most recently focused on a number of VR initiatives for the publisher, as well as supporting development on titles such as XDefiant.</p><p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tom-clancy-star-trek-bridge-crew-studio-ubisoft-red-storm-lays-off-19-citing-global-cost-saving-efforts" rel="nofollow ">reported by IGN</a>, Ubisoft has cut 19 jobs at Red Storm, citing "ongoing, targeted restructuring and global cost-saving efforts" for its reasoning.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft released a full statement to IGN, which reads, "Today, Ubisoft made the decision to eliminate 19 roles at Red Storm Entertainment. This step is part of our ongoing, targeted restructuring and global cost-saving efforts, and reflects the needs on the studio’s projects. While this was not an easy decision, it was a necessary one given our operational priorities. We remain committed to supporting those affected with comprehensive severance packages, extended health-care benefits, and career transition assistance. We deeply appreciate their hard work and the impact they’ve had on Ubisoft."</p><p dir="ltr">It is currently unclear how deep these cuts at Red Storm, which has become a VR and support studio over the last several years, go or how they will impact any ongoing projects at the team. Ubisoft PR confirmed to IGN though that this restructuring is not indicative of any larger cuts occurring at the French publisher or of its other teams.</p><p dir="ltr">Red Storm, which was founded in 1996 and created stalwart franchises under the Tom Clancy banner such as the Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon series, most recently released Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, which is exclusively available on Meta Quest 2 and above. Besides this release, which marks the long-running franchise's debut on virtual reality platforms, the studio has spent much of the last few years supporting games like XDefiant, which was shut down earlier this year, and working on a pair of canceled projects, including a canned Splinter Cell VR title and a free-to-play spin-off title in The Division series subtitled Heartland.</p><p dir="ltr">The former was axed back in 2022 while the latter lingered for a while longer--even being played in closed alpha tests--before being indefinitely delayed and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/">ultimately shelved</a> in 2024 amidst wider cuts at a tough time for the embattled publisher, which recently entered into a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/">partnership with Tencent</a>.</p>

Tharpe highlighted how the film stood out in the superhero genre by striking an honest tone unique to the Superman ethos.</p><p>“Gunn’s approach is colorful, in both its palette and the costumes; proudly fantastical, with flying orbs, robots, portals, and giant monsters; and at times endearingly, intentionally corny (see: Krypto the super dog). But late in the third act, Superman delivers an impassioned monologue about himself that essentially states Gunn’s thesis about the character and his core values. You won’t find any controversial neck-snapping here.”</p><p>A large swath of critics applauded Gunn’s bold choice to ground <em>Superman</em> in political tensions, using the conflict between two warring countries—Boravia and Jarhanpur—as a central plot point. <em>New York Times</em> movie critic Alissa Wilkinson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/movies/superman-review.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/movies/superman-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted in her review</a></span> that her own superhero movie fatigue was no match for <em>Superman</em>’s goofy yet sincere take on the Man of Steel. <em>Vulture</em> critic Alison Willmore, meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/review-james-gunns-superman-cant-help-but-be-political.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vulture.com/article/review-james-gunns-superman-cant-help-but-be-political.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emphasized</a></span> that the hero is “the creation of two Jewish American men whose families fled the pogroms and who gave their extraterrestrial defender of the planet a background as a refugee himself.” To her, this somewhat politicized superhero film is a welcomed reflection of our world, and our real-life supervillains.</p><p>At the time o this article’s release, the movie holds an impressive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/superman_2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/superman_2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">86 percent approval rating</a></span> on Rotten Tomatoes, with journalists like <em>Associated Press</em> film critic Jake Coyle calling it “something quite rare in the assembly line-style of superhero moviemaking today: human.” That feeling of being reminded why many of us fell in love with comic books in the first place was a common sentiment among those who enjoyed it. To them, <em>Superman</em> was a trip back to their unjaded, zealous youth, when a man leaping tall buildings in a single bound still amazed them.</p><p>Unfortunately, all is not well in Metropolis. A number of critics took issue with what they see as the film’s uninspired plot, lackluster performances by some of the cast, and Krypto, Superman’s adorable dog, outshining some of the human characters.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>You might not be able to sandwalk like a Fremen in Dune: Awakening, but there are ways of getting around Arrakis besides your own two feet, including fast travel. </p>



<p>It's not immediately obvious that fast travel is in Dune: Awakening, but it is there. You don't need to use it, though, and there's a real question as to whether you should be using it at all. </p>



<p>This guide will take you through all of that; how fast travel works, where it can take you, and if you should be using it at all.</p>



<h2 id="h-dune-awakening-guide-how-fast-travel-works">Dune: Awakening Guide - How Fast Travel Works</h2>



<h3 id="h-how-fast-travel-works-in-dune-awakening">How Fast Travel Works in Dune: Awakening</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unlike other open-world games with large maps to cross, you cannot fast travel whenever you like in Dune: Awakening. It's only available when you make it to your first trade post in the southern region of Hagga Basin. </p>



<p>You can fast travel from any trade post, but it only unlocks once you've reached the first one, Griffin's Reach. Fast travel works by hiring a pilot to fly you to Harko Village, the Harkonnen base on Arrakis, or Arrakeen, the city where the Atreides have taken refuge. Both areas are social hubs where you can meet other players, though more significantly, they house plenty of important NPCs you need to speak to, like advanced-level trainers for Trooper and Mentat skill trees.</p>



<p>It'll cost you 2,500 Solaris for the pilot to fly you to either Harko Village or Arrakeen, but at least your return trip to whichever trade post you'd like to fly back to will be free. The pilot will also be able to fly you to different trade posts in Hagga Basin, such as the Anvil or Pinnacle Station, though there's still a cost to that. A more reasonable 700 Solaris will get you between different trade posts. </p>



<p>You also can't use the pilot to fly you to a trade post you've not been to before. You have to make it there yourself by some other means before being able to fast travel from one trade post to another.</p>



<h3 id="h-should-you-use-fast-travel-in-dune-awakening">Should You Use Fast Travel in Dune: Awakening?</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are two answers to this question, and the one that's right for you depends on where you are in the game. Basically, if you have yet to craft your own ornithopter, then yes, you should be using fast travel, though that's also because you have to. You can't access Arrakeen or Harko Village any other way, save for landing there with an ornithopter.</p>



<p>If you have already crafted your own ornithopter, then you don't need to use the pilot, and you can select travelling to Arrakeen or Harko Village as a form of fast travel, since there's no other way to access either settlement.</p>



<p>When you're going from one trade post to another, unless you're immediately near a trade post and have the 700 Solaris to spare, you might find it better to just get there yourself, especially if you have your own ornithopter. Being able to fly anywhere at any time is the *real* fast travel in Dune: Awakening.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A consumer rights watchdog in Brazil has launched a legal challenge against Nintendo for its policy of "bricking" the consoles of users who violate the console's terms of service. This policy is a new addition to Nintendo's user agreement. The change took effect on May 7, just a month before the Nintendo Switch 2 launched. Procon-SP, the São Paulo branch of the Brazilian Consumer Protection and Defense Program, has raised a complaint with Nintendo itself, claiming the policy violates consumer rights.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-from-online-services-sparks-headlines-brazils-consumer-rights-watchdog-issues-legal-challenge" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">IGN</a>, reports of "bricked" consoles have emerged since the Switch 2's launch. Affected users have speculated that bans result from the use of flash memory cards generally, and the MIG Switch device in particular, both of which can be used for piracy. A bricked console cannot access the internet and will display the error code 2124-4508.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If, like me, you’ve noticed an uptick in anime girls with horse ears running around your social media timeline, you might be confused as to what the hell is going on. The game causing all this commotion, my friends, is <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>,<em> </em>a gacha game that has finally made its way to the West after originally launching in Japan back in 2021. The game is based on the titular media franchise in which racehorses are reincarnated as literal horse girls who do what racehorses do best, just as bipedal humans with horse ears on their heads. Given that there are dozens of horse girls in the series, the premise is ripe for a gacha game in which people gamble to unlock their favorite. But what do you do when you’ve got them? The same thing you’d do with a regular racehorse, of course: train them to be the very best.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Like a lot of people, I had never heard of <em>Umamusume Pretty Derby </em>before the game’s launch in this part of the world last week. Despite its preposterous premise, the game plays its horse girl races pretty straight and with the kind of gusto and earnest determination you’d expect from any sports anime. As the girls run around the track, there’s spirited commentary, rivalries, and narratives unfolding. If I didn’t see that the girls had horse ears on their heads, I wouldn’t know it wasn’t just a straightforward racing show. Well, at least I wouldn’t until after the girls have crossed the finish line, at which point they put on an idol concert for a crowd of adoring fans. Sure, pop off, queens.</p><p>After <em>Umamusume </em>draws you in with all the glitz and glamour, it does what every one of these games does and bombards you with menus, currencies, and random drops. When I started to navigate these abundant, colorful menus, they crashed my iPhone 12. Maybe it’s time for an upgrade. Wait, is the horse girl gacha game going to get me to an AT&amp;T store to join modern times? What an odd turn of events.</p><p>Anyway, these random drops come in two forms: trainees and support cards. The former are the actual horse girls you’ll be training; the rest are supplementary cards that will give your primary character a boost. Each horse girl has a career that, once completed, allows them to be registered as a Veteran Umamusume and Legacy character, in order to grant stat boosts and other perks to other characters. So you can see how the grind feeds into itself and incentivizes you to train several racers rather than just your favorites. </p><p>When you get set up in your career, parts of the game feel more like playing with a digital pet than I expected. Each girl has different goals, requiring different training regimens to make progress in their story. You’ll also monitor their energy levels, interact with other students at the horse girl academy, and eventually, you’ll send her off to the races. The only real input you get into the competitions themselves is the training you put your horse girl through and the game plan you give her ahead of time. You can make some strategic decisions, like telling her to prioritize pacing herself instead of sprinting like her life depends on it, but the optimal strat is determined by the stats she’s gained through training ahead of races, Ultimately, your goal is to set her up for success; if you were hoping for a more direct racing game, you will not find that here.</p><p>All that being said, there’s potential here for some real sicko grinding and optimizing your racer’s stats, especially as you import legacy characters to boost those attributes and collect support cards through drops. It can make going through the careers feel almost like a rogue-like run in which you try to figure out the best build to claim victory. I see the various hooks <em>Umamusume </em>has lowered into the sea, and while I know the kind of people who gravitate towards these kinds of games might bite,&nbsp;I don’t know if the bait is quite to my liking, personally.&nbsp;I still find its barrage of mechanics and menus overwhelming, though, and there isn’t much else here pulling me in, so I don’t think I’ll be staring into the abyss long enough to get caught up in the gacha mechanics here. Gacha games are all about risk and reward, and I don’t think its wacky concept is enough reward for the risk of opening myself to gambling.</p><p>After spending a couple of hours with <em>Umamusume</em>, its bizarre premise seems to be the most compelling thing it has going for it. It’s got plenty of the drawbacks of other gacha games on the market: full of currencies that you can purchase for ungodly amounts of real-world money, rewards incentivizing you to log in every day, enough menus to overstimulate anyone who dares to install it, and character design so generic I couldn’t identify any of these girls in a line-up with a gun to my head. Lucky for it, the thing that makes it stand out is a memetic absurdist premise that helps it pierce through the oversaturated gacha market. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but it’s just silly enough to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/umamusume-pretty-derby-breaks-all-time-player-count-record-on-steam-after-twitch-streamers-discover-horse-waifu-racing-game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/umamusume-pretty-derby-breaks-all-time-player-count-record-on-steam-after-twitch-streamers-discover-horse-waifu-racing-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">catch the eye of those who aren’t usually paying attention</a></span>.

<p>"It was exactly the same tactics of creating a very expensive movie," said Moore. "But when the game came out, it was completely BS. I knew it that night when I watched it. I thought there's no way they're delivering this experience. They were doing the same thing to us as they did with Sega, which is go: 'Alright, cute little Xbox 360 coming out, but the big boys will be out with the PlayStation 3, so you should hang around and wait for that. Because look what we can do.'"</p><p>According to Moore, game journalists also recognized Sony's strategy and quickly came to the conclusion that the PS3 wasn't powerful enough to produce that level of detail in real-time.</p><p>Moore went on to describe Microsoft's strategic rollout of Xbox 360, and added that landing the console-exclusive rights for Call of Duty 2 went a long way towards the company's success.</p><p>In the present, Call of Duty remains the most-successful <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fps-games/2900-6265/" data-ref-id="2900-6265">FPS</a> franchise, which is now owned by Microsoft after the Activision Blizzard sale.

The news caps off an incredible run for SGA, as he was not only a key part of the 2024-2025 NBA championship-winning Thunder but also league MVP, Finals MVP, and scoring champion.</p><p>Gilgeous-Alexander joined the NBA in 2018, when he was drafted 11th overall by the Charlotte Hornets. He was traded that same day to the Los Angeles Clippers, where he played for one year and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. In July 2019, Gilgeous-Alexander was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, where he has played since. Since that trade, SGA has been named to three All-Star Teams and three All-NBA First Teams. The Toronto-born star also took home the 2023 Lionel Conacher Award, given to Canada’s male athlete of the year.</p>

If you’re interested, here are links to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FC5FJZ9Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">console and <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3GWXLTS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">the console on its own</a>.</p><p>It’s a big change following Nintendo removing listings for its products from Amazon starting last year. <em>Bloomberg</em> reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/amazon-lost-right-to-sell-nintendo-switch-2-amid-sales-dispute?embedded-checkout=true">in June</a> that Nintendo pulled the listings because third-party sellers sold games at prices “that undercut Nintendo’s advertised rates.” Nintendo and Amazon pushed back on <em>Bloomberg’s</em> report in statements to the publication but didn’t go into specifics.</p><p>However, there have been signs that something had changed between Nintendo and Amazon, with Switch 2 games like <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, and <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3lrk3nx4nfy2z?ref_src=embed">all recently getting official Amazon product pages</a>.</p><p>If you request an Amazon invite, the product page will show a message saying that “if invited to purchase, you’ll get an email with a link that’s valid for 22 hours.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a decade of back-and-forth attack and defense missions in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, it was most certainly time for an update. Most of us were probably expecting a sequel. But Ubisoft decided an update masquerading as an overhaul would suffice. <em>Rainbow Six Siege X</em> enters the picture and, with it, a bunch of technical improvements, playable content, and promises. But if it’s been some time since you jumped into <em>Siege</em>, you’re likely curious about what makes this new version so special. Let’s get into it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,196358,196626" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h103333"><a id=""></a>What does the community think of the new update?</h2><p>Folks have been actively enjoying <em>Rainbow Six Siege </em>since December of 2015. So we’re about a few months shy of 10 years—that’s a long time to settle into a routine. Folks have been playing maps, operators, and weapons with major changes introduced incrementally over the last decade. But with the <em>X</em> update, everything changes at once. Sometimes, it’s not for the better.</p><p>For instance, over on Steam,<strong> there are a slew of negative reviews, dropping the first-person shooter to ‘Mixed’ on the platform</strong>. To be fair, many of them denounce Ubisoft’s customer service, which is completely fair based on personal experience.

And in an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202507/46603">Famitsu</a>, where he talks about anime and his love of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>, he's particularly gushing about one recent Switch game that he thinks "anyone aspiring to become a game developer" should play.</p>
<p>That title is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, and not for the in-game Echoes, summonable monsters, or even the puzzle design. Rather, it's how Nintendo has "used resources" and re-used assets.</p><div><figure data-videoid="AnD-StQ8xqk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnD-StQ8xqk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AnD-StQ8xqk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnD-StQ8xqk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed49fea7ypurmx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnD-StQ8xqk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As translated by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1942432023127417087">Genki on X</a>, Yoshi-P says that he "was particularly impressed" with the top-down Zelda game, even compared to other recent games he's been playing.</p>
<p>"What I am about to talk about is a bit nerdy, but even from a producer's perspective there were many points [in the game] that made me think 'Wow, that's amazing', in terms of how they used resources, how they made it, and the game design."</p>
<p>"The base resources used in the game are almost the same as other Zelda games", the director continues, praising Nintendo's ability to keep costs down "by focusing all the efforts on making the game fun to play." Well, that last point is Nintendo to a tee.</p>

<p>But beyond that, Yoshi-P thinks that Echoes of Wisdom is a great case study for people wanting to get into game development; "I would encourage anyone aspiring to become a game developer or who is just starting their career to try playing this game from that perspective."</p>
<p>That's not the first time game developers have been wowed by a Zelda game — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>'s huge open world and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s incredible Ultrahand and Rewind mechanics had many in-awe back when those games launched. Zelda just has that magic, then.</p>
<p>Hopefully we'll see some of Yoshi-P's own work on the Switch 2; there have been hints and rumours that ports of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/final-fantasy-xiv-online-director-would-love-to-see-square-enixs-mmo-on-a-nintendo-platform">Final Fantasy XIV</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/rumour-final-fantasy-devs-supposedly-hint-at-another-nintendo-release">XVI may be on the cards</a> at some point, but nothing has been confirmed.</p>

If you’ve been enjoying <em>Blue Prince</em> with a friend, definitely link up to work your mind and reflexes to the fullest in <em>Full Metal Furies</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="h106257"><a id=""></a>2: <em>The Witness</em></h2><p>The surprisingly divisive puzzle adventure <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-witness-the-kotaku-review-1754919626&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-witness-the-kotaku-review-1754919626"><em>The Witness</em></a></span> is here for two reasons. For starters, it features an open world filled with line puzzles, and it’s up to you to figure out the rules to each of them. Sometimes these are straightforward, other times they can absolutely boggle your mind. Either way, it should appeal to those hungry for another puzzler after putting down <em>Blue Prince</em>.</p><p>The second reason is that <em>The Witness</em> actually has a full fan-made parody game called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985690/The_Looker/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985690/The_Looker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Looker</em></a></span>, which is tailored made for people who both love and hate Thekla, inc’s<em> </em>puzzler. This spoof is even on Steam for free, so you got no excuse not to check it out!</p><hr><h2 id="h106258"><a id=""></a>3: <em>Outer Wilds</em></h2><p>It might not be a roguelike, but <em>Outer Wilds</em> is one of the closest approximations you’ll find to the feel of <em>Blue Prince</em>. It’s a space exploration game that offers you enormous freedom as you dive deep into every corner of the solar system. Just like <em>Blue Prince</em>, the key here is to gather information as you piece together solutions to puzzles and the history of the civilization that came before you. You’ll even split your game time between “runs” of <em>Outer Wilds</em> just as each in-game day marks a new beginning in <em>Blue Prince</em>, even if the context is a bit different between the two.</p><p>I could say more, but fans of this one have made it very clear that the first rule of talking about <em>Outer Wilds</em> is that you don’t talk about <em>Outer Wilds </em>until all parties involved have finished it. So I recommend you play <em>Outer Wilds</em> to ensure that you can enjoy <em>Outer Wilds</em> related conversations in the future.</p><hr><h2 id="h106259"><a id=""></a>4: <em>Inscryption</em></h2><p>If <em>Blue Prince </em>was the moment you realized you like roguelikes, you should know that there are enough good games in the genre for you to play for, conservatively speaking, the next 8000 years. But if I had to pick just one to recommend, then know that you can’t go wrong with <em>Inscryption</em>.</p><p>At first glance, <em>Inscryption </em>isa card battler a la <em>Slay the Spire</em> and countless others. But as is the case with anything made by the guy who gave us <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pony-island-is-one-seriously-twisted-game-1751138242&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pony-island-is-one-seriously-twisted-game-1751138242"><em>Pony Island</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-murder-mystery-where-the-suspects-are-different-video-1829121840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-murder-mystery-where-the-suspects-are-different-video-1829121840"><em>Hex</em></a></span>, there’s something much more sinister (and metatextual) lurking beneath the surface. </p><p>You can actually find the creator of <em>Inscryption</em> endorsing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Blue Prince</em></a></span> directly on the game’s Steam Page—he’s even listed in the Special Thanks section of the credits! Even if that’s a <em>very</em> tenuous connection between these two games, I’m sure <em>Blue Prince</em>’s creator would be very happy if you enjoyed the rich atmosphere of <em>Inscryption</em> too.</p><hr><h2 id="h106260"><a id=""></a>5: <em>Animal Well</em></h2><p>I’ve done my best to avoid the term “Metroidbrainia” so far, but <em>Animal Well</em> makes that task impossible. It’s a literal puzzle-focused Metroidvania that rewards out-of-the-box thinking, and you may even find yourself taking notes as you venture deeper into this game’s depths.</p><p><br>Where it gets especially <em>Blue Prince</em>-esque is in its layered design. Getting to the credits in <em>Animal Well</em> is a great accomplishment, but you’ll also see the signs leading you to dig deeper into the game’s secrets. And the more you peel away at each of the game’s layers, you’ll continue to find devious puzzles and new tools that will change the way you look at the sidescrolling world. <em>Animal Well</em> probably won’t occupy over a hundred hours of your time in the way Dogubomb’s game does. But if you’re eager for another rabbit hole to fall into, you’ll have a great time with this.  </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/games-like-blue-prince-roguelike-puzzle-inscryption-1851785833]]></content:encoded>
