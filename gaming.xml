            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/more-playstation-layoffs-reported-by-software-development-team-member/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Layoffs have hit another PlayStation studio, though it is not a game development team but a software development team. The news was reported by Oscar Diaz, Senior Design Technologist at PlayStation since October 2020, where he worked on 'Building tools and processes that help the UX group at PlayStation push the boundaries of play.' Diaz, one of the affected employees, <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@whoisryosuke/113953245919633944" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote on Mastodon</a>:</p>
<p><em>Most of my team was just laid off from PlayStation. It was a dream to get to work with Sony on the platform I'd grown up playing since the PS1 and contribute to the PS5, Portal, PSVR2, PS App, and future consoles. If you know anyone who needs an engineer experienced with native console UI, feel free to reach out.</em></p>
<p>Sony's PlayStation division has recently laid off several employees, including some at Sony Bend following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancellation of their live service project</a> (which got canceled alongside a God of War live service game in development at Bluepoint). A few months ago, we reported on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closures</a> of Firewalk, maker of the live service Concord game, and Neon Koi, which was going to port PlayStation franchises to mobile devices. Earlier in 2024, around a year ago, PlayStation <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-lays-off-8-of-playstation-workforce-london-studio-closed-guerrilla-naughty-dog-insomniac-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut 8% of its total workforce</a>, shutting down the London studio and even laying off employees at acclaimed studios like Guerrilla Games, Naughty Dog, and Insomniac Games. In July 2024, PlayStation subsidiary Bungie laid off 220 employees, too.</p>
<p>Of course, this is far from a PlayStation-specific issue. 2024 was terrible across the whole industry, and 2025 isn't shaping up to be any better. Layoffs <a href="https://wccftech.com/unknown-9-awakening-developer-hit-with-layoffs-after-games-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit Reflector Entertainment</a> after the failure of Unknown 9: Awakening, and the same goes for Phoenix Labs, developer of Dauntless and Fae Farm, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/phoenix-labs-fae-farm-developer-lays-off-majority-of-the-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to let go of most of the studio</a>. BioWare was <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shrunk down to less than a hundred employees</a> following the commercial underperformance of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid off 185 employees</a>, including the shutdown of the Leamington studio.</p>

			<p>This morning, Paradox Interactive <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-acquires-haemimont-games,c4101380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a binding agreement to acquire formerly independent developer Haemimont Games, which will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Paradox. The current leadership and team will remain active with the studio, and the studio’s ongoing projects will remain in development. The acquisition consists of an upfront cash payment and a similar sized performance-based earn-out to be paid over the coming years. Haemimont Games and Paradox have agreed not to disclose the purchase price at this time. The acquisition will be financed with cash on hand and is expected to close within a few days.</p>
<p>Haemimont Games is headquartered in Sofia, Bulgaria. Over the years, they've made games in several different genres, though most of them were in the strategy and simulation niche. Haemimont released Tropico 3, 4, and 5, the city-building game Surviving Mars, the action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/victor-vran-overkill-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victor Vran</a>, the survival simulation game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranded-alien-dawn-leaves-early-access-on-april-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stranded: Alien Dawn</a>, and most recently, the well-received tactical roleplaying game Jagged Alliance 3, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/jagged-alliance-3-unexpendables/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received an 8.5 score here on Wccftech</a>.</p>
<p>Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox, stated:</p>
<p><em>We are very happy to welcome Haemimont Games to Paradox! They bring a tight-knit team with long experience in developing management games with many well received projects in their portfolio. Moreover, they have a strong creative streak, technology developed for their niche, a new IP in development and a strong culture that fits Paradox’s way of working. We have strong faith in their team and leadership, and our main focus now is to ensure that they can continue to create great games under new ownership.</em></p>
<p>Gabriel Dobrev, Founder of Haemimont Games, added:</p>
<p><em>We're delighted to become a part of the Paradox family! The cultural fit between our companies is remarkable, and we already feel at home. This partnership empowers us to push the boundaries of our games, delivering deeper and more intense experiences to our players. It also opens new horizons for our team, technology, and creative processes, which we're eager to explore. Expect amazing new games from us!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-20-is-on-the-horizon-says-ea-boss-but-it-probably-wont-happen-until-after-battlefield-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sci-fi battle royale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> is due a "meaningful update" , according to the CEO of Electronic Arts, something he's called "Apex 2.0". To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game's name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it's not clear if that's exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind. Or at least what they're prepared to tell folks in a financial report.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>CEO Andrew Wilson made the comments in <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf">an earnings call</a> for EA's quarterly financial results, the sad phone call where numbers go to be interrogated. </p>
<p>"[On] a longer-term time horizon, there will be an even bigger, more meaningful update to that broader game experience. An Apex 2.0, if you will. This will not be the final incarnation of Apex," he said. </p>
<p>The Apex update "will probably happen after a Battlefield launch," he added. A reference to the the as-yet untitled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, which the publisher has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-crumbling-warzones-are-teased-in-a-promo-vid-calling-for-playtesters">teasing recently</a>. Elsewhere in the call Wilson said that wartorn shooter is expected to launch before April 2026.  </p><p>Previously, Wilson dismissed the idea of a "2.0" version of the game, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-ceo-pushes-back-against-the-idea-of-an-apex-20-to-solve-its-issues-after-the-titles-disappointing-quarter">Gamesindustry.biz</a>. But it looks like he feels differently now? Ah, the winds of business are ever swooshing. Despite Apex Legends still being one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">best battle royales</a>, EA aren't content with how the first-person shooter has been doing in recent times, it seems. </p>
<p>"We've had over 200 million people play the game," said Wilson. "However, the trajectory of the business of that franchise has not been headed in the direction that we have wanted for some time.</p>
<p>"[We] continue to try and test and develop more great content for that community. And I would say we have seen some progress in that, but probably not as much as we would have liked."</p>
<p>Of course, none of that means Apex Legends is going anywhere. The company still sees the series as a valuable bit of corpo-loot. Wilson himself says that "franchises that exist at this level and have this much fan love don't come along all that often."</p><p>Since appearing in 2019, Apex has gone through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/5-years-of-apex-legends-how-surreal-success-became-a-fight-to-stay-fresh">many years</a> of updates, changes, and additions. It recently added a throwback mode which simply reminded our James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-is-revisiting-the-past-but-it-should-be-prouder-of-its-present">how much better it got over time</a>. When I learned that Respawn were developing a battle royale all those years ago, my first thought was: "God, not another one". But it turned out to be my favourite in the entire genre. Whatever happens to Apex next, it's probably worth watching.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Capcom is shutting down its online multiplayer game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-reverse">Resident Evil Re:Verse</a>.</p>
<p>The spin-off game comes packaged with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> on PC via Steam, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, but from 3rd March it will be removed from online stores, as will its purchasable DLC.</p>
<p>Then, on 29th June 2025 23:59 PDT (that's 30th June 8:59 BST), the service will fully shut down.</p>

<p>"Resident Evil Re:Verse was developed in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Resident Evil series, and your overwhelming support for the game has far exceeded our expectations since the time of its release," reads a <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/reverse/us/topic/topic_250206.html">statement from Capcom</a>.</p>
<p>"Now that we've reached a new turning point for the series, we feel that Resident Evil Re:Verse has served its original, celebratory purpose admirably.</p>
<p>"We are incredibly grateful for your warm support for Resident Evil Re:Verse, and we deeply apologise for bringing you this disappointing news."</p>
<p>Any RP Boosters or content unlocked in the game's Premium Pass will be available from now until servers are shut off.</p>
<p>Though originally intended to release alongside Resident Evil Village, Re:Verse was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-reverse-resurfaces">delayed multiple times</a> before eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-reverse-has-a-new-october-release-date">releasing in October 2022</a> with Village's Winters Expansion DLC - that was 17 months after Village.</p>
<p>That means Re:Verse has lasted just over two years.</p>
<p>The game was a six-player deathmatch competitive multiplayer mode featuring various characters from across the Resident Evil universe.</p>
<p>Village was followed by the remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>, which is now the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-now-the-fastest-selling-resident-evil-game-in-history">fastest-selling game in the series</a>.</p>
<p>As for the next new game in the series, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> director Koshi Nakanishi stated last July a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">fresh installment is in development</a>. "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said. "But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>2K Games has removed Michael Condrey, founder and president of developer 31st Union, from his position within the studio. The news comes&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Kotaku</a>, which also says the main reason is the lack of player interest in their debut title, Project ETHOS, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/2k-announces-project-ethos-a-new-f2p-third-person-hero-shooter-with-roguelike-elements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its unveiling in October 2024</a>.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean 2K is shutting down the studio or the game. A spokesperson told Kotaku:</p>
<p><em>We are grateful to Michael Condrey for the dedication, passion, and work ethic it took to build an incredible team and shape the vision of 31st Union. Michael will be transitioning his role in the short term to focus on advising on the future of Project ETHOS. We remain very committed to the forward path for Project ETHOS and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio.</em></p>
<p>Michael Condrey was the Game Director (alongside Bret Robbins, who recently made <a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-of-aveum-director-says-sales-have-improved-lately-story-isnt-written-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortals of Aveum</a>) in Visceral's acclaimed Dead Space. Later, he co-founded Sledgehammer Games with fellow Dead Space creator Glen Schofield, where he worked on multiple Call of Duty games. For example, he directed 2017's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-wwii-a-shot-away-greatness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty WWII</a>. Later, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/31st-union-michael-condrey-2k-ambitious-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined 2K to found 31st Union</a> in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>As for Project ETHOS, the game was described as a free-to-play third-person hero shooter mixed with roguelike elements. These come in the form of Evolutions, powerful semi-randomized upgrades that are unique to each Hero. Evolutions can transform a sniper into a melee skirmisher or a support role into a powerful lone wolf. The roguelike elements mean that players take on the competition with new skills, stakes, and challenges every time they play, according to 31st Union.</p>
<p>The game will also include an extraction mode called Trials, which was described as an ongoing, persistent battle to collect cores, extract and unlock powerful Augments. There's also a built-in risk versus reward mechanic where players can either play it safe with the cores or risk everything to get to the top spot.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Chernobylite 2 Releases in Early Access in Just One Month]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/chernobylite-2-early-access-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chernobylite-2-releases-in-early-access-in-just-one-month.1101663/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/chernobylite-2-early-access-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been revealed by Farm 51 that Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone will be released on PC in early access on March 6, 2025. This surprise announcement came just weeks after a new trailer that perfectly showcases everything this post-apocalyptic-style game has to offer, from a massive open world to branching character development options.</p>



<p>The first Chernobylite game was released in 2019 and flew under the radar for a bit. It was a first-person survival game with exploration options left and right, plus a base-building ecosystem and some intense combat mechanics. While the first game is available on all platforms, Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone is entering early access exclusively on PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-zone">Enter the Zone</h2>



<p>I’m coming into Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone hot off an irradiated spree through games like STALKER 2 and Fallout, and I love it. I’m a huge fan of the first game, which looks phenomenal and offers a top-tier story and some interesting features, and I can’t wait for the second game to enter early access.</p>



<p>Chernobylite 2 has already been a hit with investors. This Kickstarter-backed title has secured 170% of what it was aiming for to bring the game to market, and there’s still a week left in the campaign. If you pledge to support the game, you’ll get access to both a beta and demo version of the game. </p>



<p>Here’s the most recent trailer for Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>On Kickstarter, Chernobylite 2 has secured $168,400 (at the time of publishing) out of a goal of $98,678. The most exciting stretch goal hit so far introduces first-person combat to the game. In a twist, Chernobylite 2 breaks away from the first-person exclusive perspective of the 2019 opening title and opts to use a third-person perspective.</p>



<p>But now, thanks to those backing the game, you’ll be able to switch whenever you want.</p>



<p>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone also offers fully open-world exploration, while the first game focused on smaller, more confined ‘regions’ that you could jump in and out of.</p>



<p>I’m ready for Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone – it enters early access on Steam on March 6, 2025. Are you going to give it a try? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/only-23-of-developers-believe-they%E2%80%99ve-conducted-%E2%80%98enough%E2%80%99-qa-for-new-games.1101654/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gaming-qa-developers-not-enough/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent study published by modl.ai, it was revealed that a whopping 77% of developers polled felt like they didn’t conduct enough QA for their studio’s most recent releases. Additionally, 50% of developers surveyed felt that QA budgets aren’t ‘growing fast enough’ to keep up with the ‘increasing complexity of modern games’.</p>



<p>The study was pieced together to take stock of the quality control ecosystem in the world of gaming development. It was focused primarily on gauging the adoption and anticipation of artificial intelligence in QA processes and procedures.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-ready-but-released">Not Ready But Released</h2>



<p>In recent years, we’ve seen some big-budget games released in a woeful state. More than a few titles have hit the open market in a paltry condition, boasting bugs across the board and performance issues left and right.</p>



<p>Last year, STALKER 2 was released to an eager reception but it was hampered by a stack of bugs – particularly on console platforms. In 2020, Cyberpunk 2077 was released in such a bad state that it faced legal concerns from investors.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insights.modl.ai/state-of-games-qa-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published by modl.ai</a>, it was revealed that 94% of developers (extrapolated) believe that AI will ‘play an important role in the future of game QA’. But with that being said, it comes as a surprise that just 18% of developers feel they’re ‘fully prepared to implement AI in all QA processes’.</p>



<p>They recognise that it’s the future of QA and testing, but they’re not ready to adopt it just yet.</p>



<p>In the numbers, 70.3% of survey respondents said they’d never launched a bug-free game.</p>



<p>In a statement on the data, Dajana Dimovska, the CEO of Indium Play, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’re never going to catch every bug, but AI can get you closer. It can take on early testing responsibilities, reducing the need for large QA teams throughout the production phase.</p>



<p>As the game reaches a more playable and polished state, manual QA testers step in — working alongside AI to identify and address quality issues. This collaboration between experienced testers and AI ensures a better final product.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many are ready to place stock in the implementation of AI-based QA. In one slide in the report from modl.ai, it was revealed that 21% of developers feel that AI testing is much more effective than traditional methods.</p>



<p>Presently, the blockers preventing industry-wide adoption include the complexity of setting up and operating AI-based systems, the costs of doing so, and the resistance to change – and fear of facing redundancy.</p>



<p>Do you think more AI in QA processes would eliminate more bugs ahead of launch? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you think.</p>

<p>Later in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll be tasked with getting a treasury key before a big raid can take place. It’s one of the most important steps in the run-up to one of the game’s most major missions, so it cannot be avoided. It’s simple – <strong>you need that key</strong>.</p>



<p>However, when it comes to trying to find Vavak’s key, you’ll most likely have a hard time given the size of the search area and the lack of direction towards where it might be. In this guide, I’ll tell you where and how to find Vavak’s key in Oratores, the all-important mission in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-vavak-s-key">How to Find Vavak’s Key</h2>



<p>Despite chatting with Christian in the guarded building in Kuttenberg, you’ll likely be searching the place for ages trying to find Vavak’s key. He doesn’t know where it is, either – it’s up to you to track it down.</p>



<p>Now, you could spend the next few minutes probing the building and the search area in a desperate attempt to find the critical key, or you could follow this guide and find it in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>Firstly, you’ll need to get past the guards at the front of the building. If you have a high enough charisma level (and other skills are assigned), you can pass a skill check and you’ll simply be granted access to the site. It’ll surprise Christian, who is already inside, but if you did his earlier missions and aligned amicably with him, it won’t be a concern.</p>



<p>Otherwise, expect trouble – and more speech checks.</p>



<p>Now that you’re in the building, you’ll learn that Vavak has fled, but there’s a chance that the key might have been left behind. However, this building has several floors and rooms, along with plenty of chests and hidden nooks and crannies – it’ll take <strong>forever</strong> to search everything – and not everyone knows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-lockpick-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/">how to pick locks</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t</strong> do that.</p>



<p>Instead, head to the ground floor and out the back door, making a beeline for the toilet that sits in the rear courtyard of the building. Inside the toilet (yes, <strong>inside</strong>) you’ll find a key sticking out of a pile of waste. That’s where Vavak’s key is in Oratores – simple.</p>



<p>Once you’ve got the key, you’ll need to wash up in a trough, otherwise people will notice your stink. But that’s it – that’s how to find Vavak’s key in Oratores. Have fun!</p>

                <p>With the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s newest episode, Heresy, comes a brand-new way to earn loot. This time, players will be headed back to the Dreadnaught orbiting Saturn to hunt for secrets and special rewards in the Nether. Here's how it works and how players can earn rewards, including secret loot stashes.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Limited revives, ammo and health regen</h2><p dir="ltr">Nether delves are different from other activities in that player groups will have limited revives and health regeneration is disabled, meaning that players do not have passive healing after being out of combat for several seconds. Instead, enemies will drop white orbs that give back health, and all other healing effects, such as Support Frame auto rifles, Warlock Healing Rifts, and the Void Devour buff can still take effect. Special and Heavy ammo drops are also significantly reduced in this activity and can only be affected by weapon perks, armor mods, and shooting destructible pots to find more ammo.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to complete objectives in the Nether</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439535-destiny2heresy-netherboss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439535" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439535-destiny2heresy-netherboss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439535"></a><figcaption>A Tormentor boss in Destiny 2 channels some unknown power.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439535-destiny2heresy-netherboss.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When players first spawn into the Nether activity, they will notice objectives like "Destroy Weapon Systems" on the HUD. It's not immediately obvious what these are, but upon pulling out the Ghost, the HUD will show a diamond on-screen where the next objective is. Usually, these objectives will be guarded by a yellow-bar enemy with a name and a quick objective to complete around it.</p><p dir="ltr">Objectives can range from collecting pickups to defeating a miniboss, depending on which objectives were drawn for the run. They can be any of the following, or a combination of these:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Defend an objective by standing on plates or marked areas and defeating waves of incoming enemies that culminate in a miniboss.</li><li dir="ltr">Depositing relics that come from floating objects scattered around the room into a receptacle like a statue. These are marked on the HUD.</li><li dir="ltr">Popping large orange spores that glow. Typically, these are on walls and corners and they glow bright orange and pulsate. Players can deal damage to these with any weapon.</li><li dir="ltr">Defeating a large Tormentor boss protected by a small objective like destroying Taken Blights or picking up Resonance nodes.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Simply perform the objective and then collect Boons and loot at the end of each minor objective. When all three sub-objectives are complete, the boss will be vulnerable. The boss will usually consist of invincibility phases where players need to collect or destroy an object in the arena to make the boss vulnerable again. The Nether run will end upon defeating the boss, and loot will come from the last chest at the end.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to find secret loot in the Nether</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439536-destiny2heresy-essentiapickup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439536" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439536-destiny2heresy-essentiapickup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439536"></a><figcaption>A node of Fleeting Metastasized Essentia in Destiny 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439536-destiny2heresy-essentiapickup.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are tons of small secrets scattered around the Nether, including hidden loot and special collectibles. There are chests hidden around the entire location in corners and secret rooms that can reward materials for the Tome of Want, a seasonal armor piece, or a seasonal weapon. Here is everything that can be earned in a chest in Act 1:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Any piece of Apostate’s Blade armor; Arms, chest, legs, or class item.</li><li dir="ltr">Adamantite, a Strand Support Frame auto rifle.</li><li dir="ltr">Psychopomp, an Area Denial Frame grenade launcher.</li><li dir="ltr">Abyssal Edge, a Wave Frame heavy sword.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are also Metastasized Essentia nodes, large black and white spiked orbs that can be picked up for materials for the Shaping Mirror in Eris' apartment in the H.E.L.M. When picked up, they are first seen as Fleeting Metastasized Essentia.</p><p dir="ltr">These can be lost upon wiping in the Nether by running out of Revives or if players disconnect during a run. Only at the end of a Nether run will these turn into Metastasized Essentia that can be kept and used. Take a stack of 10 Essentia to the Taken Altar to Eris Morn’s apartment, which looks like a small stone pillar with a black orb in it next to a shelf, and you will be rewarded with the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">At least two reprised weapons</li><li dir="ltr">A stack of 10 Essence of Desire</li><li dir="ltr">Enhancement Cores and or Enhancement Prisms</li></ul><p dir="ltr">If players want to check out how to get more rewards during Episode Heresy, check out how they should use the Shaping Slab and the Tome of Want for gear curating and extra buffs in the Nether.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-art-of-wild-bastards-a-very-good-looking-video-game.1101489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wild-bastards-blue-manchu-art<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm sorry,<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it's been way too long since we ran a Platform blog</a>! So let's make amends by looking at one of the prettiest games of 2024, <em>Wild Bastards</em>, and chatting with the folks responsible for said prettiness.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/luke-plunkett-aftermath-game-of-the-year-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wild Bastards</em> made my Games Of The Year list for several reasons</a>, but for Platform blog purposes it definitely helped that it was a continuation of developers Blue Manchu's commitment, across 2019's <em>Void Bastards</em> and now this, to an art style that's instantly recognisable for its sharp lines, memorable character designs and bold colours.</p><p>To learn more about how the game's visuals came together, I spoke with Blue Manchu's three artists: Ben Lee, Dean Walsh and Irma Walker.</p><p><strong>BEN LEE</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Ben served as Creative Director on the game, but indie dev being indie dev, he was also unofficially everything from art director to concept artist to a 2D illustrator.</p><p>Lee says that, as Creative Director, his chief influences came from about where you'd expect a game that looks like this to have come from. In video game terms, Lucasarts' classic <em>Outlaws</em>--a 90's first-person shooter that employed 2D sprites for its enemies in a 3D space, just like <em>Wild Bastards</em>--was of course a big inspiration, but Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns also played their part.</p><figure></figure><p>"<em>Void Bastards</em> was very focused around looking like a literal comic page come to life", Lee tells Aftermath. "<em>Wild Bastards</em> moved away from this completely and leant more in a film/animation direction. It's much more widescreen and hyper-saturated looking.</p><p>"Given that I design the visuals in our games, and in most cases hand draw them myself, this means that the way I draw kind of naturally ties the games together, even when I don't necessarily want it to."</p><p>While Lee both designed <em>and</em> animated the enemies in <em>Void Bastards</em>, this time around the game's increased roster of bad guys meant some of that work was handed off to animation studio Look Mom Productions (part of Blue Ant), a shift that he says gave <em>Wild Bastards</em> its own "unique look".</p><figure><figcaption>"My favorite piece is the illustration that we eventually used for the game's cover. It sums up everything I wanted to see in this game", Lee says.</figcaption></figure><hr><p><strong>DEAN WALSH</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Dean Walsh was 3D Art Lead and Technical Artist on <em>Wild Bastards</em>. "I designed and implemented the asset pipelines for building and importing all the art", he tells Aftermath. "With such a unique game that tends to be a bit more involved; at Blue Manchu we model the 'linework' as geometry rather than as 2D textures applied to the surface of a 3D mesh like you would see with most games. I ended up building most of the shaders too, which define how the light and colour mixes."</p><p>Pointing out that both <em>Void Bastards</em> and <em>Wild Bastards</em> have a superficially similar look, I asked if the team has a label or firm structure for it. Nope, turns out it's just...vibes. "I wish we had a term but so far we tend to be describing it more project by project, because, while similar games, they certainly have different approaches."</p><figure></figure><p>"<em>Wild Bastards</em> is built around a dynamic sun-based light which also works with our inverted line work, so the lines when shaded swap to colour to give the unique shadow look. <em>Void Bastards</em> was much tighter sight lines, more black and all top-down lit via a dynamic low res light map, I was hand cutting in detail in shadows for that."</p><p>I asked Walsh if there was a single piece of work he did for the game that he was most proud of. "The enemy shader uses a second texture that we generate; it does a few things like tell the shader where they glow but also uses a thing called a signed distance field. This is a gradient that can make those lines thicker or thinner based on how far away they are in the level."</p><figure><figcaption>This is the effect Dean is talking about, where the ink lines surrounding enemies and buildings maintain their clarity over different distances</figcaption></figure><p>"It's a small thing but it keeps enemies from getting softer or less defined, since all the lines in the world do the same thing, so they look as if they are all inked in a comic with the same pen. As a non programmer and very much an artist, being able to fumble the tech to make stuff look the way we want is always a nice surprise."</p><hr><p><strong>IRMA WALKER</strong></p><figure></figure><p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>Walker was first brought onto the project to help out on some buildings. "Ultimately these would be deemed too bland to stay as they were", she says, "so as I continued working there my role expanded to creating models based on Ben's concepts and my own ideas, and running passes on the buildings to make them a bit more interesting."</p><p>From there, she worked on a bit of everything. "Our roles on the team were usually pretty flexible, we were such a small collection of people that we'd usually end up branching out to handle whatever needed doing; my title was 'Artist' but I would occasionally handle QA and was the go-to for a lot of the fiddly little tasks nobody really wanted to be doing (like checking sprites for tiny errors and hooking them up in-game).”</p><figure></figure><p>"The sawmill (pictured above, far right) is a really fantastic example of the dedication of our entire team to make the game as visually exciting as it could possibly be. As you can see, the first iteration of our big barn (far left) was not terribly exciting. It definitely did the job of being a big barn, but the details were very uniform, the space not terribly unique to run around in, and the model itself--by the nature of being built of a lot of individual pieces--was a bit haphazard and lacked cohesion."</p><figure></figure><p>"Over time we ended up basically re-working every single building and small model in the game. It took time, and added months to the game's production, but I feel like the extra effort was absolutely worth it. The big barn was also used as the base of the Sawmill, which ended up being one of my favourite models I worked on, and really contributed to the really handcrafted, cohesive and visually engaging style we shipped the game with. To me, it all demonstrates the value of iteration. Just because something 'works fine' doesn't mean you shouldn't play around with it; sometimes even small changes can make a drastic difference!"</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, Valve has a notice designed to warn Steam users when they visit an early access game’s store page if it’s been a minute since the last update. If the dev’s lofty goals for a 1.0 release were a little too lofty, then it’s probably time to do some due diligence before spending money on what may be abandonware.</p><p>Valve hasn’t formally announced the feature, but both <em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-includes-a-warning-flagging-potentially-abandoned-early-access-games">Eurogamer</a> </em>and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-now-warns-you-if-that-early-access-game-youre-eyeing-up-has-been-abandoned-by-its-devs/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a> point it out as first highlighted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhgj6fphkx2y">SteamDB</a>. One example where you can see this warning in action is the store listing for <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F321830%2FCavern_Kings%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Cavern Kings</em></a>, which flags that its developers have not updated the game in over eight years.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>A screenshot of the </em>Cavern Kings<em> store page on Steam shows its warning to players that it’s likely abandoned.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>That’s probably long enough to safely say the game is abandoned (though the developer has since worked on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1184760%2FShovel_Knight_Pocket_Dungeon%2F" rel="sponsored">another title</a>). On the other hand, Pirate Software’s <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F567380%2FHeartbound%2F" rel="sponsored">Heartbound</a></em> currently has a warning for not being updated in 13 months. And the recent “mostly negative” user reviews track with that. But the developer just <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F567380%2Fview%2F516325480311292020" rel="sponsored">posted an update note</a> in January to explain the hiatus, and also <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F567380%3Femclan%3D103582791458518140%26emgid%3D508445172204307048" rel="sponsored">dropped a patch days ago</a> on February 1st. So, this may not be a fully fleshed-out or foolproof feature just yet.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
