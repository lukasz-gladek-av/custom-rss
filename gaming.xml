			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">officially has a release date</a>, but it's not the one players had expected. It'll arrive on current-gen consoles on May 26, 2026, as Rockstar and Take-Two confirmed that GTA VI was delayed outside its initial Fall 2025 release window.</p>
<p>Despite Rockstar having a history of delaying its biggest games at least once or twice before they finally release, Take-Two boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-still-scheduled-to-release-this-fall-take-two-full-expects-to-support-the-nintendo-switch-2/">Strauss Zelnick's stalwart reassurances</a> that Grand Theft Auto VI would release in Fall 2025 had plenty of fans believing that this time would be different. And while it very well could have been, a comment from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier indicates that Rockstar knew this delay would happen for some time now.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x">BlueSky,</a> Schreier indicates that, per conversations he's had with Rockstar employees, there has been no real chance of Grand Theft Auto VI releasing in Fall 2025 "<em>for a very long time now</em>."</p>
<p>The uplifting part to this is that Rockstar developers knew the delay was coming not just because it would have been too much work to get it done by Fall 2025, but because there's actually what Schreier describes as "<em>a real desire</em>" from Rockstar to not put the development team through an awful period of crunch.</p>
<p>"<em>Nobody I've talked to at Rockstar has believed Fall 2025 was a real window for a very long time now,</em>" Schreier wrote. "<em>Too much work, not enough time, and what appears to be a real desire from management to avoid brutal crunch. </em><em>GTA VI slipping to 2026 has seemed inevitable for months if not longer.</em>"</p>
<p>Avoiding putting the development team through an awful crunch phase and ensuring they have the time to make GTA VI as good as possible, without burning themselves out, is a solid reason for delaying. If Rockstar has turned that corner on crunch, it can hopefully be a strong example for other studios to follow.</p>

The repercussions of this announcement is seismic and far-reaching in ways we have yet to see, and will have major consequences not just for third-party game prices, but likely PlayStation consoles as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is not an exaggeration to say this is the most expensive gaming has been since the 1990s. Microsoft announced that its lowest tier console, the Xbox Series S with a little over 500GB of storage now costs $380 USD. That’s less than $20 cheaper than a PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Astro Bot bundle on the PlayStation store. The 2TB Xbox Series X is now $729, which is about $30 more expensive than a PS5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox move is on the heels of Nintendo’s Switch 2 announcement, which created waves not only <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/industry-analysts-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-chaos-due-to-tariffs-we-are-living-in-unhinged-times">due to the console price of $450 for the Switch 2</a> itself, but the $80 price tag on certain first-party games like Mario Kart World. Nintendo, which previously priced its games at $60, skipped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-full-priced-first-party-games-will-be-70">the $70 mark drawn by Xbox and PlayStation</a> at the start of this generation (which in itself caused huge uproar) and went straight to $80. Now Xbox will follow that lead this holiday when first party Xbox games will also hit that threshold, and it’s hard to believe the price increases will stop there.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Will PlayStation Games Increase to $80?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on Sony to see whether it will follow the path led by Nintendo and Xbox, but I’m almost certain it’ll announce price hikes in the coming weeks. The rising cost of manufacturing and the tariffs from the US Trade War means that Sony must raise prices just to deal with the economic realities of the world today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hypothetically, even if Sony were less impacted by the tariffs than Microsoft — which is almost certainly the reason why Xbox raised prices — Sony has the more successful hardware, and to not raise prices in the face of competition from both Xbox and Nintendo is leaving money on the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But more than console prices, it’s even more certain that Sony will raise the price of its first-party PlayStation games. The company has repeatedly touted the inherent value of its games line-up as a valuable experience worth a premium. There is no world in which Sony views its first-party games as being worth less than Xbox first-party games given their continued critical and commercial success. So if Xbox is raising first-party game prices, I think Sony will too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s even precedent for Sony’s steadfast belief in the value of its first-party IP. The company stood by its decision to release Housemarque’s last game, Returnal, at $70 despite widespread criticism from fans who’ve previously known Housemarque for delivering great-but-smaller experiences direct to digital. Knowing what we know about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-pressured-its-studios-to-make-big-cuts-amid-increasing-development-costs"><u>how much it even costs to make Sony’s biggest first-party games</u></a>, an $80 price tag feels inevitable.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Death of Physical Games</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the increase in console and game prices, the price hikes reflect an opportunity for corporations to fast-track something they’ve been working towards for a long time: A move to subscription services and digital games, and the end of physical media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Digital games and subscription services owned and operated by platform holders like PlayStation and Xbox earn more in revenue than physical media and used game sales. That is why PlayStation and Xbox have made such heavy investments into promoting services like PlayStation Plus and especially Xbox Game Pass. As far as we know, Xbox Game Pass is not receiving a price hike (it did of course <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say"><u>go up in price the middle of 2024</u></a>), and with Xbox games soon to be $80, its value for the price-conscious consumer may as well have increased given the savings subscribing to Game Pass earns compared to buying even a single first-party Xbox game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a lover of physical media, I’ve been watching this trend of funneling users towards digital services and sales with dismay, and the price hikes on physical media might take us towards an all-digital future even faster than anticipated by anyone.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What Does This Mean for GTA 6 and Everyone Else?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The handbreaks are well and truly off. Even before the trade war and since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2023, the games industry has had to reckon with declining profits and increasing development costs. Questions around whether the current pricing of games and consoles were sustainable began to circulate among industry insiders and analysts, and they have now manifested in higher costs for consoles like the PlayStation 5 Pro and Switch 2, as well as first-party games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With first-party companies firmly moving towards raising its prices, the likely final signal to confirm whether this pricing increase is a blip or a permanent move is GTA 6 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">when it eventually comes out in 2026</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea that Grand Theft Auto 6 could be priced at $100 began as an analyst’s prediction, but quickly gained traction among the wider games industry. After all, with billions of dollars poured into GTA 6’s development, and over a decade of time spent on making the game, Take-Two is looking to maximise profits from what is very easily the most-anticipated game of the decade, perhaps ever. In the past, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has said games are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publisher-ceo-thinks-videogame-prices-are-very-very-low-for-what-they-offer" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>priced “very, very low” compared</u></a> to the value they offer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Rockstar finally reveals the release date for Grand Theft Auto 6 I’m extremely confident it will cost $80 <em>at the minimum</em>. Of course, that doesn’t mean that everything will cost $80 – games like Helldivers 2 and more recently Split Fiction have proved there’s huge interest in lower priced games that fall just outside the traditional triple-A blockbuster sphere – and many will sacrifice playing a game on day one if it means they can pick it up in a sale a few weeks or months down the line. But one thing’s for sure, prices are only going in one direction in the future and for many of us, that means we’ll have to be a little more choosy over what we buy and play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em><br>

What did you expect?"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It was, perhaps, inevitable: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">Rockstar has delayed GTA 6 to May 2026</a>. Confirmation comes from an unceremonious statement that was devoid of launch platforms or any new trailer. Not even a new screenshot accompanied the news.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Rockstar games have been here before, of course. The legendary developer has form when it comes to delaying its games, so this delay to GTA 6 perhaps comes as little surprise. Still, those fans have reacted with a mix of disappointment, relief, and a realization that the internet is now set for another 12 months of rampant, often nonsensical speculation about all things GTA 6.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GTA 6 subreddit</a>, which has been the source of so many of the wild conspiracy theories surrounding the game, its trailers, and when it might come out, has exploded following the news.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Ffs, Fuck Rockstar, at least give us screenshots,” MyNameIsToFuOG said, reflecting a general disappointment that Rockstar failed to soften the blow of GTA 6’s delay without any fresh look at the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>“</strong>At least give us a screenshot, this is ridiculous even for R*,” added Abvk0. “1.5 years of silence just to drop a delay news without even showing us bread crumbs of the game?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At least we have a date now, I don't mind a delay if it means the game is gonna be good,” said the more philosophical bl00nded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s Rockstar bro. What did you expect? Also, I really doubt it will release on May 26, they will delay it more,” said a somewhat concerned Puzzleheaded-Hunt731.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also speculation Rockstar may release GTA 6 on PC at the same time as on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, now the game has been delayed to 2026. “I hope that means that a PC version is also coming in 2026 and not 2027,” said Kiwibom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“2026 console release, late 2027 PC release, 2028 new-gen console release,” predicted Velkoadmiral.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s own commenters had plenty to say about the GTA 6 delay, too, with user BSideleau slamming the console generation thus far in a scathing post:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Surprising no one. It will be a final game of this tepid generation. What a let down. I have never felt more grifted than by Microsoft and Sony this generation. Both consoles are more 0.5 updates from the previous generation than true next gen consoles, yet they expected us to pay MORE for them. Quit letting them get away with it. Demand better.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also plenty of talk about how much GTA 6 will cost. With both Nintendo and Microsoft going to $80 for some of their games, fans are bracing themselves for an $80 GTA 6. Some believe it could cost even more, going up to $100 perhaps, if the new GTA Online is included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its statement, Rockstar said “we look forward to sharing more information with you soon.” Could this mean Trailer 2 isn’t far off? Fans certainly hope so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 isn’t just expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time, fans expect it to be one of the greatest games ever made. Under that enormous pressure, the developers at Rockstar and parent company Take-Two will be desperate to ensure the game launches at the highest possible quality level. With that in mind, this delay feels like it was always going to happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/gta-vi-will-miss-2025-after-all-new-target-is-may-26-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Rockstar's highly anticipated <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will finally launch on May 26, 2026, Rockstar Games said in <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">a Friday morning announcement</a>.</p>
<p>That means the game will miss the "2025" release window that the developer announced alongside <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-confirms-many-things-including-its-florida-vibes/">the game's first trailer in late 2023</a>. That delay is needed, Rockstar said, so the company can use "this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."</p>
<p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected," Rockstar wrote in its announcement. "The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game."</p>
<h2>A long wait gets longer</h2>
<p>While disappointing for franchise fans, today's official announcement of a delay hasn't exactly been unexpected. Insider sources have been reporting that the 2025 release target looked unlikely <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-development-2026-delay-rockstar-office-release-1851359831">for well over a year now</a>.</p>
<p>"Nobody I’ve talked to at Rockstar has believed Fall 2025 was a real window for a very long time now," Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x">wrote on Bluesky</a> this morning. "Too much work, not enough time, and what appears to be a real desire from management to avoid brutal crunch. GTA VI slipping to 2026 has seemed inevitable for months if not longer."</p>
<p>The new planned launch date of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> now falls a full 4,634 days after the Sept. 17, 2013 launch of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. By contrast, there was just a 1,967-day gap between the release of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and the prior release <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em>, which <em>also</em> launched on the PS3 and Xbox 360 on April 29, 2008.</p>

Shares of Take-Two have slid by about 8% so far today to around $219, wiping out billions of market cap for the video game publisher.</p><p>Take-Two anticipated investors having questions about the delay and its impact on the company's financial outlook, so it released a statement reiterating that the company still expects "sequential increases in, and record levels of" net bookings (i.e. revenue) for Fiscal 2026 and Fiscal 2027.</p><p>GTA 6's new release date of May 26, 2026 falls in Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2027 (April 1 2026-March 31 2027). Previously, the game was scheduled to release in Fall 2025, which fell in Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2026 (April 1, 2025-March 31, 2026).</p><p>While GTA 6 is no longer coming this year, Take-Two's labels still have Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4 coming this year, in addition to its roster of sports titles.</p><p>Take-Two will release its next earnings report on May 15, and it's expected the company will face numerous questions about the impact of GTA 6's delay on Take-Two's earnings outlook.</p><p>While Take-Two's share price fell today, it's still up around 80% in the past five years. In February 2025, Take-Two's share price <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-parent-companys-stock-reaches-all-time-high-and-this-could-be-why/1100-6529336/" data-ref-id="1100-6529336">reached a record high</a> following Take-Two's announcement that GTA 6 remained on track for release in 2025 and that the company had exceeded earnings expectations. Now that GTA 6 has been delayed, the stock price is moving in the other direction, at least for now. Stock prices tend to fluctuate significantly during a major news event and then moderate soon after.</p><p>For its part, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said Take-Two "fully" supports Rockstar's decision to take additional time to "realize their creative vision for GTA 6." Reporter Jason Schreier said the delay was in part to help Rockstar's developers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">avoid a "brutal crunch" period</a>.

		<p>On 8th May, Paradox Interactive will reveal their next grand strategy game, dubbed Project Caesar. The reveal will take place at 5PM UK time, 6PM CEST, 12PM ET, 9AM PT, and can be watched here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Caesar - Official Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YaZcN-eVta8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is being created at Studio Tinto, Paradox’s Barcelona-based team that was founded back in 2020 and put under the direction of studio lead Johan Andersson, who’s had an integral role in leading development of many of Paradox’s biggest games through the eras.</p>
<p>Paradox has been lightly previewing the game in a series of Tinto Talks developer diaries, drawing in community feedback on feature ideas, game systems and historical research. Now it’s time to completely unfurl what Project Caesar will be.</p>

<p>So, what will Project Caesar be? Will be it be an original franchise or a sequel to one of Paradox’s main pillars? Being Project Caesar could refer to a Roman period game – last explored by Paradox in 2019’s Imperator: Rome – but that would probably be a bit on the nose. Meanwhile, Hearts of Iron IV is now 9 years old and Europa Universalis IV is coming up on its 12th anniversary.</p>

		<p>It’s not been a great week out in game journalist land, and our thoughts are with the staff at Polygon and Giant Bomb as they work out what might come next. Here at TSA, we’ve continued to play games, and I’ve been getting into Revenge of the Savage Planet, making a start on the extra-terrestrial adventure with a little help from Tef. Alongside that, I’ve continued to play Yakuza: Like a Dragon, which has become my chill-out game, alongside a batch of other things including Mycopunk and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/28/unbeatable-is-a-rhythm-action-narrative-adventure-thats-creating-its-own-genre/">Unbeatable</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> was so early with his WWP, that I forgot to ask everyone else, but he says that, “Following a brief spell in Cyrodiil (I intend to return to Oblivion Remastered in the very near future, mind) I once again picked up my Tantō and Kanabō to finish off Assassin’s Creed Shadows. My impressions remain very much the same though unlocking a few late game abilities and gear perks definitely made combat more interesting. A couple of soft twists kept the story enticing enough for me to see it through, but the ending is somewhat abrupt and predictably open-ended, giving Ubisoft ample opportunity for new storylines and expansions.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2. Of course. He’s not the only one sticking with his gaming happy place though as <strong>Aran</strong> has been playing The Witcher 3 where he’s once again near the end of the main quest. Then he’ll just have Blood &amp; Wine to go. That’s not all though, telling us, “I’ve also started a playthrough of Tell Me Why. Finished the first chapter and I’m intrigued to see what happens next.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has continued to play through Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which he says, “is excellent and also taking ages for me to finish for some reason.”</p>


<p><strong>Ade</strong> has kept things interesting by playing loads of random things! He told us, “Some Bayonetta 2, Mark of the Ninja (probably the best stealth game I’ve every played), a spot of AC Shadows, a little Atomfall, and also two roguelites for review; Kiborg and Spiritfall – phew!”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also had a week made up of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, telling us, “I’ve just finished the first act and it made me feel things.” He continues, “I’ve also spent some time with a couple of indies which should be reviewed for early next week. Finally I’ve now completed all the galaxy challenges in Lego Skywalker and just have the film levels to 100% but my eldest wants to multiplay those so trying to organise the time to do that.”</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been and needed a co-op buddy this week, first with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/28/mycopunk-preview-a-co-op-shooter-for-all-you-fun-guys-out-there/">preview impressions of Mycopunk’s demo</a>, and later with a good dose of Revenge of the Savage Planet. He also shared some hands on thoughts about the modern wargaming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/broken-arrow-preview-would-you-like-to-play-a-wargame/">Broken Arrow.</a></p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung Is Releasing a 3D Monitor That Feels Like a Beefed-Up Nintendo 3DS Screen]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/technology/features/samsung-is-releasing-3d-monitor-that-feels-like-beefed-up-nintendo-3ds-screen</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-is-releasing-a-3d-monitor-that-feels-like-a-beefed-up-nintendo-3ds-screen.1179642/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/technology/features/samsung-is-releasing-3d-monitor-that-feels-like-beefed-up-nintendo-3ds-screen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I remember as a kid, the Nintendo 3DS absolutely floored me. 3D effects could jump out of handheld screens? It was magical, but also something that I couldn't imagine scaling up well.</p>

<p>Then Samsung put forth its new gaming monitor lineup, featuring the Odyssey 3D. This glasses-free monitor presents similarly to the 3DS's top screen but in 4K at 165Hz.</p>

<p>Introduced last year at CES, this screen adds a sense of depth to your games and YouTube videos. It sounded a little gimmicky to me when I first heard about it, so I had to try it out for myself to see if it's worth the hype.</p>



<h2>The Samsung Odyssey 3D Monitor Breaks the Fourth Wall</h2>

<p>I visited Samsung's offices in Bellevue, WA to get some hands-on time with the Odyssey 3D (the G90XF model). Almost immediately, I was surprised by how good the 3D effect looked. It took a second to adjust to my eyes, but once it did, the sense of the depth made me feel like I could reach into the screen, almost like an aquarium or diorama.</p>

<p>With two stereoscopic cameras at the top of the bezel, the monitor tracks your eyes to optimally adjust the parallax effect. Every now and then, I'd look away, then look back, and within seconds the effect readjusted.</p>

<p>I panned my head in all directions around the monitor to test how adaptable the eye tracking was, and as long as I didn't move too fast and was within range, it would maintain the 3D effect.</p>

<p>There's a distinction between the two kinds of games that will work with this monitor though. Some games are co-developed with the Odyssey 3D in mind, like <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/samsung-odyssey-3d-khazan.jpg?itok=tiQlBehz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/samsung-odyssey-3d-khazan.jpg?itok=kfis3896 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's hard to capture with my phone's camera, but the 3D effects really pop out here, especially that giant flower in the foreground.</figcaption></figure><p>The 3D effects stood out to me here, with the snow effects especially looking—and feeling—like I'm looking into a snow globe (with lots blood and action). <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lies-of-p-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Lies of P</em></a> is also slated to receive this co-developed treatment later this summer.</p>

<p>The other kinds of games are certified by Samsung to work with the 3D monitor, though the 3D effect isn't as built into the games. These titles include <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-review" rel="nofollow">Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/palworld-preview" rel="nofollow">Palworld</a></em>, and the <em>Grand Theft Auto Trilogy</em> remasters.</p>

<p>It's hard to describe, but the 3D effect didn't feel as pronounced in the other games I tried out compared to <em>Khazan</em>. It felt more like a filter applied after the fact, instead of something from the ground up. It was still pretty good though, and it made things pop more than it usually would in a more classic experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/samsung-odyssey-3d-goku.jpg?itok=XkGehlxz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/samsung-odyssey-3d-goku.jpg?itok=DsGK00-C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here, with the camera misaligned, it's easy to see "double" here instead of the 3D image that both of your eyes would see in person.</figcaption></figure><p>Within the first year, Samsung is aiming to have 50 3D compatible games on its list (in total of both types). I was hoping to see a strategy game like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/civilization-vii" rel="nofollow"><em>Civilization VII</em></a> on the demo station, since I was curious how that isometric perspective would feel in 3D. But maybe down the line, we'll see it come up.</p>

<p>In addition to gaming, the Odyssey 3D can transform normal videos into 3D using the power of AI. As long as the video doesn't have DRM (e.g. a Netflix stream) and is in full screen, the Realty Lab app can take care of the rest. It can even take stereoscopic videos on YouTube and layer them into one 3D image.</p>

<p>I'd personally want to do more testing with this 3D conversion technology, because for some videos, it worked nicely, like a 4K scene from <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>. For other videos, like a stereoscopic POV rollercoaster, I could see double every now and then instead of a "3D" image.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-screenshot.jpg?itok=OZmZod07 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-screenshot.jpg?itok=fcDPEzNx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could you imagine a game like this in 3D?</figcaption></figure><h2>The Power of 3D Gaming Is Heavy</h2>

<p>For all the games involved, what surprised me the most was the smoothness of the experience. There weren't any noticeable frame-rate dips, and the crisp 4K resolution made everything stand out in high detail. That was something I worried about, since the PC would have to run the game as is and also process the 3D aspect on top of that.</p>

<p>However, I'm also fully aware that the demo station I played on was likely decked out with high-end gear. For an optimal 3D experience at home, Samsung recommends an Intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 1700X or higher, with at least 32GB of DRR5 5600 RAM. For AI video conversion to 3D, you'll specifically need an RTX 3080 or better (sorry AMD fans).</p>

<p>For hardcore PC gamers, these specs might not be too far out of reach, but needless to say, 3D gaming isn't exactly for mass consumption. It's a luxury good for a luxury gamer, if the monitor's $1,999 price tag didn't give that away.</p>



<p>That's where I ultimately get hung up on the Odyssey 3D monitor. Was it a cool experience? Absolutely. Will every major AAA PC game come out with support for this one monitor? Only time will tell, but likely not. Even then, is it worth the high price of entry? That's something only you and your wallet can decide, but personally, I'm not sure it is.</p>

<p>When you look at what else you can buy for $2,000 in the PC gaming space—a new VR headset, a GPU upgrade, a nicer gaming chair—it's hard to justify a monitor that does a gimmick very well but only for a certain selection of games.</p>

<p>Even in the monitor market, some of the best competitors out there cost less than half of the Odyssey 3D and offer more arguably useful features, like higher refresh rates or OLED panels.</p>

<p>If the idea of 3D gaming appeals to you, I don't want to yuck your yum. The Odyssey 3D will answer your needs very well and then some. Just don't go bankrupt for it.</p>

Nintendo <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1917860173722603707">acknowledged the issue</a> and released another update, V20.0.1, this morning, which fixes the problem.

Defeating the Ender Dragon means you've technically beaten the game, but with so many Minecraft biomes to explore, there are endless hours of enjoyment in this mode.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486449-minecraft-modes%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486449" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486449-minecraft-modes%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486449"></a><figcaption>Death is possible in Survival</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486449-minecraft-modes%285%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Hardcore">Hardcore</h2><p>Hardcore is Survival with a malicious twist. You only get one life in Hardcore mode, and when you die you'll have to reset your world. The only exception to this is if you're playing with friends who don't meet the same fate, where you have the option to spectate the world. It's not possible for some players to be in Survival and some in Hardcore in the same world; everyone will need to face the perils of Hardcore.</p><p>Once you've entered Hardcore mode you cannot change the difficulty level, so make sure it's something you're willing to commit to and grind through. The difficulty itself will also be much harder than normal Survival mode, with enemies dealing more damage, and cheats and bonus chest options are automatically turned off. While there are many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-java-vs-bedrock-differences-and-which-to-play/1100-6531281/" data-ref-id="1100-6531281">Minecraft Java vs Bedrock </a>differences, a large one is that Hardcore was not added to Bedrock until September 2024, while it was in the Java version of the game from the beta stage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486448-minecraft-modes%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486448" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486448-minecraft-modes%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486448"></a><figcaption>Be very wary of mobs in Hardcore</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486448-minecraft-modes%284%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Creative">Creative</h2><p>While Hardcore is the ultimate test of a Minecraft player's skill, Creative is the absolute opposite. There's no hunger bar, resources are unlimited, and you won't get hurt by enemies, fall damage, or even falling into a lava pit. This is the best option if you want to build something truly monumental, like a massive castle, or some of the most lavish Minecraft houses you can think of.</p><p>In Creative mode you can fly, meaning structures that are extremely tall are much easier to build. Resources can be selected from the menu and you'll have unlimited amounts of any of them. Similarly, you can access every tool, weapon, and book in the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486447-minecraft-modes%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486447" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486447-minecraft-modes%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486447"></a><figcaption>You can't interact with blocks in Spectator mode</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486447-minecraft-modes%283%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Adventure">Adventure</h2><p>Adventure mode is one of the lesser-known Minecraft features. Visitors to your world won't be able to break or place blocks unless they own special items that allow them to. These player-created adventure worlds allow for things such as Skyblock and RPG servers to exist, as they change permissions to add or remove challenge if needed. You can create custom maps and puzzles, making parkour a popular Adventure mode creation.</p><p>Similarly to Survival, you will receive damage from the environment and can die, and keeping an eye on your hunger bar is essential. However, you can respawn so it's not as challenging as Hardcore. Players often make use of Minecraft Redstone builds to create interactive and engaging environments.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486445-minecraft-modes%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486445" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486445-minecraft-modes%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486445"></a><figcaption>Mobs won't hurt you in Creative mode</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486445-minecraft-modes%282%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Spectator">Spectator</h2><p>Spectator mode is the mode you'll enter if you die in Hardcore but want to continue to experience your friends' playthrough. It can also be entered from the main world creation screen, or by using '/gamemode spectator' in the command bar on PC. You won't be able to interact with anything, meaning you can't assist with construction or help your friends take down a difficult enemy, but it comes in handy for tracking down foes such as the Warden without alerting him.</p><p>You can fly through blocks and easily traverse the world, meaning Spectator mode could be useful for anyone wanting to give their friends a helping hand without the risk of death. It's a good way to view a world you've been working on from another perspective though, and switching to this mode in the middle of a huge build will allow you to soar above it to check whether it's symmetrical, or just look for expansion potential.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486442-minecraft-modes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486442" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486442-minecraft-modes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486442"></a><figcaption>Game modes allow for custom games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486442-minecraft-modes.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Difficulty_Levels">Difficulty Levels</h2><p>There are four difficulty levels in Minecraft as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Peaceful</strong> - This is the easiest game difficulty. There are no hostile mobs, and your hunger bar will not deplete. It's an alternative to Creative mode if you still want the challenge of having to mine and craft for the items and resources you want.</li><li><strong>Easy</strong> - This sticks pretty closely to the standard Minecraft game rules, but mobs don't deal as much damage and you can't die from hunger. Spiders also can't poison you. If you're a younger player, or new to the game, this might be a good option to choose.</li><li><strong>Normal</strong> - The standard game rules, where hunger can kill you and mobs deal the usual amount of damage.</li><li><strong>Hard </strong>- This is more challenging than the normal mode, but not quite as brutal as Hardcore as you can still respawn. Zombies can break through doors and call for reinforcements, so your safe house needs to be as protected as possible.</li></ul><p>Now that you know all of the game modes and difficulty levels in Minecraft, as well as what they do, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/" data-ref-id="1100-6526408">Minecraft guides hub </a>for more helpful information.

                <p>While you may be limited to which version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft </a>you can play based on the device you're using, there are some important differences between Minecraft Java and Bedrock to be aware of. In Mojang's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-games/2900-5289/" data-ref-id="2900-5289">survival game</a>, it's more common for PC users to play on Java, while console and mobile users are on Bedrock. Here's our full breakdown of the differences between Java and Bedrock so you can decide which version is right for you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486433-minecraft-java-bedrock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486433" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486433-minecraft-java-bedrock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486433"></a><figcaption>Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486433-minecraft-java-bedrock.jpg"></figure><h2>Minecraft Java Edition</h2><p>The Java edition of Minecraft supports cross-play, so you can jump in with friends on other platforms or operating systems who are also using Java. It also allows for the customization of Minecraft skins, meaning you can completely personalize your in-game look by downloading one of the many skins online. You could even try your hand at creating your own and uploading it to the game.</p><p>The most important difference is that Minecraft Java allows for the installation of mods, meaning you can access more of the best Minecraft servers and their custom packs. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-minecraft-mods/2900-5234/" data-ref-id="2900-5234">Minecraft mods</a> can do anything from adding small quality-of-life updates, to completely overhauling the way chests and loot work. They even make playing dedicated questlines possible, or introducing new Minecraft mobs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486434-minecraft-java-bedrock%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486434" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486434-minecraft-java-bedrock%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486434"></a><figcaption>Petting a dog in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4486434-minecraft-java-bedrock%281%29.jpg"></figure><h2>Minecraft Bedrock Edition</h2><p>While Bedrock is a named entity, it actually refers to any version of Minecraft that isn't Java. For this reason, console and mobile users primarily play the Bedrock version of the game. Bedrock does support <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">cross-play</a>, so most people on consoles wanting to team up with PC players will use it if you're both on the Bedrock version. Bedrock has controller support, or touch control support for mobile.</p><p>You'll also have access to the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Minecraft marketplace</a>, which sells packs that can be downloaded to completely overhaul the gameplay experience. Some recent examples include the Hello Kitty pack, which added a beautifully cute village alongside all of the Sanrio characters, and the Star Wars pack. This is the closest thing to mods that Bedrock users can use to customize the game, as the marketplace sells add-ons that transform the look or behavior of mobs, in-game items, and other environmental factors.</p><p>Bedrock also allows for parental controls, family sharing support, and moderation via the Xbox Family Settings and Family Share apps, making it the more child-friendly option for concerned parents.</p><p>While each version does have exclusive features, both Minecraft Java and Bedrock can use Minecraft servers, and they can both join or host Minecraft Realms. Realms are servers hosted by Minecraft that create a private space for you and up to ten friends to play together, for a small monthly fee.</p><p>Now that you've decided which version of the game is best for you, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/" data-ref-id="1100-6526408">Minecraft guides hub</a> for more helpful information.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-store-revenue-share-100</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-store-to-give-devs-100-revenue-for-first-1m-per-year-from-june.1179612/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-store-revenue-share-100<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced changes to its Epic Games Store revenue share model, and the new terms, which will kick in next month, are pretty favorable for developers.</p>

<p>In a news <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Epic says that from June, it will give developers 100% revenue for the first $1m they earn each year, and that's on a per-app basis as well. From then, the standard 88-12 revenue share (that's 12% to Epic) will kick in.</p>

<p>Epic says it thinks this revenue share will provide "an even better deal for developers", and given that player counts on the Store are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-store-year-in-review-2024" rel="nofollow">continuing to rise</a>, this seems like a good time to introduce those terms.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-games-store-revenue-share-fortnite.jpg?itok=F6ZNCoDr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-games-store-revenue-share-fortnite.jpg?itok=D_FBL6fx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Epic wants to show people it's not just&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on the Epic Games Store.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as introducing the new revenue share model, Epic has also announced Webshops, a new feature that enables developers to introduce their own out-of-app purchase systems "as a more cost-effective alternative to in-app purchases".</p>

<p>Epic is specifically referring to mobile ecosystems like Android and Apple's iOS, which the company says "charge exorbitant fees". Thanks to recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine" rel="nofollow">legal rulings</a> in Epic's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-victory-play-store" rel="nofollow">favor</a>, however, devs can now send players outside of those ecosystems to alternative webshops with different payment systems.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you spend any money in Epic's Webshops, you will "accrue 5% Epic Rewards" on all of your purchases. If there's something you've got your eye on and it's in an Epic Webshop, then it might be a good idea to opt for that instead of the alternatives.</p>

<p>Admittedly, the new revenue share model and the Webshop system will likely benefit developers and publishers more than players, but if more devs get better deals with Epic, then perhaps they'll have more cash left over to make more games, eh?</p>

            <p>Open world crime blockbuster <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> has been delayed until next year, say Rockstar, telling fans that they "need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve". It's not the biggest surprise - delays happen. But it's a slightly embarrassing announcement given that Strauss Zelnick, big boss of publisher Take-Two, has twice publicly reassured investors that the game would release on time in autumn this year. The announcement comes with some sense of relief, however, as Rockstar have now set a firm date in Spring.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> VI is now set to release on May 26, 2026," say the studio in <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">a post on their website</a>. "We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team."</p>
<p>It's the first time the developers have set a concrete day for the game's release. Previously they had only revealed a broad release window sometime this autumn - a vagueness that was causing some consternation in the industry, as various big games played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-launching-early-has-literally-0-to-do-with-gta-6s-release-date-marathon-or-anything-save-confidence-says-gearbox-boss">release date chicken</a> in an effort to avoid the ultraviolent giant. At least now other studios may breathe easy and make solid plans for their own games to release this autumn and winter. </p>
<p>Delays are normal in the industry, and the result is often a more polished game. We already knew as far back as March last year that Rockstar was<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-could-slip-to-2026-under-rockstar-fallback-plan-according-to-reports"> considering a long delay as a "fallback plan"</a>, thanks to a report by Kotaku. So this was always a possibility. Jason Schreier of Bloomberg claims <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x">it was inevitable</a>, according to his own sources at Rockstar.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yet the delay is notable for being at odds with the publisher's past statements. Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Take-Two, made various confident nods to money folks in shareholder conference calls, intimating that the game's upcoming release wouldn't slip. The boss was supposedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-wont-slip-to-2026-take-two-assure-theyre-highly-confident-about-fall-2025">"highly confident"</a> about the game's previous release window, according to his words in a meeting in 2024. Earlier this year, in another money-minded call, he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-hitting-consoles-in-autumn-says-take-two-boss-promise">repeated those reassurances</a>. Later, Zelnick said that the company was staying quiet on an exact release date <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sorry-other-game-devs-but-rockstar-is-still-keeping-quiet-about-a-release-date-in-the-name-of-maintaining-anticipation">to build "anticipation"</a>.</p><p>

"We support fully Rockstar Games taking additional time to realize their creative vision for Grand Theft Auto VI," said Zelnick in <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reiterates-expectations">a statement released today</a> by Take-Two. "While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence... we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders.” 

</p><p>Uh-huh. Anyway, there's still no PC release date for the game, sorry to say. And we only really have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-put-gta-6-trailer-live-early-after-leaks-across-social-media-confirms-2025-release-date">that one trailer</a> to go off so far. That might change this summer, as we in the press traipse slowly toward the territory of the Summer Games Fest, where we will be hacking down game announcement after game announcement with a machete of words in a dense jungle of trailers. The moment we spot a big video from Rockstar, we'll send word.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Rockstar issues statement.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has delayed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> to May 26, 2026. It was due out fall 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement, Rockstar apologized for the significant delay to the game, expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected," Rockstar said. "The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We look forward to sharing more information with you soon."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar's statement at least confirms the GTA 6 release date, but there were no new assets released, which means the wait for Trailer 2 continues. There's also no mention of launch platforms, which some are already speculating leaves the door open to GTA 6 releasing on PC as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S in May 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Strauss Zelnick, the boss of Rockstar parent company Take-Two responded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boss-of-gta-6-and-borderlands-4-owner-take-two-says-it-will-time-its-releases-to-respect-the-consumers-need-to-spend-a-lot-of-time-playing-these-hit-games-before-they-go-on-to-the-next">when IGN asked how confident he was that Rockstar would hit fall 2025 for GTA 6</a>. "So we feel really good about it." That was back in February.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Commenting in a new note to the investment community issued today, May 2, Zelnick said he supported the decision to delay GTA 6 into Take-Two's 2027 financial year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We support fully Rockstar Games taking additional time to realize their creative vision for Grand Theft Auto VI, which promises to be a groundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence. As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The delay to GTA 6 opens up the second half of 2025 to a number of other games, perhaps now with more breathing room to succeed. The likes of Gearbox's Borderlands 4, EA's Battlefield, Bungie's Marathon, and Sony's Ghost of Yotei will no-doubt breath a sign of relief. Nintendo, which is preparing to release the Switch 2, will surely benefit from GTA 6's delay, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other developers and publishers who perhaps rushed their games to launch ahead of GTA 6's expected fall 2025 release window won't be so happy, of course. And if you had a game planned for launch in or around May next year, you'll probably have to rethink your release strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

You’ll also know all about that shocking death that arrives just before you make your final escape and, blinking, emerge into the beautiful open world of Cyrodiil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The shocking death I’m talking about here is of course the assassination of Emperor Uriel Septim, an assassination he knows is coming and has come to terms with. Veteran fans have replayed Oblivion enough at this point to know it’s coming, too. But back in 2006 when Oblivion first came out, it became a rite of passage to try to save him from the inevitable Mythic Dawn backstab that kicks off the story.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hundreds of arrow shots later and players soon discovered that there was nothing that could be done to save poor old Septim, not without tinkering with the game with mods or console commands. Oblivion only really makes sense if the Emperor dies at the beginning, so it stands to reason that the developers at Bethesda forced it to happen no matter what the player did to try to stop it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, 20 years later, a new generation of Oblivion fans is trying to save the Emperor, and by that I mean trying and failing in much the same way. Players are waiting, bow and arrow primed, for the assassin to emerge from the shadows in a bid to kill him before he stabs the Emperor, but alas, it is no good.</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@_elderscroller/video/7498837496252370206" data-video-id="7498837496252370206"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@_elderscroller?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="@_elderscroller" rel="noopener noreferrer">@_elderscroller</a> A new generation must close shut the Jaws of Oblivion!  <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oblivionremaster?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="oblivionremaster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#oblivionremaster</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oblivionremastered?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="oblivionremastered" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#oblivionremastered</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/obliviongameplay?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="obliviongameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#obliviongameplay</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oblivionclips?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="oblivionclips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#oblivionclips</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oblivion?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="oblivion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#oblivion</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/obliviontok?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="obliviontok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#obliviontok</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/obliviontiktok?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="obliviontiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#obliviontiktok</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/skyrimtok?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="skyrimtok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#skyrimtok</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/skyrimtiktok?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="skyrimtiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#skyrimtiktok</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/elderscrollsoblivion?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="elderscrollsoblivion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#elderscrollsoblivion</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="fyp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fyp</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7498837444293397279?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - ElderScroller" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound - ElderScroller</a> </section> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Some newcomers to the game didn’t even know they were supposed to talk to the Emperor in the first place, and so ended up with a room full of dead assassins as the endless stream of Mythic Dawn goons emerged to battle the group.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are seeking out their revenge on the Mythic Dawn, piling those corpses high.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Newcomers are also discovering that the assassins will just keep on coming if you don't talk to the Emperor.

            <p>Publisher Take-Two fully supports <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> following its decision to delay <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> into next year.</p>
<p>GTA 6 was initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">slated for an unspecified release this Autumn</a>. However, just this afternoon, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">developer announced it was delaying the release until 26th May, 2026</a>. "With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve," Rockstar said today.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250502895390/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reiterates-Expectations-to-Achieve-Sequential-Increases-in-and-Record-Levels-of-Net-Bookings-in-Fiscal-2026-and-2027">Take-Two's head Strauss Zelnick has responded to the delay</a>, stating the company supports "fully Rockstar Games taking additional time to realise their creative vision", adding on its release GTA 6 will be "a groundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations".</p>

As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders."</p>
<p>The Take-Two head added he still expects the company to have a prosperous 12 months, even with GTA 6 being a little further off on the horizon, now releasing during the company's 2027 fiscal year.</p>
<p>In a press release, Take-Two said the expectation is that "the company will achieve sequential increases in, and record levels of, net bookings in fiscal 2026 and 2027".</p>
<p>Take-Two is slated to release its next financial results on 15th May.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-review-steel-yourself-for-this-challenge<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I don't think that I'm the only person to believe that you can never have enough dragon miniatures. While it's great to have some that reside in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="72283661-e76b-4c88-a508-3288a167599c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wizkids-return-of-dragons-review" rel="nofollow">Dungeons</a>, it's also important to have some Dragons coming from <em>Planescape</em>. Ahead of it's release we got to look at Wizkids Adult Adamantine Dragon in both it's painted and unpainted variant.</p>

<p>The Adult Adamantine Dragon, featured on the cover of last March's Pathfinder: Monster Core book, is one of the primal and skymetal dragons. This is a lumbering dragon caught in mid flight (and mid chomp) as it's elevated from it's 75mm clear base.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-dragon-and-box.jpg?itok=E8f4Kmwh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-adult-adamantine-dragon-dragon-and-box.jpg?itok=RkJ0mPD7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Looking over this dragon it's fierce at every angle. From the front you can see it's focused eyes and large gaping maw, claws are forward ready to strike, and even the points of it's wings and tail look like they're ready to dig in and cause some damage.</p>

<p>These fearsome tactics are reflected in the creatures stat block as well. With melee options for it's jaws, claw, and tail the miniature wants to make sure you're away to watch out for it's apendages.</p>

<h2>Attacks Represented In Motion</h2>

<p>All of that is not even mentioning what you can't see from the monster including an Avalanche Breath that will have the creature belching a mass of boulders (maybe some nice rocks from outside will accompany this dragon nicely).</p>

<p>A lot of incredible detail has been done on the Adamantine effects of the dragon. No matter which part of it you're looking at it's very clear to see where the flesh and scales of the dragon make way for the tougher metals that protrude from it's body.</p>

<p>For the texture I've seen a lot of work that Wizkids has done where through slightly rough patterning is able to recreate a feel somewhat similar to leather, here the bulkiness of the chunks of armor do a fantastic job to show just how sturdy an opponent this is.</p>

<p>The patterning and look of this dragon also do a great job of prompting the DM for not only their positioning, but understanding the scale and where a dragon such as this could be laying in wait. While we know that the Adamantine Dragon is proficient at digging whose to say a party moving through a quarry of metals doesn't walk by a pile that is in fact the dragon itself.</p>

<h2>Unpainted And Primed To Fight</h2>

<p>Alongside the painted edition I also got to see how it looks unpainted. For someone ready to challenge themselves this would be an excellent dragon form to lend some color to. While it retains it's powerful and imposing form you'll get to put your painting skills to the test trying to fill it out.</p>

<h2>Adult Adamantine Dragon Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's always a good day when you can approach your RPG table and drop a dragon down before them. The Adult Adamantine Dragon is great because it can fit with almost any mountainous terrain, or even deep in mines where rare minerals could be found.</p>

<p>Wizkids has created an impressive dragon here that shows off the power of it's form, while also so perfectly nailing the aesthetic of the skymetal that covers this dragon from head to spiny tail.</p>
