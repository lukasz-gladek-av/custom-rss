		<p>RedDeer Games, in collaboration with developer emergeWorlds, has announced the release of the dark fantasy adventure game DROS for the Nintendo Switch. The game is set to be available starting July 12th. Initially introduced as a demo on Steam in 2021, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/emergeworlds/dros-0/posts">DROS had a successful Kickstarter campaign in early 2023</a>, and has been available for purchase on Steam since July 20th, 2023.</p>
<p><iframe title="DROS | Date Announcement Trailer | Nintendo Switch |" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efLcgbLsqqU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In DROS, players alternate between two characters who work together on the mission to destroy the Alchemist’s Tower, also referred to as the Machine. The protagonists are the Captain, a skilled bounty hunter, and Little Dros, a magical slime creature. Each character possesses their own distinct abilities, which will all be needed in the mission to bring down the Machine. The Captain is a combat specialist and, going by the trailer, can move heavy objects within the game’s stages, while Little Dros wields magical powers that are useful for puzzle-solving and navigating the challenges presented throughout the 40 levels.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1554650/DROS/">DROS is priced at £16.75 on Steam</a>, and the price is likely to be similar on the Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-25-announced-november<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Giants Software has announced&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, the latest iteration of the hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator&nbsp;</em>franchise, and it's coming in fall.</p>
<p>Launching on November 12th on PC and current-gen consoles (although not Nintendo Switch),&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>will introduce Asian farming to the series, allowing you to look after rice paddies in a "lush East Asian landscape".</p>
<p>You'll also be able to farm in North American and Central European locations, each of which offers a unique challenge and different landscapes for you to enjoy while you harvest your crops.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/farming-simulator-25-announced-machine.jpg?itok=0-z-7fud 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/farming-simulator-25-announced-machine.jpg?itok=9AFDd45o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>is riding its tractor towards a November release date.</figcaption></figure><p>New crops include rice and spinach, which will join a roster of "well over 20 overall", and you'll also be able to raise buffalo alongside more conventional&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator&nbsp;</em>livestock like chickens, sheep, and cows.</p>
<p>Naturally, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator&nbsp;</em>game, you can also look forward to tons of authentically-licensed farming machines from brands like John Deere, New Holland, and Case IH, plus lots more.</p>
<p>You can check out the cinematic announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, which shows off some of the game's new, luscious-looking Asian landscapes, right here. Be aware that there isn't any gameplay in this trailer; it's more of a scene-setter than an indication of how the game will actually look.</p>

<p><em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>will be based on "the latest and modding-friendly Giants Engine 10", according to developer Giants Software. It's an upgrade over Giants Engine 9, which was used for&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 22</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-22-sales-surpass-3-million-units-globally">previous mainline entry in the series</a>.</p>
<p>That engine upgrade will also bring boosts to the game's visuals and technical underpinning, with improved distance fog, dynamic weather, and much more bringing a new sheen of realism to your farming experience.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>when it launches across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on November 12th. More info is coming soon, so stay tuned.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gta-online-bottom-dollar-bounties-update-out-now-adding-bounty-hunts-dispatch-work-and-new-vehicles/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-online-bottom-dollar-bounties-update-out-now-adding-bounty-hunts-dispatch-work-and-new-vehicles.910623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gta-online-bottom-dollar-bounties-update-out-now-adding-bounty-hunts-dispatch-work-and-new-vehicles/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-is-getting-bounty-hunter-missions-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> earlier this month, Rockstar Games has released a major free update for GTA Online titled Bottom Dollar Bounties.</p>
<p>Bounty Hunter Maude Eccles (who returns from Grand Theft Auto V, where she offered targets to Trevor) is now about to retire, leaving her business in the capable hands of her daughter Jenette. However, she will need the help of players on the field.</p>
<p>At the all-new Bail Enforcement Office, GTA Online players can step into the role of Los Santos’ most infamous street sweeper, seeking out low-level targets for a quick buck or taking on more notorious members of the criminal underworld for greater rewards at much higher risk. Keep in mind that bringing targets in alive rather than dead will be much more lucrative. Additionally, they can equip their burgeoning business with personal Bail Enforcement Agents who will maximize their earnings.</p>
<p>Alongside this array of new bounty targets, Bottom Dollar Bounties also introduces another form of<br>
vigilante justice called Dispatch Work. Following The Cluckin’ Bell Farm Raid, Los Santos Police Department officer Vincent Effenburger is back with more off-the-books activities, all conducted from the seat of a personal police interceptor as players listen out for LSPD radio chatter and clear up the city's streets from criminals and corrupt cops alike. Completing The Cluckin’ Bell Farm Raid gives access to three new Law Enforcement Vehicles at Warstock Cache &amp; Carry.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA Online: Bottom Dollar Bounties Out Now" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_SgqsxXk8_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Bottom Dollar Bounties update adds a fleet of new rides, including two eligible for Imani tech modifications and two for Hao’s Special Works upgrades. Drift Tuning upgrades have also been enabled for three existing fan-favorite vehicles.</p>
<p>Further community-requested GTA Online experience improvements arrive with updates to the Creator (players can now build their own Drift and Drag races from scratch, and there are some new props), vehicle and game mode balancing, new Career Progress rewards for Bail Enforcement, and increased base GTA$ payouts for many activities, such as Open Wheel Races, Taxi<br>
Work, A Superyacht Life, Lowriders Missions, and more.</p>
<p>GTA+ subscribers can enjoy an expanded Vinewood Club where personal vehicle modification is available. They will now also find an all-new Vinewood Club app on their phones, from which they can claim earnings from Businesses, replenish ammo, request vehicles, and more.</p>
<p>Rockstar Games has promised further GTA Online updates coming in the weeks and months ahead: more vehicles, a tactical assault on a Merryweather aircraft carrier in an all-new adversary mode, Daily Bounties, a fresh competitive Freemode business opportunity, seasonal events, collectibles, and much more.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there's still no news on whether GTA V/GTA Online on PC will ever get those sweet ray traced shadows and ray traced reflections that <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-gets-ray-traced-reflections-on-ps5-and-xsx-still-no-word-for-pc-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were added to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X in late 2022</a>. At this point, there's a chance the PC version will never get them.</p>
<p>The snubbing appears to be set to continue with GTA VI, which has been announced only for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X. It'll likely launch on PC a year or so after the console debut (currently scheduled for <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fall 2025</a>).</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3UPoTalv4A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new trailer</a> released today, THQ Nordic announced that Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will launch on September 24, 2024.</p>



<p>The trailer featured new gameplay and narration from creative director Warren Spector. It also showcased a Collector’s Edition of the game. </p>



<p>Fans can pre-order the Collector’s Edition now. Those who pre-order can receive a unique costume pack for free and 24-hour early access. </p>



<p>However, early access will not be available on PC and Steam. The costume pack will feature characters like Steamboat Willie and Football Mickey.</p>



<p>The Collector’s Edition will cost $199.99, and has limited availability. This edition includes a Mickey Mouse Statue, an Oswald keychain, a tin sign, postcards, and a collector’s steelbook. The steelbook will feature the classic box art from the original game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Epic Mickey originally launched in 2010, and the platformer still has decent reviews. It currently has a 7.4 user rating on Metacritic, and many still count Epic Mickey among the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-disney-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Disney games</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to the signature magic paintbrush, Rebrushed plans to introduce new skills for players to use. Some of these skills include a dash, ground pound, and sprinting. However, the <a href="https://epicmickey.thqnordic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s website</a> still describes Rebrushed as a “faithful remake.”</p>



<p>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and the Nintendo Switch when it launches in September.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-lost-500-billion-three-days/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-just-lost-500-billion-over-three-days-but-it-means-nothing.910608/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-lost-500-billion-three-days/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Earlier today, it was revealed that Nvidia suffered a monumental dip in the stock market, with more than $500 billion worth of shares being wiped clean off the board. This was the single-largest short-term loss in history for <strong>any company ever</strong>, but for Nvidia, it’s a drop in the ocean. Just a few days ago, Nvidia became the most valuable company in the world, with the organisation’s net worth skyrocketing to around $2.9 <strong>trillion</strong>.</p>



<p>This drop saw Nvidia’s market cap drop by 13% over three days. In the last year, the firm has seen its share price triple as the growth of artificial intelligence drives up the value of the chips and computing hardware that the company manufactures.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-did-it-go">Where Did It Go?</h2>



<p>Many analysts have fostered concerns that the AI bubble is about to burst, and that is represented majorly in Nvidia’s performance in the stock market. </p>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/jun/25/nvidia-selloff-correction-territory-500bn-ai-chip-losses-business-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">handed to The Guardian</a>, a senior market analyst said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Some profit-taking seems entirely reasonable given NVIDIA’s meteoric rise. The stock was up over 180% this year alone. But if it continues to lose ground, then there’s a danger of contagion, with selling spreading to other big tech names. If that were the case, then the market could be in for a deeper and more protracted pull-back.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The analyst – David Morrison – admitted that there are ‘few indications’ that investors are thinking about that right now, so the expectation is that Nvidia will remain a stalwart force on the board. Another contributor to the downturn is reportedly the CEO, Jensen Huang, selling off a fair chunk of his $95 billion worth of Nvidia stock. </p>



<p>As the company hit a recent all-time high, it overtook the likes of Microsoft and Apple, soaring due to smart pricing and a dominance over the chip manufacturing market. Some research indicates that Nvidia’s chips have allowed the company to stake a claim to around 95% of the AI market – at that rate, Nvidia can set whatever price it wants.</p>

                <p>The next major update for Grand Theft Auto Online--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-bounty-hunting-update-gets-release-date-trailer-and-more/1100-6524390/" data-ref-id="1100-6524390">Bottom Dollar Bounties</a>--is out today on console and PC. The update is themed around bounty-hunting, and even features the first physical appearance of <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Maude_Eccles" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Maude Eccles</a> in GTA Online. Rockstar also teased an unexpected feature coming in the future: the ability to become a scooter-riding pizza delivery driver.</p><p>Players will meet up with Maude and her daughter, Jenette, as they take on a series of bounty missions involving tracking down some of the most wanted people in San Andreas. "Become just the type of agent of justice the state needs by tracking down and hauling in these dangerous miscreants--utilizing everything from ruthless intimidation tactics to thwarting further criminal activity," reads a line from the expansion's description.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SgqsxXk8_E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_SgqsxXk8_E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Maude will contact players and then call on them to capture a foreclosed building and then access a computer that shows four potential targets: three standard targets and one "most wanted" target. Players can use their safe house to hold captured targets, store money in a safe, and stash their cars.</p><p>The standard targets are "garden variety lowlifes," but the most wanted targets are the "upper echelon of criminal scum," including CEOs, movie stars, and street racers. Players can complete the most wanted targets once per day, while standard targets are available all the time.</p><p>Players are rewarded more handsomely for capturing targets alive, and Rockstar advised players to use non-lethal force and measures, like the stun gun.</p><p>The update also adds new "off-the-books" missions that players can take part in from LSPD officer Vincent Effenburger. However, players need to first complete the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-online-how-to-beat-the-cluckin-bell-farm-raid/2900-5146/" data-ref-id="2900-5146">Cluckin' Bell Farm Raid</a> to access the law enforcement vehicles required for the new missions.</p><p>Beyond all this, the Bottom Dollar update adds new vehicles like the Enus Paragon S and the Bollokan Envisage, both of which are be modified furrher. Other new vehicles include the Ubermach Niobe, the Annis Euros X32, the Invetero Coquette D1, and the Declasse Yosemite 1500.</p><p>Additionally, drift tuning can now be added to the Vulcar Nebula Turbo, the Ubermacht Cypher, and the Ubermach Sentinel Classic Widebody to help players zip around Los Santos in style.</p><p>The update also introduces new features for GTA+ subscribers, including the Vinewood Club app that allows players to request vehicles, claim earnings, or even replenish ammo reserves on the go. Additionally, members get access to a special garage for their cars, while they can also now grab the new Overflod Pipistrello vehicle a week before everyone else. GTA+, which also includes access to a rotating library of free Rockstar titles, recently got a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-gta-6-release-rockstar-raises-gta-price-by-33/1100-6522616/" data-ref-id="1100-6522616">significant price increase.</a></p><p>What's more, the Bottom Dollar update includes heftier payouts for activities like Open Wheel races, Taxi work, Lowriders missions, and Casino Story missions, among others. For the creative types, players can now make their own drift and drag races using an editor toolsuite.</p><p>Looking ahead, Rockstar said a future update this summer will add a new vehicle, the Pegassi Pizza Boy scooter, that will allow players to become a pizza delivery driver helping the hungry citizens of Los Santos stay satisfied.</p><p>Rockstar also teased that its annual 4th of July celebration is coming back this year, along with a Halloween event in North Yankton's Ludendorff cemetery later this year. Rockstar is also releasing a new "multi-stage head-to-head" mode, a new heist challenge, and other features for the game this summer "and beyond."</p><p>Many are wondering how GTA Online and GTA+ may factor in to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA VI</a>, which is set for release in 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pokemon-art-contest-finalists-disqualified-ai-allegations<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced that it has disqualified a number of finalists in the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>Illustration Contest 2024 for violating official contest rules.</p>
<p>The company announced the decision in <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCG/status/1805430785056588279" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, in which it said that "select entrants" in the contest's top 300 finalists have "violated the official contest rules" and will be disqualified as a result.</p>
<p>As such, several additional artists will "soon be selected" to join the finalists instead, so hopefully, this means that some artists who were disappointed will get another chance to have their dreams come true.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-art-contest-disqualifications-collage.jpg?itok=ty70G_bV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-art-contest-disqualifications-collage.jpg?itok=m4wLLatP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>Illustration Contest tasks entrants with drawing outstanding illustrations of Pokemon.</figcaption></figure><p>The Pokemon Company is coy about exactly how the entrants in question violated contest rules, but it's not hard to guess at the reason; it's likely that AI image generation is the culprit.</p>
<p>Last week,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>fansite PokeBeach <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2024/06/2024-pokemon-tcg-illustrator-contest-under-fire-for-apparent-ai-entries" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> that fans were pointing out "anomalies" in some of the entries to the competition, with said anomalies supposedly not being obvious to anyone who isn't actively looking for them.</p>
<p>PokeBeach's article points out that six of the entries to the competition are by artists bearing remarkably similar names: "Vigen K", "Vigo K", "Vigo Khachadoorian", "Vigen Khachadoorian", et cetera.</p>
<p>One image, which depicts Pikachu in a stadium, seemingly has a blurry and indistinct background, which is a hallmark of AI image generation, while another, this time depicting Eevee, features a Vaporeon with a jarringly different art style in its background.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vigen-khachadoorian-pikachu-art-pokemon-tcg-disqualifications.jpg?itok=S26OreA_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vigen-khachadoorian-pikachu-art-pokemon-tcg-disqualifications.jpg?itok=y-dvlA8_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This piece of art has been scrutinized heavily by the community for its apparent use of AI image generation.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also <a href="https://x.com/Konpeimimi/status/1801684462515929105" rel="noopener" target="_blank">been pointed out</a> that the aforementioned images all being submitted under very similar names would appear to contravene the contest's rule of each entrant being restricted to three distinct submissions.</p>
<p>The Pokemon Company hasn't stated which artists have been disqualified from the competition or what the reason is for their disqualification, so we can't know for sure that AI or duplicate submissions are behind the decision.</p>
<p>However, given that companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EA</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partners-with-generative-ai-company-to-enable-dynamically-generated-stories-quests" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-by-nvidia-aims-to-prove-power-of-generative-ai-in-games-does-exactly-opposite" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nvidia</a> have committed to using generative AI in their games or products, it's likely this isn't the last we've heard of AI and the many controversies it can cause. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The inaugural run of colorblind accessible games includes several versions of Uno, as well as some of its tactile games like <em>Tumblin’ Monkeys</em> and <em>Blokus</em>. In addition to this impressive commitment to inclusion, Mattel will be donating over $30K of these freshly minted titles to summer camps across the United States via the YMCA. </p>
<p id="EMu6Je">Moving forward, Mattel plans to make its games colorblind accessible wherever possible, and says it expects that 90% of its games catalog will be colorblind-accessible by the end of 2025. Any future titles with this change will include a “colorblind accessible” symbol, placed in the corner of the box. </p>

<p id="jauNZF">According to Ray Adler, Vice President and Global Head of Games at Mattel, before implementing this rollover and throughout the design process, Mattel partnered with several experts in the color vision deficiency field and consulted with individuals who experience colorblindness, including Mattel designers. Together, they developed custom solutions for games to ensure color was not the only way to differentiate cards or components – like icons and other tactical clues on cards or game pieces. In addition to its physical titles, Mattel will also be implementing similar updates to mobile versions of its games through Mattel163, its mobile game app holder.</p>

While standardizing accessibility in gaming still has a way to go, it’s encouraging to see publishers like Mattel making a larger commitment to inclusion in the industry. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sells-estimated-1-million-units-dlc-sequel-under-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>As first reported <a href="https://www.gamemeca.com/view.php?gid=1750274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Gameca</a> and translated <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/stellar-blade-studio-is-looking-at-a-pc-version-but-cant-comment-due-to-its-contractual-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by VGC</a>, Shift Up estimated that Stellar Blade sold over 1 million units, and shared plans for the game’s future. </p>



<p>Developer Shift Up revealed these statements during a new IPO press conference. The devs reportedly said that they are still considering a PC version of Stellar Blade. Interest in the PC port previously <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sales-pc-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surfaced last May</a>. </p>



<p>In the report by VGC, CEO Kim Hyung-Tae elaborated on the PC port. They explained that “we cannot comment on the exact timing or whether or not it will be released due to the contractual relationship.”</p>



<p>Shift Up also expressed interest in new DLC, a sequel, and even IP collaborations. In <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1805575223154295174" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X from @Genki_JPN, the devs also appeared to showcase a roadmap. </p>



<p>Images of the roadmap suggest that an IP collaboration could arrive by the end of 2024. Stellar Blade’s DLC and sequel could release sometime past April 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The roadmap seen in @Genki_JPN’s post also teases a new photo mode coming around August 2024. There’s also a first look at a new character skin.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-united-states-in-april-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best-selling game</a> in the United States last April, and there were previous rumors the game was approaching 1 million units. Still, Shift Up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-dlc-dev-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was previously undecided</a> about pursuing DLC.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade recently got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-boss-challenge-mode-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new update in May</a>. The update introduced a fresh Boss Challenge mode and more cosmetics.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/luigi%E2%80%99s-mansion-2-hd-review.910572/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Fresh new look, same old spirit.</h2></div><div><section><p>Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire may have been straight up busted at the box office, but thankfully there’s another spectre-stalking adventure to enjoy this year – albeit a very familiar one. Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD – a remaster of the 2013 Nintendo 3DS original that was also known as Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon in the US – has arrived on the Nintendo Switch looking better than ever, but almost entirely unchanged as far as its gleeful ghostbusting gameplay is concerned. It is therefore the best way to experience Luigi’s second foray into catching cheeky Caspers, but it’s no longer the best entry in the series since this Dark Moon-based adventure has subsequently been eclipsed by Luigi’s Mansion 3 in 2019.</p><p>Here’s what our reviewer said in her review of the 2013 original:</p><p>That sentiment still stands, and Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD remains an entertaining journey as spooky as it is silly, its dual-screen setup seamlessly smooshed into a single panel and sharpened to a visual standard that only just falls short of that of Luigi’s Mansion 3. The team at developer Tantalus, which was also responsible for The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD in 2021, hasn’t merely boosted the resolution for this remaster, it’s also added noticeably more detailed textures, right down to the reflective sheen on suits of armour and the threads on Luigi’s dungarees. In addition, drastically enhanced lighting means this Switch version’s haunted dioramas have been given enough depth that I didn’t really mourn the absence of the original’s stereoscopic 3D. (Although to be fair, I’m not sure I even used stereoscopic 3D in the first place.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Review Screens</h3></div></output><p>It’s not likely to win any awards for best visual design in 2024, but compared to the 2013 original the difference is night and day. I remember Luigi’s Mansion 2 having a charismatic cast of characters and enjoyably spooky settings to explore, but it was a shock to revisit the 3DS original 11 years after it launched only to have my eyeballs assaulted by enough jagged edges to grate cheese with. Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD, however, has been polished up to a level that allows the playful nature of its phantom menaces and its many magnificently crafted corridors to really shine on screen.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The goofy ghost enemies are more dork souls than dark.</p></div><p>Those enemies and environments are still effectively the same as they were a decade ago, however. Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD features no additional ghosts to bust, levels to search, or bosses to point your Poltergust 5000 at. None of Luigi’s moves from Luigi’s Mansion 3, like his plunger-powered suction shot or his ability to summon the Gummi Bear-like Gooigi, have been retrofitted into this adventure, which makes for a spook-hunting and puzzle-solving experience that preserves the clever level design of the 3DS original, yet one that noticeably lacks the expanded variety of interactions that the series’ third installment enjoyed.</p><p>It does, however, feature twin-stick controls similar to that of the third game. For whatever reason the original didn’t support the use of the Circle Pad Pro, the bulky Nintendo 3DS peripheral that added a second stick to the system while also making it much more likely to bust a seam in your trouser pocket. This meant that in Luigi’s Mansion 2 on 3DS, the taller Mario brother was stuck facing in one direction anytime you needed him to aim his flashlight or vacuum up a startled soul. That’s no longer the case in this remaster, which allows you to swivel Luigi’s aim around with the right stick. That definitely feels much more flexible and intuitive, and although the difficulty curve here remains pretty gentle – the goofy ghost enemies are more dork souls than dark – I was relieved to find that the control system never frustrated me like it did in the original.</p><p>I do wish more had been done to Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD’s multiplayer, however. Unlike Luigi’s Mansion 3, which allowed two people to play on the same system, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is strictly one player per console, whether you’re playing online or locally on a LAN. The multi-levelled multiplayer mode, Scarescraper (known as Thrill Tower in the original release), is still a lot of frantic, phantom-wrangling fun, but it’s the kind of fun I wish I could share with my kids without having to buy multiple additional Switches and copies of Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD in order to enjoy. Sadly, there’s no split-screen support to be found here. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><p><h3>More Great Games with Ghosts</h3></p></div><p>That said, I certainly still had a ghostbusting-ly good time for the dozen or so hours I spent with Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD. While I prefer the sprawling, single structure of the third game’s hotel setting, I appreciate that the more compartmentalized levels of Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD’s five distinct environments make it easier to narrow your search for any missed collectibles upon completing the main story. Plus, there are some fantastically phantasmic moments that I’d forgotten about in the decade since I first played it, from the wonderfully puzzle-heavy first boss fight with a supersized spider, to tumbling down a lengthy haunted staircase later on that feels akin to a more G-rated version of the climactic sequence from John Wick: Chapter 4.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>With its substantially enhanced graphics and more flexible twin-stick control setup, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is undoubtedly the definitive version of Luigi’s second apparition-filled adventure. If you’re a newcomer to the series – or perhaps you only came onboard with Luigi’s Mansion 3 and are working your way backwards – then there’s plenty of ghostbusting and puzzle-solving fun for you to find in Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD’s five haunted houses. However, if you’re a fan of the original Nintendo 3DS version and you were hoping for more dramatic gameplay changes or additions, then you may well be a touch disappointed. What’s more, playing this remaster in the wake of the third game may put its limitations in an unfavourable light. All told, though, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is a great installment in Nintendo’s spectre-snaring series, even if it’s not the best one you can play on the Switch.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD Review</h3></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>No industry has been left untouched by the looming presence of artificial intelligence – and gaming is no exception. But the rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney have somewhat obfuscated the fact that AI has been influencing development in one way or another since at least the 1980s.</p>

<p>There is a broad consensus that AI is "new" to the space, says Tommy Thompson, director of consultancy firm AI and Games, speaking on a panel as part of our <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/events/gi-sprint-summer-2024">new GI Sprint series about how to make games faster and cheaper</a>. But the idea that AI is a new innovation, and that it's only now beginning to threaten jobs, is far from true.</p>
<p>Thompson, who works with developers on how to integrate AI into their pipelines, has seen this "silent revolution" brewing in the industry since the late 2000s. Back then, developers began incorporating machine learning into their workflows. But AI is a field of computer science that stretches back to the 1950s, and the games industry has been a beneficiary for decades.</p>
<p>Sean Cooper, technical director at Didimo, explains: "I can think of countless automations and AI that we've used since the '80s. And now we're starting to talk about it, and starting to worry about it. But it's always been there. And it puts people out of jobs. Things like, we don't need a tester to test the game, or we need less people to test the game in order to get to [our] goal."</p>
<p>Cooper, whose company builds tools to automate character creation and populate NPCs in game worlds, adds that he can't see why people are so worried right now – because AI and automation has always been a fixture, in his experience. He says that it's always allowed developers to be more efficient, and has also been a boon for studios that lack the financial firepower to hire staff to raise the quality of their output.</p>
<p>Thompson adds that the use of sophisticated AI tools has traditionally  happened behind closed doors in AAA spaces. So these systems wouldn't have previously been widely publicised as they would have been considered mundane everyday tooling.</p>
<p>It's only now that AI has spread like wildfire through the public consciousness that those outside these walls are waking up to the potential benefits and risks. How then, in this new age where AI is in vogue, can game developers make the most of it to improve their processes and ultimately build games at a lower cost?</p>

<h2 id="section-1">Don't just chase the latest craze</h2>
<p>That there's an AI boom is undeniable, and it's predictably led to an explosion of tools and services that purport to offer AI in some way, shape, or form. This 'productisation' means it may be difficult as a studio to determine which tools are best suited – and whether generative AI is really all it's cracked up to be.</p>
<p>It would be wise, our panellists agree, to filter away the buzz and try to hone in on the substance.</p>
<p>"The problem is that we continue to have this conversation around AI in video games that is often being led by people who don't work in games, and are often trying to sell an AI product," says Thompson. "And that is not only warping the conversation, particularly among the playerbase and the general public, but it's also warping those perceptions internally within the industry.</p>
<p>"That's certainly the experience I'm having chatting with a lot of studios. Because they're  hearing the soundbites about GPT and everything else and they're like 'Can we do that in our games?' and I'm like, 'Well, yeah – but no'."</p>
<p>Whether the use of some of these tools is even legal, given the copyright concerns, is another issue altogether, he adds.</p>
<blockquote>"There is no one silver bullet that will create your game for you. I would be surprised if we see that in our lifetime"<cite>Lucie Migné</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Cooper also points out that if you simply add "AI" to a product name, it's likely to get more investment – even if it's just simple automation. That's because people with the purse strings are excited by innovation and tend to hype up new ideas. In turn, that leads to a proliferation of AI products and services that developers may see as cash-spinners. Whether or not these are truly AI products doesn't matter to some extent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, although generative AI is leading the conversation, studios may find that adopting services in this space leads to new problems they may not have anticipated – particularly around using these tools effectively – not to mention the potential legal pitfalls of not knowing which data some models were trained on.</p>
<p>Instead of chasing tools that may represent a false promise, developers should instead integrate tried and tested tools like automation or machine learning into workflows. That's Lucie Migné's advice, as senior producer at Might Build and Test – an AI and automation studio focused on quality assurance.</p>
<p>"They will probably find, like we have at Keywords [Might Build and Test's parent company] recently, that the tools as they stand right now do not necessarily live up to their complete promise," she says. "And the cost of learning that might be high for a small team."</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Lean into open source</h2>
<p>As the breadth of AI tools proliferates, how can studios without the resources to build in-house tooling from scratch get a slice of the action? Developers – especially indies – may want to tap into the ripe pool of open source as a starting point, says Cooper.</p>
<p>"If you look at indie games, they're small budgets, and if you bring in AI systems – especially free open source stuff – their quality bar is going to get substantially raised, because the missing people that they cannot hire are now filled in by these generative AI systems,” he explains.</p>
<p>But failing to lay the groundwork for the adoption of new tools or training staff to properly use them will lead to unintended consequences, adds Migné. Many in the open source community also warn that the total cost of open source isn't zero – despite the fact no money changes hands. IBM, for example, explains that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/why-open-source-isnt-free-support-as-a-best-practice/">running costs need to be considered</a>, while maintaining open source software is often a hard endeavour that requires volunteers to dedicate their time to, say, fixing bugs or adding new features.</p>
<p>"We've got to keep in mind that the general perception of [generative] AI tools in the public eye is that [they] are free to use – and it's certainly not the case," says Migné. "It might also skew the perception in the industry that because they are free, widely accessible, easy to use, that they are a bit of a panacea for all of their production problems – their missing people, their missing skillsets... pretty much like a fast-forward on experience."</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Identify the best workloads to automate</h2>
<p>It's difficult to know where to start when automating workflows, says Lauren Maslen, director of production at Mighty Build and Test, because many parts of the industry appear ripe for automation. But this may not work out in practice.</p>
<p>Some good candidates are any areas in which you have traditionally generated content, she says, highlighting NPCs and characters, instances where you have plenty of duplication in environments or even in coding and engineering. For her company, however, a lot of what they do is look at the QA process.</p>
<p>"If you're looking at any game of any scale, then you're dealing with sheets and sheets of test cases. You're relying on exact execution of these for a distributed team reporting up the chain to make sure regressions are caught early – all of those sorts of things. And that again is an area where you've got this repetition of work, [which] can be a place for automation or AI to fit neatly into the puzzle."</p>
<blockquote>"The problem is that this conversation around AI in video games is often being led by people who don't work in games, and are trying to sell an AI product"<cite>Tommy Thompson</cite></blockquote>
<p>On that note, Thompson adds it's important to identify early on exactly which parts of your workflows are being wasted on the workforce – "taking a point to stop and think about the parts of your process that are quite mundane and monotonous."</p>
<p>"So when we talk about QA, for example, the QA tester has to run into the door 500 times at 700 different angles to make sure you can't run through the door – automate that," he says. "But things like, 'I need someone to go through a quality pass through the level once every couple of days to make sure the UVs are correct, and the textures are displaying correctly in the game and all the visual fidelity's there' – that's something we can do with image recognition, certainly, but I think we can often do it much faster using a human."</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Know how far to go and which tools to use</h2>
<p>When undergoing your journey into adopting AI tools or introducing elements of automation, it's critical to find the right tools for the right purpose – and to do your homework before investing the time and resources.</p>
<p>"Not all AI or automation tools out there are useful for the same usage," warns Migné. "If you're trying to make a bot bang into a door, you're not going to use that tool to create a repetitive meeting agenda. Identify those areas that you do want to automate, and then do your research into what's available there – and use the right tool for the right purpose.</p>
<p>"There is no one silver bullet out there that will create your game for you. It does not exist yet. I would be surprised if we see that in our lifetime."</p>
<blockquote>"Instead of blindly jumping onto a bandwagon, the sector as a whole need to be intentional as to what gets automated"<cite>Aleena China</cite></blockquote>
<p>Dr Aleena Chia, lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London studies game developers and how they automate processes. She says that different members across the team may see automation through a different lens and that, ultimately, it's important to know how far you should go – and when you're going too far. She uses the example of generating individual trees versus creating a forest environment; AI isn't capable of big-picture thinking or conceptualisation, and you need to be careful to ensure these elements of content generation aren't outsourced to machines.</p>
<p>"So I think that instead of blindly or just jumping onto a bandwagon, managers and studios – and the sector as a whole – need to be intentional as to what gets automated."</p>
<h2 id="section-5">Don't forget that gaming is an art form</h2>
<p>Ultimately, studios shouldn't lose sight of their signature style or USP as they're leaning into automation and AI tools.</p>
<p>Chia says that when deciding what to automate, it's a trap to think purely in terms of how much more efficiently a machine can perform a task. Instead, studios must take a big picture approach and think about how each discipline – from narrative designers to artists and programmers – may consider automation.</p>
<p>What's going to happen, Chia continues, is there's going to be a moving target as to what is deemed creative enough to not be automated, and what is "meat and potatoes". As a whole, how we appreciate games and what consumers look for will also change with time and as the overall picture of automation moves forward – especially if gamers value knowing their game offers a human touch.</p>
<p>"I don't think that we can put all the pieces in place right now, but certainly we can have an idea of what games will look like at different levels," Chia says, signalling that the industry will only see more automation and AI adoption in the near future. How far this goes, however, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>"I was at GDC and at at roundtable an artist came and said, 'Actually, texturing is not as mindless as you might imagine, there are a lot of aspects of texturing that tell the story as well'," she adds. "So while there is consensus [that you can automate] things like running into a door or game testing, when it comes to more nuance of creative processes, I don't think we are yet seeing a consensus as to what should and shouldn't be automated."</p>

			<p>While they might not have initially won everyone over, Luigi’s ghost-busting antics have aged like a fine wine, especially with the excellence of Luigi’s Mansion 3 a few years ago. Yet, much like the ghosts that end up trapped inside Luigi’s Poltergust, all but the most recent game has found itself stuck on older consoles. Until now, that is, as Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD has slurped up one of the highlights from the 3DS library and deposited it right onto the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="A closer spook at Luigi's Mansion 2 HD! ???? (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4pdG9qVt5zI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Madcap inventor Professor E. Gadd is enjoying a lovely evening with his friendly ghosts –&nbsp;at least one of which would surely be called Casper, but for some kind of trademark infringement –&nbsp;when the Dark Moon that hovers over his perpetually moody valley is shattered into pieces and all the ghosts go absolutely nuts. Putting the potential ethical quandary of using a mysterious magic crystal thing to affect the behaviour of free spirits (destructive though they might be) to one side, Prof. Gadd needs help getting things back under control and calls upon his ghost-hunting pal Luigi back into action. Ghostbusting might not make him feel good, but he’s darned good at it!</p>


<p>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD will be immediately familiar to anyone that’s played it or the other entries in the series. Luigi has to traipse around the haunted world, battling spectral miscreants with just a flashlight to stun them and a vacuum cleaner to scoop them up. Ghosts come in all shapes and sizes, they can attack from afar, hide in the scenery and pop out to spook Luigi, or come wielding items that shield them from being stunned. It’s up to you to time your Strobulb blasts to weaken them, then activate the Poltergust to pull them in, and pull in an opposite direction to the one they’re trying to escape in order to build up a more damaging burst of suction.</p>


<p>Compared to Luigi’s Mansion 3, ghost battling feels more forgiving. You can be a good bit looser in how you pull against a ghost’s panicked flight, and you don’t have to deal with the plunger for pulling away items and armour. That said, with the tight confines of many rooms and passages, multiple ghosts coming at you together, and still having to deal with the timing of a Strobulb flash, it can still be pretty tricky. Another part of that is getting used to having movement in 3D space switch from have Luigi face the direction of motion to strafing – a persistent quirk for the series that you need to overcome, though it’s now helped by having the right analogue stick to aim and the shoulder buttons to trigger the flashlight.</p>
<p>Where Luigi’s Mansion 2 stands apart is in having a mission-based structure, taking you back to Prof E. Gadd’s lab after completing each objective, and then zapping you back to a location each time, as opposed to the more connected mansion and multi-floor hotel of the other games. A level generally takes 10-20 minutes to complete, pushing you to different parts of a location and often mixing up the puzzles and enemies that you’ll find there. Gloomy Manor could be completely covered in cobwebs that you need to clear, the front gate to Haunted Towers can suddenly be guarded by an oversized Venus Flytrap, and even a simple objective can be interrupted by ghosts that whip away the item you were after and force you to keep exploring.</p>
<p>Figuring out each room is a delight, though, and there’s a pleasing interactivity to many objects and secrets to find. You’ll have to remember that you’ve got a darklight that can reveal hidden doors and items, and that you can both push and pull using the Poltergust, but aside from those core items and door keys, everything you need to progress will almost always be contained within a room. There’s often switches to pull, buckets that you can pick up to gather liquids, plants that become balloons and more. It’s always fun finding the connections between the environmental puzzles, with some great design that obfuscates things just the right amount.</p>

<p>All of this is rendered with some big improvements for Nintendo Switch. Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD naturally runs in HD now, instead of a resolution that would be look pixellated on a postage stamp, and that does an awful lot of the heavy lifting to make the game look clearer and much nicer. However, all of the character models are now much higher quality and more detailed, improved textures and more. I do wish that they had gone a little further to get the light and shadow up to the standards of Luigi’s Mansion 3, and the character animation is somewhat limited, but it’s still a fairly handsome game thanks to the overall art style. It’s also stuck at 30fps, when you might have expected a remaster like this to shoot for 60fps.</p>
<p>Another place where this remaster could have gone further is with the multiplayer. We’re back to the original suite of multiplayer modes and options in the ScareScraper, where up to four multi-coloured Luigis can team up to take on a multi-level tower with either straight up ghost hunting, racing to reach a floor’s exit, or trying to track down polterpups. There’s also a surprise mode that mixes up the three game types floor-by-floor.</p>

<p>It’s good fun, and you can increase the number of floors and difficulty to suit your team, where you’ll often have to deal with strange curses that need teammates to come help you out, but it is also fairly limited. By comparison, Luigi’s Mansion 3 has up to 8 players online and always mixes up the objectives, and then there’s the Luigi’s Mansion remake for 3DS, which introduced co-op to the story mode with the first appearance of Gooigi. This remaster could have done similar.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Shift Up has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>sales have topped one million, and that the studio is still actively considering a PC version of the game as well.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamemeca.com/view.php?gid=1750274" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an article on Korean news platform GameMeca</a> (for which we're using machine translation), the sales figure was announced by Shift Up CFO Ahn Jae-woo during a press conference held earlier today for the company's IPO launch.</p>
<p>Ahn Jae-woo pointed to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>'s user rating of 9.2 on Metacritic, which is the highest of any PS5 game, although the game is beaten out by titles like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review-id-explain-but-i-dont-think-i-can">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a>&nbsp;</em>when it comes to critical reception.</p>

<p>Shift Up CEO Kim Hyeong-tae, meanwhile, said that the goal for&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>was to create a new IP that fans would love, and that this was emphasized over pushing for profit or including unnecessary microtransactions.</p>
<p>He does, however, say that there's a possibility paid DLC for the game (as opposed to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-new-game-plus-mode">free updates it's been receiving</a>) will be released in future, especially if&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>were to cross over with another IP.</p>
<h2><em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>PC version still under consideration, devs say</h2>
<p>As part of the IPO press conference, Ahn Jae-woo confirmed that Shift Up is still considering a PC version of&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, and that releasing one could increase the value of the game's IP even further.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24185022/nintendo-switch-2024-game-lineup-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This was supposed to be the year the Nintendo Switch rode off peacefully into the sunset. After a packed 2023 that included hit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Legend of Zelda</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario</em></a> games, the Switch had little on the calendar this year and the prospect of a successor looming. And yet, here we are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24170561/summer-game-fest-2024-trailers-news-geoff-keighley">after a hectic few weeks of gaming news</a>, and Nintendo might just have the most exciting lineup for the rest of the year, besting the likes of Xbox and PlayStation.</p><div><p>In the Switch era, it seems the company’s greatest strength has been consistency. This likely harkens back to a seemingly boring restructure at Nintendo in which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17478950/nintendo-switch-structure-success-shinya-takahashi-interview">the company merged its handheld and console development teams in order to focus purely on the hybrid Switch</a>. It certainly seems to have worked: unlike its predecessor, the Wii U, the Switch hasn’t had prolonged periods without a first-party Nintendo game. Sure, a lot of them are remakes or ports, but then again, so is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/1/23941695/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-6-dlc-tracks-release-date-characters">the device’s bestselling title</a>.</p></div><div><p>The launch of <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</em> on June 27th kicks off what looks to be a very solid run from Nintendo for the rest of the year, which the company kept secret until <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180183/nintendo-direct-june-2024-news-trailers">a Nintendo Direct earlier this month</a>. It will be followed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151970/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-switch-release-date"><em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em></a> in July, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> in September, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180977/a-new-mario-party-game-is-here-to-ruin-your-family-relationships"><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em></a> in October, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a> in November.</p></div><div><figcaption><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>In terms of quantity, Nintendo’s lineup is comparable to its competitors over the same period. (I’ll have to reserve judgment when it comes to quality.) Xbox Game Studios has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173672/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-november-19th-release-date-trailer">a new <em>Flight Simulator</em></a><em>,</em> a pair of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24172089/welcome-to-the-age-of-mythology">strategy</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2021880%2FAra_History_Untold%2F">games</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173678/heres-another-look-at-avowed-coming-in-2024">Obsidian’s latest RPG</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172097/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-xbox-bethesda-release-date-trailer-date">a <em>Starfield</em> expansion</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24174850/heres-another-look-at-the-new-indiana-jones-game">likely <em>Indiana Jones</em></a> capping things off, along with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173669/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-october-25th">multiplatform <em>Call of Duty</em></a>. Sony Interactive Entertainment, meanwhile, has the adorable <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24167370/astro-bot-ps5-sequel-trailer-date"><em>Astro Bot</em></a>, a multiplayer shooter called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168249/an-intro-to-sonys-next-multiplayer-shooter"><em>Concord</em></a>, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24168045/god-of-war-pc-release-date-ps5-state-of-play">PC port of <em>God of War Ragnarök</em></a><em>, </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24172801/lego-horizon-adventures-ps5-trailer-summer-game-fest"><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em></a><em> </em>(which is coming to the Switch in addition to PC and PS5).</p></div><p>The difference is that the Switch has been out three years longer than the most recent Xbox and PlayStation, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Nintendo is clearly gearing up for its successor</a>. It’s not usually this way: the latter years of a console’s lifespan are typically muted, while the company focuses on the next generation. It’s not the time when you get a much-anticipated twist on the<em> Zelda</em> formula. Nintendo even has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer">major Switch games going into next year</a>.</p><p>Similarly impressive, even the games that don’t necessarily seem that exciting — namely ones that already exist on other platforms — have still been turning out great. <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2</em> is a remake of a portable game that debuted more than a decade ago, and yet, it looks, plays, and feels much like its modern predecessor, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20942003/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch-gooigi-comedy">the excellent slapstick comedy <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em> from 2019</a>. (Even if the new game is lacking <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18668931/luigis-mansion-3-nintendo-switch-interview-gooigi-e3-2019">Gooigi</a>.) It’s the kind of silly and playful game that few major developers outside of Nintendo have really explored, and it stands out because of it. Its release follows other well-made ports from this year like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24041577/another-code-recollection-review-nintendo-switch">the <em>Another Code</em> collection</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162364/paper-mario-rpg-nintendo-switch"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>.</p><p>The major test for Nintendo will be maintaining this consistency across console generations. The company has often had an uneven success rate with new platforms; the megahit Wii and Switch were preceded by consoles that both underperformed and struggled when it came to a dependable release schedule. It’s hard to gauge the potential for a Switch successor without knowing anything about it, but a steady stream of high-quality Nintendo games will certainly go a long way toward avoiding the dire days of the Wii U.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Cyan Worlds' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-remake-of-myst-sequel-riven-is-coming-later-this-year-complete-with-vr-support">remake of their 1997-released Myst sequel Riven</a> launches today on Steam. Word on the reviewvine is that it's jolly decent, offering free movement around a real-time 3D reinvention of the original point-and-clicker's shimmering archipelago, with its many murals of crushed and scattered civilisations. There’s still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712350/Riven/">a demo on Steam</a> at the time of writing, a relic of long-ago Next Fest 2024. Demos tend to be removed once the game hits shelves, so I thought I’d rush you a quick post based on 30 minutes with the remake over lunch.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Riven’s world feels odder today than it did when I laid eyes on it as a teenager. I think that’s partly because it’s a fossilised vision of the internet from before the broadband era, a Narnian panegyric to the humble hyperlink. The Myst games unfold in a universe of pocket dimensions or “Ages” - accessed by diving into the pages of magic books and made up of obscure, half-real mechanisms, where generations of artisanal explorers and inventors vie to reclaim lost knowledge while prosecuting grudges and giving into their megalomaniacal tendencies.</p>
<p>You are a nameless Stranger, asked by Myst’s benevolent patriarch Atrus to rescue his wife, Catherine, from an Age created by his wayward father. Play is about exploring the archipelago and poking at exquisite, weather-worn brass instruments to open doors and reach different islands. It's a mesmerising place, but a frustrating one to unravel: one of the first things you discover is a broken lever.</p>
<p>The other reason the Riven demo feels odds is that something in me rebels against the translation of the original’s static environment art into real-time 3D. The remake is beautiful, and moreover, true to the ethereal pristine dessication of the 1997 game’s Softimage-produced and Hypercard-mounted landscapes, but – perhaps because I used to dabble with making games in Hypercard myself – I felt a bizarre anxiety about failing to match my perspective to the old frozen vistas. Exploring the demo landscape felt like trying to align a pick with the innards of a lock. Probably that’s specific to me, and probably it’s a feeling I’ve amplified into a Take for want of thinking time. This isn't the first Myst game to undergo such cosmetic surgery - Myst V: End Of Ages and Uru were also given the real-time 3D treatment.</p>

<p>If it’s extended analysis of the Myst series you’re after, I will refer you initially to John Walker (RPS in peace), who in 2020 declared that the original Myst is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-myst-still-one-of-the-worst-games-ever">one of the worst games ever</a>. Below that article there’s a comment from Doomsayer who anxiously urges John to play Riven, because he will hate it even more.</p>
<p>“Here's the secret: There's only one real puzzle in Riven,” Doomsayer explains. “You'll know it when you see it. (And you will despair.) It's a puzzle that you'll need to gather clues for over the entire game; one that will send you going back and forth over and over again across the entire world. Even diehard fans hate it. It's brilliant: The entire game all for the one puzzle. There's no game on this Earth quite like it.” This is the kind of empathic audience participation you only ever get on Rock Paper Shotgun. We don't have the headcount to review the new Riven at the minute, but I might circle back to it at the end of the year.</p>

			<p>Diablo and Warcraft fans galore - Models of the Lich King's Frostmourne blade have been spotted in the Diablo 4 Season 5 PTR.</p>
<p>Two models of the legendary blade from the The Lich King were <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/frostmourne-models-discovered-in-diablo-4-season-5-ptr-343336" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovere</a>d by outlet Wowhead. This might suggest that Diablo 4 players will soon be able to wield the iconic mourneblade. Both the Lich King's helm and Echo of Frostmourne already made their way to the latest Diablo entry as trophy slots, but Frostmourne might actually be added as a wearable blade.</p>
<p>As covered yesterday, Diablo 4 Season 5 will add a new roguelike mode to the game, new legendaries, items, and uniques. Also, weapon types will be expanded in this new season. Season 5 kicked on the PTR earlier today and is available on PC through July 2nd.&nbsp; The new season is expected to release on August 6 - running two months before the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-gets-october-date-new-cinematics-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vessel of Hatred expansion</a> on October 8. We've included some additional details about this expansion below:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ranked among the apex predators of the jungle, the Spiritborn is an entirely new class to the Diablo series. They are battle-hardened with mystical synergies that could only be awakened deep within the jungles of Nahantu. Become one of the Spiritborn and embrace the ethereal Spirits entwined with this ancient civilization.</em></li>
<li><em>Explore Nahantu, the new jungle region in Diablo IV full of secrets, dangerous new Dungeons, Strongholds, and ferocious demons from warring Tribes.</em></li>
<li><em>Never fight alone, as new Mercenaries can join you on your quest to fight in the dense undergrowth of Nahantu and beyond. These powerful allies grow in power as they progress, and each are equipped with unique abilities to help you in combat.</em></li>
<li><em>Vessel of Hatred also has huge updates for all Diablo IV players with new class skills, paragon boards, legendary glyphs, dungeon types, Tree of Whispers activities, and more.</em></li>
<li><em>A new co-op PvE mode where you work with your friends to complete objectives and slay the boss in a multi-level dungeon, while getting loot and rewards.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Diablo 4 is available worldwide now across PC and consoles (and Game Pass).</p>

						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>The Switch is home to more than its share of remakes and remasters, but despite having a hearty library of games worth revisiting, few if any Nintendo 3DS games have been up for revival. That’s about to change though, as the 3DS is finally getting a little love in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/luigis-mansion-2-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a> (originally known as Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon in North America).</p>
<p>Luigi’s Mansion 2/Dark Moon really pushed what the 3DS could do back in the day, but does it still bust with the best a decade later on more capable hardware? Or is it hard to scare up much enthusiasm for this latest Nintendo revival? Tip-toe onward for the full rundown…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you’ve ever played a Luigi’s Mansion game before, you’ll be familiar with the basic setup here. That dastardly King Boo has escaped his bonds and shattered the Dark Moon which protects the Evershade Valley, causing it to become haunted up something fierce. Luigi is again recruited by friend/tormentor Professor E. Gad to don the upgraded Poltergust 5000 and cleanse multiple themed mansions of their pesky paranormal activity.</p>
<p>While there’s always debate about where the line between remasters and full-on remakes lies, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is unquestionably on the remaster end of the scale. While the game sports updated textures, character models, and improved lighting, actual level layouts and geometry doesn’t appear to have changed, with everything having a rather chunky, angular 3DS look. That isn’t to say the game is ugly, but it’s a solid notch below <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/luigis-mansion-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>, which is one of the most visually polished first-party Switch titles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Not a ton has changed in terms of core gameplay, either. As in all games in the series, Luigi uses his Poltergust vacuum to both interact with the environment and suck up specters. In battle, your goal is to stun ghosts with your flashbulb and then vacuum them up. Ghosts will try to break free from you, but pulling in the opposite direction fills a meter which allows you to unleash an extra burst of suction power. None of the moves added in Luigi’s Mansion 3, including the satisfying ability to smash ghosts into objects and each other, have been reverse-engineered into Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD – combat plays out like it always has.</p>
<p>Well, that’s not <em>entirely</em> true. The game was, unavoidably, a bit awkward to play on a 3DS owing to its lack of a second analog stick, but that’s obviously not a limitation Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD has to deal with. You can now move Luigi with the left stick and aim the Poltergust independently with the right stick, much like in Luigi’s Mansion 1 and 3. That said, continuing this series’ history of inexplicable control limitations, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD doesn’t offer a single-stick option where your vacuum always points the same way you’re facing.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The level design of Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is largely identical to how it was on the 3DS, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Each of the game’s five themed mansions offer satisfying classic-adventure-game-style exploration, with plenty of goodies and secrets hidden around nearly every corner. While there are some surprisingly challenging brainteasers to be found here, the puzzles aren’t quite up to the same level of creativity found in Luigi’s Mansion 3, with solutions eventually starting to feel a bit predictable. Boss encounters run the gamut, with some, like the giant spider lurking at the end of the first mansion, feeling like complex puzzles in their own right, while others are more by-the-book and repetitive.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd9.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unfortunately, Luigi’s Mansion 2’s generally impressive level design isn’t always well-served by the game’s mission structure. Unlike Luigi’s Mansion 1 and 3, which give you a degree of freedom to explore the world as you wish, Luigi’s Mansion 2 is strictly mission-based, with areas of a mansion that don’t serve said mission typically being blocked off. While the majority of missions you’ll tackle are interesting enough, serving up new areas to explore and challenges to face, others are pretty obvious fillers. Particularly groanworthy are the repeated missions that task you with tracking down a wayward Polterpup, usually by revisiting numerous rooms you’ve already seen.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Also frustrating is the game’s save system, which only records your progress after you’ve completed a mission, some of which can be 30 to 40 minutes long. Have to quit midway through a mission? Too bad, back to the beginning. Die during a mission? Unless you find a hidden golden dog bone item during a mission, too bad. While Mansion-ending bosses are standalone missions that allow you to start right back at the beginning of the battle when you die, there are multiple missions that place minibosses likely to kill you the first time around at the end of a lengthy stage. Overall, Luigi’s Mansion 2 has more annoying difficulty spikes than you generally expect from a Nintendo-published game.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD — Overview Trailer — Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7PVeXriFVrw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Luigi’s Mansion 2 may have started life on a small screen, it isn’t a small game. The main campaign will take you at least a dozen hours to complete, with additional collectibles, unlockable bonus stages, and ScareScraper mode to consider. A randomized four-player co-op dungeon hack with various game types, ScareScraper isn’t likely to take the world by storm, but it provides some quick-shot fun and, based on my hands-on time with Nintendo PR reps and fellow reviewers, the online play seems to be quite functional. Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD might not be the freshest dish, but you can’t criticize the portions.</p>
<p><em>This review was based on a copy of Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD provided by publisher Nintendo. </em></p>

					
					

<p>It’s easy to see why Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD stood out in its original form on the 3DS, and even today, there’s plenty of reason to like the green guy’s spooktacular sophomore outing. That said, limited efforts to update the original material, particularly some of the game’s more frustrating structural and design choices, makes this Mansion feel just a bit creaky.</p>

<p>State of Decay developers Undead Labs have granted a fan’s wish by adding his late father in State of Decay 2.</p>



<div><p>The wholesome moment first appeared on Reddit by user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EmbarrassedBudget859/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">/u/EmbarrassedBudget859</a> four days ago, which was retweeted by the official <a href="https://x.com/StateOfDecay/status/1804644258600865870?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1804644258600865870%7Ctwgr%5E69fb299fc6faebff529e1782333aebd6d65f14f4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fxboxera.com%2F2024%2F06%2F25%2Fstate-of-decay-developers-undead-labs-grant-a-fans-wholesome-wish%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">State of Decay Twitter page</a> a day later.</p><p>The official post said, “So my dad died a few years ago and I’m one of the many who are obsessed with this game. So… I sent the devs a message asking to put him in the game. And they did what they could, which means just adding his name to random survivors. 3 years later and I found HIM. not just his name. But his traits, everything about him. This will always be my forever community.</p></div>



<p>He continued, “Sorry the photo is trash but I’m still in shock. These devs need more recognition.”</p>



<p>As admitted, the photo wasn’t the best; however, just a few hours later, he uploaded a better image of his dad in the game.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The State of Decay Twitter account credited Undead Labs Game Designer <a href="https://x.com/Rangutang" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Geoffrey Card</a> for granting the wish of the fan, a gesture that will stick with him for the rest of his life.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Undead Labs revealed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer for State of Decay 3</a>, but unfortunately, there’s still no word on when the game will be released.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hardest-bosses-ranked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is finally out, and with it comes a whole lot of new bosses to terrorize you. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki himself says some of the bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree were designed to push players to their very limit, and after finishing the DLC, we’re inclined to agree.</p><p>So of course we decided to rank all of the new bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree, from least difficult to most. One important caveat is that there are way more bosses than the ones we’ve listed here in the DLC. However, we’ve decided to just rank the main bosses – the ones that drop Remembrances you can then take to exchange for legendary gear and weapons. </p><p><strong>And of course, this is one of the most spoiler-filled lists we have for Shadow of the Erdtree, so do not read on if you haven’t finished the DLC. </strong></p><p>So with all that in mind, here are the toughest bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>10. Romina, Saint of the Bud</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/24/screenshot-830-1719264941269.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>Though Romina is a bit of a later-half boss, she  ends up not being all too difficult. A sort of play on Melania’s Scarlet Rot boss, Romina is a flowery spellcaster whose primary attacks inflict Scarlet Rot if you stay too long in her poisonous fumes. Dodging those, and she can also send exploding butterflies at you.</p><p>Luckily, it’s quite easy to escape these noxious AoEs to get your hits in until she’s defeated. Whether you’re a melee player or a spellcaster, Romina hardly puts up a fight considering how late in the game you’ll face her.</p><h3><strong>9. Scadutree Avatar</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/elden-ringtm-20240618003517-1719274889332.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>One of the many big bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree, the Scadutree Avatar might be large, but is also, funnily enough, easy to miss. Tucked away in a hidden part of the Shadow Keep, the Scadutree Avatar is a large sunflower monster who takes big swipes and can cause some massive bleed damage at range. You also have to fight it three times in a row.</p><p>Luckily, like other big FromSoftware bosses, the Scadutree Avatar’s attacks are easy to dodge, and the boss’s primary difficulty stems from having to beat it three times more than any of its actual attacks. </p><h3><strong>8 . Metyr, Mother of Fingers</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/metyrboss-1719275676985.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>Despite coming in near the bottom of the list, Metyr is still a very difficult boss thanks to her combination of big, physical AoE attacks and ability to fire lasers and other ranged abilities. Get too close and Metyr can squash you like a bug, while attacking from afar risks getting shot with a pretty powerful beam attack.</p><p>She also has a nasty ability to summon some fingery goons to help her, which can get pretty tiresome real quick. Still, Metyr is pretty weak to magic, so depending on your build you can quickly melt her health bar. </p><h3><strong>7. Divine Beast Dancing Lion</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/24/screenshot-568-1719264965211.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>Depending on how closely you’re following the critical path, the Divine Beast Dancing Lion is likely the first boss you’ll encounter in the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, and FromSoftware sure enjoys setting the bar high.</p><p>The Divine Beast hits hard, moves fast, and can switch between shooting lighting, blasting you with frost, or blowing you away with wind. This is true FromSoftware combat, so get ready to dodge, duck, dive, dip, and get one, maybe two hits in before you repeat. The only reason why Divine Beast is this low on the list is because the other bosses are just straight-up harder.</p><h3><strong>6. Rellana, Twin Moon Knight</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/eldenringbosses-blogroll-1719274678707.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>Rellana follows a rich tradition of duel-style bosses where the players feel like they’re going one-on-one with another player character, similar to Artorias and Lady Maria. The sister of Renalla, Rellana is a magical knight who combines vicious swordplay with a magic-focused second phase where she’ll wield both fire and ice magic against you. </p><p>A mix of close-combat hits, long-range AoEs, and a one-hit magic attack that took this writer multiple hours to figure out how to counter, Rellana was the first boss that I got stuck on, meaning I spent literal days trying to beat her, even with the help of a NPC summon.</p><h3><strong>5. Midra, Lord of Frenzied Flame</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/21/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-rune-skeleton-1708529241307.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>In a sense, Midra and Rellana are fairly similar bosses who utilize the same attack style of combining close-range sword attacks and long-ranged  abilities. Only in the case of Midra these long-range attacks are Frenzied instead of magic. The main differences between the two bosses is that Midra is a bit faster, Frenzy is slightly more annoying to deal with, and he has a bigger range for AoEs than Rellana.</p><p>Also, true to the Frenzied Flame name, Midra’s attack patterns are definitely more chaotic, meaning finding the patterns to dodge his attacks are just a bit trickier. </p><h3><strong>4. Putrescent Knight</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/godewyob0aajlu0-1719275490368.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>The Putrescent Knight gave me big Bloodborne vibes, not only from its design as a goopy, skeletal knight riding a slime horse, but also in its relentless attacks. The Putrescent Knight has a tendency to always hit a few more times than you expect, meaning when you think you’re in the clear and ready to take a swig from your flask, oops! He’s hit you again and now you’re dead.</p><p>More than that, the Putrescent Knight’s nasty habit of being able to split from his horse and temporarily become two enemies is also a headache to deal with.</p><h3><strong>3. Commander Gaius</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/commander-gaius-1719274578680.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>When speaking with my fellow early access Shadow of the Erdtree enjoyers, Gaius repeatedly appeared in the “Toughest Bosses” conversation. Sort of like a remixed version of Radahn from the base game, Commander Gaius charges into the battlefield on a mighty boar, to trample over players. Survive that? Well he’s armed to the teeth with gravity magic that he can then use in the second phase to crush you.</p><p>The biggest problem with Commander Gaius is you need to be perfect with your timing. If you fail to dodge him once, there’s a good chance he’ll stomp you out in a single go. But much like Radahn, if you take him head on and perfect your timing, you should be in a good place for one epic duel.</p><h3><strong>2. Messmer the Impaler</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/24/20240608021047-1-1719265032204.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>FromSoftware has heavily advertised Messmer leading into the release of the DLC, and for good reason. Messmer’s boss fight is one of the toughest in the entire DLC, and maybe the game. A two-part fight, Messmer begins his onslaught with his mighty spear, which has a huge range. Not only is Messmer fast, but his fire damage and counters make his first phase alone a pain to deal with.</p><p>The second phase is where, unfortunately, the real fight starts as he’s able to add a giant snake to his arsenal. You’ll have to dodge both Messmer and the snake because if either gets a hold of you, it’s likely game over. Whether you get gripped in the jaws of the snake as it pummels you into the ground, or deal with Messmer’s fiery grasp that can practically one-shot you, Messmer is a hard boss to read, and an even harder boss to dodge.</p><h3><strong>1. Promised Consort Radahn</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/consortradahn-1719274564949.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>Effectively the “Final Boss” of the DLC, I have a feeling Promised Consort Radahn is who director Hidetaka Miyzaki might be referring to when he talked about pushing the boundaries of boss difficulty for the DLC.</p><p>To put it simply, Promised Consort Radahn is relentless. In his first phase, Radahn’s size belies his absolute speed. Hard-hitting, fast-moving, you’ll be lucky to get through his first phase unscathed between his massive sword swings, gravity attacks, and huge health bar.</p><p>The second phase, however, feels downright impossible. Adding Miquella’s holy attacks to Radahn’s moveset makes nowhere in the arena safe for the player. As holy beams rain down continuously around the duo, Promised Consort Radahn is now also able to move at the speed of light, rushing down the player insanely fast, and hardly ever letting up even then. What this does is effectively takes away the players’ greatest skill: the dodge roll. </p><p>It will take frame-perfect movement, guile, and maybe more than a little luck to get through this two-part boss fight. But I promise the feeling afterward will be worth it.</p><p>So that’s how we rank the toughest boss fights in the new Elden Ring DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree. Let us know in the comments which bosses are giving you a particularly hard time, and be sure to check out our Shadow of the Erdtree review if you haven’t already.</p><p><em>Matt T.M.

The mod was posted to <a href="https://github.com/lostkagamine/SdvHardcoreMode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> by self-described software engineer and system administrator ‘lostkagamine’, and seemingly follows Hard Drive’s joke to the letter.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/stardew-valley-player-turns-hardcore-mode-joke-into-reality-creating-a-mod-that-ruthlessly-deletes-your-saves-if-you-dare-to-use-guides/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_content=gamestm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, the mod works by scanning every window on a player's computer while the game is open, and will immediately erase the current save file in the event that it detects ‘Stardew Valley Wiki’ in the title of an open browser page. “I have since updated it so that instead of just deleting your save, it also closes the browser window it finds the wiki in, just to add insult to injury,” wrote the mod’s creator in a <a href="https://x.com/nightshademagia/status/1804415579190620392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on X</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i have since updated it so that instead of just deleting your save, it also closes the browser window it finds the wiki in just to add insult to injury <a href="https://t.co/xQCaG19DSA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xQCaG19DSA</a></p>— akemi homura, fallen from grace ⌚️ (@nightshademagia) <a href="https://twitter.com/nightshademagia/status/1804415579190620392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>You have to admire the commitment to the bit, and the mod will undoubtedly catch the interest of players who occupy the shared space on a very specific ven diagram that includes ‘<a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> players’, and ‘Stardew Valley Enthusiasts.'

                <p>The developer behind the enormously popular Palworld said that it hasn't actually faced any sort of legal action from Nintendo or the Pokemon Company.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/palworld-pocketpair-takuro-mizobe-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameFile</a>, Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe explained, "[We heard] nothing at all. Nintendo and the Pokemon Company didn't say anything to us." Palworld has been nicknamed "Pokemon with guns" by the general gaming community and players have noted the similarities between Palworld's creatures, called "Pals" and the ones in Pokemon.</p><p>Earlier this year, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-pokemon-company-says-it-intends-to-investigate-palworld/1100-6520591/" data-ref-id="1100-6520591">issued a statement</a> saying that it would investigate acts that infringe on Pokemon's intellectual property rights.</p><p>Interestingly, Mizobe also said that creating something new is hard, and that he'd like to avoid it as much as possible. It was a lesson that he learned from working with Nintendo itself early in his game-development career. He was previously part of a training program sponsored by Nintendo for a year and helped launch a game called Tentai Shooter for the Nintendo DSi.</p><p>Palworld has been a massive success since it launched into early access on PC and Xbox earlier this year, passing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-tops-19-million-players-with-12-million-copies-sold-on-steam/1100-6520750/" data-ref-id="1100-6520750">12 million copies sold</a> on Steam and 19 million players total as of the end of January.
