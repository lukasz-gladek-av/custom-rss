			<p>Riot Games has been dipping its toes into the world of fighting games after becoming well-known for its MOBA League of Legends and auto-battler Teamfight Tactics. Their latest game is on the horizon, with 2XKO, formerly Project L, currently in Alpha testing. However, they also had a second fighting game, code-named Pool Party, which was binned in May.</p>
<p>This fighting game was said to be in the style of Super Smash Bros, with melee fighting and platforming set in the League of Legends universe. Current and former Riot employees have spoken out about this game, saying that a team of 70-80 people was assigned to work on this project.</p>
<p>While the project has since been scrapped, at least half of the team has received an offer to be reassigned within the studio to other jobs. Ten people did not receive an offer and were subsequently laid off or left the company voluntarily.</p>
<p>A statement has been made by Joe Hixson, the senior communications director at Riot Games. He told <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mikhail Klimentov</a> of readergrev.com, "We always have a number of projects in various phases of R&amp;D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year."</p>
<p>While they haven't specifically said why the project was scrapped, it's possible that they felt that the scene was now becoming too saturated. While Super Smash Bros. remains on top as the ultimate melee platform fighter, Multiversus has now broken into the scene.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Riot Games had a <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-11-of-workforce-shuts-down-riot-forge-to-refocus-on-core-projects/">mass layoff of over 500 employees</a>, which was said to be due to budget cuts so that they could continue to have as many ongoing projects as they currently do.</p>
<p>Riot Games' newest project, 2XKO, a fighting game, is due for a 2025 release date. Registration forms for their Alpha labs are currently open for people who are interested in trialing the game for them.</p>

"The RPG game format is a lot of fun, and I've even thought to myself, 'You know, for the past 30 years, we haven't done a Sonic RPG.' And I'm questioning myself. 'Why haven't we done a Sonic RPG in all this time? How have we gotten to 30 years with no RPGs?!'"</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/10/maxresdefault-1720623046528.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Takashi Iizuka | Image Credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Xwt7ka8KA">IGN France</a></figcaption></figure></output><p>Iizuka said he would "hopefully" get to work on a Sonic RPG before he retires from Sega, but made clear there was nothing "concrete" at this time. "So, I'd like to hopefully work on a Sonic RPG at some point before I retire from Sega," he said. "But you know, that's just a dream right now. There are no concrete plans at this point."</p><p>The only Sonic RPG released so far was <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-chronicles-the-dark-brotherhood">Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood</a>, a 2008 Nintendo DS game. However, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer Bioware worked on the project and not Sonic Team. </p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/09/24/sonic-chronicles-the-dark-brotherhood-review">our review of Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood</a>, IGN wrote: "There's fun to be had, and the game does pick up after the first few hours, but we'd be surprised to see many DS gamers get behind Dark Brotherhood while there are so many superior role-playing games on the platform. There's a good design in here somewhere; it's just lost in the shuffle of it all."</p><p>The closest that Sonic Team got to incorporating RPG-esque elements in a Sonic game was the blue hedgehog's first 3D game, Sonic Adventure, which implemented some RPG elements. In a <a href="https://soahcity.com/videos/sonic-adventure-dx-commentary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cut commentary for Sonic Adventure DX</a>, Iizuka explained that after work on NiGHTs into Dreams, he approached Naka, proposing that Sonic Adventure should be an RPG-style game. </p><p>Despite Sonic Team not making a Sonic RPG, the development studio has worked on role-playing games including the aforementioned Nights into Dreams and the Phantasy Star Online series. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

What do you think?</h2></div><section><p>Developer Motion Blur has announced Black State, a visually stunning new third-person action-adventure that, if the gorgeous announcement trailer is accurate, mixes the espionage action of Metal Gear Solid with the reality-bending portal tech of Portal. It's powered by Unreal Engine 5 and in development for PC.</p><p>After watching Black State's completely in-game trailer (seriously, watch it above), we asked the developers at Turkey-based Motion Blur a few questions about the project. First, what the story is about: "A former military legend is summoned for a mysterious mission: to rescue a captive scientist and uncover the truth behind a cataclysmic event. The mission, assigned by enigmatic Architects, is shrouded in uncertainty as some doors within the unknown territory lead to unpredictable and perilous destinations. Each door reveals new secrets and challenges, and he must navigate this treacherous landscape, discovering what awaits him behind each threshold, to complete his mission and unveil the hidden truths."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Black State - Exclusive First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Our next question was about that Metal Gear comparison: "Obviously, we love the Metal Gear Solid series. While working on our extensive, nearly 500-page game design document over 2.5 years, we constantly admired games like The Last of Us, Metal Gear Solid, Uncharted, and many others that push the limits of development and gameplay mechanics. Inspired by these influences, our small team is committed to delivering the highest development quality and exceptional gameplay mechanics, despite our limited size. We strive to create rich and deep storytelling combined with engaging gameplay mechanics, offering an impressive and unforgettable gaming experience. Our goal is to push ourselves to our limits and give gamers the best possible experience we can provide."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We constantly admired games like The Last of Us, Metal Gear Solid, Uncharted, and many others that push the limits of development and gameplay mechanics."</p></div><p>Black State has been in development for the better part of the past three years. The Motion Blur team says "the idea for Black State originated from the creative mind of Kadir Demirden. This concept has been evolving in his imagination for over a decade. During this period, extensive research and development were conducted to explore how a small team could produce a game with AAA quality."</p><p>IGN will have much more on Black State as development progresses.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-future-of-black-desert-online/">Black Desert Online</a> remains one of the biggest MMORPGs on the market, and it's time for their latest event to be made public. Their new event is titled "<a href="https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/Wiki?wikiNo=367">War of the Roses</a>," where you can participate in a grand battle of 300v300 PvP and see which team comes out on top. If this sounds right, the first global competition is scheduled for July 14th, where you can watch and participate in the ongoing chaos.</p>
<p>This massive-scale event is geared towards high-end players and guilds. Special roles have been created for leading players, and a brand-new tactical map will allow players to explore as they wrestle to take control of strategic control points in a battle of 600 players.</p>
<p>While the rules have not been announced as of yet, players can expect to see specific combat tactics and rules that will be enforced to ensure a fair match for everyone involved. Adventurers get to participate in a mass battle on both land and sea as you brawl to unlock powerful weapons to take down Sanctum Guardians and get the advantage on the other team.</p>
<p>As this event begins, so does the latest season in Black Desert Online. With the new season comes many new changes as the developers have taken on feedback from the players so that rewards are more substantial; there are brand-new Captain skills and some new strategic components that allow for a stronger comeback if you fall behind the crowd.</p>
<p>War of the Roses brings powerful siege weapons by activating the "Spirit's Altar," which then allows for Ancient Trolls, Ancient Chariots, and Elephants to lend you a helping hand to wrestle the victory from the other team and try to wipe out their players with speed and efficiency.</p>
<p>To participate in this grand event, players must have a combined AP and DP score of at least 700 before they can apply. Regardless of whether you win or lose, plenty of rewards are up for grabs for participating in this event.</p>
<p>Will you participate in Black Desert Online's War of the Roses?</p>

It basically amounted to him never picking a side and instead looking for a “middle ground” on all issues. This went over poorly online. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Here’s the paragraph where I take a moment to explain who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/youtube-mrbeast-split-night-media-jimmy-donaldson-1851458070&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-mrbeast-split-night-media-jimmy-donaldson-1851458070">MrBeast</a></span> is even though it’s very, very likely that you—a reader of <em>Kotaku</em>—already <em>know </em>who this dude is and don’t need a refresher. You can skip ahead. For everyone else, let me explain real fast. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mr-beast-lawsuit-100-million-virtual-kitchen-burger-1850715158&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mr-beast-lawsuit-100-million-virtual-kitchen-burger-1850715158">MrBeast</a></span> is an extremely popular content creator known mostly for his “charity” work—giving people shoes, randomly giving away money, etc—which is then documented in videos with some of the most buck-wild thumbnails I’ve ever seen. Thanks to these charity videos and a good understanding of what kids will click on, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-accidentally-ordered-burgers-from-a-youtuber-1845965201&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-accidentally-ordered-burgers-from-a-youtuber-1845965201">MrBeast</a></span> has become one of the biggest creators in the world.  Naturally, that means some people have suggested he run for president, and he’s now shared his plan for that hellish potential timeline. </p><p>On July 6, MrBeast tweeted out that if the minimum age requirement to become the President of the United States was lowered, he’d “jump in the race.” Currently, you must be 35. And no, there’s no maximum age cap for this office, hence why two bloated corpses who can barely string together coherent sentences are running in 2024. Anyway, on Wednesday, a few days after that initial tweet, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MrBeast/status/1811014883317530846&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MrBeast/status/1811014883317530846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MrBeast shared how he would act as president</a></span>. </p><p>“If I were president I wouldn’t care about party lines, I’d just always truly make the American people my #1 priority,” explained MrBeast. “For problems I’m ignorant in I’d have experts from the left and right advise me on them and try to find the middle ground that’s best for America. Wouldn’t be buyable, don’t care about doing things just because my party says I should, and I would focus on uniting the country instead of dividing it.”</p><h2 id="h125405"><a id=""></a>People react poorly to MrBeast’s platform</h2><p>The reaction to this centrist, child-like pitch for president has led to a lot of people roasting the content creator online. Many have asked simple questions like “What’s the middle ground between universal healthcare and no universal healthcare?” or “What’s the middle option between providing LGBTQ people with rights and not doing that?” Some of his fans did reply to these questions and suggest the answer is to do nothing or not change anything, providing people with a great example of why centrists are worthless. <br></p><p>Re-reading his plan, but pretending it was written and read out loud by a 9-year-old child just learning about politics and the world, is not only funny but actually makes more sense. It’s almost cute. Ahh, MrBeast thinks the right and left are equally filled with experts and good people. That’s so adorable. </p><p>“Anyways, we can pick this up in 15 years when I’m old enough to run haha,” threatened MrBeast on Twitter. Conveniently, MrBeast didn’t suggest what party he would run with, likely to avoid alienating any of his fans.</p><p> I’m not surprised that someone as popular as MrBeast is hopping online to suggest he might run for president. The conversation online has lately been focused on replacing Biden following his dismal performance in the debate last month. And MrBeast is good at chasing a trend. Still, I can’t believe that I’d rather vote for zombie Biden than MrBeast. Yet here we are. </p><p>Now, someone pester Ninja into sharing his presidential platform on Twitter and we can get a sneak peek at what our options will be in like 10 years when all these popular creators are old enough to run and their fans are old enough to vote. Or maybe climate change will wipe us all out by then. Let’s hope! </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For years now, Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass has set itself apart by offering subscribers launch-day access to new first-party titles in addition to a large legacy library of older games. That important "day one" perk is now set to go away for all but the highest tier of Game Pass' console subscribers, even as Microsoft asks for more money for Game Pass across the board.</p>
<p>Let's start with the price increases for existing Game Pass tiers, which are relatively straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Game Pass Ultimate" is going from $16.99 to $19.99 per month.</li>
<li>"Game Pass for PC" is going from $9.99 to $11.99 per month.</li>
<li>"Game Pass Core" (previously known as Xbox Live Gold) is going from $59.99 to $74.99 for annual subscriptions (and remains at $9.99 for monthly subscriptions).</li>
</ul>
<p>Things get a bit more complicated for the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/xbox-game-pass-for-console/CFQ7TTC0K6L8"> $10.99/month "Xbox Game Pass for Console"</a> tier. Microsoft announced that it will no longer accept new subscriptions for that tier after today, though current subscribers will be able to keep it (for now) if they auto-renew their subscriptions.</p>
<p>In its place, Microsoft will "in the coming months" roll out a new $14.99 "Xbox Game Pass Standard" tier. That new option will combine the usual access to "hundreds of high-quality games on console" with the "online console multiplayer" features that previously required a separate Xbox Game Pass Core subscription ("Core" will still be available separately and include access to a smaller "25+ game" library).</p>
<blockquote>

<p>But while the current Xbox Game Pass Console option promises access to Xbox Game Studios games "the same day they launch," those "Day One releases" are <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/ad/51/ad517e36-25cc-4d7d-897d-c0f9c667e9cb.pdf?n=FINAL%20Xbox%20Game%20Pass%20options%20for%20consoles.pdf">conspicuously absent as a perk for the replacement Xbox Game Pass Standard subscription</a>.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>"Some games available with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on day one will not be immediately available with Xbox Game Pass Standard and may be added to the library at a future date," Microsoft <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">writes in an FAQ</a> explaining the changes.</p>
<p>Players who want guaranteed access to all those "Day One" releases will now have to subscribe to the $19.99/month Game Pass Ultimate. That's an 81 percent increase from the $10.99/month that console players currently pay for similar "Day One" access on the disappearing Game Pass Console tier.</p>
<p>To be fair, that extra subscription money does come with some added benefits. Upgrading from Game Pass Console/Standard to Game Pass Ultimate lets you use <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/series-x-power-on-your-netbook-xbox-game-streaming-upgrade-is-now-live/">Microsoft's cloud gaming service</a>, access downloadable PC games and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/ea-play">the EA Play library</a>, and get additional "free perks every month." But it's the launch day access to Microsoft's system-selling first-party titles that really sets the Ultimate tier apart now, and which will likely necessitate a costly upgrade for many Xbox Game Pass subscribers.</p>
<h2>More problems, more money</h2>

<p>While Xbox Game Pass <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/xbox-apes-netflix-with-10-per-month-100-game-unlimited-pass/">launched in 2017</a>, launch-day access to all of Microsoft's new first-party games wasn't promised to subscribers <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/01/23/xbox-game-pass-expands/">until the beginning of 2018</a>. Since then, loyal Game Pass subscribers have been able to play dozens of brand-new first-party titles at launch, from major franchises like <em>Halo</em>, <em>Forza</em>, and <em>Gears of War</em> to indie darlings like <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, and <em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em> and much more.</p>
<p>Sure, access to hundreds of older games was nice. But the promise of brand-new major first-party titles was instrumental in driving Xbox Game Pass to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/23570040/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscriber-numbers-34-million">34 million subscribers as of February</a>. And Sony found itself unwilling to match that "day one" perk for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/breaking-down-sonys-confusing-playstation-plus-subscription-relaunch/">its similar PlayStation Plus service</a>, which only includes a handful of older PlayStation Studios titles.
</p><p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstations-jim-ryan-our-games-could-suffer-if-we-put-them-straight-into-ps-plus">a 2022 interview with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan said throwing new first-party games on their subscription service would break a "virtuous cycle" in which new full game purchases (at a price of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/70-game-prices-are-probably-here-to-stay-but-not-for-every-game/">up to $70</a>) help fund the next round of game development. "The level of investment that we need to make in our studios would not be possible, and we think the knock-on effect on the quality of the games that we make would not be something that gamers want."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>And Microsoft may be coming to a similar conclusion. Including first-party titles with cheaper, console-focused Game Pass subscriptions probably seemed like a good idea when Microsoft was still trying to attract subscribers to the service. But <a href="https://gamerant.com/xbox-game-pass-growth-subscriber-count-2023-report/">Game Pass subscriber growth is starting to slow</a> as the market of potential customers has become saturated. Microsoft now needs to extract more value from those subscribers to justify Game Pass cannibalizing direct sales of its own first-party games.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/codblops6-scaled.jpg" data-height="1440" data-width="2560" alt="Microsoft paid a lot of money to add the value of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> to a Game Pass subscription."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/codblops6-scaled.jpg" data-height="1440" data-width="2560">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Microsoft paid a lot of money to add the value of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> to a Game Pass subscription.</p><p>Activision</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>And let's not forget Activision, which Microsoft recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/microsoft-finally-owns-candy-crush-as-it-closes-69b-activision-blizzard-deal/">spent a whopping $69 billion to acquire</a> after lengthy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/judge-denies-ftc-injunction-improving-microsofts-activision-purchase-prospects/">legal</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/microsoft-is-finally-on-the-verge-of-closing-its-activision-deal/">regulatory</a> battles. Recouping that cost, while also offering Game Pass subscribers <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/05/10/every-first-party-xbox-game-will-launch-day-one-on-game-pass-sarah-bond/">launch day access to massive sellers like <em>Call of Duty</em></a>, likely forced Microsoft to maximize Game Pass' revenue-generating opportunities.
</p><p>“Let’s put it this way: If 7 million Xbox Game Pass subscribers were planning to buy ‘Call of Duty’ for $70 but now have no reason to (as it’s part of their subscription), that leaves almost half a billion dollars of revenue on the table,” MIDia analyst Rhys Elliott <a href="https://www.thedailyupside.com/technology/big-tech/microsoft-is-going-for-a-gaming-hail-mary/">told The Daily Upside</a> by way of illustrating the significant numbers involved.</p>
<p>For players who enjoy a wide variety of games and would likely purchase all or most of Microsoft's first-party titles at launch anyway, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate it still probably a good deal at its increased price. But players who subscribed to a relatively cheap console Game Pass option years ago may want to reevaluate if maintaining that launch day access is now worth $240 a year.</p>

                <p>With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Amazon Prime Day</a> almost here, a few other retailers are gearing up to offer some great deals on various items. As part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/walmart-deals-prime-day-2024/2900-5577/" data-ref-id="2900-5577">Walmart's big deals event</a>, you can save a whopping $380 on an HP gaming laptop, one that's kitted out to be both a gaming machine and your daily workhorse workstation. Normally $980, the HP Victus is on sale for $600.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4330913-hp-victus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4330913" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4330913-hp-victus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4330913"></a><figcaption>HP Victus Gaming Laptop</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4330913-hp-victus.jpg"></figure><p>This deal is for the laptop with a 15.6-inch 1080p 144Hz screen, and internally, it's equipped with 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a 5GHz AM Ryzen 5 processor, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 6GB laptop GPU. There's plenty of storage here as well thanks to the 1TB SSD and a solid battery life for when you're doing general browsing or low-intensity work.</p><p>It's worth noting that a laptop GPU is very different to the behemoths found in a modern PC, but thanks to technologies like Nvidia's DLSS, you can squeeze a lot of power out of these mobile chipsets. On a screen of this size, playing a game at 1080p and tinkering with the graphical settings will still allow you to get most modern titles to play decently, while more modest indie games shouldn't give you any technical issues.</p><p>On top of that, this is a great little laptop for doing some quick video editing or other forms of content creation, and the lightweight design makes it great for when you watch some Netflix in bed. The overall design isn't too bad either, as the angular shape isn't as ostentatious as other models available right now.</p><p>For more, you can also see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/walmart-deals-prime-day-2024/2900-5577/" data-ref-id="2900-5577">everything that Walmart has on sale right now</a>.

An <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/parent-approved-contacts-for-preteens/">upcoming change</a> will let parents individually approve each user their 10- to 12-year-old can call, chat with, and join VR experiences with on Quest. Previously, Meta didn’t allow kids in that age range to use chats, make calls, or invite others to games.</p><p>Last year, Meta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/16/23763812/meta-quest-headset-lower-age-10-years-old">lowered the minimum age</a> for kids who can use its Quest headsets from 13 to 10 years old. Kids in this age range must get parental approval to create a Meta account for the headset, which their parents will have control over. Meta also doesn’t show ads to these accounts by default and will only recommend games and apps appropriate to their age.</p><p>The change comes as the federal government ramps up scrutiny of child safety on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and Discord. In February, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24057460/senators-confront-meta-tiktok-snap-x-discord-ceos-kids-online-harm">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg</a> appeared before the Senate during a hearing and has since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/29/24144333/meta-record-lobbying-q1-2024-us-government-big-tech">spent millions on lobbying</a> while the government mulls bills on online <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/29/24086559/kids-online-safety-act-schatz-tech-groups">child safety</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We haven't written nearly enough about Fallout London, a gargantuan <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> total conversion that takes place in a whole new map based on England's capital city - the Big Smoke and/or Great Wen, whose real-life incarnation probably harbours at least one nuke at any given moment, though I haven't asked the King about that lately. Best not speculate.</p>
<p>Anyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-update-fallout-4-for-your-next-generation-pc">treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fallout-tv-show-gave-the-fallout-games-a-huge-player-bump-as-everyone-remembers-they-like-fallout">capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-waiting-years-for-its-next-gen-update-fallout-4-is-already-getting-another-patch-next-week">rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff</a>. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and <a href="https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1809555735681913115">sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing</a>, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.</p><!--more-->

<p>As such, Fallout London will ship with its very own installer and downgrader.  "GOG have been amazing through all of this," project lead Dean 'Prilladog' Carter explained on the game's Discord this week, via <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-devs-confirm-need-to-downgrade-fallout-4-next-gen-version-not-stable-enough">VG247</a>. "To be honest, we've been the ones causing them the issue. What with us having things break due to the next-gen [update] and then needing the 3rd parties to update, then waiting for them to be fixed, only for the fact that at the 11th hour we've discovered that the next-gen [version of Fallout 4], even after updates, isn't stable enough and thus we are now going out on the old version - [hence] the need for a downgrader."</p>
<p>While I think the scale of the backlash to Fallout 4's "next gen" revamp was perhaps <em>slightly</em> exorbitant, as is often the case with backlashes, Fallout London seems worth the downgrade. It's said to be around the size of the main game's Commonwealth map and Far Harbor DLC combined, and spans the capital’s boroughs from Camden to Croydon, Westminster to Hackney.</p>
<p>You'll get to fight Super-Mutants or local equivalent on the Tower Bridge, and comb the Houses of Parliament for skeleton tableau, no political metaphors detected. Everyday sights and sounds will include pubs, tube stations, red phoneboxes and buses. A very British apocalypse. I've recently moved to just outside London, where there is minimal nitrogen dioxide or Cockney rhyming slang - this is as good a way as any to walk those streets again.</p>

The damage role passive, which reduced incoming healing effectiveness when damage heroes were attacking an enemy, has been nerfed against tank heroes. The mechanic, which was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-balance-patch-passive-healing-hp-1851235801&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-balance-patch-passive-healing-hp-1851235801">added in season 9</a></span>, has been a consistent thorn in tanks’ sides and was a key part of why they lost some survivability. The passive will now only reduce healing by 10 percent, rather than the original 20. Had that been the extent of the changes, the tank role might be okay after this latest patch—But the individual buffs for each tank have made the role so powerful that the community fears the entire dynamic of an <em>Overwatch 2</em> match is going to shift.</p><p>Rather than go through each change individually, let’s focus on the best example of how the patch broke tanks: Mauga. The hero has been fairly dominant after his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-mauga-season-8-patch-notes-1851029011&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-mauga-season-8-patch-notes-1851029011">shaky introduction</a></span> last year, and he’s received some of the most significant changes in the patch. His Cardiac Overdrive ability, which allows him to heal himself as long as he’s doing damage, now allows him to heal at the equivalent of his damage output during those three seconds. This means he’s capable of tanking through even the most powerful setups. Here’s an example from @KingHydron using Bastion turret form with Mercy’s damage boost and Baptiste’s Amplification Matrix, which, by all accounts should melt anything in the game almost instantly, only for Mauga to survive through it.</p><p>He can also basically ignore high-damage ultimates like Roadhog’s just by doing damage to the enemy tank while in Cardiac Overdrive.</p><p>Not every tank has changes that result in ridiculous viral videos like that one, but it’s clear that Blizzard has beefed them up across the board. Each tank is now the bulkiest version of themselves, and it feels like the natural endgame of switching to the 5v5 format of one tank, two damage, and two support heroes. On top of cutting what was once a 12-player game into a 10-player game, <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s pivot to a one-tank team composition has been divisive since the sequel launched in 2022, as it put a lot of responsibility on the solo tank to provide defense and take up space, and the healers to keep them upright. <em>Overwatch 2 </em>funnels most of its resources into its singular tank and it feels like all other roles are essentially assisting a kaiju match.</p><p>While tanks got the most attention this patch, there are a few other grievances fans have with the latest update. DPS hero Pharah, who has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pharah-meta-season-11-patch-notes-nerf-buff-1851572626&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pharah-meta-season-11-patch-notes-nerf-buff-1851572626">frustrating fans in recent seasons</a></span>, got a few changes that ultimately didn’t address problems people have with the hero. One of the most reliable counters to her, Cassidy, was nerfed, which will only make her more of a prominent pick. So while the tank changes are considered an overcorrection, other issues have gone unaddressed in some of the community’s eyes.</p><h2 id="h118457"><a id=""></a><strong>The <em>Overwatch 2 </em>community is divided on how to fix the tank problem</strong></h2><p>While the negative reaction has been immediate and very loud, It’s important to note that the <em>Overwatch 2</em> community is full of contrasting opinions. Not everyone agrees that these massive buffs are a problem, and some even argue they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1dzt0ox/you_guys_have_been_begging_for_tank_buffs_since/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1dzt0ox/you_guys_have_been_begging_for_tank_buffs_since/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">address issues</a></span> people have had with the tank role since the swap to 5v5.</p><p>“Literally everyone and their mother was saying that the tank role was the least fun and it needed significant buffs because you were too weak and expected to do too much, while also being the primary recipient of most cc and debuffs, and literally the same day they buff all the tanks the entire sub goes up in flames over it,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1dzt0ox/you_guys_have_been_begging_for_tank_buffs_since/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1dzt0ox/you_guys_have_been_begging_for_tank_buffs_since/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user Gatt__ wrote</a></span> on the <em>Overwatch </em>subreddit. “Weren’t you guys the ones saying tanks should be like mini-bosses and shouldn’t be getting melted without a pocket healer up their ass? At least give it a week before saying this is the worst patch of all time.”</p><p>The conversation shows just how divided the <em>Overwatch </em>community is—. some believe giving tanks survivability will help the role, while others say Blizzard’s move to 5v5 structure is fundamentally flawed.</p><p>“The common sentiment was that tank sucked to play not that tank needed massive buffs,” Phasmamain wrote. “Tank has never been a weak role it’s just been an unfun one because you are taking the brunt of all damage and abilities and expected to take space for your team to make plays. Instead of gigabuffing tanks and causing more power creep they needed to tone down some of the things that countered tanks. Blizzard have become deathly afraid of nerfing things and it’s really hurting the game overall.”</p><p>Game director Aaron Keller posted on X, formerly Twitter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/aaronkellerOW/status/1806793128537637183&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/aaronkellerOW/status/1806793128537637183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on June 28</a></span> that he planned to talk about the team’s point of view on the original 6v6 format in a future Director’s Take blog or Developer Update video. Many fans have been clamoring for Blizzard to bring back a second tank since <em>Overwatch 2 </em>launched, while some believe Keller’s post suggests 6v6 might be returning. I fear that people are getting ahead of themselves. 6v6 may not have had the same problems as 5v5, but banking on a two-tank structure fixing all <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s problems is a bit myopic. Lest we forget that would no doubt bring us back to the much-maligned Double Shield Meta. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Riot Games reportedly shut down a Super Smash Bros. Melee-style game set in the League of Legends universe, codenamed Pool Party.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ReaderGrev</a>, a newsletter by former Launcher editor Mikhail Klimentov, Pool Party was canceled due to the reassessment of consumer interest in a Super Smash Bros. competitor. Riot executives were reportedly worried about MultiVersus, the Smash Bros. competitor that featured Warner Bros. characters and how it didn't seem as nearly as successful.</p><p>Pool Party's concept was reportedly also changed several times during development. Initially starting out as a hardcore fighting game, more casual mechanics and party-game elements were introduced later on. Due to the constant changes, some Riot employees reportedly became frustrated.</p><p>There were 70-80 developers reportedly working on Pool Party, and about half of them were offered different positions within Riot Games after its cancelation, while others were looking at other jobs internally. However, 10 employees were reportedly neither given offers nor were looking internally for new roles, and presumably either left Riot or were let go.</p><p>Riot Games has been expanding the League of Legends universe and creating spin-offs. Currently, Riot is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-fighting-spin-off-project-l-now-called-2xko-launches-in-2025/1100-6521282/" data-ref-id="1100-6521282">creating 2XKO, a 2D fighter</a> in the same vein as Granblue Fantasy Versus and Dragon Ball FighterZ. It is due out sometime in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/training-the-game-designers-of-tomorrow-part-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the first part of this series of publications devoted to training game and level designers, I discussed the importance of soft skills, essential complements to know-how. I presented two skills that are essential to me. In this second part, I present two others to you.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Soft skills 3 - Know how to explain your ideas and promote them">Soft skills 3 - Know how to explain your ideas and promote them</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Salesmanship">Salesmanship</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In theory, the game designer or creative director is responsible for designing the game mechanics. He or she is supposed to propose to them and develop the design documents. The rest of the team must develop the game based on these documents.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an ideal world, things seem simple: The game designer, like Father Moses on his mountain, “dictates” the design, and the team carefully executes it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But in the real life of a game designer, it doesn’t happen like that. He or she must constantly defend his or her proposals; these can be misunderstood or questioned at any time, including months after being presented to the team!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For what? The causes can be multiple.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As shocking as it sounds, the truth is that only some on a team read design documents correctly or pay attention during presentations. The consequences can then be multiple: A mechanism can be poorly implemented, a design error “goes under the radar” when it could have been corrected immediately, team members can develop assets on their own, or features can be incompatible with the design team's intentions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A final cause is the arrival of new members in the team during its development. Indeed, it will take a lot of time for them to familiarize themselves in depth with the project. Some have preconceived ideas or want to remake the game according to their tastes! It’s even worse when the newcomer is an executive, a project manager, for example, because they have significant decision-making powers. Re-explaining the game to them is not always enough.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To prevent these unwanted situations, here are some best practices.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Good practices">Good practices</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Introduce a new mechanism to the team orally, not by sending them a document and asking them to read it.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you simply send the description of a new mechanism through a written document, some people will postpone reading it until later; others will only understand some things or even read it! On the other hand, an oral presentation will be much more effective because you may be asked for explanations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Introduce a new game mechanic to the team in a simple way.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you present all the mechanism details, you will “drown” your interlocutors, and they risk not retaining the essentials. And if they do not understand your mechanism, they will not adhere to it. So, keep it simple!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Use as many diagrams as possible.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A drawing is always more effective than a text. Explaining your new mechanism with diagrams will take more preparation time, but it will be worth it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Justify your design choices using facts.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Your game design title doesn't guarantee that the rest of the team will trust your choices with their eyes closed. To support your point of view, support it with examples from games that are benchmarks in their field.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Don’t hesitate to spell out the basics.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many design choices are based on knowledge that only some share. For example, only some know that very long-term retention is one of the success factors of a free-to-play game. If you use such a mechanic for your game but people need to be aware of its importance, they may find your mechanic unnecessarily complex.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Prepare and maintain a document describing high-level design choices.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This document will be used when new members join the team.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Case study">Case study</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like my previous publication, I will illustrate the importance of mastering this skill by describing a situation I witnessed or experienced. Of course, the names are fictitious to preserve the anonymity of each person.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Terry is the sole game designer in a large team working on an action-adventure game. As the game experience focuses on narrative and level design, Terry is also in charge of writing the level design of each room.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Terry writes very detailed documents for each room, describing their content and all the actions that will occur there. But that's not all: Due to the storyline, most rooms will be visited several times by players, and each time, the room's contents change. As a result, Terry must write complex design documents that describe each room at different stages.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>This represents immense work, indeed too much for one person. Terry, therefore, simply sends his level design documents to the new lead level designer who has just joined the team. After all, if he has the slightest question, she is convinced he will return to her!</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>But, the lead designer needs to gain experience. He misunderstands the documents sent to him and does not ask for explanations, either for fear of appearing incapable or for lack of professionalism.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>After many weeks, the lead level designer complained to the new project manager that Terry's level design documents were unusable. The new project manager, too, is a newcomer; he was recruited to reorganize production, which was falling dangerously behind schedule. The young project manager, knowing little about the team and the project, looks no further; he withdraws his trust from Terry, who saw nothing coming.</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Soft skills 4 - Be kind">Soft skills 4 - Be kind</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The boomerang effect">The boomerang effect</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Caring? But what does this have to do with professional success?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In short, professional success is often associated with “human” success, with the ability to create solid and authentic bonds with colleagues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why is this so important? After all, skills should come first. Much of the reason for this importance concerns the game development process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game development is never “a long, quiet river”; instead, it is the tumultuous descent of a mountain river. Indeed, development rarely goes as planned: Dissensions within the team, technical or design problems, poor communication, delays, work overload, fatigue linked to the length of development, lack of experience, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, a team is often made up of passionate people who invest heavily. If they have an oversized ego, they make development a personal matter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All of this can generate a lot of tension and sometimes (often) lead to conflict.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this context, the quality of your relationships with the rest of the team is essential.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you have managed to create friendly ties with your teammates, if they know that you are honest, if they want to work with you, in short, if they have understood that you are a caring person towards them, the problems and misunderstandings will be much easier to overcome. Above all, they will not degenerate into an open crisis.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Good practices">Good practices</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Treat everyone with the same respect regardless of their role on the team.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Take the time to greet everyone</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and chat with them regularly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Make the effort to listen to what others tell you.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> It may not be relevant to you, but it is to them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Be open to criticism and comments from others</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and show that you take them into account.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Don't say bad things about one of your colleagues</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">... even if it's deserved! Assume that everything you say is likely to be repeated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Do not try to defend yourself by accusing others</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">; they will remember it.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Case study">Case study</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sanjeev was one of two game designers on a team working on an RPG. When he joined the project, the team management was impressed by his performance: Sanjeev demonstrated good knowledge of games and excellent analytical skills. He was also very reliable, delivering on time and following instructions precisely. He was good at what he did…maybe too good.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The team members began to feel uncomfortable around him. Every day, upon entering the studio, Sanjeev would barely greet anyone crossing his path and head straight to his office. He didn't take the time to chat informally or say hello. He seemed distant.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>During meetings, team members felt uncomfortable when Sanjeev was present: He rarely spoke, and when he did speak, he gave the impression that he was the only competent person in the room! And at the slightest comment on the results of the playtests relating to his design, he always found an argument to discredit the latter.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Team members started to run away from him.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Conversely, the other game designer was warmer with the team and demonstrated a great sense of listening. He defended his points of view and was frank, but the team felt he was constructive. The team members turned to him spontaneously.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>When the project was redesigned, the other game designer was responsible for redefining the gameplay. Sanjeev was sidelined, not for lack of know-how but solely because of his attitude; for the team, he was an unsympathetic, contemptuous person who seemed little involved in the project.</span></span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="To be continued …">To be continued …</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the next part of this publication, I will discuss an aspect of game designer work that is often overlooked: the role of design in marketing and communication.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/training-the-game-designers-of-tomorrow-part-1-of-5-">Link to part 1</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pascal Luban</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game designer &amp; creative director, freelance</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">28+ years of experience serving game developers and publishers</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamedesignstudio.com/">www.gamedesignstudio.com</a></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Blogger</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pascal Luban is a freelance creative director and game designer based in France.

		<p>Nintendo are either teasing a new horror game for Nintendo Switch, or taking one of the more unusual directions for a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> reveal, with the release of a creepy new teaser trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="Emio" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hq_NGMM2FWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So who, or what, is Emio? Well, per <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/07/nintendo-releases-mysterious-emio-teaser-trailer">Gematsu</a>, the trailer in Japan is titled “The Smiling Man”, while US and EU regional accounts have titled it “Emio”, though that doesn’t really answer the question.</p>
<p>The Japanese video also links to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/emio/index.html">this teaser website</a>.</p>
<p>So… who wants some baseless speculation?</p>

<p>There’s obviously some jokes to be made that Nintendo could be taking a very PlayStation 2 direction for the reveal of their next console:</p>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation 2 advert: Welcome To The Third Space | 2000 | #20YearsOfPlay" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Laf9vpJMDjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alternatively, this is a gritty reboot of the Luigi’s Mansion series, despite the popularity of the games with their original family friendly form of spookiness.</p>
<p>But we’d put our money on something completely different. Nintendo doesn’t have the greatest history with horror games themselves, with just a few notable exceptions. It was really during the Nintendo GameCube era that the Japanese company tried to shake off the reputation as being exclusively about kids and family friendly games. During that time Nintendo published Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem by Silicon Knights (who shut down in 2014), and penned the exclusivity deal with Capcom for the GameCube exclusivity of the Resident Evil, Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil 4.</p>
<p>All of that is to say, this is definitely <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/02/capcom-confirms-the-next-resident-evil-is-coming-from-resident-evil-7-director/">Resident Evil 9</a> and it’s a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive.</p>
<p>Or maybe not.</p>
<p>I don’t know.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/once-human-review-bomb-prompts-publisher-to-address-privacy-concerns.923784/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/once-human-review-bomb-privacy-netease-response<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Once Human</em>, a new post-apocalyptic free-to-play game, is being review-bombed by concerned players over what they perceive to be an overly invasive privacy policy, prompting a response from publisher NetEase.</p>
<p>A quick look at the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam review page</a> shows an abundance of negative reviews, many of them pointing to the game's privacy policy (although some are simply criticizing the game's mechanics and content).</p>
<p>One user <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/dShmoni/recommended/2139460/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">describes</a> what they see as the "over-collection of personal information" and "security risks", while another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971480044/recommended/2139460/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> they "nope[d] the hell out and exited" after reading&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>'s terms of service.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/once-human-privacy-concerns-review-bomb-bow.jpg?itok=RrAzHdie 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/once-human-privacy-concerns-review-bomb-bow.jpg?itok=Ze-XNoMi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Post-apocalyptic survival game&nbsp;<em>Once Human&nbsp;</em>is racking up a lot of negative reviews right now.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20240710/40780_1166424.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new FAQ</a> on&nbsp;the official&nbsp;<em>Once Human&nbsp;</em>website, publisher NetEase responds to players' concerns by describing how it uses the data it collects and attempting to allay fears regarding the collection of unnecessary information.</p>
<p>NetEase says it "only collect[s] and use[s] personal data according to specific purposes". For instance, the studio says it would only "collect government-issued IDs" if local laws required it to, pointing to prize distribution, the need to identify a user's parent for consent, or if a user "wishes to correct their age information".</p>
<p>The publisher also clarifies that the "Chinese named program" running in the background of&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>&nbsp;is a WebView Helper, which "supports WebView page rendering" within the game.</p>
<p>Lastly, NetEase says that it's not necessary to download the NetEase Launcher if you're playing <em>Once Human</em> on Steam or the Epic Store, although it is needed if you've downloaded the game through NetEase's official website.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/once-human-privacy-concerns-review-bomb-monument.jpg?itok=YVId16_v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/once-human-privacy-concerns-review-bomb-monument.jpg?itok=Rgx_3yYe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>NetEase has attempted to quell&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>&nbsp;privacy concerns.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not NetEase's assurances do anything to allay users' fears about privacy remains to be seen, but it's not the only weirdness surrounding&nbsp;<em>Once Human&nbsp;</em>right now.</p>
<p>Yesterday, just before&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>'s launch, NetEase revealed that players would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/once-human-faq-one-character">only be able to create a single character per account at launch</a>, with multi-character creation support arriving sometime in August.</p>
<p>However, after players criticized this decision, NetEase almost immediately reversed it, announcing yesterday that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460/view/4230650600759863513" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multi-character creation was now possible</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure why NetEase decided to restrict character creation in the first place. In the aforementioned FAQ, the studio says this decision was made "due to technical issues", but the fact that it was so easy to reverse casts an uneasy light on the whole matter.</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>&nbsp;is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices, assuming that you can stomach its privacy policy.</p>

            <p>Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka wants to know why the hell Sonic Team haven’t made their own Sonic The Hedgehog <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> yet. He sounds positively hysterical about it, hopping mad, which you know, mate, you’ve been running the show since 2008. You’ve been working on Sonic games since <em>1994</em>. I too yearn to bound through the Star Post portal and into a world where Sonic has to min-max his trainers and do companion quests for Big The Cat. The spinning ball of spines is in your court, Iizuka-san. The people of Mobius are ready. Mario has had that genre all to himself for long enough.</p><!--more-->
<p>Iizuka made these innocent remarks during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNeWQbiawnk">a Good Vibes Gaming interview</a> at a Sonic x Shadow Generations preview event - this being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/keanu-reeves-to-play-shadow-in-the-sonic-3-movie-as-sega-announce-the-year-of-shadow">the year of Shadow</a>. They were subsequently pounced upon by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-team-head-wants-to-make-a-sonic-rpg-before-he-retires-from-sega">Eurogamer</a>’s Ed Nightingale, who notes that Sonic Team have worked on RPGs in the past, such as Phantasy Star Universe, and as such, have no excuses save boring commercial ones.</p>
<p>"Personally, I really like role-playing games," he said. "The RPG game format is a lot of fun and I've even thought to myself you know, for the past 30 years we haven't done a Sonic RPG. And I'm questioning myself. Why haven't we done a Sonic RPG in all this time? How have we gotten to 30 years with no RPGs?!" </p>
<p>"So I'd like to hopefully work on a Sonic RPG at some point before I retire from Sega,” Iizuka went on. “But you know, that's just a dream right now. There are no concrete plans at this point." Again, Mr Iizuka, I must loom sinisterly and remind you that you are the head of Sonic Team. Make those plans concrete. Yes, I know it’s more complicated than this, I know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-cancel-hyenas-and-several-unannounced-games-due-to-covid-era-losses">Sega aren’t in the mood for passion projects at the moment</a>, but come now - the only extant official Sonic RPG is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Chronicles%3A_The_Dark_Brotherhood">a third-party project for Nintendo DS</a>, which I’m not allowed to write about or Graham will break my knees.</p>
<p>I want a Sonic Team-made Sonic RPG for exactly two reasons: I think it might be great, and I think it might be awful. Sonic games have a habit of veering in either direction, especially those released after 2001, but perhaps those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-mania">Mania</a> people fancy another bite of the apple. Either way, it’s an entertaining prospect. Gotta go fast? No Sonic, you gotta go after Tails has his turn, and also, you’re out of mana, so no spin-dash for you. It’s just as well that we have <a href="https://ethybb8-games.itch.io/sonic-rpg">Itch.io developers to fill the gap</a>.</p>

NBA Legend Vince Carter will be the cover star for the chunky NBA 2K25 Hall of Fame Edition.</p><p>Ball Over Everything is the slogan for NBA 2K25, which puts an NBA and WNBA player on the same cover for the first time ever. Tatum called his appearance on the cover "humbling" even after winning the NBA Championship with the Boston Celtics, while back-to-back WNBA champion, two-time WNBA Most Valuable Player, and six-time WNBA All-Star Wilson said her appearance is a testament to the women's league's growth.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>NBA 2K25 Covers and First Look</h3></div></output><p>"Being featured on the NBA 2K25 cover is a big moment for me and a testament to the ever-growing fandom of the WNBA," she said. "Seeing more and more WNBA athletes scanned into NBA 2K25 to best capture the style and confidence of the league has been empowering, and I can't wait for fans to experience it in-game."</p><p>NBA 2K25 promises the usual MyCAREER and MyTEAM modes on all platforms, though PS5 and Xbox Series X and S, and PC players will gain access to additional features too. This includes "a sixth era in MyNBA, a more compact and interactive City, the chance to cement their G.O.A.T. status in The W," and cross-play.</p><p>The Standard Edition of NBA 2K25 has Tatum on the cover and costs $69.99 on all platforms except Nintendo Switch, where it's available for $59.99. The WNBA Edition is a GameStop exclusive and is a repackaged version of the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S physical editions with Wilson on the cover, available for $69.99.</p><p>The All-Star Edition has both aforementioned athletes on the front, costs $99.99, and comes with 100,000 VC; MyTEAM content including 10 Player Cards (and three above 89 OVR), 3 Diamond Shoe Cards, 3 Takeover Boost, and 1 Amethyst Coach Card; and MyCAREER content including 150 Skill Boosts, 75 Gatorade Boosts, the Jayson Tatum Cover Jersey, Jayson Tatum Electric Skateboard Skin, and a 2K25 Cover Stars Design T-Shirt.</p><p>Finally, the Hall of Fame Edition has Carter on the front is available with limited availability until September 8 for $149.9 for all platforms except the Nintendo Switch. It includes everything included in the All-Star Edition plus a MyCAREER Vince Carter Cover Jersey, a Season 1 Pro Pass with four upfront Pro Pass rewards, and a 12 month subscription to the real world NBA League Pass.</p><p>NBA 2K is the only mainline basketball franchise available but has faced criticism over its intrinsic microtransactions and in recent years over its forced open world elements. NBA 2K25 appears to be addressing one of those complaints with the "more compact and interactive city" on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p><p>In our 6/10 review of the last game, IGN said: "NBA 2K24 scores big with gameplay, but its microtransaction tactics feel like a costly turnover."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
