            <p>If you really dug <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s Far Harbor DLC, you'll be glad to know a couple of modders have been gradually working away at adding a bunch more post-apocalyptic versions of real-life islands off the coast of New England to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s map for a little while now. Following the release of their first atomic-boomed atoll, Boon Island, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-4-mod-boon-island-isles-of-new-england">last year</a>, the pair have just released a trip to Massachusetts' Misery islands.</p>

<p>"What was once known for its scenic paths and seaside cottages now lies in quiet ruin, its history steeped in corruption, decay, and loneliness," reads the description modders Tenhats and Shreddah4 have penned for their latest creation, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/87983?tab=description">Misery Island - Isles Of New England</a>. Seriously, I hadn't heard of Great Misery Island and Little Misery Island near Salem, but they don't half sound like regular old England when introduced like that.</p>
<p>The two islands, which got their name thanks to a 17th century shipbuilder who ended up stranded during a winter storm, have been brought back to life in lore-friendly form as a location you can visit to explore, do some questing, or build a settlement. There's plenty of environmental storytelling inspired by the islands' real-life histories and backstory to uncover by poking about, as you listen to a new radio station and keep an eye out for some new gear.</p><p>If you're wondering what the isles'll have to uncover in terms of ruins, a leaf through the <a href="https://thetrustees.org/content/misery-islands-history/">account of their histories</a> from the trust which currently controls them reveals that prior to 1900, a guy called Daniel Neville owned the Misery Islands and was nicknamed "Lord of the Isles". His family then sold them to a group of Boston investors called the Misery Island Syndicate, who tried to turn the bigger island into a summer resort for posh holidaymakers, but quickly ran into money trouble. The ruins of that resort and other cottages which weren't destroyed in a 1926 fire remain, so it'll be interesting to see what sorts of Fallouty twists the modders have managed to work into that backstory.</p>
<p>Tenhats and Shreddah4 recommend that you hit level 25 or above before heading to the Misery Islands, which you can reach by seaplane from either Boston Airport in the main map or Far Harbor. By some miracle, the mod's description notes that it should be compatible with Fallout 4's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/maybe-hold-off-a-bit-longer-on-reinstalling-your-fallout-4-mods-as-bethesda-have-two-anniversary-update-patches-planned">recently-released anniversary edition</a> and well as the old gen and next gen versions.</p>
<p>In terms of requirements, the modders say you'll need the Far Harbor DLC and suggest you use a mod manager to install their creation. Then, you'll be ready to head off on a truly misery-filled holiday.</p>

He threw himself into Arc Raiders upon its explosive launch, and in a recent <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2620949329" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Twitch stream</u></a> reacted to The Game Awards nominations reveal to suggest that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-publisher-defends-generative-ai-use-insists-every-game-company-is-now-using-it">the game’s controversial AI-generated voice work</a> had contributed to it missing out on recognition for GOTY.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The world is just not ready for AI in video games, not yet,” Shroud said. “They're just not ready. But, hey, at least they nominated it for something. I genuinely thought they wouldn't nominate it for anything because they were scared to get backlash. But at least they nominated it for something, so that's good.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shroud continued: "Once again, another year, another rigged year. That's crazy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the end of 2025 in sight, single-player role-playing game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has emerged as a frontrunner for GOTY. Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive Donkey Kong Bananza is also up for GOTY, which Shroud certainly took issue with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Imagine Donkey Kong, too… if Donkey Kong would win, this award show is just chalked,” Shroud said. “Who the f*** is playing Donkey Kong Bananza? Nobody’s playing Donkey Kong Bananza. Nobody. That is insane.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Admitting Expedition 33 is probably going to win GOTY, Shroud said he hoped Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 would emerge victorious instead. He believed Arc Raiders will win best Multiplayer, and Battlefield 6 will win best Action. He expressed confusion that Arc Raiders was not nominated for best Audio Design, given the plaudits it has received in that area.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Shroud had previously claimed that voting in The Game Awards doesn’t matter. “All the f***ing awards are rigged anyway, who cares?” he said. “When have you ever seen an award that’s actually legit?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Geoff Keighley’s The Game Awards uses a combination of votes from the games media and influencers as well as public fan voting. The voting jury has in the past had more of an influence on the outcome. Keighley has said he’s considered going all in on public voting for The Game Awards, but expressed concerns about “social engineering.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Awards ceremony is set for December 11, 2025 at 5pm PT/8pm ET.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Ghost of Yotei has a unique feature that allows players to press a button to travel back in time to see what main character Atsu was doing many years prior. This is available at specific places in the game world, but the original plan at Sucker Punch was to allow players to do this anywhere, any time.</p><p>Creative director Jason Connell said in a conversation with Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan that this feature was something he was "very excited about" when it was originally pitched years ago. He said the appeal was that players could be at one moment experiencing Atsu's story in the main timeline when things are dark and bleak and she's on her lone wolf quest, and the next they could travel back in time and feel the "warmth of her past" and understand what she's fighting for.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKJWi6Pagmw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1552">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NKJWi6Pagmw?start=1552" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"It started off as, 'Let's do that as many places we can, maybe everywhere,'" Connell said. "Like, can we do this as like a, like a stake-in-the-ground game feature?"</p><p>However, after about a year of working on this, and with the understanding that it would require double the art, Sucker Punch had to scale it back and only have this feature available in certain areas of the game. "So while it's this amazing feature, it saddened me the day that I had to to kill that and narrow it. But in the end, it was the right choice," he said.</p><p>Connell said the decision to narrow the feature came after feedback from testers and in discussions with colleagues. While Connell said he feels confident it was the right call, it was still "hard" for him.</p><p>He added that, had the feature been available across the entirety of the game, it ran the risk of feeling like a "gimmick" if Sucker Punch couldn't back it up with enough "meat" to make it worthwhile, narratively speaking.</p><p>Gilligan, for his part, said the situation could be like the delicate balance of salt on french fries.</p><p>"It's like salt on your french fries. There's nothing better than just the right amount of salt on your french fries. And then when you overdo it, you're like, 'Ugh, these are too damn salty,'" he said.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei review</a> praised the game overall, and specifically the time-travel mechanic. "By visiting her home and specific locations around Ezo, you can step into the past and revisit fond memories from her childhood, such as practicing sword fighting with her brother and working with her weaponsmith father in the family's forge," reviewer Richard Wakeling said.</p><p>"These windows into the past create further empathy for a character who eventually goes on to inflict brutal violence. You can feel the weight of her loss in each moment, and this persists throughout the game as you explore more and more of Ezo."</p><p>Ghost of Yotei launched in early October and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-sales-draw-even-with-ps4-and-ghost-of-yotei-has-a-big-debut/1100-6536128/" data-ref-id="1100-6536128">exceeded 3 million sales so far.</a></p>

<p>"Across the opening weekend, we've seen a great response to the quality and depth of gameplay in Black Ops 7," it wrote, adding there will be more to come.</p>
<p>However, many have pointed out that the tone in this latest release post, which Activision acknowledges every year, is a little less enthusiastic than previous examples. </p>
<p>Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>, for example, received a post boasting about the game's stats. "#1 Total Players, #1 Hours Played, #1 Total Matches," it read, with Activision thanking the fan base for making Black Ops 6 "the biggest Call of Duty ever".</p>
<p>You can see the two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> posts side by side below.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to The Game Business' Chris Dring, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 had "a smaller UK retail launch (physical sales) than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>" based on GfK data. Black Ops 7 also has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-the-lowest-metacritic-user-score-ever-for-a-call-of-duty-game">the lowest metacritic user score for a Call of Duty game ever</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-underperforms-on-steam-during-launch-weekend-but-does-that-mean-the-games-sold-badly">Steam player numbers have been lower than other series entries</a>.</p><p>Black Ops 7 has also come under fire for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards">apparent use of generative AI</a>. This matter was recently brought up by US Congressman Ro Khanna who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-members-of-the-us-congress-are-pushing-back-against-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-ai-use">responded to Activision Blizzard's AI use in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 by highlighting the need for AI regulations in the United States of America</a>.</p>
<p>"A shift away from single-player leaves Call of Duty with its most lopsided and homogenous entry in decades, though what it does offer is consistently good fun when accepted on its own terms," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Eurogamer's Black Ops 7 review</a>.</p>

It’s also making a gaming headset to compete with Meta. These are big, ambitious, and messy efforts, and we have <em>lots</em> of questions. So do you!</p><div><p>We’ve gotten a lot of questions about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/819080/valve-brings-back-steam-machines-steam-os-steam-frame-news-announcements">Valve’s huge 2026 hardware push</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/819080/valve-brings-back-steam-machines-steam-os-steam-frame-news-announcements#dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODE4NjIy">entry into the console wars</a>, and we’re compiling the answers we’ve got so far. Some of them are direct answers to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama">your subscriber questions in our AMA</a>; thank you for paying our salaries!</p></div><p>So, let’s start with…</p><div><p id="what-is-a-steam-machine"><h2>What is a Steam Machine?</h2></p></div><p>The Steam Machine is a specific living room gaming PC coming out in early 2026. It’s not your typical Windows PC. The 6-inch cube is barely bigger than a box of Kleenex (bless you), can come bundled with a wireless controller that connects directly to the box, and runs Windows games on the pick-up-and-play SteamOS. It’s basically a game console.</p><p><strong>So the Steam Machine is just a big stationary Steam Deck for the TV?</strong></p><p>Basically! Valve says it has six times the performance, will run all the same games, and runs the exact same SteamOS underneath. Valve says you can even pop the microSD card out of your Steam Deck, put it in the Steam Machine, and your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818602/valve-steam-deck-machine-frame-microsd-card-game-cartridges">games should just work</a>.</p><p><strong>I don’t have a box of Kleenex handy. How small is it </strong><strong><em>really</em></strong><strong>? </strong></p><p>To be exact, Valve tells us it’s 152mm tall (148mm without feet), 162.4mm deep, and 156mm wide. The Nintendo GameCube is 150mm tall, 161mm deep, and 110mm wide, so they’re pretty close.</p><p><strong>Can I call it the GabeCube?</strong></p><p>We won’t stop you! Because you can swap out the front plate, there are lots of fun puns to turn into reality, like <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsub%2F469%2F" rel="sponsored">The Orange Box</a>. Or take Dbrand’s suggestion to make it a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819863/dbrand-companion-cube-valve-steam-machine-skin">Companion Cube</a>.</p><p><strong>How much will it cost?</strong></p><p>We don’t know. Valve won’t tell us yet.</p><p><strong>Wait, Valve announced a console and won’t even say what it costs? </strong></p><p>Yeah, Valve says it hasn’t finalized the price. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview#:~:text=more%20expensive%20lately%3F-,Yazan%20Aldehayyat%3A,-If%20you%27re%20trying">Valve told <em>IGN</em> </a>that it’ll be “as affordable as possible.” Valve told us it’ll be “positioned closer to the entry level of the PC space” and “very competitive with a PC you could build yourself from parts.” And Valve <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/valve-brings-back-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-hands-on-with-valves-new-amd-based-living-room-gaming-hardware#:~:text=The%20market%20is%20kind%20of%20weird%20right%20now%2C">told <em>Tom’s Hardware</em></a> it’s aiming for “a great value,” but it’s tough to price right now because “the market is kind of weird” and “<a href="http://ontinue-to-soar/">memory prices are going up</a> like right as we speak.”</p><p><strong>Does it come with <em>Half-Life 3</em>?</strong></p><p>Do you <em>really</em> think Valve can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpw2ebhTSKs">count to three</a>? As we are writing this, no. But Valve is maybe, kind of, possibly, sort of, potentially hinting that… something… <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/820533/valve-secrecy-security-guards-steam-machine-valve-hq-no-hl3">might be revealed soon</a>.</p><p>Need more “hopium,” as the cool kids call it? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660946/half-life-3-is-playable-end-to-end%5C">Here</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/1/24333632/2025-is-another-great-year-to-be-excited-for-half-life-3">you</a> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/half-life-3-confirmed-every-insider-is-pointing-at-november-19-for-the-big-day-and-im-also-huffing-hopium/">go</a>.</p><p><strong>Does it come with a gamepad?</strong></p><p>You can save money by buying it without one, but it can also come bundled with this Steam Controller:</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><strong>What in the Dreamcast is that?</strong></p><p>It’s the Steam Controller, and it has its own section, scroll down! Or you can bring your own gamepad.</p><p><strong>Is the new Steam box more powerful than a PS5? Why is everyone tweeting “8GB VRAM” like it’s an insult?</strong></p><p>Some PC gamers are getting <em>real </em>tired of good GPUs hamstrung by insufficient video memory, and the Steam Machine’s 8GB isn’t a lot for a console that claims it can do 4K! That said, Valve is upfront that you’re only getting 4K after using AMD’s FSR upscaling, and the PS5 has to rely on upscaling techniques too.</p><p>We don’t truly know how powerful the Steam Machine is, but both its specs and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement#:~:text=On%20a%204K%20TV%2C%20the%20demanding%20Cyberpunk%202077%20benchmark">our early <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> test</a> suggest we’re looking at PS5-plus, <em>maybe</em> PS5 Pro graphics. (It has a newer Zen 4 CPU, and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Radeon-RX-7600M-XT-vs-Radeon-RX-7600S-vs-Radeon-RX-7600M_11550_11556_11552.247598.0.html">the closest AMD GPUs</a> boast a similar number of teraflops to that of the PS5 Pro.)</p><p><strong>How upgradable is the Steam Machine?</strong></p><p>Not terribly! It’s a proprietary motherboard with a soldered CPU and GPU, so you can’t upgrade those unless Valve offers them as a package deal. But the SSD storage should be easy (M.2 2280 or 2230 sticks are swappable), and it takes standard DDR5 laptop memory modules.</p><p><strong>Does it do HDR and VRR? FSR4 and frame gen?</strong></p><p>Both the HDMI and DisplayPort offer HDR, but they only support the AMD FreeSync flavor of variable refresh rate (VRR) for smooth gameplay even when your frame rate dips. Valve says it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama?commentID=a3b10546-2a76-4a4c-8af6-92e1ab2122f8">“hoping to improve” the FreeSync implementation</a>, too.</p><p>Valve’s official answer on FSR: “Steam Machine supports the AMD technologies that AMD supports on RDNA3 hardware, including FSR 3 and frame gen.” It’s a Navi 33 GPU, so a version of FSR 4 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqDWJCW06Ks">might be technically possible</a>…</p><p><strong>Can it play </strong><strong><em>Fortnite</em></strong><strong>? Will it play [INSERT GAME HERE]?</strong></p><div><p>Linux can now play almost any Windows game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/807711/xbox-ally-sleep-fail-bazzite-fix-performance">many of them better than Windows</a>. But the main exceptions are big multiplayer games so lucrative that their publishers insist on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">powerful anti-cheat systems that don’t allow Linux</a> because the fear <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999300/fortnite-on-steam-deck-sweeney-says-valve-needs-tens-of-millions-of-users-to-justify-it">currently outweighs</a> the Linux opportunity.</p></div><p>That means multiplayer games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>,<em> GTA Online</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Destiny 2</em>, Roblox, and sports games like <em>EA FC</em> all won’t work on SteamOS.</p><p>“We hope that the launch of Machine will change the equation around anti-cheat support and increase its support,” Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-battlefield-6-work-on-steam-machine-valve-hopes-its-new-hardware-will-prompt-a-fresh-discussion-with-developers-over-kernel-level-anti-cheat">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. Sounds like Valve is just crossing its fingers.</p><p><strong>Can I put Windows on it to play those games?</strong></p><p>Valve won’t stop you! It’ll even help by making Windows drivers available at its website (not through Windows Update). Just know its track record of Windows support for SteamOS hardware <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/10/22971108/valve-steam-deck-windows-runs-drivers-no-support">isn’t great</a>, and we think we’re <em>still</em> waiting for Valve’s own dual-boot solution.</p><p><strong>If this runs Linux, how is it playing Windows games?</strong></p><p>Short version: it tricks Windows games into thinking they’re running on Windows.</p><p>For the long version, here’s Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais:</p><div><blockquote><p>You’re going to be playing it through Proton, which is essentially a distribution<a href="https://www.winehq.org/"> of Wine</a>, bundled with everything you would need to run any sort of game that’s made for Windows.</p><p>The game itself is a Windows executable, right? At a core level, the Linux operating system does not even know how to load the program, and so, instead of invoking it through the OS, you invoke it through Proton, which is going to do the first step of setting up the address space, loading the segments of code into memory. The code coming from the app is all x86, and so Proton is a facilitator. It puts the code of the existing code of the app in a format and a layout that the Linux OS can understand and then starts executing that code.</p><p>Whenever that game code makes an API call for something it was built against in its original development environment, either just a core C runtime library or higher-level APIs like DirectX or DirectSound, or USB enumeration or input — whenever the game calls those functions, those functions exist in Proton’s code, and it’s going to be Proton implementing that and giving you results. Or giving the game a result based on the Linux OS, as opposed to the other environment that the game was designed for.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Wait a second. Didn’t Valve do this already?</strong></p><p>This isn’t actually the first Steam Machine! <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future">The original</a> from 2013 never went on sale but was meant to show third-party manufacturers the way; those third-party efforts (like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5281824/steam-machines-are-here-how-alienware-is-realizing-valve-console-dream">Alienware Steam Machine</a>) flopped, and Valve seemingly abandoned the idea in 2015.</p><p><strong>So what makes Valve think it’ll work this time around?</strong></p><p>Valve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22579747/valve-steam-deck-steam-machines-editorial">learned its lesson</a> with the Steam Deck handheld, which the company built itself and uses a compatibility layer to make Windows games play great on the Linux-based SteamOS, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc">the device didn’t flop</a>. Now it’s bringing everything it learned to a box for your TV.</p><p><strong>Are we getting third-party Steam Machines again?</strong></p><p>Maybe! Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais tells us Valve is “excited to partner” with companies on Steam Machines like it did with Lenovo on a SteamOS handheld. “I think the first step is for us to ship what we have, and it will maybe show the way. Then it’s all based on the conversations we have after that.”</p><p><strong>Okay, so just how flexible is this new Steam Machine? Does it run Discord for chatting, OBS for streaming? What about Netflix and other streaming apps? </strong></p><p>Yes, yes, and yes. It’s a PC with an optional desktop mode, and you can find a whole app catalog there. Steam carries OBS Studio for livestreaming, too.</p><p>And since it’s a SteamOS device like the Steam Deck, you’ll almost certainly be able to use one of the many available web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to launch streaming services, then <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?si=xyHHwsqpQZQ182sR&amp;v=RCVy2BzxzN8&amp;feature=youtu.be">turn them into more easily accessible web apps</a>.</p><p>They may not look their best on a 4K TV, though. Even on a Windows PC, many streaming apps don’t offer the same quality 4K HDR Dolby streams they do on even a cheap streaming stick.</p><p><strong>What about other game stores like Epic, GOG, Battle.net? Can I stream games from GeForce Now and Xbox Cloud? </strong></p><p>If it’s like Steam Deck, the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/">Heroic Games Launcher</a> and Lutris can let you more easily access games from other stores on your Steam Deck, though you have to do a bit of work to get them set up.</p><p>Same deal with game streaming. You’ll have to do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hhscoRV9Ew">a little legwork</a> to get them set up in Game Mode alongside your other Steam games. Oh, and you should be able to stream games from your PS5 to the Steam Machine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xT0OPMNeXJs">with Chiaki</a>.</p><p><strong>Can I install game mods?</strong> <strong>Could I use it as a Plex server?</strong></p><p>It’s doable, including in Bethesda games like <em>Skyrim</em> and <em>Fallout</em>. Just don’t always expect it to be easy. And it looks like Plex has a service for Arch Linux, which underpins SteamOS and thus the Steam Machine, but we’ve never tried it!</p><p><strong>That sounds great. So I can replace my gaming PC with a Steam Machine?</strong></p><p>Probably not for the latest AAA releases on high settings. And unless you dual-boot into Windows, you can’t play a bunch of the biggest multiplayer games because their anti-cheat software doesn’t work on Linux. But if your gaming PC is getting old and you’re good with PS5-level performance…</p><p><strong>I can work with that. What’s there to be worried about?</strong></p><p>It might cost way too much — people are still used to spending $500 or less on the console beneath their TV! It also just might not work as well as a Steam Deck crossed with a PlayStation. We’ve only used it briefly, we don’t know exactly how capable the hardware is yet, and compatibility layers make it less of a sure thing than a PS5, which has games specifically made for it.</p><p>That said, we were pretty impressed during our initial hands-on, especially with the new Steam Controller.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="what-is-a-steam-controller"><h2>What is a Steam Controller? </h2></p></div><div><p>It’s Valve’s new controller, and some of us <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">might be</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fhhwjX1je50">a teensy bit impressed with it</a>.</p></div><p><strong>What’s so impressive?</strong></p><p>This one might soon rule the roost where PCs are concerned. It now feels like a traditional gamepad in the hands — unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price">original Steam Controller</a> — but with all the extra inputs and unprecedented customizability of the Steam Deck’s integrated gamepad. It has new TMR joysticks and capacitive sensors in the grips, a D-pad, four face buttons, two bumpers, two triggers, four back buttons, four menu buttons, a gyro, and two touchpads for replicating a mouse or trackball or for simultaneous two-thumb typing.</p><p><strong>Will I have to replace this controller in a year because the sticks start to drift?</strong></p><p>Probably not! Valve is using custom drift-resistant TMR (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">tunneling magnetoresistance</a>) joysticks in the controllers. Magnetic joysticks like these are getting more common in aftermarket pads, but Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft haven’t made the switch yet.</p><p><strong>I can’t get over the touchpads. Why are they tilted? They look uncomfortable. </strong></p><p>They might be! We only got to try the new controller for a few minutes. But we’re fans so far, and Valve says people preferred it this way. You don’t hold a gamepad the way you do a wide Steam Deck, do you?</p><p><strong>What about the grip sensors, what will those do?</strong></p><p>“Grip Sense” tells when you’re fully gripping it, and you can use that as a virtual on/off button to do whatever you want in games. A Valve employee wanted it for easier gyro aiming: just grip the controller to activate, no need to move your thumb off the face buttons or joysticks. It could be handy for fine-tuned aiming in FPS games.</p><p><strong>How do I charge the controller?</strong></p><p>The controller comes with a puck that doubles as a charging station and a low-latency access point for up to four gamepads. Just slide the puck under the controller, and it will magnetically snap into place for charging.</p><p>It’s called the “Steam Controller Puck,” but a Valve employee said that internally, it was called <a href="https://x.com/8izzozero/status/1988793330998927588">the “chongle,”</a> so do with that what you will.</p><p><strong>Does it have a headphone jack? I like the one on the DualSense and Xbox controllers.</strong></p><p>No, unfortunately. “We just didn’t feel like it was necessary,” hardware engineer Steve Cardinali <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/820747/the-steam-controller-doesnt-have-a-headphone-jack-and-valve-told-us-why-kind-of">tells us</a>.</p><p><strong>How many Steam Controllers can you connect to the Steam Machine?</strong></p><p>You can connect up to four to the computer’s internal antenna, which is dedicated to Steam Controllers. Each extra puck supports four more pads. Valve’s engineers told us they tried 16 controllers, though that isn’t officially supported.</p><p><strong>Can I use my own controller with the Steam Machine? Which ones? What about keyboard and mouse?</strong></p><p>Keyboard, mouse, your PS5 DualSense or Switch Pro Controller, practically any Bluetooth gamepad, and even some racing wheels should work! Steam Input natively supports many of their extra buttons and gyros, and will let you remap and assign macros on just about anything. Even the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/12/11/24319049/psa-youve-got-another-year-to-save-your-google-stadia-gamepad-from-a-wired-only-existence">Google Stadia controller</a> is supported. The Xbox One controller may not work, though. Valve tells us it’s still figuring out how to support the Xbox One wireless adapter for Windows.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="what-is-a-steam-frame"><h2>What is a Steam Frame?</h2></p></div><p>Valve’s new SteamOS VR headset is designed to play both flat-screen and VR games. It’s a standalone headset with an Arm chip, like the Meta Quest, and it can play Windows games locally or off a microSD card <em>because Valve now has an emulator for Windows on Arm, too</em>.</p><p>It can also stream your games from a nearby PC with very low latency using a dedicated wireless adapter and eye-tracking cameras.</p><p><strong>Why does that matter for the Steam Machine?</strong></p><p>If you have a Steam Machine and a Steam Frame, you can plug the Steam Frame’s wireless adapter into your Steam Machine to stream the games from it. They’ll look a lot better than if you ran them on the Frame directly. Or you could just use a normal PC, like Valve did for our demos.</p><p><strong>Wait, it’s tracking my eyes? That sounds creepy.</strong></p><p>Yeah, it’s watching your eyes move, checking their position between 80 and 125 times every second. And somehow we totally forgot to ask Valve whether it’s keeping track of what you look at.</p><p><strong>Straight to jail, Sean and Jay, straight to jail. You’ll ask Valve for us now, right? </strong></p><p>We just did, and we’ll let you know if we hear anything. And Valve <em>is</em> using it for something cool! The eye-tracking unlocks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/817993/valve-vr-steam-frame-foveated-streaming-rendering-link">“foveated streaming,”</a> which puts the highest-fidelity bits right in front of your eyes while lowering the resolution in your peripheral vision.</p><p><strong>Is there something special about the controllers?</strong></p><p>The controllers for Valve’s previous headset, the Index, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18639084/valve-index-steamvr-headset-knuckles-controllers-preview">were fun</a>, but they were also bulky and didn’t have everything you might need to play flat-screen games.</p><p>The Frame’s new controllers, on the other hand, are two small wands packed with all the buttons and inputs required for both flat-screen games and VR games. AB <em>and</em> XY, triggers <em>and</em> bumpers. The Quest’s wands don’t have those extra inputs.</p><p><strong>Why do you keep talking about flat-screen games for a VR headset?</strong></p><p>Valve’s pitch is every game in your Steam library — VR or flat-screen, locally or streamed — will work on this lightweight headset, no cord required.</p><p>But you should know that the performance of a couple flat Windows games running locally on the headset — <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Hades II</em> — was a little choppy.</p><p><strong>Uh-oh. Do you know why?</strong></p><p>Valve told us after our demos that what we saw was a bug, and that it hadn’t yet fully implemented a shader pre-caching system that could have smoothed things out. So it’s possible the shipping product will perform better. We’ll have to test.</p><p>But issues with Windows games on Arm aren’t that surprising. Sean has messed around with <em>Silksong</em> on a phone, and while it worked, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/776180/hollow-knight-silksong-android-phone-windows-emulation-gamehub">it wasn’t perfect</a>. The processing power on the Frame is limited, too — it’s an older smartphone chip, but with a lot more power and cooling than you get in a phone.</p><p>Valve plans to have a Verified program for games it expects to run well on the Frame, so we hope that checkmark will be an indicator of good performance.</p><p><strong>Why use Arm for the Frame at all if there are extra hurdles to jump through?</strong></p><p>Battery and heat! “We chose Arm for Steam Frame for its power efficiency and low heat generation — especially important for a headset,” Valve hardware and software engineer Jeremy Selan tells us. The battery here is way smaller than in a Steam Deck, though, if you’re wondering how long it’ll play Windows games. Like half the size. 21.6 watt-hours.</p><p><strong>What’s the battery life?</strong></p><p><em>Not</em> six hours of <em>Hades II</em>, because we asked and Valve said no. Valve <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/steam-frame-vr-hands-on-quest-3s-biggest-competition-yet">told <em>Digital Foundry</em></a> to expect one to four hours of gameplay depending on settings; it <a href="https://youtu.be/bWUxObt1efQ?si=6SqxmDjSPP4LiNi_&amp;t=1950">told <em>Gamers Nexus</em></a> it currently consumes up to 7 watts streaming and 20 watts playing local games, which works out to about three hours and one hour minimum runtime, respectively. Valve says it’s still optimizing, and the rear USB-C port is in a great spot to plug in an external battery.</p><p><strong>So pack a battery for flights… Wait, can I use it on a plane at all?</strong></p><p>Selan says yes:</p><div><blockquote><p>Yes, we’ve played Frame on a plane from takeoff to landing without tracking issues. The onboard cameras work in tandem with the motion sensors in the headset to offset any external motion experienced when in a vehicle.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>How about in bed?</strong></p><p>Selan once more:</p><div><blockquote><p>A bunch of us play this way. The game theater screen in VR is repositionable and resizable, and you can move it to be on your ceiling if you prefer.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Is it comfortable to wear?</strong></p><p>We’ll have to test more, but it’s smaller and lighter than the Quest 3 with a plush and more balanced head strap right out of the box. It felt pretty great in a brief demo.</p><p><strong>How about with glasses?</strong></p><div><p>Our friend <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/i-tried-valves-steam-frame-machine-and-controller-coming-in-2026-steam-os-is-coming-for-your-face-and-tv/">Scott Stein at <em>CNET</em></a> writes:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>There’s support for prescription lens inserts, but my high index option wasn’t available at the demo, so I had to squeeze my glasses in. They fit, but just barely.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Do the vents smell as good as the Steam Deck’s?</strong></p><p><strong>If it’s Arm, can I play Android games on it too? </strong></p><p>That’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame">the plan</a>! Developers will be able to publish the Android APKs on Steam, and Valve will send Steam Frame devkits to some of those developers.</p><p><strong>Is it more powerful than a Quest 3? </strong></p><p>It should be, based on the raw specs.</p><p><strong>Does the Frame have any other cool tricks?</strong></p><p>We love modular gear <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24190757/modular-laptops-repairable-upgradable-diy">as a general rule</a>. Did we mention the Frame is modular?</p><p><strong>Modular?</strong></p><p>Modular. The “frame” and “lenses” come apart. The headband, speakers, and battery detach from the core compute module of the Frame. And on that core module, right above where your nose is, there’s an expansion slot for extra cameras to slot in.</p><p><strong>Will Valve sell other headbands I can slot in instead?</strong></p><p>Not Valve, at least to start, but you can expect other companies or regular people to cook up their own ideas. From Selan:</p><div><blockquote><p>We will be sharing specs and external CAD to enable folks to make accessories for the front expansion port (like an extra camera) and alternate head straps. For companies who wish to sell Steam Frame accessories for these ports with our official partner branding, there will be a partner program.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Why would I want an extra camera?</strong></p><p>Valve cut corners on its passthrough cameras to bring the price down, it claims, so you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/821170/steam-frame-doesnt-let-you-see-the-real-world-in-color-because-valves-considering-your-wallet">can’t see the real world in color</a> through it like Meta’s latest headsets.</p><p><strong>What about other XR stuff? Can I run multiple apps, pin them to different places in my home, and expect them to stay?</strong></p><p>Selan isn’t promising a rich catalog of apps yet, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame#:~:text=you%E2%80%99ll%20be%20able%20to%20bring%20up%20a%20browser%2C%20have%20floating%20windows%2C%20all%20of%20the%20multitasking%20environments%20you%E2%80%99d%20expect%2C">some of this, yes</a>. “You’ll be able to bring up a browser, have floating windows, all of the multitasking environments you’d expect.” Room setup and multiple windows are “on the list” for launch. He didn’t address pinning specifically.</p><p><strong>How does the Steam Frame’s pixel density compare to other headsets?</strong></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy XR is 4K per eye, with incredibly clear visuals. We can read a phone pretty easily through the headset, as long as it’s not too close to the headset’s cameras.</p><p>This is 2K per eye, a lot closer to the Meta Quest 3, where it’s good enough to make out a phone, but grainy.</p><p><strong>Charging headsets is a pain. Will Valve sell a dock for the Frame?</strong></p><p>Selan:</p><div><blockquote><p>We have nothing to announce, but we’ll be sharing external CAD, if others wish to make docks (similar to Steam Deck).</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Is the streaming adapter just for the headset, or can I use it to stream games from PC to other gadgets? </strong></p><p>Just for the headset for now. Selan again:</p><div><blockquote><p>In terms of using a dedicated Wi-Fi adapter for a direct connection between an untethered device and the PC, we are excited about that potential but have nothing to announce at this time.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>Do I need fast USB ports for the 6GHz adapter? </strong></p><p>The adapter “works great” over USB2 and USB3, Selan says.</p><p><strong>Why not make the headset even lighter by making a battery or compute puck?</strong></p><p>“We explored many different options and decided on the built-in battery for simplicity, weight balancing, and ease of use,” Selan says. “External compute via puck is interesting, but being able to leverage your existing PC’s compute is such a compelling experience that we chose to prioritize wireless streaming technologies instead.”</p><p><strong>I saw pictures of the Controller and Frame with clear shells that I desperately want. Is Valve going to sell those?</strong></p><div><p>It’s not planning to, but you can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/817411/here-are-pictures-of-the-see-through-steam-frame-and-steam-controller-you-cant-buy">admire them in our photo gallery</a>!</p></div><p><strong>Will Valve sell replacement parts for the Steam Frame and Steam Machine like with the Steam Deck, and if so, when?</strong></p><p>Selan and hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat told us, for both products respectively, that Valve plans to have replacement parts available.</p><p><em>Linus Tech Tips</em> got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3FkuZNSGkw">slightly more context</a>: “While Valve hasn’t actually told iFixit that this product is coming yet, they did say that they’re hoping to continue their partnership that they’ve had on the Steam Deck making replacement parts available for end users.”</p><p>Also, the Steam Controller’s battery is user-replaceable and pops right out.</p><p><strong>I saw a picture of a Steam Machine with an e-paper screen. How about that?</strong></p><p>Sadly, Valve won’t sell it. “The e-paper faceplate will not be available for sale,” Aldehayyat tells us. “That was a (very cool) mod that one of our engineers made internally during development.” We want it, too.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/820293/steam-machine-frame-hardware-faq]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-14-in-1-docking-station-drops-to-an-all-time-low-making-multi-device-charging-practically-pennies.1356643/</guid>

              <p>A cordless workstation is a clean workstation, and it can also be an efficient one with the right gadget at hand. If your everyday work involves dealing with multiple devices at once, a solid docking station can be an excellent investment.</p>
<p>The best options out there that feature multiple ports and reliable power delivery usually don’t come cheap, but Amazon is currently making it easier than ever to grab one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/">Right now, the Anker 14-in-1 USB-C laptop docking station is going for just $43 on the retailer, after a sweet 39% off its retail price.</a> The deal, however, is selling out fast, which means the offer (or the stock) won’t be around for much longer. We highly recommend acting fast to grab yours before it’s too late!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Connectivity Options for All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>You’re getting 14 connectivity options in a compact, lightweight build. These include two 4K HDMI ports, a 1080p VGA port, a 5 Gbps USB-C port, a 100W USB-C PD-IN port, five USB-A ports, a 1 Gbps Ethernet port, an SD / micro SD slot, and an AUX port. The two 4K HDMI and one 1080p VGA port let you connect up to three external screens at the same time. Windows users will enjoy extended display support, while on macOS, the displays will only mirror what’s going on your main display. Regardless, these are great for adding multiple screens for a bigger, more productive setup. With Windows, you can be hosting Zoom calls on one and present using the other. Or work on one while having reference documents open on the rest; the possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>The USB-A and USB-C ports support ultra-fast file transfers at impressive 5 Gbps speeds. This hub also offers up to 80W of pass-through charging, which means all your laptops will stay charged as you power through your productive days.</p>



<p>Compatibility-wise, the hub plays nicely with USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt 3/4 laptops, and supports Windows 10/11, macOS (12 and up), and ChromeOS systems. And since it’s quite lightweight, you can carry it around with you easily. Just toss it in your laptop bag, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/">Anker also throws in an 18-month warranty with your purchase for some extra peace of mind</a>. All things considered, it’s a great option to consider if you’re looking to manage a bunch of different devices in a compact, clean way. The current discount puts the hub in a much more affordable range.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>'s CEO believes the gaming industry is heading towards PC dominance, despite the company's upcoming publishing juggernaut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> so far only slated for Xbox and PlayStation.</p>
<p>Strauss Zelnick made the comments earlier this week, while chatting with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html">CNBC's Squawk Box</a>. "I think [the industry is] moving towards PC, and business is moving towards open rather than closed," Zelnick said.</p>
<p>"But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen - that's never going away," the CEO furthered.</p>

<p>Zelnick's comments come one week after Valve announced its own range of gaming hardware, notably the Steam Machine, which is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">console/PC hybrid which will be able to run PC games on a television or as a normal gaming computer</a>.</p><p>Zelnick also touched on the mobile gaming market, which he said is growing more rapidly than the console market. "Mobile, of course, is taken with you, it's repeatable, and it's enjoyable," Zelnick said. "And I do think because it appeals to the broadest possible audience, it will probably continue to grow more rapidly."</p>
<p>During an earnings call, Zelnick stated Take-Two expects the mobile business to increase by roughly 10 percent in the next quarter.</p>

<p>Many publishers have moved to release their games on PC as well as consoles. PlayStation, for example, has steadily been making its once-console exclusives available via the likes of Steam over recent years. Earlier this year, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida admitted porting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-games-on-pc-is-almost-like-printing-money-says-former-exec-shuhei-yoshida">PlayStation-exclusive games to PC is "almost like printing money"</a>, and provides an opportunity to invest in further games.</p><p>There is still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">no word on a GTA 6 PC release from Rockstar and Take-Two</a>, though. Earlier this year, Zelnick teased a PC release of GTA 6 will be on the way, but added the company tends not to "go across all platforms simultaneously". At this time, Take-Two's head noted the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40 percent of overall sales.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-update-1-7-adds-faction-turf-wars-expedition-mode-more/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ukrainian developer GSC Game World has released a major STALKER 2 patch, updating the game to version 1.7. The new version introduces the long-awaited 'turf wars' between factions, powered by the A-Life System, which was initially lacking and is now <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-big-1-5-patch-fixing-a-life-and-adding-mod-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being restored to its original vision one patch at a time</a>.</p>



<p>Now, factions can expand their control over new territories but may also lose control of their own lands if they fail to defend them. Various points of interest, checkpoints, and locations (but not hubs, to avoid disrupting missions) are contested by different NPCs and mutants, who also seek to defend their lairs and territories from their hostile neighbors, the titular Stalkers. Other AI improvements have made stealth in STALKER 2 more realistic and less frustrating, because NPCs won't easily spot players who successfully hide in reeds or tall grass, and even when they do, they'll be less accurate when shooting at bushes. On the other hand, human and creature NPCs have learned the art of tactical retreat if the fight isn't going their way, and they are also smarter when it comes to choosing the distance when fighting.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Expedition Showcase | Update 1.7" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJdwhpMdpuA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Update 1.7 also introduces a new Master difficulty level, which can only be selected at the beginning of the game, and Expedition mode, which limits autosaves to when exiting camp and during specific missions, and locks players out of manual saving, except for saving to exit the game. Both are designed to increase the tension players feel while roaming the Zone.</p>



<p>STALKER 2's new patch features new anomalies, a rework of the stamina and sprint system (another source of frustration in the launch version of the game, in my opinion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as noted in my review</a>), an update to inventory and equipment stats, some improvements to the controller experience, and a new light rain weather scenario. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full changelog</a> also lists a ton of bug fixes.</p>



<p>The game is currently 30% off on Steam. The PlayStation 5 version <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is set to launch in just two days</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s latest set of additions, dubbed the California Resistance update, have arrived today, November 18th. Alongside the unboxing of the new suburban skirmish setting that is the Eastwood map and a sabotage mode, the update brings a sizeable patch with tweaks aimed at the likes of ensuring bullets do end up where you intend and making sure mortars are clean enough to eat meals off of.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ok, so maybe that last bit is exactly what the patch notes for update 1.1.2.0 mean when they speak of a "major polish pass to deployable gadgets, including the LWCMS Portable Mortar, LTLM II Portable Laser Designator, and Supply Crate systems." What they do make clear beyond all doubt is that the update's bringing golf carts. Eastwood has them nestled among its pools and fairways, and I assume they'll likely feature in the vehicle battle-focused "Rodeo" missions being added to gauntlet mode.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sabotage is an 8v8 mode centered around bomb site destruction and probably listening to the Beastie Boys back catalogue on repeat. California Resistance also brings two new guns, the DB-12 shotgun and M357 trait sidearm. Finally, EA have announced that battle pickups, powerful guns with limited ammo you can grab for a short burst of firepower, are coming "later in the update".</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>The patch's other tweaks to the general field battling experience include aim assist being reset to what it was like during the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s open beta, with the aim of keeping aim slowdown "consistent across all ranges" by undoing a ratcheting up on long-range slowdown that came with release. Along similar lines, controller input latency and stick response has been revamped in order to allow for smoother aiming and better movement responsiveness.</p><p>In terms of tweaks to guns themselves, EA have "fixed unintended weapon dispersion increase rates and improved non-recon sniper rifle accuracy while globally reducing dispersion across all weapon types". Basically, most weapons should now have a better chance of hitting what you're aiming at. Away from the firing range, challenge and progression requirements should now be clearer and easier to keep track of.</p>
<p>The full notes are in the post above if you want the full briefing before heading to the war-torn golf course. If you do give the update a go, make sure to tut at anyone cheeky enough to try slapping the roof of a golf cart in case it flies up into the air and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-latest-update-shoots-down-hammer-wielding-drone-riders-and-permanently-fixes-lock-on-missiles">gives them a combat advantage</a>.</p>

<p>The latest Call of Duty title will have the usual seasonal Battle Passes. It gives you the chance to grind matches, earn battle pass XP, and earn in-game items. We’ve got the latest information on the Black Ops 7 Season 1 battle pass.</p>



<p>You know what to expect from the first season of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-split-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>: All the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> content, new Warzone integration, and of course, a snazzy Battle Pass packed with lots of tiers.</p>



<p>The Season One Battle Pass is the first thing on most of your minds, so let’s fill you in.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-black-ops-7-season-1-battle-pass-release-date">When Is The Black Ops 7 Season 1 Battle Pass Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Be patient. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s not confirmed, but we expect the Season 1 Battle Pass to go live on <strong>December 4</strong> with the expected start of Black Ops 7 Season 1.</strong></p>



<p>It’s always the same with new seasonal content. We never know the <em>exact </em>information until it’s close to happening, but historical data means it’s quite easy to figure out the start date, or not far off. The only thing between now and Season 1’s start is the mini-preseason beforehand. Even then, it would be a separate Battle Pass.</p>



<p>We’ve seen from the Vault Edition that the Season One Battle Pass is coming. Speaking of which, if this is your first Call of Duty, you probably need a walkthrough on the pass itself.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-black-ops-7-season-1-battle-pass">How To Get Black Ops 7 Season 1 Battle Pass</h2>



<p><strong>There are two main ways to acquire the Black Ops 7 Season 1 Battle Pass: Buy it from the CoD Shop using CoD points, or by getting it automatically through buying the Vault Edition.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-cod-points">CoD Points</h3>



<p>A Call of Duty seasonal Battle Pass is usually <strong>1,100 CoD Points</strong>—which equates to roughly <strong>$9.99</strong>. There’s the BlackCell Season Pass, but this costs a lot more, and there’s usually an upgraded Season Pass (without BlackCell gear), which offers Tier Skips.</p>



<h3 id="h-vault-edition">Vault Edition</h3>



<p>If you shelled out <strong>$99.99 or £99.99</strong> for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-vault-edition-contents-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vault Edition</a>, not only do you get a ton of goodies like skins and Mastercraft Weapons, but you’re also entitled to the <strong>BlackCell Season One Battle Pass</strong>.</p>



<p>This means you automatically get the best version of the Season 1 Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Whichever method you opt for, you’ll get the Battle Pass for the multi-week duration of Season 1. Let us know if you intend to buy the Season 1 Battle Pass. Is there anything in particular you buy seasonal passes for?

Gaming rival Sony is expected to release a more traditional console as the PS6. Nintendo, meanwhile, is sticking firmly to its long-standing hardware position, bolstered by blockbuster exclusives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick’s comments come amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-announces-next-gen-steam-machine-says-its-over-6x-more-powerful-than-steam-deck-but-theres-no-price-yet">Valve’s announcement of a next-gen Steam Machine</a>, itself backed by a new Steam Controller. The Steam Machine is a gaming-focused PC designed to be more accessible than a standard desktop PC, with a sleek, cube-like design and SteamOS on-board. It’s a clear play for the PC in the living room space, and gets in ahead of Microsoft’s own reported next-gen console ambitions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-welcomes-steam-machine-announcement-in-congratulatory-message-to-valve-with-next-gen-xbox-waiting-in-the-wings">Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer welcomed the Steam Machine announcement</a>. “Gaming moves forward when players and developers have more ways to play and create, especially across open platforms,” <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1988677531801944496" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Spencer tweeted</u></a>. “Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox's vision from the start. As one of the largest publishers on Steam, we welcome new options for players to access games everywhere. Congrats on today's announce.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Next-gen Steam Machine Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A recent report claimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-play-playstation-games-like-god-of-war-and-spider-man-because-its-a-console-pc-hybrid-that-runs-steam"><u>the next Xbox is a console / PC hybrid that will play PlayStation games released on PC via Steam</u></a>. That means the likes of Sony Santa Monica’s God of War, Insomniac’s Spider-Man, Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Tsushima and pretty much all other PC games will all be playable on the next-gen Xbox in an industry first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Windows Central</u></a> reported that while users of the next-gen Xbox can remain inside the Xbox ecosystem if they want, they can exit to Windows, where the console acts like a traditional Windows PC. That means having access to PlayStation games on Steam, and mouse and keyboard games from Blizzard's launcher, Battle.net (World of Warcraft), and Riot's launcher (League of Legends).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following that report, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-funny-that-people-think-about-the-console-pc-as-two-different-things-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-drops-biggest-hint-yet-that-the-next-xbox-is-basically-a-pc"><u>dropped yet another hint that the next-gen Xbox is basically a PC</u></a>. In an interview with <a href="https://www.tbpn.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TBPN</u></a>, Nadella responded to questions about the evolution of the company’s gaming business, and in doing so dropped a clear hint at where the company is going.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Remember, the biggest gaming business is the Windows business,” Nadella began. “To us, gaming on Windows… and of course, Steam has built a massive marketplace on top of it, and they’ve done a very successful job. Now, we’re the largest publisher after the Activision [deal]. Therefore we want to be a fantastic publisher. Similar approach to what we did with Office. We want to be everywhere, in every platform. So we want to make sure, whether it’s consoles, whether it’s the PC, whether it’s mobile, whether it’s cloud gaming, or the TV, we just want to make sure the games are being enjoyed by gamers everywhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Second, we also wanted to do innovative work in the system side on the console and on the PC. It’s kind of funny that people think about the console-PC as two different things. We built the console because we wanted to build a better PC which could then perform for gaming. I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled. It delivers performance that is unparalleled, that pushes I think the system forward. So I’m really looking forward to the next console, the next PC gaming.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to last week, and Valve appears to have gazumped Microsoft by returning to the Steam Machine. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview"><u>an interview with IGN ahead of the reveal</u></a>, we asked Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais and hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat whether they saw gaming PCs being the natural evolution of the console, given both Microsoft and Valve’s efforts here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how they responded:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pierre-Loup Griffais:</strong> When we think about what to work on next and working on things like Steam Machine and stuff, we're typically not looking at consoles or other products in that direction. Everything we do is informed by what's happening on the PC gaming side of things. Of course there ends up being quite a bit of overlap because we’re doing a bunch of stuff that helps PC gaming work better in the living room and that's traditionally where consoles have been. But really I would say that most of our thinking is not informed by what's happening on the console side, and so I don't know if we have many theories as to where that might be headed. But in general it seems like people seem to be recognizing that there's quite a bit of value in a more PC-like experience and the customizability and all that, and so we're happy to see more of these elements being embraced by platforms in general.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yazan Aldehayyat:</strong> As far as we're concerned the Steam Machine is a PC, so that delineation is not there. In our view, the Steam Machine is just one option in the ecosystem of gaming PCs out there. If you're already happy with your PC gaming experience, that's great. We love that. We are a PC gaming company. We're just trying to give you more options. And that's how we view it. It's just something that we think is a really great addition to a living room or a desktop, but it's just one other option that people can have available to them to play their Steam games basically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don’t know when exactly the Steam Machine will come out, beyond a vague 2026 release window, and we don’t know how much it will cost (Aldehayyat told us the Steam Machine “is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for GTA 6, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-updates-main-gta-6-website-with-new-release-date-and-sorry-pc-gamers-its-still-down-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-only">PC gamers are worried they won’t get to play the game until late 2027 or perhaps even 2028</a>, given its recent delay to November 2026. Will Rockstar bring forward the inevitable PC release as a result?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>Last year Zelnick was asked if the lack of a PC version of GTA 6 was set in stone</u></a>. Here’s Zelnick’s response in full:</p><blockquote>Well, the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement, I guess that could happen too. It doesn’t seem to me that either would be set in stone.</blockquote><blockquote>But Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before, and they will make more announcements in due time. I do believe that the right strategy for our business is to be where the consumer is, and historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That was Zelnick dancing around the inevitable PC version of GTA 6, but he did point to Rockstar’s release strategy for its previous games. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/place-your-bets-will-gta-6-release-on-pc-on-the-same-day-it-does-on-consoles/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fans of Rockstar games</u></a> have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude, only to have those hopes dashed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question is how long PC gamers will have to wait for the biggest entertainment launch of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6 in the meantime, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/publisher-jokes-concern-and-a-lot-of-memes-the-internet-reacts-to-the-gta-6-delay"><u>how the internet reacted to the GTA 6 delay</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history"><u>why it’s no surprise it was delayed in the first place</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>Nintendo has told Eurogamer it has no intention of hindering the use of third-party <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> docks following its latest console update.</p>
<p>Last week, update 21.0.0 was issued that makes a number of software tweaks, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-update-for-switch-consoles-finally-indicates-if-your-games-are-digital-or-physical">addition of symbols to indicate if software is physical or digital</a>. However, some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/third-party-switch-2-docks-reportedly-no-longer-compatible-after-nintendos-latest-console-update">Switch 2 owners reported third-party docks no longer worked</a> following the update.</p>
<p>Nintendo has now issued a response. "Nintendo Switch 2 outputs audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch 2 Dock," the company told Eurogamer. "Nintendo Switch does the same, outputting audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch Dock. Nintendo does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility."</p>

<p>The Switch 2, of course, comes with a dock in the box, but some users have purchased additional docks to play in other rooms or for travelling, for example.</p>
<p>An official dock from the Nintendo store will set you back £92.99, however, so many users have purchased third-party options instead.</p>
<p>It would appear, following Nintendo's statement, that any incompatibility issues caused with third-party docks are unintentional.</p>
<p>Outside of games, Nintendo has two big films in the works. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-breakdown-of-the-super-mario-galaxy-movies-first-trailer-with-the-easter-eggs-weve-spotted">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie got its first official trailer</a> last week, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-think-these-set-photos-are-telling-us-a-lot-more-about-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-than-nintendo-is-letting-on-analysis">Legend of Zelda movie has now begun filming</a>.</p>

            <p>I’ve moaned plenty about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">technical and performance woes</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> inflicted upon itself, and only seems committed to remedying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patches-will-keep-coming-if-almost-as-slowly-as-the-game-still-runs">at a glacial pace</a>. Yet on the possibility of future RE Engine-powered games suffering the same fate, even I haven’t been as worried as certain Capcom investors, who recently extracted an assurance from the developer-publisher that upcoming horror sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> will arrive in better shape.</p>
<p>During a conference call to discuss fiscal earnings and other businessy matters – the official transcript is <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_02.pdf">here</a>, translated from the original Japanese – Capcom were asked if there was "a risk that Resident Evil Requiem will experience technical issues similar to those seen with Monster Hunter Wilds." The response: nah mates, probably not.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In as many words, anyway. The full answer reads: "Resident Evil Requiem differs from Monster Hunter Wilds in terms of gameplay, system architecture, and network features. At present, we do not anticipate similar risks. We are developing the game to provide a smooth gaming experience across a wide range of PC specifications."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>While it’s a stretch to pin much of Wilds' crap framerates, popping textures, or complete misappropriation of frame gen tech on "network features," it is true that Requiem is a very different game. It’s also made by a separate team within Capcom, and has the benefit of following two previous RE Engine-built Resi games whose imperfections on PC didn’t come anywhere close a Wilds-level disaster. When Katharine (RPS in peace) was hardware ed, she declared <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> one of the "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-village-pc-performance-best-settings">best-looking PC games of the year</a>" that nonetheless ran "supremely well" provided you kept within your GPU’s expected limits.</p><p>More recently, in July 2025, I played Resident Evil Requiem itself on a PS5 Pro and it seemed pretty much fine. This was the same <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-has-its-own-version-of-lady-dimitrescu-but-i-doubt-youll-be-thirsting-for-this-hag">hag-dodging demo that Edwin tried</a> previously, though since we lost comms this morning after he disappeared down a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/morsels">Morsels</a> reviewing hole, I don’t know whether he played that on a PC or console. Or, indeed, if any of us will ever see him again.</p>

But despite stepping up to save the world — and collapsing in the process — Desmond's death scene apparently only clicked with North after he checked Twitter following the game's launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That technically was Desmond's death scene, and I didn't know it," North told <a href="https://youtu.be/eEipR4kRQIE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fall Damage</a>. "I found out on Twitter. 'Are you upset Desmond's dead?' And I'm thinking, what? Because there's no 'Argh!' There's nothing that you'd expect from a main character's death, although the good people at Ubisoft have told me that he's not technically dead."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, North is likely referring to the ending of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>, where the actor returned to the franchise as a mysterious character named The Reader. Valhalla makes it pretty clear that The Reader is Desmond — or his consciousness which now lives on inside the Animus, at least. And, seemingly, Ubisoft has confirmed this to North.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Desmond's death (or his physical body's demise, at any rate) came as a surprise to some fans who'd followed the character since the franchise's origins. But Ubisoft developers have said that as the Assassin's Creed series grew in scope, each game began to struggle to onboard new players. Following the end of Desmond's arc, the series experimented with other ideas for its modern day sections, and currently pushes players directly into the historical action instead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think the original idea was eight or nine games with Desmond," North continued, referencing Ubisoft's ever-changing original plans for the Assassin's Creed series, "but, as it so often goes in the entertainment industry, different developers, different creative directors come in, and they have their own way of continuing the story — and it's done very, very well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was very sad to step away from the role of Desmond," he concluded, "because Assassin's Creed is one of my favorite stories I've ever been part of."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A recent report suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stop-removing-the-modern-day-assassins-creed-fans-react-as-black-flag-remake-reportedly-cuts-everything-outside-the-animus">Ubisoft was planning to remove the modern day section from its widely-rumored Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake</a>, and bolster the game's historical sections instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

For months now, most coverage about the sequel has concerned the painful breakdown between Unknown Worlds' founders and Krafton, which<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pubg-parent-company-buys-subnautica-studio"><u> acquired Unknown Worlds in October 2021</u></a>. Over the summer, reports came to light that Subnautica 2's early access release was delayed to 2026 just months before Krafton was due to pay <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus"><u>a $250 million bonus to the development team</u></a> "against the wishes of the studio’s former leadership."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/krafton-responds-to-ex-subnautica-2-leads-lawsuit-saying-they-resorted-to-litigation-to-demand-a-payday-they-havent-earned"><u>Krafton issued a response to the lawsuit filed by former leads of Subnautica 2</u></a>, Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, offering rebuttals to the developers' claims and alleging they "resorted to litigation to demand a multimillion-dollar payout they haven't earned." Then, last month, Unknown Worlds itself sued its founders Cleveland, former CEO Ted Gill, and studio co-founder Max McGuire for allegedly stealing game design files shortly before they were fired. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in new legal <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/950200391/Public-Version-Plaintiff-s-Pre-Trial-Brief" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>paperwork</u></a>, the founders allege Krafton CEO CH Kim and Unknown Worlds newly-appointed CFO Richard Yoon discussed a potential takeover over Slack, and allegedly used ChatGPT for ideas on how to get out of paying the bonus, and set up a "secret task force" to take over the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the lead-up to this decision, Krafton CEO CH Kim had become frustrated with the contract Krafton signed to acquire Unknown Worlds. From his seat, it had become a bad deal for Krafton — one 'under which [Krafton] can only be dragged around,'" the filing states.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Krafton created a secret task force called 'Project X' whose mandate was simple: either make a 'deal' with the Founders on the 'earnout' or execute a 'Take Over' of Unknown Worlds. When the Founders refused to accede to Krafton’s demands, Krafton pulled the trigger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"> "[Maria Park, Krafton's global head of corporate development] told Kim that ‘it seems to be highly likely that the earn-out will still be paid if the sales goal is achieved regardless of the dismissal with cause,'” the new filing adds. “Kim turned to artificial intelligence to help him brainstorm ways to avoid paying the earnout. ChatGPT likewise advised that it would be ‘difficult to cancel the earn-out.'” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cofounders allege that Krafton refused to "produce the ChatGPT conversations," later claiming "they no longer exist.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The filing also seeks to bolster Unknown Worlds' claims that Subnautica 2 was indeed ready for its planned soft launch, stating that Unknown Worlds’ playtest data, presented to Krafton in May, "showed that the game met players’ expectations." Furthermore, Krafton’s "own internal expert declared that the planned 2025 release would be best (and that firing Ted Gill would result in a multi-year development delay)," and Maria Park wrote "the game was ready for an August launch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement to press, Krafton said: "There is nothing more important to us than ensuring the players get the best possible experience. We are looking forward to highlighting that all of our decisions have been focused on ensuring Subnautica 2 exceeds the high expectations that come from our players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were forced to make a change when the former leaders showed little interest in the development of Subnautica 2, which has always been our top priority. Now, this trial comes down to plaintiffs asking to be restored to jobs they were not doing, said they had no interest in doing, and had previously declined requests that they come back and do those jobs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game to Subnautica’s fans."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Subnautica 2 itself? Developer Unknown Worlds recently shared <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-legal-drama-over-250-million-bonus-new-developer-vlog-shows-work-on-subnautica-2-continues"><u>a behind-the-scenes look at an all-new deep-sea predator</u></a>, and "how the team has used Unreal Engine 5 AI for lifelike behavior, real-time reactions and tense encounters for player."

            <p>Rebecca Heineman, one of the co-founders of Interplay Entertainment - a key programmer as well as the designer of The Bard's Tale 3 - has passed away. She was 62 years old.</p>
<p>Heineman was battling an aggressive form of cancer and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/burgerbecky.bsky.social">shared her struggle quite openly on Bluesky</a>. She continued posting to the end, paying tribute to her late wife, game designer Jennell Jaquays. Heineman's passing was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmcd.bsky.social/post/3m5u7i37gns2u">announced by her friend Heidi McDonald</a>, who wrote: "My trailblazing game industry bad-ass friend Rebecca Heineman has passed away. Fuck cancer."</p>
<p>Tributes for Heineman rolled in overnight from various games industry figures related to Interplay, and beyond. Fellow <a href="https://x.com/BrianFargo/status/1990561629080277499">Interplay co-founder Brian Fargo wrote</a>: "Rebecca Heineman sadly passed away. Known her since the 80s when I'd drive her to work, one of the most brilliant programmers around. A real gut punch earlier today when she messaged me: 'We have gone on so many adventures together! But, into the great unknown! I go first!!!' :("</p>

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jesawyer.bsky.social/post/3m5uawgnzas2h">Obsidian design director Josh Sawyer, who worked at Interplay's Black Isle studio, added</a>: "Rebecca was one of the founders of Interplay and programmed and designed for some of the most influential games of my youth, notably Bard's Tale 1 and 3 and Wasteland. She will be missed."</p>
<p>Former Obsidian and Black Isle writer and designer <a href="https://x.com/ChrisAvellone/status/1990652649927049560">Chris Avellone also added</a>: "Rebecca Heineman, I hope you and Jennell are together again. Thanks for all the games, and all the memories. You will be missed. :("</p>
<p>Besides her game-development work, Rebecca Heineman, a trans woman, was a notable advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, and was recently awarded a Gayming Icon Award for her tireless work in this area. "I was informed that I will be given the Gayming Icon Award for all my work in LGBT+ issues over my career," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/burgerbecky.bsky.social/post/3lshnxmeo5k2h">Heineman wrote earlier this year</a>. "I'm deeply humbled at getting this news. I'm very happy and honored!"</p>
<p>Heineman also recently recalled how she'd <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/burgerbecky.bsky.social/post/3m5cfon7ajk24">won the National Atari 2600 Space Invaders Championship</a>, 45 years ago.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Rebecca, and thank you for all you've done.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, from developer Sandfall Interactive, has become the most nominated game in The Game Awards history, with a total 12 nominations to its name this year.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 released back in April, to widespread praise across the industry. It is now rounding out a monumental year with those 12 Game Award nominations, including Game of the Year and best performance nods for Ben Starr, Charlie Cox and Jennifer English.</p>

<p>Sharing word of its nominations, <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1990472251544633613?s=20">the Clair Obscur team wrote</a>: "What a privilege to be nominated, not only for 2025 GAME OF THE YEAR, but also TWELVE??!! TOTAL NOMINATIONS</p>
<p>"There are so many deserving, precious games from this year, and to be nominated among them makes us SO SO very whee... THANK YOU!!"</p>
<p>Earlier this year, nominated actor Charlie Cox - who voiced Gustave in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - said that even though the game has been met with critical acclaim, he personally feels "like a total fraud". Why? Because it turns out that the actor recorded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/daredevils-charlie-cox-feels-like-a-total-fraud-following-clair-obscur-expedition-33-praise">most of his lines in only about four hours as part of a voice over gig set up by his agent</a>. </p>

            <p>Interplay co-founder and veteran game designer Rebecca Heineman has died at the age of 62 following a cancer diagnosis earlier this year. The news has been shared on social media by numerous friends and former colleagues of Heineman, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmcd.bsky.social/post/3m5u7i37gns2u">Heidi McDonald</a> and Brian Fargo, while the latest post to a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebecca-ann-heineman-fight-aggressive-cancer">GoFundMe</a> the developer set up to raise funds for treatment says that page's funds will now go towards Heineman's family making funeral arrangements.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It’s time," reads the latest update to the developer's GoFundMe page. "According to my doctors. All further treatments are pointless. So, please donate so my kids can create a funeral worthy of my keyboard, Pixelbreaker! So I can make a worthy entrance for reuniting with my one true love, Jennell Jaquays. My daughter Cynthia Elizabeth Heineman, will be making the arrangements."</p>
<p>Heineman has also posted a "last toast" message to BlueSky and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRLMgemDqbX/">Instagram</a>, which references her wife Jennell Jaquays, who <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/jennell-jaquays-legendary-designer-who-shaped-both-tabletop-and-videogames-has-died/">died in January 2024</a> of complications caused by Guillain–Barré syndrome: "Valhalla really really reeked of beer, but Jennell seems happy. The other angels are tired of me saying "fight for the other users" while throwing my halo around. I leave it up to you to go to lindken.com and look up Jennell Jaquays, now look at her job description, goddess of technology...and fuck cancer, fuck it in the ass."</p>

</span></p><p>Heineman won the Space Invaders US national championship in 1980, before going on to co-found Interplay in 1983, alongside fellow developers Brian Fargo, Jay Patel and Troy Worrell. That studio developed and/or published the opening works in several foundational series in PC gaming with the first two Fallouts and Baldur's Gates, alongside an array of other classic games. While at Interplay, Heineman designed and programmed games such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bards-tale">The Bard's Tale</a> 3: Thief of Fate and Dragon Wars, before going on to found or co-found Logicware, Contraband Entertainment, and Olde Sküül.</p>
<p>A transgender woman, Heineman received a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DL32W5ps7t1/">Gayming Icon award</a> from <a href="https://gaymingmag.com/awards/">Gayming Magazine</a> in 2025, with the site writing: "Her advocacy for LGBTQ+ inclusion, accessibility, and diversity in tech has inspired countless developers and players."</p>
<p>"Known her since the 80s when I'd drive her to work, one of the most brilliant programmers around," fellow Interplay co-founder Fargo wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/BrianFargo/status/1990561629080277499">tribute post</a>. "A real gut punch earlier today when she messaged me: 'We have gone on so many adventures together! But, into the great unknown! I go first!!!'."</p>
<p>Thanks to Heineman for all of her contributions to the medium and all the best to those she leaves behind.</p>

Each plushie--SpongeBob, Patrick, Plankton, and Sandy--has a cubic shape that will make them easier for the claw to grasp, and there are also six plastic prize capsule toys included here. Arcade1Up says the machine will offer three distinct modes of play, ranging from Easy Mode for kids or beginners to Normal Mode for a balanced challenge. Or if you feel like a dose of reality, Scam Mode will put your skills to the test.</p><p>The cabinet also features a light-up marquee, glowing control buttons, and an internal ceiling light alongside various images of SpongeBob and the main cast of the long-running cartoon series. The full cabinet measures over five feet tall, so you'll want to make certain you have some space at home for it.</p></div>                      </div><p>This isn't the first time that Arcade1Up has produced a claw machine, and if you'd like one that doesn't feature SpongeBob gleefully staring at you, you can grab a unit for $550 through Amazon. While you don't get any plushie toys included with it, it does have a more retro-inspired design, and it comes with 12 plastic capsules that you can add prizes to. Like the SpongeBob machine, you can set it to Easy, Normal, or Scam modes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4605769-rcade-claw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4605769" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4605769-rcade-claw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4605769"></a><figcaption>Arcade1Up Claw Machine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4605769-rcade-claw.jpg"></figure><p>SpongeBob fans looking to revisit Bikini Bottom can also preorder <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKVQ3PR3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide</a> ahead of its release on November 18 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X, Switch 2, and PC.

			<p>Konami’s latest punt at reviving <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-online">Metal Gear Online</a> marks one of the publisher’s best multiplayer offerings to date, but its timing couldn’t be worse. Released as a free update for <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> on October 30th, some two months after the base game’s launch, Fox Hunt has found itself wedged between military shooter sequels <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. As if that wasn’t enough to contend with, it’s also going up against the unstoppable <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</a> which has taken the online gaming space by storm.</p>
<p><iframe title="METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER - FOX HUNT Trailer | KONAMI" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c46xM5-wScg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fox Hunt may be the underdog, but when it comes to MGS multiplayer, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/konami">Konami</a> couldn’t have set the bar any lower with 2018’s simply awful Metal Gear Survive. Not only does it easily surpass the company’s previous attempt to do something new with the Metal Gear franchise, Fox Hunt is a surprising stroke of genius that takes elements of the Snake Eater remake to craft a fun and fast spin on the now matured battle royale formula.</p>


<p>Konami has done very little to attract attention to this new mode and even during Fox Hunt’s initial onboarding, the developers don’t do a great job at succinctly explaining what the deal is. So, here’s a quick breakdown.</p>
<p>Each match features 12 players – 6 pairs – who will drop into one of two scenarios. In Survival Capture teams will scour the map for frog-like “Kerotan” figures, making sure both players are each holding onto one when the round timer expires. The winning team will advance to the next round, where the number of figures is reduced, until one pair of players wins.</p>


<p>Survival Intrude uses the same round-based formula, populating the map with duck-like “GA-KO” figures instead. Shooting one of these will create a zone that you and your partner will need to defend until the clock counts down. The further you advance, the fewer capture points become available, inevitably leading to a final showdown.</p>
<p>Despite their preoccupation with cutesy collectable figures, both modes work surprisingly well when paired with the spruced up stealth action gameplay of MGS Delta. Snake Eater’s OSP (on-site procurement) doctrine is a natural fit for the battle royale or extraction shooter formats, dropping players into each match completely naked, forcing them to scramble for weapons and equipment. If you happen to spawn next to an enemy team, that first minute or so will be a desperate struggle to see who can bust open a supply crate first, using whatever gear inside to repel the attackers.</p>

<p>While it’s possible to scour the map for more crates until you’ve refined the perfect loadout (complete with body armour, upgrade kits, and health/stamina consumables) you’ll also need to keep an eye on the countdown clock. Clever operatives will lock down an objective in good time, fortifying themselves using natural terrain and Fox Hunt’s smart new gadget: AT-Camo.</p>
<p>Think of this as a goofier version of Old Snake’s OctoCamo suit from Metal Gear Solid 4. Wherever you are, you can pop open a radial menu and select from a variety of equipped patterns such as rubble, grass, or bark. Doing so will daub your character in a bulky disguise with the intention of blending in with your surroundings. If you happen to have the right the camouflage you will be almost impossible to see from a distance, though all players can temporarily activate a kind of six sense that will give a rough indicator of which direction other operatives are located.</p>
<p>Fox Hunt’s gunplay is lifted directly from the Snake Eater remake, allowing you to seamlessly switch between third and first person perspective (while aiming). It’s sharp and responsive though not everyone will be a fan of how it pairs with Metal Gear’s character movement which can feel janky and a bit cumbersome. With that said, after a few rounds, it should start to feel natural and you’ll quickly learn how to make the most of your surrounding terrain and the ample cover it provides.</p>

<p>Compared to other shooters, the “time to kill” or “TTK” here is fairly generous, especially if you happen to scavenge some body armour. This helps add some longevity to firefights, and puts more emphasis on positioning and strategic use of equipment rather than favouring whichever players wield the most firepower. With that said, well-placed headshots can still strike down unsuspecting operatives with a “drop shot” damage bonus given when shooting someone as they open a crate or use items such as meds or rations.</p>
<p>On the subject of longevity, Fox Hunt features a progression system that feels both genuinely rewarding and problematic at the same time. As you play, you’ll earn in-game currency that can then be spent on loot boxes (remember those?) stuffed with various unlocks. While some of these are purely cosmetic – such as radio callouts, emotes, and playercards – others will reward you with valuable in-game buffs when you duplicate them. For example, AT-Camo suits can come equipped with perks such as silent movement or even a bonus luck rate when opening supply crates. Meanwhile, stacking duplicate character skins will increase their life regeneration and stamina recovery.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, players have a chance at unlocking some pretty effective augmentations that can help give them the upper hand. While it sounds bad, this is pretty much the case for most online shooters with the likes of Call of Duty and Battlefield reserving the best weapons, perks, and gear for higher level players. You might even argue that Fox Hunt’s random box system is fairer, giving anyone the chance to unlock loadout options they would typically need to grind for. And before anyone asks if it’s pay-to-win, there is no in-game cash shop or microtransactions. We hope it stays that way, Konami.</p>
<p>Although it’s on a much smaller scale than most live service titles, Fox Hunt’s ongoing success will also depend on meaningful post-launch support. With only two modes and a handful of maps, it would be a shame for Konami to let this little gem fade away without presenting its players with some kind of roadmap.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt multiplayer mode rounds off one of the best remakes of 2025. It offers a surprisingly robust spin on existing battle royale and extraction shooter concepts, with smaller maps and match times working in its favour, successfully incorporating those stealth and strategy elements fans have come to expect.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Strauss Zelnick, who has been the CEO, chairman, and largest stakeholder of Take-Two since 2007, appeared yesterday <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Squawk Box</a>, CNBC's business news program that airs weekdays from 6 to 9 AM Eastern Time.</p>



<p>During the conversation, the veteran executive of what will soon be the largest independent American publisher (once the Electronic Arts leveraged buyout goes through) said that the gaming industry is moving toward PCs and more generally toward open ecosystems, although the console experience isn't really going away.</p>



<p><em>I think it’s moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed. But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen — that’s never going away.</em></p>



<p>The Take-Two executive isn't wrong. The console market has long stagnated, and its three big players, Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft, are only really stealing each other's customers rather than gaining new ones. On the other hand, PC gaming continues to grow, as evidenced by <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-already-generated-sales-for-16-billion-this-year-gabe-newell-gets-superyacht/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam's record-breaking sales</a>. Moreover, new PC-based devices with a handheld or home console format, such as the Steam Deck, the ROG Ally, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-70-gaming-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Steam Machine</a>, are being produced, thus potentially stealing market share from regular console manufacturers.</p>



<p>For its part, Microsoft is also shifting the way it thinks about consoles. While Xbox president Sarah Bond has just reiterated that the Xbox experience starts with the traditional console, rumors point to the next-generation hardware being a sort of console-PC hybrid that might also offer access to a Windows desktop environment.</p>



<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-largest-gaming-publisher-want-to-be-everywhere-competition-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a slight hint late last month</a> at the company innovating in that space:</p>



<p><em>We also want to do innovative work on the system side on the console and on the PC. It's kind of funny that people think about the console and PC as two different things. At Microsoft, we built the console because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for games. I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom. But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled. It delivers performance that's unparalleled that pushes I think the system forward.</em></p>

            <p>The touring <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/in/en/concert">Witcher in Concert</a> musical performance was a resounding enough success that CD Projekt Red has announced a second tour for Europe next year.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I watched The Witcher in Concert in London earlier this month and was very impressed. A 14-piece ensemble played through the music of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> (plus expansions) all while a specially cut montage of game moments - divided into chapters - played on a projected screen above.</p>
<p>More excitingly, perhaps, the ensemble included Polish folk metal band Percival, which co-composed the music in the game. It's their almost guttural singing and discordant-sounding harmonies that provide The Witcher 3 with such a distinctive sound. It's a rousing performance.</p>

<figcaption>This is from a different concert several years ago, but it gives an idea of what to expect from Percival. It's hair-raising seeing the music you'll know so well performed in front of you.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64R2Lcuui3U" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>

<p>There will also be an Asian tour next year though no details are available for it yet.</p>
<p>The Witcher 3 turned 10 years old this year - a milestone anniversary the Witcher in Concert tour was created to celebrate - and a lot has happened in that time. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> was built and released, which brought all kinds of challenges to be overcome. A decade later, the studio is returning to The Witcher world with brand new instalment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. And I thought this anniversary would be a good time to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-worked-in-the-witcher-3-and-what-didnt-looking-back-on-a-landmark-rpg-with-cd-projekt-red">look back on The Witcher 3 with the studio, at what it got wrong, and what it got right</a>.</p>
