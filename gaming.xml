		<p>As we tick on over into November – do months tick? – it immediately starts to feel like the end of the year is racing up on us. There’s still an awful lot of video games to go between now and then. Heck, there’s a whole new games console coming out next week!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-isnt-getting-any-dlcs-as-bioware-is-wholly-focused-on-mass-effect-next/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-isn%E2%80%99t-getting-any-dlcs-as-bioware-is-wholly-focused-on-mass-effect-next.1025961/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-isnt-getting-any-dlcs-as-bioware-is-wholly-focused-on-mass-effect-next/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is seemingly doing well for itself so far. It had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-breaks-steam-records-for-a-bioware-and-ea-single-player-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken</a> Steam concurrency records for a BioWare and EA single-player premium game yesterday, and the numbers have improved since, with a new peak of 77.4K registered twelve hours ago.</p>
<p>However, for the time being, there are no plans to make any story DLCs for it. That's what Rolling Stone&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a></span> as part of an interview with Dragon Age: The Veilguard Creative Director John Epler. The reason is fairly straightforward: BioWare isn't a large team nowadays, and they are currently focused on making the next Mass Effect game, which Executive Producer Mike Gamble recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-next-will-stay-photorealistic-and-mature-confirms-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> will stick to the photorealistic art style and mature tone.</p>
<p>Of course, this interview was conducted when the game had only just released. If Dragon Age: The Veilguard turns out to surpass EA's sales estimates (CEO Andrew Wilson recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-breakout-potential-says-ea-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> investors it has breakout potential), there's a chance those plans might change. Still, from a narrative standpoint, Veilguard does close up nicely (unlike Inquisition, which very much needed the DLCs to really bring the story to a proper conclusion).</p>
<p>In the Rolling Stone interview, John Epler went into the feedback that BioWare absorbed from its fans to make Dragon Age: The Veilguard a better game. From Mass Effect Andromeda, the studio learned that the polish wasn't enough and that the open world design was lacking:</p>
<p><em>I do think Andromeda was a better game than its reception suggested, but on the flip side, I don’t think the reception was unfair. At the time of launch, there were technical issues and things that didn’t work.</em></p>
<p><em>We had been doing Dragon Age pre-production on versions of Dragon Age 4, and we did have a version that was a lot more open-world. But again, we ran into the same problem of how do you make it compelling or narratively interesting? The reception to Andromeda definitely solidified that.</em></p>
<p>From Anthem, of course, they understood that the multiplayer focus was not working:</p>
<p><em>We’re a studio built to make single-player RPGs. And more importantly, I think a lot of people have come here to build single-player, story based RPGs. So, it just kind of ended up making more sense to make this game the way it is versus a multiplayer game.</em></p>
<p><em>We were alienating parts of our fan base that had been with us for a long time, and not successfully bringing in anyone else through the multiplayer side of things. The reception to Anthem was very clear in that we needed to get back to those aspects that we did well, and multiplayer became an obstacle in the way of doing just that.</em></p>
<p>With that said, Epler did not entirely close the door to doing another multiplayer game in the future:</p>
<p><em>It’s possible to tell a strong story in a multiplayer game. Final Fantasy XIV does an excellent job. Multiplayer also introduces some complications around world states. I make a giant choice in my world and the world changes.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, Epler said Inquisition players felt there wasn't enough companion banter, which was also fixed in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>

<p>Old-school Apple fans probably remember a time, just before the iPhone became <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/07/iphone-users-spend-147-hours-a-month-playing-games/">a massive gaming platform in its own right</a>, when Apple released a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/05/wicked-cool-apple-gaming-wednesday/">wide</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2006/09/5439/">range</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/12/peggle-and-bomberman-keep-the-good-ipod-gaming-times-flowin/">games</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/08/games-games-games-one-for-your-ipod-and-one-for-your-iphone/">designed</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/11/new-ipod-game-phase-rhythm-games-on-a-clickwheel-yippee/">late-model</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/09/tetris-ms-pac-man-sudoku-for-new-ipods-released/">clickwheel</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/07/game-review-song-summoner-the-unsing-heroes-ipod/">iPods</a>. While those clickwheel-controlled&nbsp;titles <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/looking-back-at-the-history-of-ipod-click-wheel-games/">didn't exactly set the gaming world on fire</a>, they represent an important historical stepping stone in Apple's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/the-mac-gaming-console-time-has-forgot/">long journey</a> through the game industry.</p>
<p>Today, though, these clickwheel iPod games are on the verge of becoming lost media—impossible to buy or redownload from iTunes and protected on existing devices by incredibly strong Apple DRM. Now, the classic iPod community is engaged in <a href="https://github.com//ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject">a quest to preserve these games</a> in a way that will let enthusiasts enjoy these titles on real hardware for years to come.</p>
<h2>Perhaps too well-protected</h2>
<p>The short heyday of iPod clickwheel gaming ran from late 2006 to early 2009, when Apple partnered with major studios like Sega, Square Enix, and Electronic Arts to release 54 distinct titles for $7.49 each. By 2011, though, the rise of iOS gaming made these clickwheel iPod titles such an afterthought that Apple <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-removes-ipod-click-wheel-games-from-itunes-store/">completely removed them from the iTunes store</a>, years before the classic iPod line was discontinued for good in 2014.</p>

    <p>
      YouTuber Billiam looks takes a hands-on tour through some of the clickwheel iPod's games.

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>In the years since that delisting, the compressed IPG files representing these clickwheel games have all been backed up and collected in <a href="https://archive.org/details/ipod-click-wheel-games-archive">various archives</a>. For the most part, though, those IPG files are practically useless to classic iPod owners because of <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/728B5C4B-0A35-40BE-A2E7-E5464C68B80A.html">the same strict Fairplay DRM</a> that protected iTunes music and video downloads. That DRM ties each individual IPG file not just to a particular iTunes account (set when the game file was purchased) but also to the specific hardware identifier of the desktop iTunes installation used to sync it.</p>
<p>Games already synced to iPods and iTunes libraries years ago will still work just fine. But trying to sync any of these aging games to a new iPod (and/or a new iTunes installation) requires pairing the original IPG file provided by Apple years ago with the authorized iTunes account that made the original purchase.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Didn't back up that decades-old file? Sorry, you're out of luck.</p>
<p>A set of 20 clickwheel iPod games was eventually patched to work on certain iPod Video devices that are themselves flashed with custom firmware. But the majority of these games remain completely unplayable for the vast majority of classic iPod owners to this day.</p>
<h2>A virtual workaround</h2>
<p>Luckily for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/">the sizable community</a> of <a href="https://discord.gg/nZ2dD64X">classic iPod enthusiasts</a>, there is a bit of a workaround for this legacy DRM issue. Clickwheel iPod owners with working copies of any of these games (either in their iTunes library or on an iPod itself) are still able to re-authorize their account through Apple's servers to sync with a secondary installation of iTunes.</p>

<p>If multiple iPod owners each reauthorize their accounts to the same iTunes installation, that copy of iTunes effectively becomes a "master library" containing authorized copies of the games from all of those accounts (there's a five-account limit per iTunes installation, but it can be bypassed by copying the files manually). That iTunes installation then becomes a distribution center that can share those authorized games to any number of iPods indefinitely, without the need for any online check-ins with Apple.</p>
<p>In recent years, a Reddit user going by the handle Quix used this workaround to amass a local library of 19 clickwheel iPod games and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/vzaj7w/comment/igc8nkz/">publicly offered</a> to share "copies of these games onto as many iPods as I can." But Quix's effort ran into a significant bottleneck of physical access—syncing his game library to a new iPod meant going through the costly and time-consuming process of shipping the device so it could be plugged into Quix's actual computer and then sending it back to its original owner.</p>
<p>Enter Reddit user Olsro, who <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1fydso6/preservation_of_ipod_clickwheel_games_read_this/">earlier this month</a> started the appropriately named <a href="https://github.com//ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject">iPod Clickwheel Games Preservation Project</a>. Rather than creating his master library of authorized iTunes games on a local computer in his native France, Olsro sought to "build a communitarian virtual machine that anyone can use to sync auth[orized] clickwheel games into their iPod." While the process doesn't require shipping, it does necessitate jumping through a few hoops to get the Qemu Virtual Machine running on your local computer.</p>

<p>Over the last three weeks, Olsro has worked with other iPod enthusiasts to get authorized copies of 45 different clickwheel iPod games synced to his library and ready for sharing. That Virtual Machine "should work fully offline to sync the clickwheel games forever to any amount of different iPods," Olsro wrote, effectively preserving them indefinitely.</p>
<h2>For posterity</h2>
<p>Olsro told Ars in a Discord discussion that he was inspired to start the project due to fond memories of playing games like <em>Asphalt 4</em> and <em>Reversi</em> on his iPod Nano 3G as a child. When he dove back into the world of classic iPods through a recent purchase of a classic iPod 7G, he said he was annoyed that there was no way for him to restore those long-lost game files to his new devices.</p>
<p>"I also noticed that I was not alone to be frustrated about that one clickwheel game that was a part of a childhood," Olsro told Ars. "I noticed that when people had additional games, it was often only one or two more games because those were very expensive."</p>
<p>Beyond the nostalgia value, even Olsro admits that "only a few of [the clickwheel iPod games] are really very interesting compared to multiplatform equivalents." The iPod's round clickwheel interface—with only a single "action" button in the center—is less than ideal for most action-oriented games, and the long-term value of "games" like <em>SAT PREP 2008</em> is "very debatable," Olsro said.</p>

      A short review of <em>Phase</em> shows off the basic rhythm-matching gameplay.

<p>Still, the classic iPod library features a few diamonds in the rough. Olsro called out the iPod version of <em>Peggle</em> for matching the PC version's features and taking "really good advantage from the clickwheel controls" for its directional aiming. Then there's <em>Phase</em>, a rhythm game that creates dynamic tracks from your own iPod music library and was never ported to other platforms. Olsro described it as "very addictive, simple, but fun and challenging."</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Even the bad clickwheel iPod games—like Sega's nearly impossible-to-control <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> port—might find their own quirky audience among gaming subcommunities, Olsro argued. "One [person] <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HdWWhZ0hDM">beat <em>Dark Souls</em> using DK bongos</a>, so I would not be surprised if the speedrun community could try speedrunning some of those odd games."</p>
<p>More than entertainment, though, Olsro said there's a lot of historical interest to be mined from this odd pre-iPhone period in Apple's gaming history. "The clickwheel games were a reflect[ion] of that gaming period of premium games," Olsro said. "Without ads, bullshit, and micro-transactions and playable fully offline from start to end... Then the market evolved [on iOS] with cheaper premium games like <em>Angry Birds</em> before being invaded with ads everywhere and aggressive monetizations..."</p>

<p>While Olsro said he's happy with the 42 games he's preserved (and especially happy to play <em>Asphalt 4</em> again), he won't be fully satisfied until his iTunes Virtual Machine has all 54 clickwheel titles backed up for posterity. He compared the effort to complete sets of classic game console ROMs "that you can archive somewhere to be sure to be able to play any game you want in the future (or research on it)... Getting the full set is also addictive in terms of collection, like any other kind of collectible things."</p>
<p>But Olsro's preservation effort might have a built-in time limit. If Apple ever turns off the iTunes re-authorization servers for clickwheel iPods, he will no longer be able to add new games to his master clickwheel iPod library. "Apple is now notoriously known to not care about announcing closing servers for old things," Olsro said. "If that version of iTunes dies tomorrow, this preservation project will be stopped. No new games will be ever added."</p>
<p>"We do not know how much time we still have to accomplish this, so there is no time to lose," Olsro <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1fydso6/preservation_of_ipod_clickwheel_games_read_this/">wrote on Reddit</a>. iPod gamers who want to help can contact him through his Discord account, inurayama.</p>

But when will that be? Unfortunately, it's not a question with an easy answer, because there's no scheduled time for this maintenance window to end.

<p>Step aside, my collection of gaming headsets, there’s something new and even more immersive in town.</p>



<p>I was recently lucky enough to review the OXS Thunder Pro+ ‘gaming sound system’, an innovative piece of technology that fuses a phenomenal soundbar with the ‘world’s first wireless satellite neck speaker’ to promote <strong>the most immersive </strong>sound experience you can get in gaming.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full OXS Thunder Pro+ review and find out if it’s worth the hefty investment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-next-generation-sound">Next-Generation Sound</h2>



<p>I’ve always been a headset-focused kind of gamer, but in the last few weeks, I’ve been toying with the OXS Thunder Pro+, a multi-functional, multi-dimensional gaming sound system that works on so many levels. Presently, the soundbar is sitting under my main monitor, a placement that’s facilitated by the device’s relatively unassuming profile.</p>



<p>It might boast some of the most powerful sound output I’ve ever heard, but it’s just 24 inches wide and 3 inches high, which means it’ll fit nicely into almost any gaming space. It’s an attractive unit, too. It looks like something from the future, and it features customisable RGB lighting that is a must-have for many gamers out there.</p>



<p>In terms of the on-board audio, the OXS Thunder Pro+ soundbar has 7.1.2 Dolby Atmos built-in, with multi-directional speakers taking full advantage of eight precision-tuned drivers to ‘create a lifelike 3D soundscape’, as the manufacturer says. It does feel like that when you’ve got the thing switched on and pumping out anything from music to the cacophony of a game of Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Another huge win is the accessibility of the device. It can be connected to almost anything through a range of methods, including Bluetooth, optical, HDMI, and USB. There’s a handy control unit that handles power and volume, and there’s also a remote in the box. </p>



<p>It’s a one-touch operation that never ceases to amaze me, and the connectivity and responsiveness of the device are off the charts.</p>



<p>Here are some numbers to consider:</p>



<ul>
<li>96dB output</li>



<li>Bluetooth 5.0</li>



<li>Peak power output – 160W</li>



<li>DSP onboard</li>



<li>HDMI eARC for better console connectivity</li>



<li>50% smaller than competing soundbars, and weighs barely 6.5 KG</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-fully-tested">Fully Tested</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The neck speaker system hasn’t been much of a game-changer</figcaption></figure>







<p>I put the OXS Thunder Pro+ through its paces, connecting it to a PlayStation 5, mobile devices, and of course, my PC. I found that my favourite ‘preset’ was RAC, which is designed for racing games but works so well across a variety of genres. From deep, booming bass to a depth of audio and clarity the likes of which I’ve never heard in a sound system, the OXS Thunder Pro+ constantly impressed me.</p>



<p>The 40W bass woofers and neodymium drivers are put to work regardless of what you’re playing, watching, or listening to.</p>



<p>Also, there’s a PC app in case you want to go a step further and fully customise the lighting and equalisation, too. I’m not a sound nerd so I haven’t played with this, but the app is intuitive and easy to use.</p>



<p>If I have one complaint, it’s that the ‘satellite neck speaker’ doesn’t seem to be at all worth the investment. If you only want to buy the soundbar, it’ll set you back $599.99, but adding the neck speaker bumps that up to $699.99.</p>



<p>As a neck cushion, it’s close to flawless. It has a unique silicone covering that feels wonderful to the touch and has a nice cooling effect, and it’s ergonomic and comfortable in all gaming conditions, but the onboard speakers just aren’t it. It’s supposed to promote ‘3D surround sound’, but you can barely hear the speakers and they’re very tinny and underpowered.</p>



<p>If I’m being brutally honest, I’d say that the OXS Thunder Pro soundbar is <strong>well worth the investment</strong>, but lumping on the extra $100 for the neck speaker probably isn’t a shrewd purchase. Unless you want a <strong>very </strong>comfortable and durable neck cushion, then you’re fine.</p>



<p>What really should be possible is controlling the volume of the neck speakers <strong>separately </strong>from that of the soundbar. Even with the soundbar blaring, the neck speakers are almost inaudible. </p>



<h2 id="h-switching-off">Switching Off</h2>



<p>So, let’s sum up this OXS Thunder Pro+ review:</p>



<ul>
<li>The sound quality of the bar is nothing short of flawless, and even when it’s <span><strong>booming</strong></span>, the speakers can handle the throughput without crackling or vibrating too much.</li>



<li>It looks phenomenal and futuristic, and with the RGB included, it’s so nicely at home in a gaming setup.</li>



<li>The levels of accessibility and compatibility are unparalleled and the OXS Thunder Pro+ will become the beating, thumping heart of your audio ecosystem.</li>



<li>It doesn’t necessarily provide the surround-sound audio of a headset, so it’s not ideal for competitive shooters, but for everything from casual multiplayer to single-player epics, it’s <strong>perfect</strong>.</li>



<li>The neck speaker unit is a waste of time unless you want a $100 cushion that can play some tinny audio behind your ears.</li>
</ul>



<p>My verdict? <strong>Buy</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’ve got $600 to burn and want a top-notch gaming soundbar that’ll blow your hair back with both audio quality and onboard features, the OXS Thunder Pro won’t let you down.</p>

<p>One of the nastiest teams in competitive Call of Duty was recently assembled to compete in The Flank’s $25,000 Black Ops 6 Invitational.  The four-way combination of Dashy, Drazah, Simp, and Shotzzy proved too much for the competition to overcome, and this dream team managed to dominate so effectively that their opponents rage-quit in the final seconds.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-dynasty-has-been-cemented">‘The Dynasty Has Been Cemented’</h2>



<p>… is what Simp cried out as the final seconds of a ridiculous round of Hardpoint closed out on Skyline. The scoreline was separated by such a huge distance that the team of Scrap, Crimsix, Insight, and CleanX couldn’t compete. By the end of the series, the FaZe-OpTic team was just having a blast and picking up an easy payday.</p>



<p>It’s not all bad, though – the second-place finish was taken in good spirits by the likes of Crimsix, the winningest competitor in Call of Duty history and an esports legend:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Got 2nd in The Flank invitational #2. My teammates played insane. Thank you to those who tuned into the stream! But not bad for a pro race car driver.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On October 30, the first Flank tournament was won by Ghosty, Scrap, Gwinn, and TJHaly, so while Scrap was forced to rage-quit this follow-up event, he at least got <strong>something </strong>in the bank. </p>



<p>That’s not the end of all things, though – the crowning gem of The Flank’s Invitational series is yet to take place. From November 5 – 6, $50,000 will be on the line in the final round of the tournament, and once again, it’ll be played by randomised teams, which means anything is possible.</p>



<p>Presently, Activision is yet to reveal the schedule for the 2025 CDL season, so once The Flank’s Invitational series is wrapped, we’re back to wagers and scrims.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-return-of-the-max.1025922/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been almost a decade since the first Life is Strange title hit platforms worldwide, and in that time, several follow-up games have been released to flesh out the universe. However, for many, the first game is by far the best and most memorable, and much of that can be attributed to the stellar story laid out by the lead characters: Max Caulfield and Chloe Price.</p>



<p>On October 29, Deck Nine and Square Enix released Life is Strange: Double Exposure, bringing back the Max Caulfield character for the first time since 2015 (except for a brief reappearance in 2018). This all-new game represents a fresh dynamic for the character and the series, and it delivers in every way imaginable.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-beautifully-mysterious">Beautifully Mysterious</h2>



<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure is a touch of fan service mixed with an honest attempt to expand a universe that has unravelled over a decade. There’s no doubt that bringing Max Caulfield back was a shrewd move by the developer, as this is the character that kickstarted the entire franchise in 2015.</p>



<p>As a die-hard fan of the Life is Strange series, I sat down with my copy of Double Exposure (on PlayStation 5) and dove in expecting nothing but good things. The series as a whole has ebbed and flowed, but in my opinion, there has never been a <strong>bad </strong>Life is Strange game.</p>



<p>Fortunately, my expectations were met and exceeded in Double Exposure.</p>



<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure has been built in Unreal Engine 5, which promotes a sumptuous visual palette that players will be pleased to explore. The original game featured a rather simple aesthetic and little in the way of animations, but Double Exposure is fully motion-captured and everything from the in-game interactions to the facial animations are nothing short of flawless.</p>



<p>Now more than ever, the characters’ emotions are being pulled to the surface.</p>



<p>Of course, where a Life is Strange game shines is in the story, and Double Exposure has twists, turns, and opportunities to explore off the beaten path in droves. It took three years to assemble this game, and it shows – there’s plenty of meat on the bones here and full completion of the five-chapter title will take around ten hours.</p>



<p>And with Life is Strange <strong>being </strong>Life is Strange, you’re encouraged to go back around and try approaching the game from a different angle, making new choices that open up fresh paths through the title.</p>



<h2 id="h-this-action-will-have-consequences">This Action Will Have Consequences</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Deck Nine has established something special with Double Exposure, and we now know it’s not the end for Max Caulfield. This isn’t a spoiler as it was announced by Square Enix, but the character <strong>will return </strong>in future games, which is nothing but a win for all involved.</p>



<p>As I played through Life is Strange: Double Exposure, I found it extremely difficult to be critical of the game. If I have any concerns, they’re mostly centred around the game’s audio. I felt at times that the audio balancing was a little strange, and in one scene, voices could be deafening, while in the next, they’d be whisper-quiet.</p>



<p>At one point, I had a bug that made one character’s voice muffled as though they were standing three rooms over and talking to me through the walls.</p>



<p>It’s not enough to take away from the wonderful set pieces, unique story elements, and phenomenal acting, though. I believe that Double Exposure features the best acting work in the series, and the whole ‘between two worlds’ mechanic is brilliantly done, encouraging players to constantly poke and prod to capture all the small details.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<p>As a Life is Strange fan, I can’t recommend this game enough. Beyond that, even if I weren’t a fan, this is a solid creation from a dedicated team, backed by a brilliant cast and a stellar engine that makes the game look unbelievably good at times. It’s <strong>well worth </strong>the investment. Max Caulfield is back and she’s better than ever, and that’s all the average fan should need to know to pick up their copy.</p>

<p>It wasn’t the quadruple-threat collection I expected, but Epic Games has gone ahead and done it anyway. On social media, images have surfaced showcasing the Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Juice Wlrd, and Ice Spice skins coming soon to the world’s most popular battle royale game, and fans are excited, to say the least.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-run-it-back-with-snoop-eminem-ice-spice-and-juice-wrld-in-battle-royale?lang=en-US&amp;sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite blog</a>, Epic unveiled the collection of skins and new locations debuting soon in the Chapter 2 Remix. From Snoop Dogg’s ‘Doggfather’ mansion to Eminem’s restaurant, ‘Mom’s Spaghetti’ in the Grotto, there’s plenty to explore in the coming weeks with this update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-interesting-update">Interesting Update</h2>



<p>Players will have to contend with these artists as enemies in Fortnite, with each character taking over a unique, on-theme location and dropping rare loot upon defeat. For instance, if you slay Eminem, he’ll turn around on a dime and help you out, offering you the Mythic RG Minigun.</p>



<p>Through November, each new week will be dedicated to the arrival of a different artist. First, players will fight Snoop Dogg, then Eminem, and in the third week, they’ll contend with Ice Spice on Shark Island. </p>



<p>In the fourth and final week, players will come face to face with Juice Wrld, but instead of fighting him, Epic has arranged a tribute to his legacy, offering a unique ‘Slayer Juice Wrld Outfit’ to any player logging in during a specific window. He’ll also be the frontman for the Remix: The Finale live event on November 30.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to this hip-hop collaboration in Fortnite? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> which skin you’re most excited to cop.</p>

                <p>This week, Dragon Age fans have been able to dive back into the continent of Thedas in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-gone-gold/1100-6526915/" data-ref-id="1100-6526915">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. Longtime players may recognize that events in the game were foreshadowed in some of the previous installments. According to former Dragon Age lead writer David Gaider, that's because he laid out of the series' lore years ago in a document that's still influencing the direction of the games.</p><p>"The way I created the world was to seed plots in various parts of the world that could be part of... a single game," Gaider told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "Then there was the overall uber-plot, which I didn't know for certain that we would ever get to, but I had an understanding of how it all worked together... A lot of that was in my head until we were starting Inquisition and the writers got a little bit impatient with my memory or lack thereof, so they pinned me down and dragged the uber-plot out of me. I'd talked about it, I'd hinted at it, but never really spelled out how it all connected, so they dragged it out of me. We put it into a master lore doc, the secret lore, which we had to hide from most of the team."</p><p>Although Gaider left BioWare after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review/1900-6416222/" data-ref-id="1900-6416222">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, there are signs in The Veilguard that his original plan is still being followed, at least to a degree. He pointed to the return of Fen'Harel as a major example. However, Gaider declined to state what his original ending for the Dragon Age lore was just in case BioWare ever gets around to telling that story.</p><p>"I always had this dream of where it would all end, the very last plot," added Gaider. " But the idea that this uber-plot was this sort of biggest, finite... That the final thing you could do in this world that would break it was there as a 'Maybe we would get to do that one day.'"</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté has addressed the online backlash which has swirled around the main characters of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the subsequent  impact it has had on the game's development staff, and the attempts by bad faith commenters to disrupt and dissuade creative teams from telling stories featuring diverse and inclusive characters in general.</p>
<p>Speaking tonight in London, at an event organised by BAFTA and attended by Eurogamer, Coté offered a full-throated defence of his team's work on Shadows which has come under such notable criticism this year, particularly over the inclusion of Black samurai Yasuke as one of the game's two protagonists. Coté has addressed the subject previously, in particular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">when the subject was commented on negatively by X owner and billionaire Elon Musk</a>, but never before in such an impassioned manner, in so much detail, at such length.</p>
<p>Discussing the current "shifting cultural landscape", Coté described the current "discussions around representation and inclusivity in media" as an additional and previously unforeseen challenge. "These conversations can influence how our games are perceived, but rather than shy away from those conversations, we should see them as an opportunity," he explained.</p>

<p>"Assassin's Creed has always been about exploring the full spectrum of human history, and by its very nature, that history is diverse. Staying true to history means embracing the richness of human perspectives - without compromise. For example, in Assassin's Creed Shadows, we highlight figures, both fictional like Naoe, a Japanese woman warrior, and historical, like Yasuke, the African born samurai. While the inclusion of a Black samurai in feudal Japan has sparked questions and even controversy, Naoe, as a fictional character, has also faced scrutiny for her gender.</p><p>"But just as Yasuke's presence in Japanese history is fact, so too are the stories of women who defied societal expectations and took up arms in times of conflict," Coté continued. "So while both Naoe and Yasuke's stories are works of historical fiction, they reflect the collision of different worlds, cultures and roles, and their inclusion is precisely the kind of narrative that Assassin's Creed seeks to tell, one that reflects the complexity and interconnectedness of our shared history.</p>
<blockquote>"We've consistently introduced protagonists from diverse racial, ethnic and gender identities."</blockquote>
<p>"And this isn't new ground for the franchise," he noted. "From Altair to Aveline de Grandpré to Ratonhnhaké:ton [the protagonists of Assassin's Creed 1, Liberation and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> respectively], we've consistently introduced protagonists from diverse racial, ethnic and gender identities. History is inherently diverse, and so is Assassin's Creed and the stories we tell. So to be clear, our commitment to inclusivity is grounded in historical authenticity and respect for diverse perspectives, not driven by modern agendas."</p>
<p>Coté's tone seemed notably different to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Ubisoft's last, vague mention of "polarised comments" by company boss Yves Guillemot</a>, who raised eyebrows in September when he told investors that Ubisoft was "an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda". Guillemot's comments followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-team-acknowledges-elements-that-have-caused-concern-among-japanese-fans">similarly vague blanket apology by Ubisoft</a> for "some elements in our promotional materials [that] have caused concern within the Japanese community" which also stated that "while Yasuke is depicted as a samurai in Assassin's Creed Shadows, we acknowledge this is a matter of debate and discussion". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-condemns-malicious-developer-abuse-after-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal">Guillemot had previously condemned</a> the "malicious and personal online attacks" directed at Shadows' development team in the wake of the game's reveal.</p><p>"Alongside these deep-rooted franchise values is our commitment to recognise and listen to legitimate criticism as an essential part of the creative process," Coté said tonight. "Our community helps us grow, evolve and deliver better games. Today, we all however face the added challenge of distinguishing between genuine feedback and attacks driven by intolerance.</p>
<p>"The current climate is tough on our creative teams," he continued. "They face lies, half truths and personal attacks online. When the work they pour their hearts into is twisted into a symbol of division, it's not just disheartening, it can be devastating. What keeps me going is the resilience born out of conviction that I see in our teams every day. I am especially proud of the Shadows team for staying true to their creative vision and the core tenets of Assassin's Creed.</p>
<blockquote>"Our creative teams face lies, half truths and personal attacks online."</blockquote>
<p>"By choosing Naoe and Yasuke as protagonists, we are expanding the narrative landscape, offering new points of view that challenge established norms found in many works of fiction, while staying true to the history that shaped them. At the end of the day, Assassin's Creed is not just a franchise, it's a platform for entertainment, dialogue, discovery and understanding. Our commitment isn't just about reflecting on the past, it's about ensuring that the stories we tell continue to unite, inspire and challenge players, regardless of their background, and we'll continue to stand by these values because they are central to the heart of the franchise, and I believe, to the future of storytelling itself. Ultimately, we believe that the diversity and richness of the human experience is what helps Assassin's Creed resonate with players across the globe, and we're committed to standing firm on that foundation."</p>
<p>Coté noted that Assassin's Creed has featured universal themes "like resistance to tyranny and the preservation of knowledge and identity" since its outset, and that it has always featured an opening message acknowledging the game as a work of fiction created by a team diverse in both its backgrounds and beliefs. "From the very beginning, Ubisoft has embraced this diversity," Coté said. "Assassin's Creed is more than just a game. It can be a platform for meaningful exploration and reflection wrapped in the excitement of unforgettable gameplay, and it is that fusion of creativity, diversity, immersion and fun that continues to define the franchise and connect it with players around the globe."</p>
<p>Coté closed with a broader reflection on the stifling of creative freedoms more generally, as cultural differences become ever more divisive.</p>
<p>"Today, the stakes are higher," Coté said. "The stories we tell, the characters we create and the game worlds we build are instrumentalised by those who seek to silence creativity, to stoke fear and incite hatred. I believe we are facing what [author] Fareed Zakaria calls an 'Age of Revolution', a time when the real conflict is not between the left and the right, but between societies that close themselves off and those that open themselves up to the world. Throughout history, it's the open societies that have always eventually prevailed. While there may be setbacks over years or even decades, it is openness that has continually pushed humanity forward.</p>
<blockquote>"When we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, until freedom and creativity wither away."</blockquote>
<p>"This echoes the selfless bravery of our Assassin's Creed protagonists," he continued. "They fought for freedom, knowledge and the right to chart their own paths, just as we, as creators, fight to tell stories that matter in a world that grows increasingly divided. As the authors of 'How Democracies Die' so powerfully stated, democracies crumble when good people decide to stay silent. The same is true, I think, of our creative freedom when we allow fear to stifle our voices. When we self-censor in the face of threats, we hand over our power, piece by piece, until freedom and creativity both wither away. We cannot let that happen. It's time for us as creators to stand firm on our commitment to our values, by telling stories that inspire, that challenge and that help people connect. Our silence cannot become complicit.</p>
<p>"To our players - the ones who have stood by us, supported us and celebrated our work over the years with enthusiasm and constructive feedback - this stance is for you," Coté concluded. "You are the heart of our journey. We create for you, and your support fuels our creativity and strengthens our resolve to keep pushing boundaries, to tell stories that matter. This journey is yours as much as it is ours, and I thank you for being with us every step of the way. I'm an optimist and a dreamer. I believe that the answer to hate is to continue creating experiences that celebrate the richness of our world and capture the magic of our collective imagination, because in the end, creativity is stronger than fear, and together, we are creating the future of entertainment."</p><p>Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-on-adapting-japanese-culture-social-media-pressures-and-ubisofts-controversial-apology">previously sat down with Assassin's Creed Shadows' art director</a> Thierry Dansereau to discuss the game's adaption of Japanese culture, social media pressures and Ubisoft's controversial apology. "Of course we're making creative choices," Dansereau told me. "It's a video game."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's only fitting for the man who is not only headlining Fortnite Festival Season 6, but who will also feature prominently in this new music-heavy retro season of battle royale.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zJK2qBcSYs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9zJK2qBcSYs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As has long been rumored, Fortnite Chapter 5 is wrapping up with a sequel to last year's OG season. Chapter 2 Remix will, as the name implies, focus on Chapter 2--specifically the first few seasons. The season will run for just a month, ending on the evening of November 30, and will bring with it the Remix Pass. The Remix Pass is shorter than a normal battle pass at just 70 tiers, and it includes five skins that are remixes of existing skins from early Chapter 2. That's one more skin than last year's OG Pass included.</p><p>Each week of the Remix season will focus on a different artist. Week 1 is Snoop, Week 2 is Eminem--complete with a new skin inspired by his Houdini music video get-up, Week 3 is Ice Spice, and the fourth and final week will feature a tribute to the late Juice WRLD. Each week will come with themed locations and weapons in battle royale, and new item shop skins for each of the artists. And to top it all off, a cel-shaded Juice WRLD skin will be given out for free to anyone who logs in on the final day of the season, November 30, when the Remix finale event will go down.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4393788-fortniteremixchapter2snoopdogg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393788" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4393788-fortniteremixchapter2snoopdogg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393788"></a><figcaption>Snoop Dogg is headlining both Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 and Festival Season 6.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4393788-fortniteremixchapter2snoopdogg.jpg"></figure><p>Over in Fortnite Festival, Snoop Dogg is headlining a new Music Pass with a throwback cel-shaded skin, and he also has a bundle of item shop cosmetics as well. At 1,400 V-Bucks, this pass is cheaper than the previous Festival passes, but it still includes four jam tracks in addition to some Festival instruments. The tracks are:</p><ul><li>"Robbery" by Juice WRLD</li><li>"Bounce Back" by Big Sean</li><li>"Crank That" by Soulja Boy Tell Em</li><li>"Young, Wild and Free" by Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa and Bruno Mars</li></ul><p>The new season of Fortnite Festival will run until January 14.</p>

                <p>Black Friday is still weeks away, but that’s not stopping some brands from getting a jump start on the biggest shopping holiday of the year. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fblogs%2Fpromotions%2Fblack-friday-cyber-monday-2024&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Maingear</a> is one of the first to rush through the gates, with massive savings that <strong>run through December 8</strong>. Along with big discounts on four prebuilt gaming PCs, most PCs in the sale are eligible for free two-year warranties, free shipping, and a Nvidia game bundle that gets you a free copy of Star Wars Outlaws.</p><p>Most of the gaming rigs on sale are ultra-premium models equipped with the latest hardware on the market. The most enticing of the bunch might be the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fmg-1-4070-super-bf24&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MG-1 4070 Super / 7800X3D</a>, which is seeing a nice <strong>$420 discount</strong>. Along with the RTX 4070 Super and Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, it’s equipped with 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, and Windows 11. The discount brings it to $1,877--which is a pretty great deal for all those components.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4393738-mg-1-legendary-bfcm-2024-edition.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393738" data-ratio="0.56243756243756" data-width="1001" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4393738-mg-1-legendary-bfcm-2024-edition.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393738"></a><figcaption>MG-1 RTX 4080 Super / Ryzen 7800X3D</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4393738-mg-1-legendary-bfcm-2024-edition.jpg"></figure><p>For something even more affordable, you’ll find the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fmg-1-4060-ti-bf24&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MG-1 4060 Ti / 7600X</a> on sale for $1,388 (was $1,666). It drops you down to the RTX 4060 Ti, though it’s still more than capable of handling most games without any difficulty. Other notable specs include 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, and a Ryzen 5 7600X CPU.</p><p>At the premium end of the spectrum is the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fzero-lcd&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MG-1 4070 Ti Super / 7800X3D</a> for $2,833 (was $3,334). It’s loaded with an RTX 4070 Ti Super, AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 2TB SSD, and 48GB RAM, making it an absolute powerhouse. It also comes with a free Lian-Li Uni Fan upgrade--a bonus that can’t be found on the other three models on sale.</p><p>These discounts will stick around until December 8, though Maingear notes that <strong>inventory is limited</strong>--so if one of the items is popular, it could disappear before the anticipated end date. Here’s a closer look at all four products to help you decide if one is a good upgrade for your needs. You’ll also find two gaming laptops up for grabs, though their deals aren’t quite as enticing as the prebuilt desktops.</p><h2>Best Maingear Desktop Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fmg-1-4060-ti-bf24&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MG-1 (RTX 4060 Ti, Ryzen 5 7600X, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD)</a> -- $1,388 ($<del>1,666</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fmg-1-4070-super-bf24&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MG-1 (RTX 4070 Super, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD)</a> -- $1,877 ($<del>2,297</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fmg-1-4080-super-bf24&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MG-1 (RTX 4080 Super, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD)</a> -- $2,494 ($<del>2,960</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fzero-lcd&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MG-1 (RTX 4070 Ti Super, Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 48GB RAM, 2TB SSD)</a> -- $2,833 ($<del>3,334</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fml-16-rtx-4060&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ML-16 Laptop (RTX 4060, Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD)</a> -- $1,699 ($<del>1,799</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-15802428%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmaingear.com%2Fproducts%2Fml-16-rtx-4070&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmaingear-prebuilt-pc-early-black-friday-doorbusters%2F1100-6527541%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ML-16 Laptop (RTX 4070, Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD)</a> -- $1,977 ($<del>2,199</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-games-on-sale-for-great-prices-tears-of-the-kingdom-for-45-echoes-of-wisdom-for-50/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom And Echoes Of Wisdom Get Stellar Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition In Stock On Launch Day For PS5 And Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp;

In each week of November, Fortnite will have a waterfall rollout of new map locations "revamped" by the artists, culminating in a finale event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chapter 2 Remix was revealed alongside a surprise billboard takeover of Times Square in New York City on Friday night with performances from Ice Spice and Snoop Dogg. (Ice Spice played "Princess Diana," and Snoop Dogg did "Who Am I (What's My Name)?", "Gorgeous," "Drop It Like It's Hot," and "The Next Episode.") The concert was also livestreamed simultaneously on Fortnite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Week 1 will have Snoop Dogg's touch, remixing the point of interest formerly known as The Agency as The Dogg Pound. It will also bring back the boogie bomb that triggers "Drop It Like It's Hot." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The in-game compound was at least partially inspired by his actual 30+ room compound – converted from a warehouse 10 years ago – located nearby the Los Angeles International Airport, his son Cordell Broadus told press after the event.

Tonight's Chapter 2 Remix: The Prelude live event has just concluded in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, with more than 10 million players in-game and millions more watching via YouTube and TikTok. 
</p>
<p>
As Fortnite's in-game countdown clock reached zero, tonight's event was revealed to be a livestreamed concert held for real in New York's Times Square, where Ice Spice and Snoop Dogg performed in front of a large crowd. 
</p>
<p>
Both singers will join Fortnite's next season, Chapter 2 Remix, which kicks off tomorrow. They'll also be joined in-game by the returning Eminem, who headlined last year's Big Bang in-game event, and who looks to be getting another skin. 
</p>

<p>
An even more surprising addition, perhaps, will be late rapper and Fortnite fan Jarad "Juice WRLD" Higgins. Players who log in on 30th November, when Chapter 2 Remix concludes with a further live event, will get a cel-shaded Slayer Juice WRLD skin for free. It's the first time Fortnite has featured a skin based on the likeness of someone who is deceased.
</p>
<p>
"Jarad always loved to play Fortnite - it was more than just entertainment for him, it was a way to connect with others," said Carmela Wallace, mother of Jarad "Juice WRLD" Higgins' mother in a statement tonight. 
</p>
<p>
"From a young age, video games were a part of how he bonded with friends and family, and being in Fortnite is an incredible tribute to that connection. I know he would be overjoyed to see how his love for games continues to bring people together across different spaces, just like his music does."
</p>
<p>
Snoop Dogg also released a statement tonight, ahead of his arrival in Fortnite, beginning with Chapter 2 Remix's launch tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
"Being part of Fortnite is all about creating, playing, and sharing my music and culture with the next generation," Snoop said. "My son Cordell's a big Fortnite player with me, so when we had the opportunity we jumped on it as a new way to connect with my sound and style. Anyone can be Snoop in Fortnite."

<p>
Chapter 2 Remix is set to last four weeks, and introduce a new music artist each week, located at familiar Chapter 2 locations. Snoop (who notably is also Fortnite Festival Season 6's featured artist) will take up residency at The Agency, while Eminem appears on 7th November at The Grotto, Ice Spice turns up in week three on 14th November at Shark Island, and a fresh landmark dedicated to Juice WRLD turns up in week four, from 21st November.
</p>
<p>
Gameplay-wise, Chapter 2 Remix will see the long-awaited return of motorboats, with helicopters set to return later in the season. Snoop's hydraulic-bouncing 1966 Cadillac DeVille will also be available, and yes you can make it jump in the air. 
</p>
<p>
A new cosmetic type, Kicks, is being introduced so your skins can wear branded footwear, because of course. Initial brands include Nike and Jordan, with the latter included in the new season pass.
</p>
<p>
Further additions beginning tomorrow include a new map for Fortnite Reload, which includes different landmarks from the Fortnite Chapter 1 map, that will rotate every 30 minutes with the original Reload map. A new solos mode for Fortnite Reload will also debut, where players have three lives total. 
</p>
<p>
One last, long-requested feature: improvements to Fortnite's locker will mean you can once again bundle saved loadouts, with space for 200 now added.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/coldridge-explores-the-wild-west-one-hex-at-a-time.1025832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/coldridge-indie-steam-pc-4x-exploration<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was alerted this week--on Linkedin no less, in case you were wondering how hard it is for a game to bust out of Steam's algorithm these days, even when the game is catered seemingly exclusively to you--to the release of <em>Coldridge</em>.</p><p>It's a turn-based exploration game. Not a turn-based combat game, not a tactics exercise, you don't even build anything, all you do here is push out into a foggy map, seeing what resources and dangers lie beyond, one hex at a time. I've seen others say it's simply the opening turns of <em>Civilization</em> broken out into their own game, and while that's mostly correct, there are a few points of difference.</p><p>It's got the same overall vibes as the beginning of <em>Civ</em>, sure. It's just a scout and the unknown. The thing is, without the rest of a 4X game to follow on from the exploration, the context here is entirely different. Instead of scoping out places to settle and having the freedom to take your time, <em>Coldridge </em>is a roguelite with an emphasis on scouring the frontier for resources.</p><p>Playing as said scout, you arrive at a mysterious and ruthless town, where you're given board in exchange for the completion of a series of contracts. To complete them you need to--yes, you guessed it--go explore the surrounding wilderness, discovering resources that the "Guild" offering you the contracts can seize and sell off.</p><figure></figure><p>Movement is everything here, as the map is only revealed and the resources only secured by moving the player onto a hex. Of course just moving a scout around a map onto some trees and bison would be too easy, so the catch comes in the form of <em>Coldridge's </em>sense of economy: You only get a certain number of expeditions to complete each year, and each expedition only lasts a handful of turns. So you've got to be <em>really </em>careful which contracts you take on and how strategically you make your moves.</p><p>It's a cruel, stingy game! Narratively the only thing keeping you alive is the fact you're allowed to stay inside the walls of Coldridge, and you're only allowed to stay so long as you keep completing the Guild's contacts, which become increasingly bloated and selfish over the course of the game, asking you to claim more and more on each run while facing increasing risk and danger. This makes <em>Coldridge </em>hard; there's one hell of a difficulty spike just moving from the first to second year, but once you learn <em>Coldridge's </em>own stringent rhythms, instead of just trying to play <em>Civ</em> over and over, you'll get the hang of it.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Coldridge - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BhXA1aqDRH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It's all very clean and direct and uncluttered. It's got great art, a snappy interface, some cool music, and it's just generally a very cool idea for a game and its setting. <em>Coldridge</em> has a solid roguelite structure too, which helps with the aforementioned difficulty; every run, even the most disastrous, can unlock new items and perks you can use next time around. The fact it's turn-based means you can take all the time in the world planning your moves while watching the gorgeous little bison and pretty little plains that litter the gorgeous map.</p><p>With such a sturdy bedrock, then, it's a shame that <em>Coldridge </em>felt the need to lean so heavily on its characters and dialogue, both of which are hammy and overwritten and which the game could have easily done without. A more interesting story than the story itself can be found in your actions out in the field; it's affecting to scout for bison in these beautiful, untouched fields, only to see industry come swooping in and strip the map of these "resources", then realise...it's all your fault.</p><p><em>Coldridge</em>--which was developed by a pair of veteran Amplitude (<em>Humankind</em>, <em>Endless Legend</em>, etc) devs--is out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3052500/ColdRidge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This time around, Snoop Dogg and Ice Spice took the stage — both in the game and IRL at Times Square in New York — and once the season kicks off, the musical aspects will go a step farther. </p><p>As the name implies, the new mini season brings back many of the characters, gameplay elements, and locations of the game’s second chapter, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20916237/fortnite-chapter-2-new-map-season-11-black-hole-design-epic-games">which launched in 2019</a>. Chapter 2 was notable in particular because it erased the original battle royale map to start over fresh for the first time. (The Chapter 2 map itself would be swapped out in 2021 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22815391/fortnite-the-end-event-chapter-2-recap-highlights-news">when it flipped over in dramatic fashion</a>.) The month-long event will change things up weekly, with new elements themed around a different musical artist. Snoop Dogg is up first, followed by Eminem, Ice Spice, and culminating with Juice WRLD.</p><p>The remixed version of Chapter 2 begins on November 2nd and will run through November 30th, with Epic teasing a “finale” event to wrap things up. It’s also introducing a new cosmetic item: kicks, so that you can put a pair of Nikes on Peely the banana.</p><div><p>Going back in time isn’t new for the game. A year ago <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948555/fortnite-og-new-season">Epic kicked off <em>Fortnite OG</em></a>, a throwback mini season that was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23993686/fortnite-og-new-players-lego-fortnite">designed specifically to lure back lapsed players</a>, before the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">dramatically expanded with new experiences like <em>Lego Fortnite</em></a>. Similarly, music has long been a large focus for the game, with virtual concerts from the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">Travis Scott</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a>, along with a rhythm game called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band"><em>Fortnite Festival</em></a> featuring stars like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137317/billie-eilish-fortnite-festival-date">Billie Eilish</a>.</p></div><div><p>More recently, Epic has started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24282075/fortnite-streamlining-battle-passes-music-lego-festival">streamlining <em>Fortnite</em>’s battle passes to better accommodate all of its many games</a>. Meanwhile, a number of notable places have been crafting <em>Fortnite</em> islands of late, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261095/hasbro-board-games-fortnite">Hasbro</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24279789/fortnite-espn-football-island-disney">ESPN</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24281908/where-we-voting-boys">the Kamala Harris campaign</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dragon-age-veilguard-review-controversy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These days, when a big new game comes out, you can pretty much roll the dice on what kind of reactionary controversy it will produce. Are we looking at a moral panic over trans characters? Diversity consulting? Games journalists being too positive? Games journalists being too negative? Some other quibble that will be forgotten in a week, interchangeably swapped out like grains of sand dragged away by the unrelenting tide? Anyway, the usual suspects got mad about <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> reviews this week.&nbsp;</p><p>You can listen to this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours for a full rundown of <em>why</em>, but the whole thing is illustrative of a larger, more important issue: Thanks to algorithmic prioritization on sites like YouTube and Twitter, this is how a growing number of people engage with video games. Plenty of normal people still manage to tune it out the hours-long rants and conspiracy theories, but at what point does this rancid flavor of brain rot go from a vocal niche to a borderline-mainstream position? And what are the long-term consequences of that?</p><p>Also on this week’s episode: We lament <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the untimely end of Firewalk</a>, the studio that made <em>Concord </em>to Sony’s specifications and then promptly got dumpstered for it. Will the industry actually learn from this? We can only hope. Then we move on to more media layoffs, <a href="https://aftermath.site/fandom-gamespot-screen-junkies-layoffs-restructuring" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this time at Fandom</a>, which owns GameSpot, among a sometimes-baffling lineup of other properties (TV’s Guide’s website? Huh!). Oh, and we solve <em>the hell</em> out of what would seem to be an impossible puzzle: How does a worm drive a little apple car?&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that Aftermath can grow so large that it becomes the entire internet, supplanting YouTube and other platforms with the kinds of refreshingly chill conversations we regularly have in our Discord (which you can join by <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subscribing to our “member” tier</a>).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I guess my doomer-pilled concern about all of this is that as the American fascist project continues to grow in power and all of these platforms facilitate these ways of talking about things – conspiratorial thinking and whatnot – do we reach a point where [this becomes the default]? Because I would say that right now, this is still not the way most normal people talk about games or engage with them. A lot of people, as we see even based on <em>Dragon Age</em>’s Steam numbers right now, saw this game, thought it looked cool, bought it, and now they’re playing it. If you look at Asmongold’s most-viewed video about all of this, it has around one million views. One million sounds like a lot! But this game will probably be bought by north of ten million people. So it’s a fraction. And even then, a lot of the people who watched that video were probably never going to buy the game anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>So it’s not negligible, exactly, but it’s still a niche. But as these things continue to have relatively convenient onramps – like searching “<em>Dragon Age</em>” on YouTube and getting pulled down this rabbit hole – do we reach a point where this is the predominant mode of conversation around games? Inmates taking over the asylum or whatever; is that where we’re headed? Because we’ve seen this in American politics: The more you enable these people structurally or systematically, the more footing they gain until they become a default.&nbsp;</p><p>Are we looking at that in the conversation around games, too? Are we already a large part of the way there? And then to what extent are the people who are engaging with this stuff and dunking on these people constantly also facilitating it? I don’t know. I hate to use this phrase, but I’m just asking questions. It’s one of those things that… I wouldn’t say it keeps me up at night, but when I can’t sleep, I’m like “I may as well also make myself feel bad.” And so I start thinking about things like this.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I want to say that it’s still a small number of people broadly. And I was talking to someone else this week about how we see the internet, but there are also millions of people playing video games who are not on the internet. So what are people actually doing? To some extent, you’ll never know. And I want to say that at least on Twitter, it’s an echo chamber. But I don’t know. This conspiracy about Sweet Baby, is it this widespread conspiracy, or is it three loud guys and their friends? I think seeing this colloquial usage of it <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/dualshockers-promotes-idiotic-alt-right-sweet-baby-conspiracy-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-review-hastily-deletes.1021527/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in this DualShockers review</a> makes me think “Oh God, maybe it’s a bigger thing.” Who just says that?</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> I think an important thing to remember is, we work in video games, and we work directly with people who know as much about video games as possible and as much about the video game media ecosystem as possible. The people who follow us on social media, all they do is talk about video games all day. Our peers and colleagues and former colleagues, that’s all we talk about. As a sample of the game-playing public, we are a tiny fraction of people. All my IRL friends will talk to me about a <em>Call of Duty</em> game once a year. Everyone I play football with will talk to me about <em>EA Sports FC</em> once or twice a year to complain about it. They don’t play <em>Dragon Age</em>. They don’t know what it is. They barely know what <em>Fortnite </em>is.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s the same for everything: It’s music. It’s movies. People don’t consume media about these things constantly on a daily basis. It’s easy for us to lose track of that because we think everybody does, because everybody around us does. But my experience with this stuff – because I make it my point to know as many people outside of games as possible to avoid becoming a broken husk of a person – is [that] it’s really important to get that perspective. It’s fucking video games. No one cares. Play a game you like or don’t. You don’t need to go online and talk about it for 18 hours a day or whatever.&nbsp;</p><p>So yes, people like Asmongold are out there making these videos, but like Nathan said, what’s a video like that going to top out at? A million? Worldwide? Among English-speaking people? That’s not shit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Right. There are well over 300 million people in the United States alone.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Right, and that doesn’t include English-speaking people in Europe and the rest of the Anglosphere. I don’t think it’s something to be worried about as a discourse-shaping trend; it’s more just a bummer for that type of content on that type of medium. It’s gonna go on its own journey, and during that time people are going to be put off it. People might stop watching that kind of content and look somewhere else. They might look on TikTok or on blogs like Aftermath dot site. </p><p>It’s not a given that every 13 year-old boy watching an Asmongold video is going to turn into someone who thinks like that.&nbsp;Most people are relatively normal, and there’s a point where once people with a certain kind of hateful or twisted or conspiratorial view start to get oxygen and start to get enabled, their views become increasingly bizarre to a normal person. People aren’t so easily brainwashed that they’ll all just go along with that. </p><p>Obviously the political situation in the United States shows that lots of people can if they’re subjected to it long and hard enough, but on a global basis, on a normal-person basis, a lot of people will eventually be like “I think this guy’s fucking weird” or “Who cares? It’s <em>Dragon Age</em>” or “Not everything has to be a conspiracy and a political gesture.” I’m more optimistic than other people are with that stuff, but it’s more of a YouTube problem than a societal problem. They need to sort that out.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>True, but in addition it’s a Twitter problem, it’s a Facebook problem, with Asmongold there it’s a Twitch problem, it is to some extent a TikTok problem.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> But Facebook is a great example because kids don’t use Facebook anymore. It’s boomer shit, and it’s full of weirdos, so they stopped using it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> But it’s a radicalization engine for boomers. All of these things are radicalization engines. They all ended up at the same place despite starting at different starting points. If we’re just talking on radicalization engines – those are our main means of communication – then how long until everyone is some flavor of radicalized, and not for the better? And again, you talk about polarized politics in our country; we’re already part of the way there. I hope that things get better, but I think that will require a concerted effort on the part of those who want them to be better to build something else. I think as long as we’re doing it all [on these platforms], there will be a slow but steady downward trend.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is the third patch to arrive since last weekend’s release and adds a host of tweaks and fixes for glitches big and small. Although the update largely focuses on Multiplayer and Zombies, it also includes a trio of universal touch-ups, including the removal of that pesky black screen glitch that has bothered players when trying to load into a match.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/codblops6-1725926226920.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 update brings fixes for Multiplayer and Zombies.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 Multiplayer adjustments include the removal of Lowtown from the Infected map pool while adding the same mode to Private Match’s list of available modes. Players will now find that the Shotgun Slug attachment deals the correct amount of damage, too. Stability improvements have also arrived to address hiccups revolving around the UAV Scorestreak, Infected medals, and the Vigilance Perk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s typical for some players to take advantage of map exploits shortly after launch, and it’s also typical for the team at Activision to move quickly when squashing these exploits. Today’s update is no different, as it comes with a few patched exploits in the Zombies mode. Specifically, enjoyers of the round-based game mode will no longer be able to re-activate timed GobbleGums for extra use. Additionally, the Tactical Raft can no longer be used to block zombie paths on Terminus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 launched last Friday and has already positioned itself as one of the most successful Call of Duty games of all time. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the release was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record"><u>the series’ biggest launch ever</u></a> earlier this week. Call of Duty GM Matt Cox added, “Black Ops 6 is an amazing game, and the response from the Call of Duty community has been incredible. This is only the beginning.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the launch of the updated Nuketown map today, players can expect to dive into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-gets-nuketown-this-week-as-activision-reveals-season-1-plans"><u>Black Ops 6 Season 1 when it launches November 14</u></a>.

The patch also resolves an issue that allowed players to utilize Tactical Raft to block zombies. What's more, the game had an issue where players could get stuck in Spectator mode, but that's now been fixed.</p><p>You can see all the changes for Black Ops 6 multiplayer and Zombies below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/10/bo6-preseason-patch-notes#nov1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as shared by Activision.</a> For more, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Black Ops 6 campaign</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review/1900-6418309/" data-ref-id="1900-6418309">multiplayer</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-review/1900-6418310/" data-ref-id="1900-6418310">Zombies reviews.</a> You can also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-black-ops-6-the-replacer-video-is-maybe-the-best-and-funniest-yet/1100-6527545/" data-ref-id="1100-6527545">watch The Replacer have some fun on Jeopardy</a> in a silly promo video for Black Ops 6.</p><h2>Friday, November 1, 2024</h2><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h4>Stability</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue where some players may encounter a black screen when loading into a public or private match for both Multiplayer and Zombies.</li></ul><h4>Settings</h4><ul><li>Resolved an issue when trying to select DLSS or DLAA in the upscaling options.</li></ul><h4>UI</h4><ul><li>Resolved an issue with the unlock notification for Diamond Mastery Badges.</li></ul><h3>MULTIPLAYER</h3><h4>Maps</h4><ul><li>Removed Lowtown from Infected map pool.</li></ul><h4>Modes</h4><ul><li>Added Infected to Private Match mode select.</li><li>Resolved an issue in Free-For-All where scoring was based on total score rather than the number of elimination points.</li><li>Resolved an issue in Search and Destroy where players could slide too far while defusing or planting the bomb.</li></ul><h4>Weapons</h4><ul><li>Resolved an issue with the Slug attachment on Shotguns dealing incorrect damage.</li></ul><h4>Progression</h4><ul><li>Resolved an issue where challenges requiring Dive Kills were not awarded properly.</li></ul><h4>Stability</h4><ul><li>Resolved an issue with stability when using the UAV.</li><li>Resolved an issue with stability in Infected when earning medals.</li><li>Resolved an issue with stability when using the Vigilance perk.</li></ul><h3>ZOMBIES</h3><h4>Gameplay</h4><ul><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to re-activate timed GobbleGums.</li></ul><h4>Enemies</h4><ul><li>Specials and Elites killed by scorestreaks will no longer drop items.</li></ul><h4>Terminus</h4><ul><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to block zombie pathing with the Tactical Raft.</li></ul><h4>Liberty Falls</h4><ul><li>Resolved an issue that prevented Scorestreaks from being used after completing the Main Quest.</li><li>Resolved an issue that would leave the player in spectator mode when dying after completing the Main Quest.</li></ul><h4>Stability</h4><ul><li>Resolved an issue with stability when changing field upgrades.</li><li>Added various server-side stability fixes.</li></ul><h4>UI</h4><ul><li>Adjusted round UI limit to 999 from 256.</li></ul>
