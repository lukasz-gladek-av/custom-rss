            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-gta-6-isnt-skipping-physical-discs-at-launch-2000665471</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A strange rumor that popped up online last month claimed that, to avoid early leaks, Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive were going to delay the physical release of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>and the game would only launch digitally. That’s not the case.</p> <p>On February 3, as part of Take-Two’s Q3 fiscal results, the company’s longtime CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">told <em>Variety</em></a> bluntly that the online rumors swirling around <em>GTA 6</em>‘s physical launch were nothing to worry about.</p> <p>“That’s not the plan,” Zelnick told the outlet.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/397290/gta-6-a-wersja-pudelkowa-sprzedawcy-zwiastuja-smutna-wiadomosc-dla-fanow-fizycznych-wydan.html">This odd rumor popped up in January</a> after a Polish site reported that a Rockstar insider had heard that <em>GTA 6′</em>s physical and digital releases could be split up. Once the rumor popped up in January, it quickly spread and was reported by sites like <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6s-physical-release-could-be-delayed-to-2027-because-of-leaks-3309757/"><em>Dexerto</em></a> and was posted across places like Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. Here is the original, now debunked, claim:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“We are getting more and more information that the box version will not be released simultaneously with the digital version to prevent leaks.”</p></blockquote> <p>However, <em>Kotaku</em> was unable to verify the rumor with any of its sources. And to be honest, it always seemed odd, especially when you consider digital games have leaked via pre-loads. In fact, that happened with <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/634490-grand-theft-auto-v/67072105"><em>GTA V</em> over a decade ago</a>. And now that Zelnick has weighed in officially to call the rumor false, hopefully that’s the end of it. Now, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-breakdown-secrets-spf-sunscreen-reddit-1851144759">GTA</a></em> fans can go back to figuring out the SPF rating of an NPC’s sunscreen via wild math and trailer screenshots.</p> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> launches November 19 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452">Take-Two has confirmed that marketing for the game will begin sometime in the summer</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-date-canceled-2000665470</link>
            <guid>1424674</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> was supposed to be one of the Nintendo Switch 2’s big fall 2025 releases but was indefinitely delayed amid a race to address performance issues for the PC version. Many fans hoped it might end up launching in early 2026 instead, but the Switch 2 port of <em>Borderlands 4</em> is now officially being paused.</p> <p>“We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU,” Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">told&nbsp;<em>Variety </em></a>on Thursday. “Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. We’re continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have <em>PGA Tour 2K25</em> coming out and <em>WWE 2K26</em> [for Switch 2], and we’re incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future.”</p>

 <p>What’s especially odd about the last-minute reversal is that<em> Borderlands 4</em> was already publicly demoed running on Switch 2 last summer at shows like PAX West. Assessments varied, with some players saying it looked surprisingly good while <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1958920625600569844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1958920625600569844%7Ctwgr%5Ef902f1abb49199769f6600e5bad50cb760a1d61f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fborderlands-4-performance-issues-nintendo-switch-2%2F">others said</a> it suffered from surprising performance hang-ups, even when docked.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Okay I’ll just put it bluntly:</p> <p>Borderlands 4 on the Switch 2 could barely run at 30fps with 4 enemies on screen in docked mode. It had horrendous input delay, and the render resolution was seemingly turned all the way down.</p> <p>I’ll talk more about it in a video maybe tomorrow 😬</p> <p>— EpicNNG (@EpicNNG) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1958920625600569844?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“We need to share that the release of<em>&nbsp;Borderlands 4</em> on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed,” the studio wrote <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">in a surprise announcement</a> last September less than two weeks before it was set to launch. “We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that.”</p>

 <p>Gearbox Entertainment recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-2026-road-map-updates-cross-save-new-loot-dlc-level-cap-increase-2000664254">doubled down on big plans for the looter shooter’s 2026 content roadmap</a>. That includes a new rarity of gear, raising the level cap, and fresh story content in paid DLC packs. The roadmap even called out the addition of a new photo mode. The Switch 2 port, on the other hand, was conspicuously absent. Publisher 2K Games has yet to reveal how many copies the latest sequel has sold.</p>

 <p><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s absence from the Switch 2 will be a bummer for fans hoping they’d eventually be able to jump in, but it’s not the only port that players have been patiently waiting on. <em>Elden Ring</em> was also announced for Nintendo’s new console last year and also remains MIA. Demos last summer suggested it was having framerate issues as well. Other heavy hitters like <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> have performed well enough though.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[More Grand Theft Auto VI “Marketing Beats” Coming in Summer 2026, While GTA V Has Sold Over 225M Copies]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/more-grand-theft-auto-vi-marketing-beats-coming-in-summer-2026-while-gta-v-has-sold-over-225m-copies/</link>
            <guid>1424632</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Take-Two Interactive's</strong> <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/quarterly-earnings">third-quarter financial results have been published</a>, which means there's plenty of information to glean from the company behind <strong>2K</strong> and <strong>Rockstar's</strong> latest numbers. What everyone wants to hear about, though, is <strong>Grand Theft Auto VI</strong>, which may just be the most anticipated video game ever, and in the meantime, <strong>GTA V</strong> has hit yet another astronomical sales milestone.</p>



<p>While Take-Two's chief executive officer, <strong>Strauss Zelnick</strong>, didn't get too deep into what's coming for <strong>GTA VI</strong>, he did confirm in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-googles-project-genie">The Game Business</a> and during the call with investors that we can expect more "<em>marketing beats</em>" for the game during <strong>Summer 2026</strong>. He also reaffirmed the game's release date, which is, as of the time of this writing, still set to be <strong>November 19, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>We feel great about it</em>," Zelnick told The Game Business. He added, "<em>You know me pretty well, for me to even say we've got marketing beats coming this summer, is a huge departure from what I usually say, which is that our labels will make marketing announcements</em>."</p>



<p>Last month, on GTA VI's release date, we heard that its <a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/">November date is a "<em>more real</em>" release window than its previous 2025 date</a>. Before that, Zelnick said <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-very-high-conviction-grand-theft-auto-vi-wont-be-delayed-again-rockstar/">his confidence level that the game would not be delayed was <strong>"<em>very, very high</em>."</strong></a> Everything Take-Two is projecting in this report supports that it will indeed be launching this coming November. Hopefully, that's still the case the closer we get to the date, though a lot can always change in the coming months. </p>



<p>Regarding GTA V's new sales milestone, Take-Two reports that the game has sold an astounding <strong>225 million copies</strong> over the last decade plus. It adds that the <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> series has, overall, sold a whopping <strong>465 million copies</strong> in its lifetime, which means that on its own, GTA V accounts for almost half of all copies of a Grand Theft Auto game that have been sold since the series launched in 1997.</p>



<p>Overall, Take-Two reported <strong>$1.76 billion</strong> in net bookings, well above its projected $1.6 billion for its third quarter, with Grand Theft Auto contributing its fair share to the increase in revenue. <strong>GTA Online,</strong> for its part, saw a <strong>27% increase</strong> in revenue.</p>



<p>While everything is coming up roses in Take-Two's financials, its subsidiary and Grand Theft Auto VI developer, Rockstar, continues to be under pressure from unions over the firing of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer-calls-grand-theft-auto-vi-developers-allege-union-busting-deeply-concerning/">31 workers in the UK</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">three workers in Canada</a></strong>. Rockstar continues to claim that these workers were leaking confidential information, while the IWGB union representing the fired workers continues to refute those claims and accuses Rockstar of union-busting.</p>



<p>The most recent update in that case was <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-judge-denies-fired-rockstar-employees-interim-pay-iwgb/">a UK judge denying the fired workers' interim pay</a>, though the case itself is far from over.</p>

            <p>
It's undeniable that for throwback 3D retro aesthetics, the original PlayStation and Nintendo 64 are the consoles that most people try to emulate. So I'm always quite chuffed to see a game that takes its visual cues from more recent consoles, like, say, Bel's Fanfare, a very 3DS-era looking Zelda-esque game where you play as a little demon girl who works as a cleaner on a strange, massive ship.
</p>
<p>
Armed with nought but a funny-looking shield, Bel is specifically tasked with aura cleaning, aura being a mysterious substance that comes from impurities of the soul, i.e. globs of glowy stuff that comes out when people get anxious, or sad, or traumatised. She has to go around cleaning different rooms on the ship, all inhabited by "otherworldly beings," and in turn she has to help them deal with their problem.

<p>
Bel's Fanfare very much inspired by early 3D Zelda games, the devs say as much on the game's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chibig/bels-fanfare/description">Kickstarter page</a> - by the way, it's on Kickstarter, and already funded - though to me it's look is particularly reminiscent of the 3DS Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask remasters. Combat wise, you do more blocking than attacking, which I find to be a neat twist on the genre (the genre being "Zelda-inspired RPG"), absorbing aura with it in bullet hell battle rooms, this part seemingly drawing inspiration from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>.
</p><p>
The environments are all quite varied and charming, you can gossip with the game's cast of characters, you can set people up on dates and catch fish, and "???" whatever that might be. I'll certainly be quite curious to check out the full thing whenever it launches, but in the meantime, you could join me in wishlisting it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4317460/Bels_Fanfare/">Steam</a>.

              <p><span>In 2015, </span><i><span>Gawker </span></i><span>published an article titled “</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150124104133/https://gawker.com/here-is-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epsteins-little-b-1681383992"><span>Here Is Pedophile Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s Little Black Book</span></a><span>.” It included a link to a redacted copy of Epstein’s alleged address book listing contact info for a range of famous, wealthy, and powerful people. One of them was <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-halves-pay-still-1846789618">then-Activision-Blizzard-CEO Bobby Kotick</a> who ran the publisher behind industry-defining hits like<em> Call of Duty</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em>. The latest trove of Epstein files released by the Justice Department last week shows more than a dozen emails allegedly exchanged between the two men.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Several emails dating from November 2012 show Epstein trying to set up an alleged dinner with Kotick while the latter was visiting New York. Epstein had asked the gaming executive if he’d be willing to come a day early when the actor and director Woody Allen would be available, but one of the emails shows Kotick writing back to say that wasn’t possible.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Epstein’s itinerary for that month listed a dinner with Bobby Kotick on November 18, 2012. “bobby Kotick came over last night„ hes great,” Epstein wrote to Next Model Management co-founder Faith Kates on November 19, 2012. Kates unexpectedly retired last month after her name surfaced </span><a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/12/01/society/next-model-management-co-founder-faith-kates-retires-after-jeffrey-epstein-e-mails-resurface/"><span>in a previously reported</span></a><span> batch of Epstein emails.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A representative for Epstein proceeded to send information about his private island in the Caribbean, Little St. James, to Kotick on November 21, 2012. In a follow-up exchange on December 9, 2012, Epstein asked Kotick how the Caribbean was. Kotick allegedly wrote back, “Great, wished would could have stopped by the island.”</span></p> <p><span>Emails between the two were allegedly exchanged multiple times in 2013 as well. A February 24, 2013 email stated that Epstein was in LA planning a visit to SpaceX that week and was trying to link up with Kotick while in town. “Thanks , but rather see you,” Epstein wrote in one email. “Taking girls after to bel air.” Kotick at one point allegedly wrote back, “Come with your friends to my house at…Bev Hills, 10 min=tes from Bel Air.”</span></p> <p><span>Several emails also show Epstein trying to arrange a tour of Activision. The company did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Epstein again tried to arrange a meeting with Kotick at the end of April 2013. “great… see you then i will bring 3or 4 . also I understand that Brian Grazer, like me ,searches for smart interesting people„ do you know him?” Epstein emailed Kotick on April 29, 2013. “Yes I do,” Kotick allegedly wrote back. A follow-up email from Kotick was allegedly sent later that day. “Can we meet at 6? I am running late,” it read.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The two allegedly exchanged more emails the following day. “great house, great art, i am in ny 1-6 if you have time when you come,” Epstein wrote to Kotick on April 30, 2012. “Thanks. Great guests,” Kotick allegedly wrote back. The email accounts corresponded multiple times in the days after that. “my russian guest misssed your arrival yesterday,” Epstein wrote to Kotick in a May 7, 2012 email. “And I missed her. III see you both next trip,” Kotick allegedly wrote back on May 8, 2012.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Each of these emails is dated after Epstein’s 2008 felony conviction in Florida where he pled guilty to state charges of soliciting and procuring a person under 18 for prostitution. He went on to serve a 13-month jail sentence and was added to the national sex offender registry, for which an account belonging to him was later banned from Xbox Live in December 2013.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Kotick allegedly exchanged emails with Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell as well. “You don’t ring, you don’t write. Yours heart broken Ghislain,” Maxwell wrote to Kotick in April 24, 2004. An email reply allegedly from Kotick read, “Mend it together and bring that sexy body that goes with it out to my town. III ring.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for what the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ghislaine-maxwell-sentenced-20-years-prison-conspiring-jeffrey-epstein-sexually-abuse"><span>Justice Department described as</span></a><span> “her role in a scheme to sexually exploit and abuse multiple minor girls with </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/jeffrey-epstein-charged-manhattan-federal-court-sex-trafficking-minors"><span>Jeffrey Epstein</span></a><span> over the course of a decade.”</span></p> <p><span>Kotick left Activision Blizzard in December 2023 after the company was acquired by Microsoft in a record $70 billion acquisition. The merger came at the conclusion of a lengthy regulatory process and while Activision Blizzard was facing multiple sexual misconduct lawsuits which were eventually settled with no admission of any wrongdoing.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“[N]o court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations that there has been systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard; that Activision Blizzard senior executives ignored, condoned, or tolerated a culture of systemic harassment, retaliation, or discrimination; or that Activision Blizzard’s Board of Directors including its Chief Executive Officer, Robert Kotick, acted improperly with regard to the handling of any instances of workplace misconduct,” </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tiktok-sale-bobby-kotick-1851325000"><span>read a statement</span></a><span> included in one of the court-approved settlements. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Rockstar’s parent company, Take-Two Interactive, reconfirmed that <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is set to launch this November during its quarterly earnings report and conference. Take-Two’s CEO even revealed that marketing for the long-awaited crime sim will start this summer.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-marketing-will-kick-off-this-summer-as-take-two-confidently-reaffirms-november-release-date?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter">as spotted in a press release about Take-Two’s Q3 2026 earnings results by <em>IGN</em></a>, the company confirmed that it plans to start marketing <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> sometime in the summer, which seems to indicate that the game, which has been delayed a few times now, is actually (for real) getting close to launching later this year.</p>

 <p>“I feel good about it. Very good about it,” said Zelnick when asked by the outlet how he felt about <em>GTA 6</em>‘s November 19 release. “Of course, because any time you’re getting closer to marketing beats, you’re obviously in a place where your confidence level is as high as it can be.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-googles-project-genie">Zelnick told newsletter <em>The Game Business</em></a>&nbsp;this when asked about the confirmation that<em> GTA 6</em>‘s marketing blitz was just a few months away: “You know me pretty well, for me to even say we’ve got marketing beats coming this summer is a huge departure from what I usually say, which is that our labels will make marketing announcements.”</p>

 <p>In an earnings call later in the day, Zelnick was asked how much marketing a game like GTA 6 even needs. He assured investors that Take-Two and Rockstar weren’t going to “sit back and relax.”</p> <p>“I think the opposite is true,” said Zelnick. “We are in the business of eating red meat for breakfast. I think we’ll be having a lot more red meat in the coming months. We are very fortunate that the consumer anticipation for <em>GTA 6</em> is huge. And one does have to be judicious with how one markets such an extraordinary product. Rest assured, I think you’ll be pretty astonished by the creativity that Rockstar’s marketing team brings to consumers in the coming months.”</p>

 <p>Normally, Take-Two doesn’t provide details like this, opting to let Rockstar provide those details later, so this is a good sign that <em>GTA 6</em>‘s development is on track. You don’t start committing to expensive marketing plans and telling the press about them unless everyone involved is very confident in the game’s development status. And yes, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501">in the past, Zelnick has told investors and the public he felt good about <em>GTA 6</em>‘s release date</a>, and then it was delayed. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-strauss-zelnick-ceo-take-two-interview-rockstar-games-2000617237">But in those cases</a>, he and Take-Two hadn’t committed to a marketing timeframe like this before. And while things can always change, at least for now it seems <em>GTA 6</em> is finally, for real, actually launching as planned on November 19.</p> <p><b>Update: 2/3/26, 5:35 p.m. ET: </b>Added quote from Zelnick about <em>GTA 6</em> marketing.</p>

<p>The Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) marketing train is getting ready to get into full gear. </p>



<p>As part of the company’s <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">quarterly earnings report</a> on Tuesday, Take-Two Interactive confirmed that marketing for GTA 6 will begin this summer. </p>







<p>On top of that, CEO Strauss Zelnick address concerns about a lack of a physical version of the game when it launches in the fall. </p>



<p>In speaking with Variety, Zelnick was asked about the claims that Take-Two Interactive was going to withhold from a physical release of GTA 6 until 2027 in order to prevent leaks before launch. To that notion, Zelnick bluntly said that it was<strong> “not the plan”.</strong></p>







<p>GTA 6 is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 on November 19, 2026. Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-release-date-earnings-call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaffirmed the release date</a> as part of the same earnings report. </p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> publisher, Take-Two Interactive, has reaffirmed that GTA 6 is still scheduled to release on November 19, 2026.</p>







<div><p>The update came as part of Take-Two Interactive’s <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/a68e5705-1d42-46f6-bd6b-95c219d7aac1" type="link" id="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/a68e5705-1d42-46f6-bd6b-95c219d7aac1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">quarterly earnings call</a>, where Take-Two CEO, Strauss Zelnick said,</p><p>“With ongoing momentum across many of our businesses, and the highly anticipated launch of Grand Theft Auto VI on November 19th, we continue to project record levels of Net Bookings in Fiscal 2027, which we believe will establish a new financial baseline for our business, set us on a path to enhanced profitability, and provide further balance sheet strength and flexibility.”</p></div>



<p>It’s said that marketing for the game will also begin this “this summer”, so eargely awaiting fans will have to wait a little longer to be able to see more on the game.</p>

            <guid>1424572</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Late last week, the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/30/nx-s1-5693904/epstein-files-doj-trump?ref=aftermath.site"><u>released another heavily redacted drip feed</u></a> of files tied to the criminal investigation and subsequent death of Jeffrey Epstein, a man convicted of such heinous sex crimes that his name has practically become synonymous with the idea. The files, which started releasing in late 2025, have implicated <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/a-list-of-powerful-men-named-in-the-epstein-files-from-elon-musk-to-former-prince-andrew?ref=aftermath.site"><u>numerous globally powerful figures including Donald Trump and Elon Musk</u></a>, the latter in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/30/elon-musk-epstein-files-island-visits?ref=aftermath.site"><u>brutally embarrassing fashion</u></a> (both maintain their innocence).&nbsp;</p><p>But sprinkled throughout the files are references to <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/01/30/jeffrey-epstein-was-banned-on-xbox-live/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Epstein’s banned Xbox Live account</u></a>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/jeffrey-epstein-five-nights-at-freddys-porn-via-4chan-links-emails-show-2000664667?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Five Nights At Freddy’s</em> porn</u></a>, the concept of microtransactions, and even specific people like ex-Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, former Rockstar North president and founder of <em>MindsEye </em>studio Build A Rocket Boy, Leslie Benzies, and current Rockstar president Sam Houser.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Kotick, Benzies, and Houser for more information but did not receive responses as of this publishing. Being included in the files doesn’t mean that a person has committed a crime.</p><p>Kotick and Houser have not commented publicly on the matter, though Mark Gerhard, co-CEO of Build A Rocket Boy, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-ceo-threatens-youtuber-after-epstein-video-2000665097?ref=aftermath.site"><u>issued a “cease and desist” notice</u></a> in the <em>MindsEye </em>Discord server to YouTuber Cyber Boi immediately following the latter's video titled "Leslie Benzies is in the Epstein Files." The video has since been deleted. A detailing of sexual assault allegations against Benizes contained in the Epstein files remains live on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leslie-benzies-accused-sexual-assault-in-epstein-files/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Insider Gaming</u></a> (Houser, according to a document in the files, was allegedly aware of the situation).&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-epstein-allegation-gta-mindseye-2000665340?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a statement to Kotaku</u></a>, Benzies denied the allegations: “These allegations are false, I had a 3 months consensual relationship with this person, and I have never met Jeffrey Epstein, nor have I ever visited his island, his properties or travelled on his plane. Any suggestion otherwise is misleading,” he said.</p><p>The files also contain evidence that Kotick exchanged emails with Epstein and others in his circle, but thanks to the US government’s decision to redact and decontextualize them in an obvious effort to sow confusion and discord, it’s unclear if Kotick ever met directly with Epstein or visited his island. Epstein tried to schedule <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02155539.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>dinner with Kotick (and, at one point, Woody Allen)</u></a> in November 2012 in New York. In an email sent on November 18, 2012, Epstein suggests that Kotick, at least, spent some time with him. "bobby Kotick came over last night„ hes great," <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00948221.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Epstein wrote</u></a> to Next Model Management co-founder Faith Kates, who <a href="https://pagesix.com/2025/12/01/society/next-model-management-co-founder-faith-kates-retires-after-jeffrey-epstein-e-mails-resurface/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>stepped down last year</u></a> following a different batch of Epstein emails. Kotick, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01765212.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>said to Epstein</u></a> that he wished “would [sic] could have stopped by the island” in December 2012 following a trip to the Caribbean. The two continued to correspond in 2013, with Epstein <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01787930.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>messaging Kotick</u></a> in May to say “my russian guest missed your arrival yesterday” and Kotick replying “And I missed her. Ill see you both next trip.” (It is unclear to whom they were referring.)</p><p>Also in May 2013, Epstein emailed Kotick <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01974631.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an unhinged missive about edutainment</u></a> that seems to have originally been written by <a href="https://deepfuture.tech/about-pablos/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>self-proclaimed “hacker, inventor &amp; technology futurist”</u></a> Pablos Holman after Epstein mentioned to Holman that he was meeting with former Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education Joel Klein. Here it is, in its entirety:</p><blockquote>Play "Medal of Honor" or "Call of Duty" and you will learn war history. Here's what I've been thinking.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Video games are already great at teaching. If they don't assess your level and put an appropriate challenge right in front of you, the game fails. Challenge too hard and you get frustrated and quit playing. Too easy and the game is no fun. That is exactly what a good teacher or tutor would do. Fundamentally the thing that works is a 1 to 1 student teacher ratio. Even if you have a shitty teacher or tutor, you will learn a lot because that person gets to know you and challenges you at your level. That doesn't scale, but computers do. So we have to use computers to replace teachers – or at least augment them.</blockquote><blockquote>Today's video games don't try to teach stuff we care about. Well, except for shooting bad guys. The best scheme I've come up with so far is to use X-Prize or something like it to co-opt the existing video game industry. Give out a prize to the game that comes up with the best way of teaching kids anything from a normal school curriculum. Let them pick whatever they want to teach, any grade level, and just incorporate it into their product. That's the way to get the most brains and the most users for the least money. You want to skip convincing educators and parents about this stuff and just go straight for the kids.</blockquote><blockquote>Imagine you are looking at a door in a video game. It has some squiggly symbols printed on it. Little munchkins walk up to that door and say “Konichiwa.” The door opens and they are greeted by a hot princess with big tits and a thong. The door closes in your face. You are going to fucking learn to read and pronounce Kanji.</blockquote><blockquote>Unleash that on 5th grade boys and then next thing you know, you'll have an entire generation of bilingual kids speaking Japanese to each other behind the backs of their parents and teachers.</blockquote><blockquote>Edutainment is for pussies. It doesn't work. Once kids catch on that you are trying to teach them something they shut down. We have to keep the boobs and guns and profit. You see how much money video games are making these days? Fuck educational reform. We need educational subversion!&nbsp;</blockquote><p>The next day, Kotick <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00695633.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>replied</u></a>: "X prize is a good idea but key is real world rewards. Learn to read: earn cell phone minutes, iPhone credits, virtual items in games."</p><p>Epstein forwarded Kotick’s message to Holman, who reacted by <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01762201.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>saying</u></a>, "I'm all for indoctrinating kids into an economy. You gotta love how his [e]xample for 'real world rewards' is 'virtual items in games.'"</p><p>Many have suggested that this means Epstein played a pivotal role in convincing Activision to embrace microtransactions, but this appears to be a massive overstatement; for one, Holman and Kotick were the ones making the lion's share of the above suggestions – not Epstein. For two, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</em> had just introduced microtransactions prior to the conversation, and <em>Call of Duty: Ghosts</em> would push things further in that direction a handful of months later.</p><p>In 2018, an Epstein advisor <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02624612.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>suggested</u></a> spending a large sum on Activision stock in hopes that <em>Call of Duty</em> could challenge <em>Fortnite </em>for the battle royale throne, but it seems like Epstein and his accountant, Richard Kahn, decided against it (and later <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01030996.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>mocked the advisor for it</u></a>).</p><p>Epstein maintained his fascination with games in the years following, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02466653.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>emailing back and forth in 2016</u></a> with Bitcoin Core contributor Jeremy Rubin about the latter’s idea of a creating “an intellectually sti[m]ulating game where women outperform men,” which, in his mind, would either “provide evidence of universal inferiority which would inform you (society) to not invest in gender diversity as much” or, if the experiment was successful, would help them "learn more about how to get value out of fema[l]e employees." In response to the question of whether any such games already existed, Epstein replied: “motherhood game? card games, video games= hacking. all are games . same result. . poetry. game ma[y]be :).”</p><p>If you’re not already seeing the pattern, it’s clear that Epstein and his associates saw games as mechanisms for profit, coercion, and control, a throughline that persists in his association with two key figures in Gamergate and the surrounding bedlam: Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon.</p><p>Based on available files, Epstein expressed interest in Thiel and his surveillance company, Palantir, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01877201.pdf?utm_campaign=here-s-how-epstein-broke-the-internet&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email"><u>as early as 2012</u></a>, but correspondence between the two began <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02095904.pdf?utm_campaign=here-s-how-epstein-broke-the-internet&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email"><u>in 2014</u></a>. Then, in May 2016, Epstein <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00826876.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>messaged Thiel</u></a> saying that he "would have gladly share[d] your expenses for the gawker suit" and invited him to dinner with Noam Chomsky, of all people (it is unclear if this dinner ever took place). That suit, of course, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/02/hogan-thiel-gawker-trial/554132/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>led to the collapse of Gawker Media</u></a> and the sale of its many sites – of which Kotaku, a major Gamergate target (and the former employer of all five members of Aftermath’s core staff), was one. This would <a href="https://www.headcountcoffee.com/blogs/corporate-legends-lost-empires/the-rise-and-gutting-of-gawker-media-the-lawsuit-that-reshaped-publishing?srsltid=AfmBOooL7SERVnKHpFLibbcK-roJWUN-42RO69tPpAe8KghriqIoMML1&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>send ripples through the worlds of media and journalism for years to come</u></a>, leading to a press defanged by the threat of legal annihilation.&nbsp;</p><p>The next month, shortly after the June 2016 referendum that kicked off Brexit, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02459362.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Epstein emailed Thiel</u></a>, saying "brexit, just the beginning" and then, in response to Thiel asking what he meant, "return to tribalism. counter to globalization. amazing new alliances. you and I both agreed zero interest rates were too high, and as i said in your office. finding things on their way to collapse, was much easier than finding the next bargain."</p><p>(ICE now relies on data from Palantir to <a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>figure out which neighborhoods to raid</u></a>.)</p><p>Bannon catapulted himself into the public eye in 2012 by taking over Breitbart&nbsp; – a far-right publication and core Gamergate legitimizer – and then parlaying that right-wing revitalization effort into a 2016 gig as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon?ref=aftermath.site"><u>CEO of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign</u></a>. Prior to all that, however, Bannon <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/trumps-campaign-ceos-little-known-world-warcraft-career/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>worked as CEO of Internet Gaming Entertainment</u></a>, a <em>World of Warcraft</em> gold seller. Epstein maintained his fixation with virtual currency when the two met and began collaborating closely in 2017, with the two <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02521618.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>emailing</u></a> about using crypto to fund a “populist/nationalist coalition” that could “stave off” Time’s Up – aka the #MeToo movement – “for [the] next decade plus."</p><p>Epstein and Bannon would go on to message throughout 2018 and 2019 about various attempts at reshaping the political landscape. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01614968.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bannon bragged</u></a> that he had figures and groups like far-right Italian politician Matteo Salvini, Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, and right-wing UK politician Nigel Farage dangling from his puppet strings. Epstein, in turn, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02506034.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>waxed grandiose</u></a> of “twenty thousand hackers. showing up at the same place. . .. they will be sharing ideas on hacking crypto ex[c]hanges, voting booths, medical records, crypto wallets," which piqued Bannon’s interest.</p><p>But, <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/here-s-how-epstein-broke-the-internet?ref=aftermath.site"><u>as Garbage Day points out</u></a>, this doesn’t mean Epstein, first and foremost a career scuzzball, and Bannon, who flunked out of the White House during Trump’s first term and became a (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/us/steve-bannon-prison-release.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>briefly imprisoned</u></a>) podcaster, were <em>responsible </em>for any of what was to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Based on the emails to which we currently have access to, populist politics, online disinformation, cyber warfare, and cryptocurrency were all just scaffolding for his work as a financier and sex trafficker. A way to destabilize the global order, make connections with the world’s elites, and continue enriching himself and preying on vulnerable young girls. Reading through his messages, it’s clear that he was someone who was learning to speak the language of social media and far-right populism at the same time everyone else was.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Were Epstein and Bannon really building a crypto-funded far-right coalition of pro-Russian dictators across Europe? Or were they just LARPing as kingmakers with each other over email? And does the distinction even matter if other powerful figures seemed to believe in their project?</blockquote><blockquote>It is nearly impossible to not get pulled deeper down the rabbit hole while reading through Epstein’s emails. Because, whether or not he did directly influence elections across the globe, he was trying to. And he had the means and the access to believe he could.</blockquote><p>The Epstein files, in their current <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/31/jeffrey-epstein-unreleased-files?ref=aftermath.site"><u>incomplete and piecemeal form</u></a>, are if nothing else a useful demonstration of how obscenely powerful people talk to each other – how they seek to exert control and the levers they pull on to do so. These objectives are not implied; they’re stated outright. Resulting class solidarity among the hyper-wealthy is unconstrained by laws, boundaries, or industries. If something can be used to amass more power, it’s on the table. This, obviously, includes video games and the internet, which have played an increasingly pivotal role in securing the far right’s grip on numerous institutions and governments over the past decade.&nbsp;</p><p>It is no coincidence that monstrous crimes against women and children lie at the heart of this deleterious trend, whether Epstein himself succeeded at tilting the global balance of power or not. Far-right ideology begins at home, with the familial unit. However, under this framework family is not treated as a community to be nurtured, but as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jun/08/power-patriarchy-victimhood-denial-three-experts-on-why-men-hurt-women?ref=aftermath.site"><u>property to be owned and controlled</u></a>. The option for a patriarchal man to violently abuse people – including children – is a core appeal of the ideology, which is why far-right politicians and personalities have spent years trying to normalize rolling back laws around <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn?ref=aftermath.site"><u>abortion</u></a>, <a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2025/08/gop-senator-who-said-trans-people-put-girls-at-risk-just-helped-a-relative-who-a-13-year-old/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>consent</u></a>, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/republican-lawmakers-child-marriage-abortion-1235018777/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>marriage age</u></a>, and <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/09/neil-parrott-maryland-gop-house-argument-spousal-rape/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>spousal abuse</u></a>.</p><p>The point of the project has always been to consolidate power in the hands of a select few; now we’re seeing exactly who those few are and what they intend for it to look like.

            <guid>1424554</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>EA's</strong> announcement that it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/"><strong>going private</strong> in a buyout led by the <strong>Saudi Arabia PIF</strong> and <strong>Silver Lake</strong></a> wasn't the only major deal the company made in 2025. It also <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-ca/news/ea-partners-with-stability-ai">struck a deal with Stability AI</a>, a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/googles-project-genie-shows-meaningful-progress-in-content-generation-but-it-cant-replace-creative-vision-says-analyst/">generative AI</a></strong> firm that "<em>is unlocking the power of open-source generative AI to expand human creativity,</em>" according to its <a href="https://stability.ai/">website</a>. </p>



<p>At the time of the deal, Stability AI chief executive officer, <strong>Prem Akkaraju</strong>, said, "<em>EA is a pioneer in interactive entertainment and understands that innovation begins with the creator</em>. <em>At Stability AI, we put creators at the center and build around their specific needs. By embedding our 3D research team directly with EA’s artists and developers, we’ll unlock the next level in world-building power</em>."</p>



<p>For EA's part, <strong>Rick Stringfellow</strong>, the head of visual content for the <strong>EA Entertainment</strong> division, said, "<em>EA has always been, and will continue to be, at the forefront of technology, innovation, and play</em>. <em>Partnerships like this are how we evolve the craft of game-making and give our teams the tools to tell deeper, more meaningful stories</em>."</p>



<p>Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/electronic-arts-strategy-stability-ai-deal-1236650229/">Variety</a>, EA's chief strategy officer, <strong>Mihir Vaidya</strong>, digs further into why EA made the deal, and what Vaidya believes the deal does for EA as it moves into the future. "<em>One thing we're super proud of at EA is that, over the course of our history, I think we've taken great pride in our heritage as electronic artists.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>And to be a great electronic artist, you need to have the very best technology and tools available to you. That’s been a core principle of how we’ve kind of thought about technology, is we always are looking out there for the very best technology and solutions for our creatives.</em>"</p>



<p>That's the spirit with which, according to Vaidya, EA found Stability AI, and eventually decided to partner with the company because of what it was capable of and willing to do. "<em>What really stood out to us and why we ultimately decided to partner with Stability was one of the things that we talked to all of our developers was this notion that we can’t control the tools that are available</em>. <em>Certainly there’s gaps in capabilities, but even when the tools were capable, they’re not controllable. That’s incredibly frustrating for anyone in order to see their utility in the context of their work. And when we unpack, well, why are they not controllable?</em>"</p>



<p>"...<em>Turns out you need deep customization. Customization means you have to be able to unpack the model, understand where representations of different concepts and capabilities lie, and then be able to preserve those representations but adapt them at the same time to your specific needs. It’s not a trivial task. It’s very, very difficult. And you need a partner that is able to do that. And Stability was not only able to do that, it was willing to do that</em>."</p>



<p>One thing worth remembering, as is noted in the interview, we won't see any 'fruits' of this deal for a while. GenAI tech is still finding its place within game development, if it even has a place to begin with, and that's without getting into <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-is-theft-i-have-to-use-it-otherwise-ill-get-fired-gdc-reports-one-third-of-game-workers-are-using-genai-for-daily-tasks/">the <strong>concerns and real disdain</strong> developers</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/">players have for the technology</a>.</p>



<p>On those concerns, namely, ones from developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-microsoft-laid-off-developers-being-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-built/">worried that GenAI tools will simply replace them</a>, Akkaruju believes that, while there may be some developers laid off because of GenAI tools, ultimately, there will be more jobs in game development as the industry expands because of the technology, equating it to how ATMs did not bring about the extinction of bank tellers.</p>



<p>"<em>If you add or introduce technology into making something more efficient, what ends up happening is the workforce actually expands. Labour is not fixed, and so if it was fixed, you're absolutely right, that would truly eliminate the jobs</em>," Akkaruju said.</p>



<p>"<em>When those [ATMs] were rolled out in America in the '80s, every bank teller in America was up in arms, and they said, 'This is what we do. We give withdrawals, we take deposits, and you're taking our jobs away with this machine.' And there's more bank teller jobs today than in the '80s, if you go point for point. And why is that? Because the banks did an analysis, and they went from 30 people that they needed for each location down to 13, and they did what came naturally, they expanded</em>."</p>



<p>A fine observation to make, when, as the chief executive officer of the GenAI company, you're not going to be the one losing your job when those layoffs come. And right now, when looking at EA specifically, <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/">due to the ticking time bomb that is the <strong>$20 billion debt</strong></a> the company is taking on as part of its buyout, layoffs are practically the only thing developers at EA can look forward to. And that's without getting into other major flaws between the immediate and tangible benefits ATMs brought, versus the predominantly theoretical benefits executives tout for GenAI tech that we won't see today or tomorrow, and potentially not for several years.</p>



<p>Vaidya, for his part, said he did not want to <em>"trivialize</em>" the concerns developers have about layoffs due to the introduction of GenAI tools, while still ultimately taking a similar view to Akkaruju. "<em>AI can play a role in augmenting a particular task, what's naturally going to happen is there's going to have to be a recomposition of certain tasks...Over the course of time, there's naturally new job families that also emerge.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>I think the most important thing to do, if this is the case, is to be on the front foot and lead the conversation,</em>" Vaidya continued. "<em>Because otherwise, what happens is this notion of disruption kicks in because you're not ready for that change. And as a result, this is especially the case if if that disruption comes from folks that are not insiders in the industry, but outside of it. And that's one of my biggest worries is that we become observers, as opposed to participants and leaders in this conversation, because market forces will lead to AI being deployed at scale. And there are many players outside of the creative industry today that are trying to leverage AI in the space of sport and entertainment</em>."</p>

              <p><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>is an amalgamation of every facet of pop culture, which can sometimes lead to weird moments of whiplash as it veers between awesome crossovers and properties I wouldn’t want to touch with a 10-foot pole.

              <p><em>Highguard’s</em> 5v5 mode, which launched over the weekend as a temporary experiment, is now a permanent mode in the free-to-play raid shooter. And while the new mode is better than the old 3v3 option, I’m not sure it’s enough to save this thing.</p> <p>On January 30, after some teasing, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584"><em>Highguard’s</em> devs announced a new 5v5 mode</a> was being added to the game immediately following fan feedback that the original 3v3 mode wasn’t exciting enough. At the time, <em>Highguard</em> labeled the new option as a “limited time mode.” However, apparently so many players liked it, and the reaction to it was so positive, that the mode is going to stick around permanently alongside the 3v3 mode, which isn’t going away.</p>

 <p>“You’ve been asking, and we’re happy to share—5v5 Raid Mode is here to stay,” <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412?s=20">posted <em>Highguard’s</em> official Twitter account.</a> “We appreciate everyone hopping in over the weekend to give the mode a try. We saw a fairly even split between 3v3 and 5v5, which helped inform our decision.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You've been asking, and we're happy to share—5v5 Raid Mode is here to stay! ⚔</p> <p>We appreciate everyone hopping in over the weekend to give the mode a try. We saw a fairly even split between 3v3 and 5v5, which helped inform our decision. <a href="https://t.co/S0QfgCE7vK">pic.twitter.com/S0QfgCE7vK</a></p> <p>— Highguard | LIVE NOW! (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Credit to developers Wildlight Entertainment for implementing a 5v5 mode into <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-patch-note-fov-ps5-crash-pc-optimization-2000664201"><em>Highguard</em> </a>so shortly after the game’s January 26 launch. And after playing a few 5v5 matches over the last few days, I do think it’s a better version of the game. In my experience, having more players on the map has led to more frequent firefights before the shieldbreaker fully spawns. It also makes raids bigger and more chaotic. It did cause some performance issues during those fights that involved most or all of the players, something Wildlight warned could be an issue. Hopefully, performance can be improved in 5v5 matches because it’s easily the best way to play <em>Highguard</em> and likely should have been the primary mode the game launched with last month.</p>

 <p>All that said, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646">I’m not sitting here suggesting <em>Highguard</em></a> is suddenly a great game now. A lot of <em>Highguard’s</em> issues aren’t solved by adding more players. There are still too many competing mechanics causing issues, the visuals are bland, heroes are dull, combat seems too sweaty for more casual players, and collecting loot isn’t much fun. 5v5 doesn’t change that, even if it does make the game more fun to play.</p>

 <p>I suspect this 5v5 mode will be enough to help <em>Highguard</em> escape <em>Concord’s</em> fate and let it stick around for a few more weeks at least. Beyond that, I’m not sure. I’m not convinced the world needed another online-only team-based PVP hero shooter, even if it now supports 10 players in a match.</p>
