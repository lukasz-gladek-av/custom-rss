		<p>Commodore Amiga owners were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWBSnBsCW5Y">spoilt for superb shoot ’em ups</a> with original games such as&nbsp; Xenon II, Project X, Swiv,&nbsp; and Bloody Money, and superb arcade ports such as R-Type.&nbsp;One title that stood out from the crowd was Apidiya, a game that ditched spaceships and battle stations and replaced them with insects and ponds.&nbsp; It was totally unique and it’s coming back in almost exactly the same form.</p>
<p>Apidya Special is a full remake rather than an emulated version of the original Amiga title and it’s been developed by the original team, together with a devoted Apidya super-fan-turned-developer. The new version is based on an unreleased console port from the 90s, presumably the Sega Megadrive version, and uses the original assets along with brand new pixel art.&nbsp; There’s also a new version of the soundtrack by legendary 16-bit composer Chris Hülsbeck.</p>
<p><iframe title="Apidya' Special Announcement Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OHiFhz-yJkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“We never thought we’d return to Apidya after all these years,” said Peter Thierolf, original creator of the game. “but with new technology, the right team, and the passion of the community, we can finally deliver the version we always dreamed about.”</p>
<p>While remaining true to the original game there some new features that have been added, check them out:</p>

<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentic Remake</strong>&nbsp;– Completely rebuilt from scratch; no emulation.</li>
<li><strong>Two Visual Modes</strong>&nbsp;– Seamlessly switch between HD widescreen or original Amiga 4:3 presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusive Chris Hülsbeck OST</strong>&nbsp;– Newly arranged soundtrack alongside remixed and classic tracks.</li>
<li><strong>Retro Visual Effects</strong>&nbsp;– Optional CRT shaders, bloom, and authentic scanline simulation.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Worlds</strong>&nbsp;– 5 diverse themed worlds (Meadow, Pond, Sewers, Cyber, Lair), up to 5 levels each, 20 unique bosses, and hidden special stages.</li>
<li><strong>Fresh Surprises</strong>&nbsp;– Randomized in-game events like “Night Mode” with new enemy sprites.</li>
<li><strong>Co-op Mode</strong>&nbsp;– Second player controls one of the helper drones.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility Options</strong>&nbsp;– Modernized difficulty settings to make the game enjoyable for all generations (including the original devs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apidya Special will launch next year on PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Can someone please remake SWIV now? Pretty please?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-rod-fergusson</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioshock-infinite-producer-rod-fergusson-returns-as-bioshock-franchise-head.1273944/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary producer Rod Fergusson has been appointed as the new franchise head for the&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>series, following the fourth game's well-documented production struggles.</p>

<p>Fergusson announced his new position <a href="https://x.com/rodfergusson/status/1957824815018213692" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on social media</a> earlier today, declaring that he'll be heading up&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>developer Cloud Chamber and "overseeing development of the next&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>game, along with franchise extensions like the in-development Netflix movie".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that while he's excited to start his new role, he understands that "the studio restructuring is a difficult time for the team", and that he's "deeply grateful" for the work completed on&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>by Cloud Chamber thus far (although we still don't know exactly how much work that is).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bioshock-infinite-rod-fergusson.jpg?itok=8bkzByqD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bioshock-infinite-rod-fergusson.jpg?itok=-RZ1k_Yj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rod Fergusson oversaw the final stretch of development on&nbsp;<em>BioShock Infinite</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering to what Fergusson is referring, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-remake-canceled-bioshock-4-story-report" rel="nofollow">reported recently</a> that a remake of the first&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>game was canceled internally at publisher 2K, and that development on the still-unannounced&nbsp;fourth major&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>game is in a rough patch.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, 2K execs are unhappy with the way&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4</em>'s story was progressing, leading to the ousting of Cloud Chamber head Kelley Gilmore and a change in creative director Hogarth de la Plante's role to a more "publishing"-focused position.</p>

<p>The internal review that led to these decisions also apparently resulted in layoffs at Cloud Chamber, which is likely what Fergusson is referring to when he talks about "studio restructuring". It's another corporate term for staff cuts.</p>

<p>Rod Fergusson has something of a reputation as a "closer", a producer who's brought in to bring struggling projects over the finish line. It's a trick he performed before with 2013's&nbsp;<em>BioShock Infinite</em>, which is probably why 2K execs feel like they're in safe hands with him now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bioshock-2-remastered-rod-fergusson.jpg?itok=BfcvPzC0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bioshock-2-remastered-rod-fergusson.jpg?itok=aUwQ-XMu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fergusson will be overseeing the whole&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>franchise at 2K.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that amid all of this upheaval,&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>hasn't actually been officially announced yet, so we don't even know what direction the game will take.</p>

<p>Still, with Fergusson at the helm, perhaps the huge, lumbering Big Daddy that is the franchise at this point can start juddering into motion again. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

              <p>With a reputation for being a closer, Rod Fergusson helped get the last troubled BioShock game out the door. Can he do it again? The outgoing head of the <em>Diablo</em> franchise at Blizzard revealed on Tuesday that he’s joined <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680">2K Games’ struggling Cloud Chamber studio,</a> as <em>BioShock 4</em> development stalls and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr7jxitg22z">layoffs</a>&nbsp;hit the Montreal-based team.</p> <p>In an memo to staff shared with<em> Kotaku</em>, 2K Games president David Ismailer confirmed that Fergusson would be head of the BioShock franchise, including helping to oversea its movie spin-off that’s currently in production at Netflix. But he also said the team at Cloud Chamber would be downsized as <em>BioShock 4</em> is reworked.&nbsp;“While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a <em>BioShock</em> game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” he wrote.</p> <p>Fergusson announced earlier this month he was <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680">leaving Blizzard after five years</a>, having joined just prior to the launch of <em>Diablo 4</em> and before Microsoft, his old employer, purchased Activision Blizzard. He was similarly brought in to help ship <em>BioShock Infinite,</em> which suffered multiple delays under a chaotic development process led by series creator Ken Levine at Irrational Games over a decade ago.&nbsp;“I’m returning to 2K as Head of the BioShock Franchise, leading Cloud Chamber!” Fergusson wrote on Bluesky. “I’m deeply grateful for the work the studio has done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love.”</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:7stk6kdxhyemi6fdsk23q3ta/app.bsky.feed.post/3lwr7mrw2gc2e" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiae25sd7bmtqrb6sjljl5iqrc6oobscldxw6nr6af2hcjlcqmsi6m"> <p lang="en">Would you kindly allow me to share some news?</p> <p>I’m returning to 2K as Head of the BioShock Franchise, leading Cloud Chamber!</p> <p>I’m deeply grateful for the work the studio has done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7stk6kdxhyemi6fdsk23q3ta?ref_src=embed">Rod Fergusson (@rodfergusson.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7stk6kdxhyemi6fdsk23q3ta/post/3lwr7mrw2gc2e?ref_src=embed">2025-08-19T15:20:29.637Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Not long after it launched, Levine left Irrational, and parent publisher 2K Games announced it was shutting the entire studio down. Years later, it was revealed that a new studio in Canada called Cloud Chamber would be making <em>BioShock 4</em> while Levine worked on Judas, a very BioShock-looking sci-fi immersive sim, at his Ghost Story Games startup. Despite both being revealed a while ago, each project is still MIA.</p>

 <p><em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-cloud-chamber-2k-take-two-remake-2000614413">reported earlier</a> this month that <em>BioShock 4</em> had suffered a setback and leadership change after a recent negative internal review. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-not-canceled-movie-judas-ken-levine-2000616424">claims the game won’t be canceled, however</a>. “It’s going to come out,” he said in a recent interview. “That I can say hand on heart, without question.”</p> <p>Fergusson, a long-time producer, is a known hater of the phrase “it’s ready when it’s ready.” “It takes the agency away from the team,” he <a href="https://www.polygon.com/diablo/492060/diablo-4-rod-fergusson-ready-when-its-ready/">told <em>Polygon</em></a> last year. “Saying ‘it’s ready when it’s ready’ means the team doesn’t have control over what they’re building. Mind, I’m giving you one person’s philosophy. But you control the scope. You control the schedule. You control a bunch of things. The idea that the game has to reveal itself somehow, with some unknown amount of content…I just find ‘it’s ready when it’s ready’ to be so passive.”</p> <p>Here’s the full email Ismailer sent staff today about the changes:</p> <blockquote> <p>BioShock is woven deeply into the fabric of 2K. It’s one of our most beloved franchises and respecting its legacy and meeting our fans’ expectations is critical to its future success.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p> <p>Work on the next BioShock game has been underway for several years. While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p> <p>I know this is tough news for everyone. If your role is being affected, you’ll hear from your manager or studio leadership today with details on severance, career services and support resources.&nbsp; There is no easy way to do this, but we hope to do whatever we can to support you through this.&nbsp; I want to thank each of you for your dedication and hard work.<u></u><u></u></p> <p>I also want to share an important studio leadership update. After an extensive search, I’m excited to announce Rod Fergusson will be leading Cloud Chamber as the new Head of the BioShock Franchise. Rod is an industry veteran with a proven history of critical and commercial success, including BioShock Infinite, Gears of War, and Diablo.&nbsp; Rod rejoins us from Blizzard, where he was GM of the Diablo franchise and launched Diablo IV – Blizzard’s fastest-selling game ever.<u></u><u></u></p> <p>As Head of the BioShock Franchise, Rod will lead Cloud Chamber and oversee the development of the next BioShock game, as well as franchise extensions including our film partnership with Netflix. We will share more about Rod’s onboarding and how these changes will take shape in the coming days and weeks.&nbsp; Rod and I worked together 10+ years ago and I am grateful he has chosen to return to lead our BioShock efforts.<u></u><u></u></p> <p>I recognize that today is a day of mixed emotions. We’re excited to have Rod joining us, and are equally grateful to everyone at Cloud Chamber who has helped us get this far. These changes are rooted in 2K’s firm confidence in BioShock as one of the most beloved franchises, and our commitment to deliver the best game in franchise history.</p> </blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony has announced its brand new Inzone lineup of gaming products. Joining the new product lineup are Inzone H9 II headset, the E9 in-ear headphones, KBD-H75 keyboard, a gaming mouse, and two new mouse pads.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-wide-range-of-peripherals">A Wide Range Of Peripherals</h2>



<p>Starting with the headset, the <strong>H9 II</strong> is the follow up to the original H9. <strong>Retailing for $349.99</strong>, the new headset features up to 30 hours of battery life with quick charging that gives you up to three hours of use on a five minute charge. Other features include a detachable unidirectional 14000kHz super wide band microphone, Bluetooth connectivity, active noise cancelling, and 360 spatial sound.</p>



<p>Moving on to the<strong> $149.99 E9 in-hear headphones</strong>, there are a pair of wired earbuds that also come with a 3.5MM to USB adapter for more adaptability. Like the H9 II, the E9 also features 360 spatial sound while allowing audio setting customization through Sony’s proprietary <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/software/00279252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inzone Hub app</a>. The E9 has a pressure-free and ear hanger design that allows for more comfortable wear during long sessions.</p>



<p>On the keyboard front, <strong>the KBD-H75</strong> is a 75% form factor board that retails for <strong>$299.99.</strong> The KDB-H75 features magnetic hall effect switches that allow for customization of its actuation points ranging from 0.1-3.4mm. The gasket-mounted keys absorb the impact on press, making them feel quicker and smoother, and it features an 8000Hz polling rate.</p>



<p>The <strong>$149.99 Inzone Mouse-A</strong> gaming mouse can be both wired or wireless, depending on your preference. At 48 grams, it comes in as a lightweight option for those who like the control. Features of the Mouse-A include a 90-hour battery life, 8000Hz polling rate, 30,000 DPI, and the same quick charge feature as the headset. For the mouse, however, the quick charge is 10 hours of use after a five minute charge and only 1.5 hours for a full charge. </p>



<p>Lastly, there are two new mouse pads—Mat D and Mat F—each designed for different types of players. <strong>The $34.99 Mat D</strong> features a 4mm high-density rubber cushion that Sony says is geared more for battle royale and first-person shooters. <strong>The $59.99 Mat F</strong> is more geared for tactical control with 6mm cushion. Both have a cloth surface.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have full impressions of the newest lineup of Sony Inzone products in the coming days, letting you know if they’re worth the investment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rod Fergusson, who recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-gm-rod-fergusson-leaves-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced his departure</a> from Blizzard after five years, has revealed that he is heading to 2K to become the new head of the BioShock franchise.</p>



<p>In his post on <a href="https://x.com/RodFergusson/status/1957824815018213692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Fergusson said that he’ll be <strong>“heading up Cloud Chamber and overseeing development of the next BioShock game, along with franchise extensions like the in-development Netflix movie.”</strong></p>



<p>With Fergusson taking over, it was also revealed that the studio will be letting go an unknown number of employees as part of the changes.</p>



<p><strong>“While I’m excited to get started in the coming weeks, I recognize the studio restructuring is a difficult time for the team,”</strong> he said. <strong>“I’m deeply grateful for the work done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“For now, the firehose of onboarding awaits, and I look forward to sharing more when I can.”</strong></p>



<p>Fergusson joins 2K and BioShock after if it was recently reported that the next BioShock game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-bioshock-game-suffers-development-hell-failing-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in development hell</a> after failing an executive review. The original report said that 2K was “overhauling parts of the next&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>&nbsp;game and shaking up management after senior executives expressed they were unhappy with its development.” </p>



<p>That shake up now includes Fergusson as the head of the studio. </p>



<p>At the time of the news, a 2K Spokesperson told Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier that they were <strong>“working hard to set&nbsp;BioShock&nbsp;up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the new BioShock entry, it was also reported that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioshock-remake-shelved-this-year-claimed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake of the original game</a> was recently shelved as part of the changes happening within the company.</p>



<p>What do you think of Fergusson, who most recently was the general manager on Diablo 4, taking over as head of BioShock? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

        <p>Fergusson’s return to <em>BioShock</em> is notable, as Fergusson was hired by 2K in August 2012 to salvage the then-troubled <em>BioShock Infinite</em>‘s production.

                <p>Sony's Inzone PC gaming collection is branching beyond headsets and monitors with its next batch of releases. Most notably, Sony is entering the gaming keyboard and mouse scene with competitive-focused options made in collaboration with esports team Fnatic. Like all products in the series so far, the Inzone KBD-H75 Wired Gaming Keyboard ($300) and the wireless Inzone Mouse-A ($150) are built with high-end components and carry premium prices.</p><p>Sony is also releasing a new flagship Inzone H9 II wireless gaming headset with ANC and audio drivers based on its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new WH-1000XM6 headphones</a>.

The custom sensor is complemented by a wireless signal with a polling rate of up to 8,000Hz, the same as the KBD-H75.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+H9+II&amp;crid=3OIEHGVW2A3XO&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+h9+ii%2Caps%2C134&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?k=Sony+Inzone+H9+II&amp;crid=3OIEHGVW2A3XO&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+h9+ii%2Caps%2C134&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+H9+II&amp;crid=3OIEHGVW2A3XO&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+h9+ii%2Caps%2C134&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">Sony Inzone H9 II Wireless Noise-Canceling Gaming Headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+H9+II&amp;crid=3OIEHGVW2A3XO&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+h9+ii%2Caps%2C134&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?k=Sony+Inzone+H9+II&amp;crid=3OIEHGVW2A3XO&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+h9+ii%2Caps%2C134&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+H9+II&amp;crid=3OIEHGVW2A3XO&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+h9+ii%2Caps%2C134&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">$350</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Wireless-Canceling-Over-ear-Headphones/dp/B0B1TDHLPT?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original H9 Wireless Gaming Headset</a>--which is excellent--the H9 II utilizes the audio driver from Sony's flagship WH-1000XM headphone series.

Sony's Inzone H9 and the Inzone Buds have the best noise-canceling features we've tried in gaming-focused audio gear, and the H9 II should be even better with ANC while also offering improved positional audio. The leatherette ear cushions should also be similar to the XM6, just with a fuller form factor.</p><p>The H9 II has a detachable cardioid boom mic with ambient noise-filtering tech and a Super Wide Band mic.

The E9 comes with two different styles of eartips and multiple sizes for each. The foam eartips are designed to isolate noise, and then there are also more traditional silicone eartips.</p><p>Sony says the E9 earbuds are its first "fully enclosed structure," which is intended to help with isolating specific sounds. The earbuds support virtual 7.1 surround sound and Sony's 360 spatial sound. Each pair of E9 gaming earbuds comes with the carrying case shown above.</p><p>Since the E9 earbuds connect via 3.5mm audio, you could use them on basically all of your gaming platforms and devices, but the Inzone Hub customization suite only works on PC, as does some of Sony's audio features.</p><p>This isn't Sony's first pair of gaming earbuds. Sony previously released a pair of noise-canceling wireless earbuds for PC and PlayStation consoles called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone Buds</a>. We'd highly recommend the Inzone Buds for PC and PlayStation as well as mobile devices with USB-C--the Inzone Buds are limited to Bluetooth LE, so you need to use the dongle for most mobile devices. Sony raised the price of the Inzone Buds from $200 to $230 earlier this year, but you can grab a pair for $198 at Amazon. The Inzone Buds have ANC, whereas the E9 earbuds have noise isolation features.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+Desk+Mat&amp;crid=5M4LT083CEHY&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+desk+mat%2Caps%2C99&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?k=Sony+Inzone+Desk+Mat&amp;crid=5M4LT083CEHY&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+desk+mat%2Caps%2C99&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+Desk+Mat&amp;crid=5M4LT083CEHY&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+desk+mat%2Caps%2C99&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">Sony Inzone Gaming Desk Mats</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+Desk+Mat&amp;crid=5M4LT083CEHY&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+desk+mat%2Caps%2C99&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?k=Sony+Inzone+Desk+Mat&amp;crid=5M4LT083CEHY&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+desk+mat%2Caps%2C99&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+Desk+Mat&amp;crid=5M4LT083CEHY&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+desk+mat%2Caps%2C99&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">Mat-F: $60 | Mat-D: $35</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>To go along with its new keyboard and mouse, Sony is adding a pair of mouse pads to its Inzone lineup.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> PC players are finally set to receive proper optimisation for the game's performance issues, but Capcom has stated it won't arrive until this winter. That's almost a year after the game was released.</p>
<p>"To our hunters playing #MHWilds on PC, we're committed to listening to your feedback and improving both performance and stability of the game," said Capcom in a post on social media. "Although we will continue to implement gradual improvements in the weeks ahead, we are targeting Free Title Update 4 this winter to implement a multifaceted plan, including CPU and GPU related optimisations, followed by a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards."</p>
<p>The PC version of the game has been heavily criticised since the game's release for its poor performance, but waiting so long for improvements is ironic when the game has sold incredibly well and Capcom itself has noted how important the PC platform is. Will the improvements coming in winter be too little too late?</p>

<p>"Yeah, there are more players than ever playing on PC, including in Japan," said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-producer-acknowledges-importance-of-pc-platform-and-crossplay">producer Ryozo Tsujimoto back in February</a> ahead of the game's release, "so we definitely see room for the series to capture new players who haven't tried it before if that's their chosen platform." That's partly why Capcom released a PC benchmark tool too, to help satisfy PC players.</p><p>It's a sentiment mirrored across the industry. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has noted the importance of the PC platform</a>, teasing a release for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sees-game-sales-drop-but-multiplatform-strategy-continues-in-earnest">Square Enix is pursuing a multiplatform strategy</a> that's seen sales of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> games and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> boosted. And just look at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-runaway-success-on-pc-proves-south-korea-is-positioning-itself-to-become-a-major-force-in-global-gaming-and-experts-agree">PC success for Shift Up's Stellar Blade</a>, which sold a million copies on Steam in just three days.</p> <div>

<p>So when Capcom released Monster Hunter Wilds across PC and console in February, it's no wonder sales skyrocketed after the success of both World and Rise. It became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">company's fastest-selling game</a>, with over 8m units sold in just three days. It even helped propel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-series-helps-capcom-achieve-12th-consecutive-year-of-increased-profit">Capcom to its 12th consecutive year of increased profit</a>. According to Capcom's recently updated <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html">Platinum Titles list</a>, Monster Hunter Wilds has sold 10.5m copies across all platforms and is the eighth best-selling Capcom game of all time.</p>
<p>And on PC the game got off to a spectacular start. On Steam, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">quickly surpassed Monster Hunter World's all-time player peak</a> before hitting over a million concurrent players. Shortly afterwards, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-propels-steam-to-highest-ever-player-count">Steam hit a new player peak across the platform</a>. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai5telk2p">Analyst Mat Piscatella</a> stated in March Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of February, with Steam accounting for over half the game's sales.</p>
<p>Yet quickly that success was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-responds-after-monster-hunter-wilds-steam-success-is-marred-by-performance-complaints">marred by performance complaints</a>, specifically on PC. Capcom acknowledged these issues, but has failed so far to fully rectify them. Even now, the game sits with a mostly negative rating on Steam.</p>
<p>Sales and player counts have tumbled as a result. Last quarter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter">Monster Hunter Wilds was outsold by Devil May Cry 5</a>, albeit through sales and its new anime series raising interest levels. Monster Hunter Wilds sold 477k copies, which was only just higher than the four-year-old <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. At the time of writing, the game has a Steam 24-hour peak of just under 46k - that's a 97 percent drop from its all-time peak of 1.38 million players. Concurrent players don't tell the whole picture of a game's success, but the drop here is monumental however you look at it.</p><p>Capcom has released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-finally-fixes-the-games-inexcusable-performance-woes-on-pc">multiple patches to address performance issues on PC</a>, but problems remain. What's more, the forthcoming patch doesn't appear to be all-encompassing as a "second stage of mitigation measures" will follow, suggesting this will be a major overhaul as issues run deep. If that's required to fix problems, it'll be worth the wait to get the game back on track.</p>
<p>But that long wait is a huge disappointment for players, with responses on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1mtq9f2/capcom_is_working_on_mh_wilds_pc_optimization/">reddit</a> ranging from apathy to frustration at how long it's taking.  As <a href="https://x.com/W33ab00Jones/status/1957534736441561510">one response</a> on social media reads: "You guys waited too long and lost me. Sorry, not sorry."</p>
<p>While the initial sales of Monster Hunter Wilds has proven the success of the series, its massive drop-off ever since just shows how quickly the audience has moved on. The lack of a comprehensive fix on PC is a core reason for this, but so is the endgame.</p>
<p>Capcom has today released a statement acknowledging the demand for increased replayability of endgame content. As such, Appraise Talismans will now be available in top level quests, allowing for deeper customisation. A new Melding Pot feature will also allow for unwanted Appraised Talismans to be used to create new items.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>🛡 Guild Report 23 🛡</p><p>The team has heard the requests regarding end-game content, and implemented improvements in Ver 1.021, released on August 13.</p><p>Request:<br>Increase replayability in endgame content.</p><p>Improvement:<br>You will now be able to obtain Appraised Talismans in 9★ quests… <a href="https://t.co/Krjt46PmsI">pic.twitter.com/Krjt46PmsI</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1957719118154477785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Still, the additional monsters and challenging hunts <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/letter-2508/">coming later this year</a> feel like minimal extras. Presumably, Monster Hunter Wilds will receive a major expansion just like Iceborne for World and Sunbreak for Rise. Typically these extend the lifespan of Monster Hunter games considerably, with extra story and more monsters to hunt. Until then, it's frustrating to see Capcom continue to stumble on a fundamental level.</p>

		<p>If you’re not up to speed on Hollow Knight: Silksong, here’s the short version. It was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-silksong-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch/">announced in February 2019</a>, but then updates were few and far between until a new trailer was revealed at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase in June 2022. The game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/10/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed/">officially delayed in May 2023</a>, and then in April 2025 it appeared in a sizzle reel for Nintendo with a 2025 release date.</p>
<p>However, the lack of communication and six-year (and counting) development time has led fans to joke that the game will never come out.&nbsp; A playable demo <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/29/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-at-the-xbox-gamescom-booth-this-year/">should be on the floor</a> at Gamescom 2025 starting tomorrow, but as there was a playable demo in 2019 that doesn’t mean much to the fans.</p>


<p>In a massive tease, Team Cherry have now posted a video that will launch a “Special Announcement” for the game at 3.30pm on 21st August.&nbsp; The internet has responded in the only way possible by suggesting that the big announcement is that the game is cancelled.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong was scheduled to come to PlayStation, Nintendo, PC, and Xbox, and was also meant to be a Day One launch on Game Pass. However, some of those details are now years old so things may have changed since then.</p>

<p>Here’s a little more about the game, but again, this is from previous announcements so may not be accurate.</p>
<p><em>Hornet, princess-protector of Hallownest, finds herself alone in a vast, unfamiliar world. She must battle foes, seek out allies, and solve mysteries as she ascends on a deadly pilgrimage to the kingdom’s peak. Bound by her lineage and guided by echoes of her past, Hornet will adventure through mossy grottos, coral forests and shining citadels to unravel a deadly thread that threatens this strange new land.</em></p>
<p><em>Hornet must master a whole new suite of powerful moves to survive. She’ll unleash devastating attacks, learn incredible silken abilities, and craft deadly tools in order to overcome the kingdom’s challenges. Over 150 all-new foes stand between Hornet and the shining citadel crowning the kingdom. Beasts and hunters, assassins and kings, monsters and knights – Hornet must face them all with bravery and skill!</em></p>
<p><em>The vast inter-connected world of Hollow Knight: Silksong is brought vividly to life in a traditional, hand-crafted, 2D style. Gilded cities, Lakes of fire, and misted moors are illustrated in exquisite detail and accompanied by a vibrant orchestral score. In her search for the truth behind her capture, Hornet will befriend surprising strangers, discover shocking secrets and solve ancient mysteries in a kingdom full of wonders.</em></p>

			<p>Developer Team Cherry has announced that it will host a "<em>Special Announcement</em>" for Hollow Knight Silksong this coming Thursday, August 21, 2025, at 7:30am PT / 10:30am ET / 3:30pm BST. It's the first official word from Team Cherry on its highly anticipated title in what feels like forever, and it is likely when we'll learn about the game's release date, if we don't hear about it today during Gamescom ONL 2025, that is.</p>



<p>"<em>The countdown is on! Join us in 48 hours for a special announcement about Hollow Knight: Silksong!," </em>the description of the video, which is set to premiere on YouTube, reads. The studio shared the same message on <a href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1957812884773433667">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, so for now it seems like that's all we'll get from them until Thursday.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We've known that Silksong would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-gamescom-2025/">playable at Gamescom 2025</a> for a while now, and with its marketing ties to Xbox and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, there's been a lot of speculation that when we <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">officially learn the release date</a> for the new Xbox handheld, we'll also learn the release date for Silksong.</p>



<p>That could still be true, and with the ROG Xbox Ally release date likely going live during Gamescom ONL 2025, Silksong's release date could be part of the ONL news cycle, with this presentation later in the week being a deep-dive into gameplay. At least, that would be the case, if not for Bloomberg's Jason Schreier claiming that the release date is being saved for the Thursday presentation.</p>







<p>We'll see how it all shakes out by the end of today, and if Silksong makes an appearance during the ONL presentation. What's certain, is that we are in the final stretch for Silksong. The wait is almost over, and we'll soon have a lot more official news on the title than we've had in the years since it was first announced. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed that the next&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game to be getting the remaster treatment is none other than&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia</em>, and the remaster is due to land later this year.</p>

<p>Last week, the studio accidentally confirmed the existence of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-xillia-remaster-rumor" rel="nofollow">via an unfortunate YouTube thumbnail</a>, but earlier today, the remaster was officially revealed. It's landing on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch (but not Switch 2, strangely) on October 31st.</p>

<p>The project is part of Bandai Namco's promise to release remastered versions of games in the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-series-remasters-regular" rel="nofollow">"fairly consistently"</a>, with the first entry in the so-called Remaster Project, namely&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review-spirited-journey" rel="nofollow">launching earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>Big changes include new "vivid and beautiful graphics", as well as the inclusion of over 40 DLC packs released for the original game, although certain licensed content (probably referring to the outfits themed around Japanese anime&nbsp;<em>Star Driver</em>) aren't included.</p>

<p>You'll also find a new autosave function that will save your game after events or "moving around the map", as well as the chance to toggle random enemy encounters, a new Retry feature if you die in battle, and much more.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em>, which shows the work the team has done in order to update the original for modern systems, right here.</p>




<p>When the first <i>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</i>leak happened, some suggested that the direct sequel&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia 2&nbsp;</em>may also be included as part of a package, but that's not the case. I'd imagine, though, that&nbsp;<em>Xillia 2&nbsp;</em>is on the cards if this remaster does well.</p>

<p><em>Tales of Xillia Remastered&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on October 31st. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p>Xbox has just announced the new games arriving on Game Pass in the second half of August, and it contains a couple of enormous names. We already knew that&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> was going to be a day-one release on Microsoft’s subscription service, but we’ve now learned that <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> will be joining it two days later. Along with a bunch of others.</p> <p>Added today for PC is <em>Balatro</em> publisher Playstack’s <em>Void/Breaker</em>, developed by Stubby Games. Another game launching directly onto Game Pass, this is from the same team that created 2022’s extremely good FPS puzzler <em>The Entropy Center</em>.&nbsp;<em>Void/Breaker</em> is a roguelite FPS in which you’re trapped in endless loops by an evil AI, and is all about lightning-fast action.</p> <p>Also arriving on PC is an early access build of <em>Blacksmith Master</em>, a game that’s proven to be well-liked on Steam in which you…well, you already guessed from the title. It’s a blacksmith management sim.</p>

 <p>Arriving tomorrow, August 20, on consoles and PC is <em>Goat Simulator Remastered</em>, the recent remake of the original&nbsp;<em>GTA</em>-like spoof, and <em>Persona 4 Golden</em>, the 2012 update to one of the most beloved entries in the murderous coming-of-age series. Then on August 21 there’s <em>Herdling</em>, the big-beast herding adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-trailers-announcements-1851627031/36#content">first announced at Gamescom last year</a>.</p> <p>Come August 26, the big hitter arrives. Stretch your crouching muscles because it’s <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>, the anticipated remastering of the original <em>Gears of War</em> from 2006. Being published by Xbox Games Studios, it’s coming straight to Game Pass Ultimate, but in our new, strange future, it’s also being released for sale on PlayStation as well.</p> <p>Then there’s the big surprise for this month, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. While the game has developed some manner of infamy for allegedly being poorly treated by both <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569">BioWare</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-live-service-1851756169">EA</a>, and was then caught in the tiresome culture wars, it remains a solid RPG and a great piece of storytelling in a well-loved universe. It already faced the ignominy of being <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-playstation-plus-march-sonic-tmnt-1851766608">free on PS Plus just a month after it was released</a>, but perhaps makes more sense to arrive on Game Pass now that it’s six months old.</p>

 <p>Here’s the full list of releases for August, and the various tiers of Game Pass on which they appear:</p> <p>Aug 19: <em><strong>Blacksmith Master </strong></em>– PC (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 19: <em><strong>Void/Breaker</strong></em><em> –&nbsp;</em>PC&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 20:&nbsp;<em><strong>Goat Simulator Remastered</strong>&nbsp;</em>– Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Standard)</p>

 <p>Aug 20:&nbsp;<strong><em>Persona 4 Golden</em></strong> – Cloud, Console, PC (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard)</p> <p>Aug 21:&nbsp;<strong><em>Herdling</em></strong> – Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 26:&nbsp;<strong><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></strong> – Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p> <p>Aug 28:&nbsp;<strong><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>– Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass)</p>

 <p>Then, because the universe must be balanced, a bunch of games are leaving. On August 31 you’ll no longer have:</p> <ul> <li><em>Ben 10 Power Trip&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Borderlands 3&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Paw Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>Sea of Stars&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> <li><em>This War of Mine: Final Cut&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li> </ul> <p>Presumably&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em> is being removed to entice you to pay for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em> when it comes out in September.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-be-a-pro-features-announced/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nhl-26-be-a-pro-features-announced.1273875/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the first time in six years, the Be A Pro mode in the EA Sports NHL series is getting a facelift with NHL 26. On Tuesday morning, EA Sports held a deep dive giving a look at all of the new features coming to the popular single player mode.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NHL 26 – Be A Pro Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YXarJ9r31Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-no-more-pond-hockey">No More Pond Hockey</h2>



<p>For years, EA Sports NHL’s Be A Pro started out with an interview about your player playing pond hockey ahead of the NHL draft. Well, you can say goodbye to that repetitive cutscene. Now, you’re players will start out in the World Juniors where not only are you trying to win gold for your country, but you’re also trying to improve your draft stock.</p>



<p>Aside from the starting point, Be A Pro in NHL 26 <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/nhl/nhl-26/news/nhl-26-be-a-pro-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has been completely rebuilt</a>, delivering a new immersive and dynamic version of the mode. At its core, NHL 26 introduces a chapter-based career structure that mirrors the real ups and downs of professional hockey. </p>



<p>After the aforementioned play in the World Juniors, every stage of your career unfolds in its own chapter with tailored challenges and branching outcomes. Unlike past years, your path to stardom is no longer guaranteed. Poor performance can see you demoted to the AHL, while standout play can have you playing top-line minutes.</p>



<p>Presentation has also received a complete overhaul, making career milestones feel more like true events. New cutscenes and cinematic sequences highlight key moments such as walking into your first NHL locker room, tunnel walkouts before big games, World Juniors and AHL trophy celebrations, hoisting the Stanley Cup, and even a retirement ceremony that gives your final game proper weight. A new media scrum system brings added authenticity, putting you in front of reporters where your answers impact reputation, relationships, and career trajectory. These moments help ground the grind of the season with emotional payoffs that feel earned.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Off the ice, NHL 26 introduces a redesigned hub that keeps your career connected to the bigger picture. The hub tracks your active challenges, surfaces league headlines, and displays a new “form score” that reflects recent performance. This score directly affects ice time, trust from coaches, and your opportunities within the organization, creating constant accountability for how you play.</p>



<p>A major addition this year is the energy and development system, which ties performance, training, recovery, and playing style to long-term growth. Managing your energy is key to unlocking and upgrading X-Factors, rewarding players who balance intensity on the ice with smart choices off it. Your personality also develops along one of two paths, confident or influential, and are based on how you interact with teammates, media, and coaches. Salary perks, endorsements, and lifestyle upgrades further expand the role-playing aspect, giving you more control over your legacy and how you are remembered when your career comes to a close.</p>



<p>Put together, these changes look to make Be A Pro in NHL 26 the deepest and most dynamic version of the mode to date. That said, players will have to wait to see how it all comes together when the game releases for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>NHL 26 releases on September 5 for those who purchase the Deluxe Edition of the game. Those who buy the Standard Edition will get the game on September 12.</p>

No idea. But this teaser comes just hours before Gamescom Opening Night Live, a show for which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oh-boy-geoff-keighley-is-teasing-hollow-knight-silksong-for-gamescom-opening-night-live">host Geoff Keighley seemed to be teasing Silksong for just yesterday</a>. When we wrote that story up yesterday, it seemed likely we were finally getting a Silksong release date at ONL. The signs are all there. It's been confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-makes-brief-appearance-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct-to-secure-2025-release-window">Silksong is coming out in 2025</a>, and it's even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-a-new-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-playable-at-gamescom">playable on the show floor</a> of Gamescom this week. It's also been leaked that the ROG Xbox Ally is launching October 16, and confirmed that Silksong <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/retail-leak-reveals-rog-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date">would be on the system whenever it does launch</a>. All that put together makes it pretty likely that <em>one</em> of these presentations is going to have an actual release date in it somewhere, and that release date is likely very, very soon.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957813072514408802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, my Geo is bet on a teaser of Silksong at Opening Night Live, followed by a full and more lengthy reveal on the 21st, with a release date (or even, dare I hope, a shadow drop?) at one of the two presentations. Whatever the case, it seems clear that there's no clown makeup to be had this time around: Silksong is really about to emerge from its cocoon after all these long years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-sequel-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch">first revealed six years ago,</a> in 2019, after previously being teased as just a DLC for Hollow Knight.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">He doesn't seem too bothered.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Masahiro Sakurai hosted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtkHiB7WKf4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">45-minute Nintendo Direct</a> solely dedicated to his latest project, Kirby Air Riders. And it was a somewhat unusual Direct! Delivered in Sakurai's iconic style that he's developed from giving Super Smash Bros. presentations over the years, the whole thing felt very Smash Bros. in general. But Sakurai also opened the presentation by invoking another game, admitting that Kirby Air Riders is "basically Mario Kart".</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He said this to get ahead of criticisms or comments from the audience that it is, admittedly, a bit odd for Nintendo to have asked him to make a new Kirby Air Ride game coming out right on the heels of Mario Kart World. Both are racing games that feature a diverse roster of racers with different abilities, unique karts and courses, and similar functions such as boosting, drifting, and drafting. Sakurai says he was asked by Shinya Takahashi and Satoshi Mitsuhara to make Kirby Air Riders while he was working on DLC for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You might be asking yourself if it's basically Mario Kart," Sakurai said. "You race and battle with familiar characters around courses with different features, or so they say. Ok, so it basically is like Mario Kart. I even mentioned this when I received the request ot make the game. I asked them if they still wanted to do it. But as fans of the original know...The appeal of the game is not actually the races!"</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/kirby-air-riders-direct-8-19-2025-29-49-screenshot-1755612633905.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/kirby-air-riders-direct-8-19-2025-29-59-screenshot-1755612630057.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And yes, as the presentation went on, it became clear that Kirby Air Riders is filling a very different niche to Mario Kart. For one, Mario Kart World made a big show of expanding its races to 24 racers at a time. But Sakurai pointedly limited Kirby Air Riders races to six, saying that "too many participants in this game can make it messy" in a seemingly lighthearted jab at Kart. In another major difference, while Kirby does have its City Trial mode as a more open zone free-for-all, its primary races are lap races, while Mario Kart World emphasizes driving from track to track across an open world. This is something that Kart fans have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-upset-over-mario-kart-world-patch-that-makes-a-big-change-to-online-play-thanks-i-hate-it">actually criticized since the game came out</a>, as Nintendo made efforts to push the long-distance races over circling a track three times (and then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-u-turns-on-mario-kart-world-change-that-forced-more-open-world-driving-as-it-increases-chance-of-lap-type-races">U-turned on this choice later</a>).</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/kirby-air-riders-direct-8-19-2025-28-7-screenshot-1755612570092.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from the Mario Kart comparisons though, the whole Direct just felt like a Smash Bros. presentation. Much of that is likely chalked up to it just being Sakurai's presentation style, which we've mostly seen for Smash Bros. in the past. But the dramatic way in which he revealed new characters on the roster, the visual style of the title cards and interstitials, the music and sound, and a lot of other elements lent a very Smashy feel to the whole thing. The original Kirby Air Ride took a lot of UI, sound, and style elements from Super Smash Bros. Melee, so it only makes sense to see that happen here too. It's like Mario Kart meets Super Smash Bros, almost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby Air Riders is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-kirby-air-riders-release-date">out on November 20, 2025</a>, for the Nintendo Switch 2 and will feature a wide roster of Kirby characters including Waddle Dee, King Dedede, Gooey, Chef Kawasaki, Metaknight, and more.

                <p>This year, games that were previously Xbox-exclusive properties have been migrating to PS5, including the upcoming Gears of War remaster, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/" data-ref-id="1100-6531314">Gears of War Reloaded</a>. Just under two decades ago, the original Gears of War was one of Xbox's signature titles. Now, the co-creator of the franchise, Cliff Bleszinski, has shared his thoughts about seeing Gears of War appear on a PlayStation console.</p><p>"It doesn't feel strange," said Bleszinski during an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-air-riders-grand-direct-unveiling-was-classic-sakurai-as-he-jokes-its-not-another-mario-kart-clone" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "I'm thrilled that more people are going to get to experience a big part of my legacy that I worked so hard on."</p><p>Bleszinski also noted that he's interested in returning to the series as a consultant, but "crickets" has been the response from the devs. Although Bleszinski left the Gears franchise years ago, he has shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-needs-a-god-of-war-like-reboot-creator-says/1100-6518779/" data-ref-id="1100-6518779">his belief that the franchise should be rebooted</a>. Bleszinski has also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-creator-discusses-his-alien-game-pitch-and-what-went-wrong/1100-6518780/" data-ref-id="1100-6518780">he pitched an Alien game</a> prior to Disney's purchase of Fox.</p><p>Gears of War Reloaded is the second remaster of the original game from 2006. All of the post-launch content from the game's first remaster, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, will be included. Microsoft has sent free upgrades for Reloaded to anyone who already has Gears of War: Ultimate Edition.</p><p>Microsoft will drop Gears of War Reloaded on August 28 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. Cross-platform play and cross-progression will be supported. It will be on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-august-include-gears-of-war-remaster-and-chaotic-goats/2900-6892/" data-ref-id="2900-6892">Game Pass</a> at launch. Microsoft has yet to confirm that the next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526145/" data-ref-id="1100-6526145">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, will be cross-platform when it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-teases-2026-plans-including-possible-halo-release/1100-6532264/" data-ref-id="1100-6532264">launches in 2026 as part of Xbox's 25th anniversary.</a></p>

                <p>DC games haven't had the best of times in recent years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/" data-ref-id="1100-6523301">marked by a string of missteps</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">canceled projects</a>. While titles like the Batman: Arkham series found success, much of the broader DC gaming output has lacked consistency. This is something James Gunn wants to remedy as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-studios-announces-10-new-movies-and-tv-shows-prepare-for-chapter-1-gods-monsters/1100-6511036/" data-ref-id="1100-6511036">10-year plan as co-head of DC Studios</a>.</p><p>When the rebooted DCU launched in 2023, Gunn emphasized cross-platform storytelling, noting that actors would portray their characters "across all forms of media--including video games." While there has been little public movement since then, Gunn recently confirmed that there is "slight movement on different things." That could mean we're headed toward a future where David Corenswet voices Superman in both film and other media, although Gunn didn't discuss specifics concerning Corenswet or anyone else.</p><p>“We have a couple of little DC games coming out. But we also have talked about--and in early stages of planning--some bigger things," Gunn told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/dc-tv-shows/after-years-of-silence-dc-boss-james-gunn-teases-dcus-gaming-plans-theres-one-thing-in-particular-im-excited-about-but-it-does-take-time/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>. "One thing in particular I'm excited about, but it does take time."</p><p>Both Gunn and Peter Safran are taking a proactive role in shaping DC's gaming future. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">Back in February</a>, Safran gave an outlook on how they're trying to course-correct the situation and give fans must-play games again.</p><p>"James and I sit with literally the guys that run the studios…whether it's NetherRealm or whether it's Rocksteady, sit with them and talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in," Safran shared.</p><p>Gunn also admitted then that any major release is "at least a couple of years" away, but in the meantime, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/">Rocksteady is said to be returning to its single-player Batman roots for its next project</a>, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-boss-says-it-has-the-best-cookies-talks-about-milking-them/1100-6526460/">WB Games is now focusing its efforts and resources on its biggest franchises</a>.</p>

It is unclear what exactly this announcement will involve, but fans are mostly just hoping for a release date.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Despite the general lack of information, Silksong is playable at this year's Gamescom,&nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/#:~:text=Play%20Hollow%20Knight%3A%20Silksong%20with%20a%20new%20demo%20%E2%80%93%20on%20PC%20or%20ROG%20Xbox%20Ally%20X">according to Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/microsoft-partners-with-asus-for-dedicated-handheld-xbox-device">it will be available on Microsoft's ROG ALLY device</a>, so we're expecting some kind of announcement during Opening Night Live in a few hours. Geoff Keighley seemed to support this by&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957492830374650018">posting a photo with a clown nose</a>, potentially referencing the meme of Hollow Knight's protagonist in clown attire that's posted whenever we don't get news about its sequel.&nbsp;</p><p>However, partnered with this announcement is a series of Bluesky posts from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, who is known for accurately digging up information from behind the scenes of the games industry. Not only does he claim to have "the story behind why Silksong took seven years to make," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr5gpfhkk2x">citing a video call he did with Team Cherry's founders earlier this month</a>, he also says, "<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr4xi2x5c2g">No, Silksong's release date will not be announced</a> today at Gamescom Opening Night Live, despite Geoff Keighley's teasing." Team Cherry's Thursday announcement will come after Opening Night Live, however, so there's a chance we might get a date then. While Schreier has a solid track record in this line of work, none of this is confirmed, so take it all with a grain of salt.</p><p>Regardless of when it drops or what this trailer will bring, people will be there to watch it. With 15,000 in the YouTube audience a full 47 hours before it even happens, it's safe to say this is one of the most anticipated games of the decade. Here's hoping Team Cherry gives them something to get excited about.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/19/hollow-knight-silksong-special-announcement-set-for-august-21]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/">Delta Force</a> is officially out now for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, after the release date was <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-arrives-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-this-august-season-break-update-arrives-in-july/">confirmed this past June</a>. As part of the console launch celebration, developer Team Jade has debuted a suite of console-exclusive rewards for players jumping in on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Delta Force | Console Launch - Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hGWaElM2BQI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Delta Force arrives with full crossplay support between consoles and PC, though you can opt out of crossplay if you'd rather not play against PC players. </p>



<p>The shooter runs at 60 FPS on both PS5 and Xbox Series X/S devices, though PS5 Pro players will be able to enjoy the game at unspecified higher frame rates later this year through a forthcoming patch. If you want to get a taste of a higher frame rate for Delta Force on your PS5 Pro now though, a press release for the news recommends you disable vertical sync to unlock the game's frame rate.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Delta Force includes console-exclusive rewards. Image credit: Team Jade</figcaption></figure>



<p>Along with the main multiplayer Warfare and Operations game modes, players will also be able to dive into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-campaign-to-launch-on-february-21/">recently launched</a> Black Hawk Down campaign mode as free DLC for Delta Force.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-hands-on-preview-revisiting-a-cinema-classic/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto played the campaign earlier this year in a hands-on preview</a> ahead of its release, he called it "<em>a drastic shift in both technology and pacing from the multiplayer experience that players might have to take a moment and recognize that they’re getting two distinct gameplay experiences in the same package.</em>"</p>



<p>Now players on consoles can experience the campaign, and everything else Delta Force has to offer alongside PC players.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/major-hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-set-for-this-week</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/major-hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-set-for-this-week.1273827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>developer Team Cherry has teased a major announcement regarding the game, and it's coming in just a couple of days as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1957812884773433667" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on social media</a>, Team Cherry says that in just 48 hours, a "special announcement" regarding&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>will be made. I'd wager anything that we'll finally be getting a release date for one of the most hotly-anticipated indie games of all time.</p>

<p>The announcement will take the form of a YouTube video, so that pretty much cements the idea that we're getting a release date; after all, I doubt Team Cherry would make this much of a song and dance just for a fresh look at&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-this-week-boss.jpg?itok=DbLXeY9R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-this-week-boss.jpg?itok=oOFuScC_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date could finally be on the cards.</figcaption></figure><p>It's been a long, strange road for&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">all the way back in February 2019</a> (yes, it really has been that long), the followup to 2017's celebrated Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>has been in development for a long time.</p>

<p>Each year that went by after&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s initial announcement saw excitement around the game grow, even though&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-still-tba" rel="nofollow">release date</a> was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed" rel="nofollow">nowhere to be seen</a>.</p>

<p>According to SteamDB's <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is still Steam's most-followed game, clocking up 356,387 followers. By contrast, the platform's second most-followed game is&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>, which has 217,811 followers.</p>

<p>Excitement rose again when&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>was included as part of Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">summer showcase this year</a>, as well as the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">reveal event back in April</a>, although again, neither presentation brought with it that ever-elusive&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date.</p>




<p>It can't be easy for Team Cherry;&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is easily the most-hyped indie game on the scene right now, and it's hard to imagine anything living up to the astronomical expectations many will have for the platformer.</p>

<p>Still, things are definitely moving forward now, at any rate. We'll almost certainly get to learn when&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is arriving later this week, so stay tuned for more!</p>

              <p>And, just like that, we’re back. Welcome once again to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news, interesting stuff, stories you might have missed, and more. This morning, we have bad news about PlayStation Plus, good news about<em> Helldivers 2,</em> strange news about that PlayDate console, and sad news about the state of video games as brainrot meme games continue to take over everything. But hey, at least that new <em>Conjuring</em> movie looks like it might be pretty good?</p> <h2><strong>A <em>Fortnite</em> clone of <em>Roblox’s</em> <em>Steal The Brainrot</em> is super popular</strong></h2> <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-empire-review-popular-memes-1851787027">Steal A Brainrot</a></em> has become one of the most popular games on <em>Roblox</em>, leading to kids throwing tantrums when someone…well, steals their brainrot. And now, someone has created a clone that’s become one of the most popular games on <em>Fortnite</em>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-brainrotted-roblox-clone-is-dominating-the-fortnite-charts/1100-6534047/">At one point, as reported by <em>GameSpot</em></a>, the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/island?code=3225-0366-8885"><em>Fortnite</em> knock-off had over 180,000 active players.</a> That would put it in the top five on the Steam charts.</p> <p>And all this popularity has led to a flood of brain-rotting slop. There are clones filling up <em>Fortnite’s</em> creative mode. And if you look around other storefronts and games with user-generated content, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494">you’ll see that knockoff brain-rotting games are truly everywhere</a>. It’s totally awesome and not at all horrible that so much of the video game industry is now entirely based around random users chasing the algorithm and exploiting kids playing stuff on their iPad.</p>

 <h2><strong>Eight games are leaving PlayStation Plus in a few weeks</strong></h2> <p>Sony has announced that eight games are leaving PlayStation Plus Extra’s library on September 16. Sadly, one of the games going away is <em>Plucky Squir</em>e, a solid adventure with some impressive visual flair. Here’s the full list:</p> <ul> <li><em>UFC 5&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>The Plucky Squire</em></li> <li><em>Night in the Woods&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Road 96&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Pistol Whip&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir</em></li> <li><em>FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Dragon’s Crown Pro</em></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Game Boy emulation is now possible on the PlayDate</strong></h2>   <p>The PlayDate might not be the best-selling console around, but it is one of the coolest. And now the black-and-white handheld with a huge library of exclusive games (and a crank!) can do something very cool: Play original Game Boy games. Of course, not officially. Neither Nintendo nor the people behind the PlayDate are involved.&nbsp; But instead, a small group has created “<a href="https://github.com/CrankBoyHQ/crankboy-app">CrankBoy,” a free, fast, and high-performance Game Boy emulator</a> that works perfectly on the PlayDate and its sharp black-and-white screen.</p> <h2><strong>Some of <em>Halo’s</em> best guns will soon be available in <em>Helldivers 2</em></strong></h2> <p>We knew <em>Halo 3: ODST</em> content was coming to <em>Helldivers 2</em> as part of the game’s leap from PS5 to Xbox later this month. But now,<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/19/helldivers-2-halo-odst-crossover-warbond-xbox-launch/"> Xbox has revealed more details about the crossover DLC</a>, and while I’m happy to see the iconic ODST armor arriving in<em> Helldivers 2</em>, the bigger news is that four guns from <em>Halo</em> are coming to the co-op sci-fi shooter, too. This includes the franchise’s famous assault rifle, but more importantly, it includes <em>ODST’s </em>wonderful&nbsp;SOCOM pistol, aka that cool silenced pistol that goes “pip pip pip” and drops Grunts cleanly. I’m hopping back into <em>Helldivers 2</em>, baby.</p> <h2>Valve is adding six new characters to its hero shooter thing known as <em>Deadlock</em></h2> <p>Remember <a href="https://kotaku.com/deadlock-valve-steam-hero-shooter-moba-release-date-1851631341"><em>Deadlock</em></a>? It was that secret hero-based MOBA-shooter Valve sort of released, but in a weird way. Well, <em>Deadlock</em> continues to grow, and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1422450/view/669466707009471267?l=english">game’s latest update is one of its biggest</a>. It adds a whole new lobby area for players to explore between matches and a new character, a deadly but stylish vampire. Plus, Valve plans to add five new characters to the game over the next few days.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425"><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i></a> <span>fans, this is not a drill. We’re actually getting an update on </span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span>, the long-awaited sequel that has gone so long without an update that the act of anticipating it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-hollow-knight-switch-2-screenshots-date-1851775219"><span>has become a meme</span></a><span> almost as common as making </span><i><span>Half-Life 3 </span></i><span>jokes in the chat section of every industry livestream. </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>may appear at today’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-gamescom-2025-livestream-what-time-fallout-black-ops-7-2000618270"><span>Gamescom showcase</span></a><span>, but it looks like developer Team Cherry also has something else to share on Thursday.</span></p> <p><span>The studio has scheduled a YouTube video to go up on Thursday, August 21, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time titled “Special Announcement.” There’s really nothing else to go on here beyond a logo and a chat log of people already excitedly waiting for whatever the video is. However, given that the game is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-rog-ally-gamescom-demo-1851787121"><span>playable at Gamescom</span></a><span>, there’s enough reason to be cautiously optimistic that </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is finally, after all this time, imminent, and coming to a console near you. Here’s the scheduled video if you want to save it for Thursday, or just hang out with the rest of the sickos waiting in the chat.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Special Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong </span></i><span>was first announced in 2019, just two years after the original game launched in 2017. Since then, the game’s absence from any and every video game showcase has been felt so deeply that hoping and praying for its arrival has become an ongoing joke for the series’ fans, as well as passersby who loved to clown on fans every time the game didn’t show up. Now, it seems, the drought is finally over. Hopefully, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is coming soon. If it is, you’ll be able to play it just about anywhere, as the game is coming to both current and last-gen consoles, as well as PC, Mac, and Linux devices. Strap in, folks. After six years of waiting, the ride is about to begin.</span></p>
