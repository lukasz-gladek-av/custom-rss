            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, Mac, and other Linux-based enjoyers of superhero shooter hit <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> can once again play without fear of being pulped under an unlawfully swung banhammer. Developers NetEase had recently doled out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1hs39mf/can_proton_cause_you_to_get_flagged_for_cheating/">bans of up to 100 years</a> to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-apologizes-for-mistakenly-banning-players-for-using-cheats">IGN</a>, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.</p>
<p>"We sincerely apologize for this situation and want to assure you that we do not and will not ban players who are playing fairly and without cheating," NetEase’s <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1193841000108531764/1201833362399170560/1324661682936746075">Discord</a> statement reads, perhaps not with the kind of wording I’d use if I’d just banned players who are playing fairly and without cheating. It continues: "We have identified the specific reasons behind these false bans and have compiled a list of affected players. We have lifted these bans and want to express our heartfelt apologies for the inconvenience this has caused."</p>
<p>Proof, there, that justice can be served by apologetic executives just as effectively as vigilante supersoldiers and/or sentient trees. I haven’t played Marvel Rivals – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-review">Ed’s review</a> would have put me off even I hadn’t already had my fill of hero shooters – but I do note that Valve have rated it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/">Playable for the Steam Deck</a>, so the number of falsely condemned SteamOS players could have been substantial from that alone.</p>
<p>Proton, the specific compatibility layer that SteamOS integrates, does have some past form for triggering certain anti-cheat systems, though in the Deck’s early days this was more down to a simple lack of software compatibility rather than genuine concerns over Proton’s potential dodginess. Still, the prospect of exposing games to the untameable, open-source Linux still spooks some developers. Fortnite has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-wont-get-steam-deck-support-epic-ceo-blames-cheaters">never worked on SteamOS</a>, for one, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">cut support</a> over potential cheating concerns.</p>
<p>Fair play to NetEase for refraining from such a heavy handed approach, even if you <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-rivals-winnie-the-pooh-banned">still can't mention Winnie the Pooh</a> in its chat.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia is gearing up to announce its next-gen GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards, and with it will come the next era of Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). According to a leaked store listing, Nvidia DLSS 4 is set to release alongside the new GPUs.</p>



<p>Spotted on social media by <a href="https://x.com/GawroskiT/status/1874834447046168734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tomasz Gawroński</a>, a European listing for an Asus RTX 5080 card retailing for €1,699.95 mentions the previously leaked GDDR7 VRAM along with “DLSS4”. While many assumed that the image was fake, noted hardware leaker <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1875039748122878433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kopite7kimi</a> confirmed that DLSS 4 was accurate.</p>



<p>No other details about DLSS 4 were provided. Features along with compatibility for last-gen RTX 40 Series cards should be announced when it’s officially revealed.</p>



<p>Nvidia is scheduled to announce the first RTX 50 Series graphics cards at CES 2025. CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote presentation on January 6 at 930pm ET/ 630pm PT. </p>



<p>You can check out the rumored specs for the first three cards in the next-gen lineup below. It’s worth noting that until details are official, the specs should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

As noted by TheXclusiveAce, each report includes some highly personal data including your IP address, so think twice before sharing it unedited.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ6Zw8tADVo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dZ6Zw8tADVo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To get access, the first step is to visit <a href="https://support.activision.com/privacy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision's privacy page</a> and login to your Activision account. TheXclusiveAce also mentioned that he had to login to his PSN account as well. After that, submit a personal information access request. Prior to the video above, the wait time was around a day before Activision e-mailed the file out. But since this method is now widely known, there may be additional delays.</p><p>The report itself is a very through examination of each player's Call of Duty history, as it tracks every match played, as well as the mode, the operator who was used, the number of hits taken, the longest streak, and more. It's a lot to take in. The report also charts the course of each player's skill ranking as it rises or falls depending upon their activities in the games.</p><p>SBMM ratings are used to place Call of Duty players in lobbies with similarly skilled players, as determined by Activision's criteria. Not every player may agree with these assessments, as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-player-pleads-with-call-of-duty-to-put-him-in-the-trash-lobbies/1100-6528596/" data-ref-id="1100-6528596">NBA's Donovan Mitchell recently pleaded with Activision</a> to put him "in the trash lobbies." Over time, it's possible that the most experienced Call of Duty players may be able to utilize the info in their player reports to enhance their ratings.</p><p>Recently, Activision debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-best-stoner-dlc-yet-turns-you-into-a-pot-smoking-lizard/1100-6528200/" data-ref-id="1100-6528200">a stoner-lizard DLC</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone.

            <p>Atari has shared a sneak peek at its upcoming "iconic" handheld console, Gamestation Go.</p>
<p>Whilst the company has given very little in terms of detail, it does reveal the handheld's final look with the accompanying text: "An icon, reimagined".</p>

<p>The teaser shows off the console's button layout, and it all looks very much what you'd expect from a handheld console released in 2025. But it also confirms the system will come with both a paddle and a Trak-Ball, plus a number keypad on the right-hand side.</p>

<p>That's it, though - we don't get a release date or anything else concrete, but with CES 2025 just around the corner commencing 7th January, hopefully we'll discover some of the finer details next week.</p>
<p>On the plus side, we also had a cheeky glimpse of My Arcade, which will hopefully include some Intellivision goodies after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-buys-intellivision-brand-ending-longest-running-console-war">Atari purchased the brand last year</a>, ending what Atari claims to be the "longest-running console war in history".</p>
<p>Atari's home consoles went head-to-head with Mattel's Intellivision in the late 1970s and 1980s, long before Nintendo and Sega competed in the 1990s. Intellivision even enlisted actor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYLly625cXE">George Plimpton for an infamous series of adverts</a> comparing the two consoles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/falcons-sign-niko/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/falcons-finally-sign-cs2-superstar-niko.1073400/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/falcons-sign-niko/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Falcons organization officially announced the signing of Bosnian Counter-Strike superstar Nikola “⁠NiKo⁠” Kovač today, successfully bringing on the star that once rebuked them. The first significant domino to fall during the latest post-CS2 Major transfer window has fallen. </p>



<p>The plethora of resources available to the Saudi organization have finally led to the star they’ve always wanted, and the move has drastically altered the competitive CS2 landscape.</p>



<h2 id="h-second-time-s-the-charm">Second Time’s The Charm</h2>



<p>This is Falcons’ second time going after NiKo, having spent most of 2023 pursuing one of Counter-Strike’s greatest riflers. Though at the end of 2023, NiKo pivoted and chose to remain with G2 Esports for the 2024 season. G2 and NiKo fell just short of winning the Major that still eludes them, but the 2024 campaign was still a successful one. Russian AWP prodigy Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blossomed into one of the best players in the world</a>, and G2 capitalized on the signing of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guatemalan sensation Mario “malbsMd” Samayoa</a>. G2 lifted trophies at IEM Dallas, the BLAST Fall Final, and the BLAST World Final in 2024.</p>



<p>Despite the presence of the legendary Emil “Magisk” Reif, Peter “dupreeh” Rasmussen, and coach Danny “zonic” Sørensen, it was a turbulent and forgettable 2024 season for Falcons. The roster struggled throughout the year, even with Oleksandr “⁠s1mple⁠” Kostyliev playing with them on loan. The nail in the coffin was failing to qualify for the Perfect World Shanghai Major, prompting Falcons to discontinue s1mple’s loan and bench everyone not named Magisk.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Falcons are <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40627/sources-falcons-in-talks-over-heroic-trio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly considering</a> the trio of Damjan “⁠kyxsan⁠” Stoilkovski, René “⁠TeSeS⁠” Madsen and Abdul “⁠degster⁠” Gasanov, who all currently play for Danish organization Heroic. But this is the result of another instance in which Falcons have been denied the player they really want, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-will-reportedly-keep-cs2-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G2 has reportedly closed off talks for previously mentioned m0NESY</a>.</p>



<p>With the big NiKo domino now fallen, and the post-Major break ending in less than two weeks, many more new signings and transfers are expected over the next few days. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[It Looks Like a Bunch More GameStop Stores are Closing Down]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-gamestop-store-closures</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-looks-like-a-bunch-more-gamestop-stores-are-closing-down.1073379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-gamestop-store-closures<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several more GameStop stores appear to be closing down, although there's technically been no real official announcement from the company or its management regarding these closures (save for one small detail in an SEC filing).</p>

<p>Over on the GameStop subreddit, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hsbjt5/my_first_thought_when_i_heard_my_store_was_closing/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">number</a> of GameStop <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hs3a1i/well_guys_its_been_nice/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">employees</a>&nbsp;are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hs7n3n/my_store_has_been_culled/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">declaring</a> that their stores are being closed. Sorting posts by most recent on the subreddit shows tons of posts pertaining to store closures, although the posts don't name which stores are closing.</p>

<p>That might be owing to the policy outlined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1hs5bok/to_our_concerned_guests_do_not_ask/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> by GameStop assistant store leader ArcherFawkes, who claims that if employees share information about a store's closure with customers, they'll be punished. As such, users are directed not to "ask for what stores are closing", as they "cannot tell you outright".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamestop-closing-stores-reddit.jpg?itok=tW-laThn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamestop-closing-stores-reddit.jpg?itok=sThjS2CD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The GameStop subreddit is currently full of posts declaring that stores are closing down.</figcaption></figure><p>The full scale of the store closures isn't currently known, and it is possible that some of these posts are by users who work at the same GameStop, but it seems that plenty of stores have been affected.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, GameStop management hasn't made an official public-facing announcement of these closures, although in an <a href="https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/2c1eac18-9f79-41b9-9e56-a8db8fe7aac4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SEC filing from mid-S</a><a href="https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/node/20696/html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">eptember</a>, company management said an ongoing review "may result in the closure of a larger number of stores than we have closed in the past few years".</p>

<p>These closures come after GameStop announced back in March <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-confirms-more-layoffs-share-price-tumbles-after-sales-slide/1100-6522189/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that it had closed 287 stores</a> over the previous fiscal year, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamestop-closing-180-200-stores" rel="nofollow">hundreds</a> of other store closures in <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/10/investing/gamestop-store-closures/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">previous years</a>.</p>

<p>In its latest <a href="https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-discloses-third-quarter-2024-results" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earnings release</a>, GameStop acknowledges that its net sales have dropped from $1.078 billion in last year's third quarter to just $860m in the same period this fiscal year, although net income for the third quarter was $17.5 million, up from a $3.1 million loss during the same period last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamestop-closing-stores-mascot.jpg?itok=YNHSaKPp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamestop-closing-stores-mascot.jpg?itok=bJVezOYH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>GameStop remains indelibly associated with its infamous stock price fiasco for many.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, in many people's minds, GameStop is still associated with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamestop-stock-trading-halted-due-to-sudden-spike" rel="nofollow">bizarre meme-driven 2021 stock inflation</a>&nbsp;story, which saw stock prices soaring to such a height that trading was halted more than once owing to volatility.</p>

<p>The situation eventually got so out of hand that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/white-house-economic-team-monitoring-gamestop-stock-situation" rel="nofollow">attracted the US government's attention</a>. Eventually, author Ben Mezrich would write a book,&nbsp;<em>The Antisocial Network</em>, chronicling the debacle, with that book later becoming a major Hollywood motion picture by the name of&nbsp;<em>Dumb Money</em>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens in the coming weeks with regards to GameStop store closures, but for now, if you're a company employee, it might be best to check with your management regarding what's going on with your store.</p>

                <p>Marvel Rivals developer NetEase has apologized to rightfully pissed-off players who were unfairly banned for cheating. The problem is even though they were not using cheating software, this resulted in false bans. NetEase failed to say how many.</p><p>NetEase said (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-apologizes-for-mistakenly-banning-players-for-using-cheats" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) that it admitted it had mistakenly flagged some players who were playing in compatibility layer programs as cheaters. "We sincerely apologize for this situation and want to assure you that we do not and will not ban players who are playing fairly and without cheating," NetEase said. "We have identified the specific reasons behind these false bans and have compiled a list of affected players. We have lifted these bans and want to express our heartfelt apologies for the inconvenience this has caused."</p><p>NetEase continued that it is investing in improving its anti-cheat, and called on players to report cheaters if they encounter them.</p><p>"Our mission is to provide all players with a fair, just, and enjoyable gaming environment. Therefore, preventing and identifying cheaters is one of our top priorities. We have invested significant manpower and resources to improve the speed and accuracy of our detection systems," the developers added. "With any ongoing detection system, there is always room for improvement. We appreciate your assistance in helping us tackle this challenge. If you encounter any cheating behavior, please report it immediately; our reporting system will respond promptly. If you believe you have been wrongly banned, you can appeal to our customer support team, and we will review your case and respond in a timely manner. You can reach the support team via either in-game or in Discord!"</p><p>The news comes ahead of Marvel Rivals Season 1 and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-teases-four-new-heroes-coming-to-the-game/1100-6528615/" data-ref-id="1100-6528615">arrival of Fantastic Four playable characters</a> who were teased with a first-look image with a soon-to-be-released trailer. Fingers crossed for HERBIE to be added as well.</p><p>While this might have annoyed some players, Marvel Rivals has been a stellar hit for NetEase, reporting 10 million players in three days <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-celebrating-another-milestone-with-a-free-limited-time-reward/1100-6528532/" data-ref-id="1100-6528532">and 20 million in two weeks</a>. Over on Steam, Marvel Rivals peaked over its launch weekend with 480,990 concurrent players, which was enough to put it in the top five most-played games on Valve's platform.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-dc-in-2025.1073340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-dc-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the comics, 2024 was a pretty quiet year for DC. It didn’t help that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/joker-2-suffers-a-historic-drop-at-the-box-office-as-another-clown-takes-the-top-spot">Joker: Folie à Deux turned out to be one of the year’s biggest box office bombs</a>. But there’s a new hope on the horizon. James Gunn’s DCU is coming, and with it a brand new era for DC on the big and small screens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From Gunn’s hotly anticipated Superman movie to the return of shows like Peacemaker and The Sandman to the expansion of DC’s Absolute Universe, let’s break down the biggest and most important DC projects arriving in 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">DC Universe: Every Upcoming Movie and TV Show</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman Kicks Off the Live-Action DCU</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to 2023, which saw the release of no fewer than four films set in the now-defunct DC Extended Universe, 2025 is definitely smaller in scope. Just like with 2024’s Joker: Folie à Deux, there’s only one new live-action DC movie hitting theaters this year. That said, it’s easily the most important movie DC has released in years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That movie is, of course, James Gunn’s Superman. Where Gunn’s Creature Commandos animated series gave us our first taste of the new DCU cinematic universe, Superman is our first live-action foray into this world. Based on Creature Commandos’ quality, not to mention Gunn’s work on the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy, we have high hopes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman casts David Corenswet as the Man of Steel. Rather than exploring Kal-El’s origin story for the umpteenth time, the movie takes place after Superman has been on the job for a few years. He’s trying his best to use his powers to guide and protect mankind and prove that there’s room for decency and kindness in our cynical modern world. In other words, exactly the sort of superhero film we could all use right about now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman also stars Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor, Skyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen, and Wendell Pierce as Perry White. And because this film is our introduction to the DCU in live-action, fans can expect a lot of other DC heroes to drop by. That lineup includes Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern Guy Gardner, Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific, Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl, and Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho. Also helping tie together the growing DCU will be Frank Grillo, who reprises the role of Rick Flag, Sr. from Creature Commandos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Needless to say, there’s a lot riding on Superman’s brawny shoulders right now. This film marks the full debut of a brand-new cinematic universe, and it paves the way for a number of big-budget DC projects in the years ahead, from movies like Supergirl and The Authority to shows like Lanterns and Paradise Lost. It’s a piece in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dcu-chapter-one-gods-and-monsters-james-gunn-peter-safran">a much larger puzzle Gunn is calling “Gods and Monsters.”</a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is whether Superman can succeed where so many DC movies have crashed and burned in recent years. Given the way films like The Flash and Shazam! Fury of the Gods bombed at the box office in 2023, it’s clear fans had written off the old DCEU before it even finished. And Joker: Folie à Deux proved to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/joker-2-should-be-a-big-deal-for-dc-so-why-does-it-seem-like-nobody-cares">a complete misfire for DC in 2024</a>. Is the DC brand irrevocably tarnished in Hollywood, or can Superman start the road to recovery?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever happens, we’re eagerly looking forward to the release of Superman, which hits theaters on July 11, 2025.      </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Batman: Knightfall Gets Animated</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman may be the only live-action theatrical release DC is putting out in 2025, but it won’t be the only new DC movie. DC’s line of direct-to-DVD animated films will continue in the new year, with details starting to leak about their ambitious next project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the release of the critically acclaimed two-part Watchmen adaptation, DC is turning to another classic graphic novel for its next adaptation, Batman: Knightfall. In fact, Knightfall is reportedly getting a full trilogy of adaptations, matching the scope of the recent Crisis on Infinite Earths movie trilogy. The trilogy hasn’t been officially announced yet, but as pointed out by The Direct, <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/warner-bros-developing-new-batman-movie-trilogy-report" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a listing for the first movie has appeared on the EIDR database</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Batman: Knightfall is the famous 1993 crossover where Batman first encountered the ruthless Bane. Over the course of the story, Bane wears down the Dark Knight physically and psychologically and breaks his back. Left paralyzed, Bruce has no option but to turn the Batman mantle over to another like-minded vigilante named Jean-Paul Valley. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that Batman: Knightfall is a trilogy of movies, we assume the first film will adapt Knightfall itself, while the second will cover the follow-up crossover Knightquest and the third will cap off the story by adapting Knightsend. In Knightquest, Jean-Paul establishes himself as a more ruthless and deranged alternative to Bruce, while in Knightsend a recovered Bruce has to reclaim the Batman mantle and save Gotham City from this sadistic new Dark Knight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, DC has yet to formally announce the Batman: Knightfall movies, so at this stage we don’t know the voice cast or potential release dates. It’s possible that Knightfall is a continuation of the Tomorrowverse, meaning that Batman: The Long Halloween star Jensen Ackles would reprise the Batman role again. But it’s also possible that DC has closed the door on that animated universe following the Crisis trilogy, meaning we may see a new actor cast as Batman. Either way, expect Batman: Knightfall to be one of the darkest and most violent Batman movies since DC’s adaptation of The Dark Knight Returns.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">DC TV in 2024</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There may be only one new DC movie hitting theaters in 2025, but DC definitely has a more stacked TV and streaming lineup planned this year. That includes another addition to the new but rapidly growing DCU, as Gunn’s Peacemaker returns for Season 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Peacemaker: Season 2 will be the next DCU project to hit after Superman. How does that work when the first season was a spinoff of Gunn’s The Suicide Squad, which was part of the DCEU? Don’t think too hard about it. Just know that Season 2 continues the misadventures of John Cena’s peace-loving anti-hero Christopher Smith. Danielle Brooks, Freddie Stroma, Jennifer Holland, Steve Agee, and Robert Patrick are all also returning for Season 2, and Frank Grillo’s Rick Flag Sr. continues to serve as the glue tying the DCU together.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Peacemaker Season 2 will debut on Max in August 2025, so fans don’t have to wait long after Superman’s release to get more of this growing superhero universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re expecting one other live-action DC series to arrive in 2025, as Netflix finally continues the saga of The Sandman. Tom Sturridge is back as Morpheus, as the Lord of Dreams deals with new challenges to his realm. One of those challenges comes from Gwendoline Christie’s Lucifer, who is out for revenge after being outwitted by Morpheus in Season 1. It’s expected that Season 2 will adapt the comic storyline The Season of Mists, a tale that pushes the Morpheus/Lucifer rivalry in a very unexpected direction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We can also expect to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/captain-price-actor-barry-sloane-is-the-prodigal-in-the-sandman-season-2">meet the rest of Morpheus’ siblings in Season 2</a>, including Adrian Lester’s Destiny, Esmé Creed-Miles’ Delirium, and Barry Sloane’s Destruction. Why did Morpheus’ little brother Destruction abdicate his responsibilities? That’s another mystery the series looks poised to explore in Season 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With production on Season 2 having wrapped in 2024, Netfix has previously confirmed a 2025 release for Season 2. However, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-gaiman-offering-to-step-back-from-good-omens-season-3-amid-assault-allegations-report">executive producer Neil Gaiman was recently accused of sexual assault and abuse</a> by multiple women, and it’s unclear how this might affect Netflix’s timetable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the animated side of things, we’re hoping to see new seasons of Batman: Caped Crusader, My Adventures With Superman, and Harley Quinn in 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Caped Crusader debuted on Prime Video in 2024, at which point Amazon had already greenlit the series for a second season. Hamish Linklater will return as the voice of Bruce Wayne and Batman. Based on the ending to Season 1, it seems safe to assume that Season 2 will deal with the emergence of Batman’s greatest foe, the Joker, though we don’t yet know who will voice the Clown Prince of Crime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for My Adventures With Superman, this lighthearted, shonen anime-inspired series has been greenlit for Season 3. With Season 1 debuting in 2023 and Season 2 following in 2024, we’re hopeful that the third season can continue that annual release schedule, especially with the new movie also dropping this year. With Season 2 introducing Supergirl and pitting Superman against Amanda Waller and ARGUS, it’s anyone’s guess what parts of the Superman mythos Season 3 will mine.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Harley Quinn is confirmed to return in January 2025. This decidedly adults-only animated series took a year off in 2024 to make room for the Kite-Man spinoff, but it’s time to put the spotlight back on Kaley Cuoco’s Harley and Lake Bell’s Poison Ivy.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">DC Games: Will We See a New Arkham Game?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 is looking to be pretty quiet on the gaming front for DC. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deathstroke-rounds-out-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-currently-announced-roadmap-but-then-what">Rocksteady will be adding Deathstroke</a> as the newest and last playable character to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. After a rough launch in 2024, that live-service game looks to be headed into maintenance mode in 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We could see new DC characters added to the free-to-play fighting game MultiVersus, which already includes mainstays Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Joker, and Harley Quinn. And it’s also possible the Meta Quest-exclusive Batman: Arkham Shadow will be ported to other VR systems in 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But beyond that, there’s not much for DC fans to look forward to in 2025. At best, we hope to see some concrete announcements about what’s coming in terms of DC’s video game roadmap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do know there are projects in the works. While Gunn has already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-gunn-throws-cold-water-on-the-batman-video-game-rumor">shot down rumors of a new game set in Matt Reeves’ The Batman universe</a>, there is at least one new Batman game in development right now. Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav confirmed as much when he revealed on a recent investor call that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady">Batman is one of the core pillars of the company’s gaming future</a> going forward. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Rocksteady be working on the next entry in the Arkham franchise? Or will another studio take charge of putting players in Batman’s boots? Either way, we’re hoping to catch a glimpse of this mysterious game at some point in 2025. And while we’re at it, it would be nice to see a little more of Monolith’s Wonder Woman game, which was announced at the 2021 Game Awards but has basically dropped off the map since.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">DC Comics Goes All In</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">DC may have had a rough year on the big screen in 2024, but DC Comics is coming off a very successful year and looking to continue that momentum into 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DC’s main focus right now is on the DC All In initiative, which aims to give readers fresh, easy jumping-on points for all of DC’s ongoing titles. That includes major books like Tom King and Daniel Sampere’s Wonder Woman, Joshua Williamson and Dan Mora’s Superman, Tom Taylor and Mikel Janin’s Detective Comics, and Mark Waid and Dan Mora’s Justice League Unlimited. We’re also eagerly looking forward to digging into Ram V and Evan Cagle’s New Gods, a series that just kicked off in December 2024 and will be as important as any other when it comes to charting the Darkseid-focused future of the DC line.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">DC's Absolute Universe: Preview Art Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dc-comics-absolute-universe-batman-scott-snyder">Then there’s the Absolute Universe</a>, the other side of the DC All In coin. The Absolute line is similar to Marvel’s Ultimate Universe in that it focuses on updating and streamlining DC’s iconic heroes without the burden of decades of existing continuity. Scott Snyder and Nick Dragotta’s Absolute Batman, Kelly Thompson and Hayden Sherman’s Absolute Wonder Woman, and Jason Aaron and Rafa Sandoval’s Absolute Superman have all proven to be big hits for DC, and they’ll continue to expand the line heading into 2025. Look for new additions like Al Ewing and Jahnoy Lindsay’s Absolute Green Lantern, Jeff Lemire and Nick Robles’ Absolute Flash and Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez’s Absolute Martian Manhunter, all debuting in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DC’s biggest story of the year, however, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dc-comics-announces-batman-hush-sequel-and-the-return-of-vertigo-nycc-2024">may well be Batman: Hush 2</a>. This sequel brings back writer Jeph Loeb and artist Jim Lee for a brand-new mystery centered around the titular villain. Hush 2 kicks off in the pages of Batman #158, also releasing in March.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/20/mixcollage-20-oct-2024-12-06-am-1693-1729397202902.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, DC is bringing back the beloved Vertigo imprint in 2025. Once the home of critically acclaimed mature readers comics like The Sandman, Preacher, and Y: The Last Man, Vertigo was previously shuttered back in 2019. But now it’s returning as a home for creator-owned comics. James Tynion and Álvaro Martínez Bueno's The Nice House by the Sea is the first book to carry the Vertigo banner, but we’re expecting a lot more announcements in the months to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s what you can expect from DC in 2025. Are you excited for Gunn’s Superman? What about the return of Peacemaker and The Sandman? Cast your vote in our poll and let us know in the comments which new DC project you’re most looking forward to this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Enterprising&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>players have figured out a way to discover their SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) rating within the game, a value that's supposed to be hidden from players' view.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-players-are-getting-activision-to-send-them-their-personal-information-so-they-can-find-out-their-hidden-sbmm-rating" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, this method comes via YouTuber TheXclusiveAce, and it works for every&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game you've played since 2021's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Vanguard</em>. That's a heck of a lot of data.</p>

<p>As IGN points out, however, it's a method that takes a little while, and you'll have to put in a bit of effort to reap the rewards. You'll have to submit a personal information access request via the <a href="https://support.activision.com/privacy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Activision privacy page</a>, and it can take a couple of days for the data to arrive, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-gunfight.jpg?itok=2Vil6up- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-gunfight.jpg?itok=u5uyfZJv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to find out your&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>SBMM rating? You can do so via a newly-discovered method.</figcaption></figure><p>Once you do get the info (for which you'll also need to log into an Activision account), you'll be granted access to a vast amount of data that, according to IGN and TheXclusiveAce, includes every Multiplayer match you've played on record.</p>

<p>You can see info like the modes and maps you've played with, as well as number of hits, damage numbers, and even the amount of time you've spent moving in each game. Activision really is collecting a staggering amount of player data from&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>, it seems.</p>

<p>If you don't know what SBMM is, it's a rather hot topic within the multiplayer gaming world. SBMM, or skill-based matchmaking, refers to a method by which players are grouped together in multiplayer games according to their skill level.</p>

<p>Some players have decried SBMM, suggesting it makes games too hard to enjoy as "sweaty" players dominate higher-end lobbies. However, <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/CallofDuty_Matchmaking_Series_2.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">extensive experiments released by Activision last year</a> seem to contradict this, suggesting that players do appreciate SBMM when it's present, even if they don't realize it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-posing.jpg?itok=iNWu2iF7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-posing.jpg?itok=F7UF2pJy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty</em>'s SBMM process is perhaps more popular than players would like to believe.</figcaption></figure><p>The data TheXclusiveAce uncovered isn't necessarily helpful in a vacuum, as it doesn't contain comparison to other players, nor does it show the skill rating of lobbies in which you participated in multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>However, if the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>community comes together to compare data, then a more comprehensive picture of the way SBMM works within the games could be created.</p>

<p>It's well worth watching his video on the subject if you want to learn more about how to access your own data, as well as what it could tell you about your own&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>performance. You can see it here.</p>




<h2>What else is going on in the world of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>?</h2>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>land, the games'&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>collaboration, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover" rel="nofollow">first teased back in early December</a>, has now officially landed.</p>

<p>Per the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>blog, the&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>crossover gives you the chance to earn goodies like a new Front Man Operator, as well as new Skins for existing Operators that sport the iconic green tracksuit from the show.</p>

In recent months, it’s occurred to the company that perhaps it’d be good if people saw the stuff it’s making, adding the service as an option on Amazon Prime, and now it’s offering a completely free weekend to lure you in. It’s just, there’s also an awful lot of confusion about when it actually starts.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s purportedly not set up such that you have to cancel once the free weekend is over on January 5, which is good.

Both are gripping dramas.</p><p>Then there’s <em>Severance</em>, Ben Stiller and Adam Scott’s incredible twist on a workplace comedy in which everything is distinctly not OK, Bill “<em>Scrubs</em>” Lawrence’s comedy <em>Ted Lasso</em> following an American coach of a British football team, and indeed Bill Lawrence’s comedy-drama-cum-murder mystery <em>Bad Monkey</em>, with Vince Vaughn finally finding a platform in which he can shine.</p><p>There’s a ton of other sci-fi on there too, among it <em>Invasion</em>, <em>Dark Matter</em>, <em>Foundation</em>, <em>Constellation</em>, and the <em>Godzilla</em> spin-off show <em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.</em> Other hugely rated shows include <em>Slow Horses </em>starring Gary Oldman, <em>Bad Sisters </em>with the amazing Sharon Horgan, and <em>Disclaimer </em>starring Cate Blanchett.</p><p>A <em>lot</em> of the above shows have been cancelled, so cruel is the world of spending hundreds of millions on TV shows that don’t ever get a chance to find an audience, but none so brutally as Taika Waititi’s reimagining of Terry Gilliam’s <em>Time Bandits</em>. But, you know, if you’re only planning to blitz the archive for a single weekend, you may as well watch what looks enjoyable.</p><p>Um, Apple has also made some movies.</p><p>Is there a catch? Well, sure. You’ll need to sign up for an Apple ID to do this, which is to say, this is a massive database play by the megacorp, looking to gather vast numbers of email addresses to bombard with further nags. But of course it’s that, and we’re all capable of unsubscribing, or using a temporary email address.</p><p>Whether it actually starts Friday or Saturday (we shall update accordingly), it seems like a pretty decent deal. If you want <em>one</em> show to focus on, pick <em>Silo. </em>And <em>Severance</em>. And <em>For All Mankind.</em></p><p><strong>Updated: 01/03/2025, 10:32 a.m. ET:</strong> Added some vague details about when the offer begins in the U.S. based on Apple’s response to our questions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>According to a veteran video game industry analyst, 2025 could be the year that Microsoft goes "all-in" on bringing its Xbox games to other platforms, including PlayStation 5. Microsoft, of course, has already begun to launch some games on rival platforms, but Serkan Toto of Kantan Games believes Microsoft will lean further into that this year.</p><p>Toto told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/switch-2-finally-gta-6-to-dominate-ai-in-game-dev-again-analysts-predictions-for-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Microsoft may opt to do this for a variety of reasons, including helping to pay for its massive buyout of Activision Blizzard and the "huge lead" of PlayStation in the market.</p><p>"2025 might be the year where they go all-in," Toto said. "The $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal, rising costs across the board, the power of forever-titles, the huge lead of Sony, and other factors will likely leave Microsoft no choice but to bring all their big games to PS5 early, including blockbusters such as Gears of War: E-Day or Perfect Dark."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1895316273" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

including Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Hi-Fi Rush, and Pentiment. Even before this, though, Microsoft was already one of the biggest publishers on PlayStation and Switch thanks to the juggernaut Minecraft series. Call of Duty is now a Microsoft franchise, too, and Microsoft continues to release the game on PlayStation platforms.</p><p>One of the next big Xbox games to come to PlayStation is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which launches for PS5 in Spring 2025. Beyond this, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-halo-game-is-reportedly-being-considered-for-ps5/1100-6523999/" data-ref-id="1100-6523999">ongoing rumors of a Halo: Combat Evolved remaster project that could launch on PS5.</a></p><p>In May, it was reported that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-pushing-for-no-red-line-for-what-games-could-come-to-playstation-report/1100-6523516/" data-ref-id="1100-6523516">mandating increasing margins at all divisions, including Xbox</a>. At the time, it was reported that Microsoft might look to release even more of its first-party games on PlayStation to help increase revenue. There is said to be an internal plan within Microsoft called "Latitude" that is focused on formulating plans to bring more first-party Xbox games to rival systems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/03/an-eternal-strands-demo-is-coming-to-pc-later-this-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Yellow Brick Games has announced that an Eternal Strands demo is coming to PC via Steam on 21st January, giving a sneak preview of their magic-infused action-adventure game a week before the full release for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 28th January – it will also be day one on certain tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>There’s no word yet on if a demo will also be coming to console, though <a href="https://x.com/YellowBrick_Qc/status/1874836069608522227">the team responded to a query</a> about this by saying “Steam only for the moment”, which implies it’s a possibility.</p>


<p>Eternal Strands will cast players as Brynn, a young Weaver seeking to recover her people’s cultural home, fighting enemies with a blend of magical abilities and weapons. Core to this, however, is a thermodynamic layer woven throughout the game world so that the elemental use of fire and ice can be applied to the environment to great effect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eternal Strands - Release Date Trailer | Yellow Brick Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhMT5IWrTlk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Heat will spread, cold will chill, and there’s real-time destruction that goes hand-in-hand with telekinetic powers. You can, for example, set fire to a tree, then rip it out of the ground and hurl it at enemies with Brynn’s telekinesis. Alternatively, cast a magical ice wall to block incoming attacks, or infuse her sword with flames to waft at enemies.</p>

<p>Brynn is also inherently mobile, allowing her to face off against gigantic enemies that you’ll need to climb up, shatter armour to reveal weak spots, freeze to limit mobility, burn to clear fur, and more in order to defeat. Of course, the magic will also be useful for navigating the fantasy city.</p>
<p>It’s all a rather intriguing additional layer to the action-adventure formula, bringing more interactivity and emergent reactivity to the game. Definitely one to keep an eye on for later this month, as one of the earliest game releases of the year.</p>

			<p>Remedy Entertainment Creative Director Sam Lake was recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jDKF2dlK6E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed by IGN</a> about the prospects of the so-called <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-new-game-in-the-remedy-connected-universe-is-already-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy Connected Universe</a>, which he feels is really just getting started after Control and Alan Wake 2.</p>
<p><em>Personally, to me, games are a storytelling medium and, from that perspective, an art form.... It's been a long journey. I can look back and see logical steps through it all, but more and more, I'm looking at it from the perspective of all of these different forms of expression, mediums, and art forms, how games as a very modern medium can hold all of that in them and how in this interactive form we can use everything that has come before and give it kind of a new meaning and context. </em></p>
<p><em>We can really use all of that to create these layered worlds that the player can then go and experience and explore. I feel that we made a very decisive leap forward when it comes to that, but in no way do I feel that we would have kind of reached the end. Already in the process of creating this latest game, there were a lot of new exciting ideas that came about but were not possible to explore in the context of Alan Wake 2.</em></p>
<p><em>I feel like we are just getting started, so I feel it's too early to start talking about an endgame. I love tying these things together. I love making it deeper and expanding on the lore. It really feels like this kind of opportunity to take these strands that we have put there, expand and entertain different ideas. It feels really exciting.</em></p>
<p>Sam Lake also explained that how these games will be connected might also incite newcomers to try the other games in the universe made by Remedy.</p>
<p><em>The way we are looking at it, every game needs to be enjoyable on its own and stand on its own on feet, but then for our fans for people who have been playing other Remedy games, we want to put in a lot of content for them to discover for the ongoing universe story. Also, we feel hopeful that now that there is a universe and a catalog of games that will be expanding as we go, somebody playing their first Remedy game can then continue in the universe and check out the other games as well and dive deeper into that rabbit hole.</em></p>
<p>Lake talked about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal with Annapurna</a>, too, calling them the perfect partner to work on a film or TV series adaptation. The closest new Remedy project is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, though, a cooperative multiplayer that likely won't put too much emphasis on storytelling for a change.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-steam-player-count-new-record</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rust-player-count-reaches-new-all-time-high-almost-seven-years-after-release.1073271/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-steam-player-count-new-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>has managed to hit a new all-time player count record on Steam, despite the fact that the game is nearing its seventh anniversary (and it's been out for even longer if you count Early Access).</p>

<p>According to the ever-reliable <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/252490/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>,&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>managed to hit 262,284 players within the last 24 hours, which is also the game's all-time peak. Even at time of writing, it's sitting at 200,694 players, so it's not like that spike was a fluke.</p>

<p>Of course, these numbers probably won't come as a surprise if you're a&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>player or if you've been following the game. After all,&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>'s player count has been <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/252490/charts/#max" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">slowly climbing</a> since its 2013 release, although the 262,284 jump is impressive even within that context.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rust-player-count-record-fortress.jpg?itok=QHXBbycJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rust-player-count-record-fortress.jpg?itok=4Ezc9Q0T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rust&nbsp;</em>has hit a new all-time player record on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what's driving this player count increase? It's likely that the Steam Winter Sale, during which&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>was available at a 50% discount, contributed hugely to the game's surge in popularity.</p>

<p>We're also just moving out of the holiday season, during which many players will have had more time to play games. Both of these are likely contributing factors to&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>'s newfound (extra) success, although content creators on platforms like YouTube and Twitch likely also shouldn't be discounted.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game in which "the only aim" is to survive.&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>'s world is also unapologetically hostile; it's one in which "everything wants you to die", according to developer and publisher Facepunch.</p>

<p>Since release,&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates bringing new features to the game, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-update-adds-military-bases-to-raid-for-goodies" rel="nofollow">military bases</a> to raid for goodies, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-above-ground-trains-update-rolls-out-today" rel="nofollow">above-ground trains</a> to ride, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-september-2021-update-improves-underwater-labs" rel="nofollow">improvements to existing features</a>, among other things.</p>




<p>Sadly, you're a little late to check out&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>as part of the Steam Winter Sale, but you can still grab it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/Rust/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4415-CUSA14296_00-D11PROJECTRUST01" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/rust-console-edition/BRPVTJKWHBR7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a> (and current-gen machines via backwards compatibility).</p>

This, unfortunately, resulted in false bans, although NetEase failed to say how many.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We sincerely apologize for this situation and want to assure you that we do not and will not ban players who are playing fairly and without cheating,” NetEase said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer said it had made a list of affected players and lifted their bans. “We have identified the specific reasons behind these false bans and have compiled a list of affected players,” it said. “We have lifted these bans and want to express our heartfelt apologies for the inconvenience this has caused.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase went on to insist it is investing in improving its anti-cheat, and called on players to report cheaters if they encounter them. Here’s the rest of the statement in full:</p><blockquote>Our mission is to provide all players with a fair, just, and enjoyable gaming environment. Therefore, preventing and identifying cheaters is one of our top priorities. We have invested significant manpower and resources to improve the speed and accuracy of our detection systems. With any ongoing detection system, there is always room for improvement. We appreciate your assistance in helping us tackle this challenge. If you encounter any cheating behavior, please report it immediately; our reporting system will respond promptly. If you believe you have been wrongly banned, you can appeal to our customer support team, and we will review your case and respond in a timely manner.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-fps-selaco-hits-100k-sales-four-times-its-original-goal.1073259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/selaco-sales-100k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Altered Orbit Studios has announced that ambitious FPS&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>has already crossed a major sales milestone that represents a fourfold increase on the studio's original goal for the game.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873018637603201" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media platform X</a>, Altered Orbit reveals that&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>has sold 100,000 copies, a figure the studio says it "never expected to reach", especially during the Early Access period (which began back in May this year).</p>

<p>Altered Orbit <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873021556736150" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">follows up</a> by saying that its original intention was to sell 25,000 copies of&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>in the game's first twelve months on release, but that "somehow", this figure was quadrupled in "just half the time".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-sales-100k.jpg?itok=2Inn0I7B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-sales-100k.jpg?itok=-37znJFg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Selaco</em>'s mixture of retro nostalgia and ambitious thinking has resulted in a very respectable sales milestone within its first six months or so on sale.</figcaption></figure><p>The developer says that it decided to go publisher-free and place all its faith "in the game itself", as well as "the community to help spread the word", and it looks like those strategies worked.</p>

<p>Still, Altered Orbit <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873023557480935" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">does acknowledge</a> that others played a role in&nbsp;<em>Selaco</em>'s success too. Specifically, the studio thanks New Blood's Dave Oshry for doing "more for us than I could fit in an entire Twitter thread", as well as "other developers" who are "always ready to offer help and see their peers succeed". Aww.</p>

<p>Amusingly, Altered Orbit closes its thank-you statements by <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873025470107948" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggesting</a> that players only bought&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>to play its "Burger Flipper" minigame. If that minigame isn't significantly expanded in the full release, I expect boycotts.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Selaco</em>, it's a throwback first-person shooter that promises to offer "thrilling action set pieces, destructibility, smart enemies, and a fleshed-out story" within what Altered Orbit calls an "immersive game world".</p>




<p>The game owes a debt to the likes of&nbsp;<em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/genre-advancing-shooters-half-life" rel="nofollow">genre-advancing classics like <i>Half-Life</i></a>, and more recent titles like&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>for its action set pieces. That's a pretty heavy cross of influences to bear.</p>

<p>If you're interested, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and if you're still not convinced, perhaps our very own Austin's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/selaco-sets-new-standard-for-fps-genre" rel="nofollow">glowing preview</a> will do the trick.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> studio Arrowhead has shared a number of former pitches, including a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox">Star Fox</a>-style game based within the Helldivers universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/pilestedt/status/1874226763913715938">In a New Year's post on X</a>, Arrowhead CCO and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> creative director, Johan Pilestedt, asked players to share their "expectations and desires for what the next Arrowhead game will be", hinting that he was "working on the high concept" to the studio's next release.</p>

<p>Responding to comments from the community, Pilestedt then opened up about a number of "high concept" pitches previously considered, including the Star Fox-esque game tentatively called "Eagles of Democracy".</p>
<p>"We made a prototype in unreal," Pilestedt <a href="https://x.com/Yurka_Shaman/status/1874267225554903448">added</a>. "It would basically try to capture Starfox. So arcade... but still simulated.</p>
<p>"The title was 'Eagles of Democracy'."</p>

<p>Pilestedt also shared that the team had previously worked on a concept for a top-down reimagining of the 1990 arcade game, Smash TV, too:</p>

</p></div>

<p>"Smash TV is a top-down reimagining of the classic arcade game of 1990," the pitch began which was reportedly written around 12 years ago. "The game pits up to four contestants in a violent game show set in the distant future of 1999. The game focuses on the source inspiration for Smash TV to create a game filled with brutal action, death traps, and gladiator-inspired game shows.</p>
<p>"The game plays homage to 80s action movies such as The Running Man, Total Recall, RoboCop, and Escape from New York, tying everything together with cheesy music, 'cool' visual effects and over-the-top storytelling."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developers-respond-to-criticism-of-killzone-2-crossover-cost">Arrowhead recently responded to criticism from players of the high cost of its Killzone 2 crossover</a>, eventually deciding to gift all players the planned second set of the collaboration items for free.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eternal-strands-demo-coming-one-week-before-release.1073247/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-demo-coming-one-week-before-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Canadian developer Yellow Brick Games <a href="https://x.com/YellowBrick_Qc/status/1874832372568666282" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that a free demo for its debut title, Eternal Strands, will be released on January 21, one week before the full game's launch. The demo's content has not been revealed yet, nor do we know if progress will carry over to the full game once purchased.</p>
<p>Eternal Strands is the new game by <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-mike-laidlaw-new-studio-yellow-brick-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Dragon Age lead Mike Laidlaw</a>. After leaving BioWare, Laidlaw worked on an unannounced Arthurian-inspired roleplaying game at Ubisoft, but that project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ex-chief-creative-officer-canceled-an-arthurian-rpg-from-dragon-age-designer-mike-laidlaw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a>. Afterward, Laidlaw founded Yellow Brick Games to make this intriguing fantasy third-person action/adventure title.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, Francesco and I were able to play a short but impressive demo that showcased the game's emphasis on physics. Here's an excerpt from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gamescom-hands-on-preview-magical-mayhem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a>:</p>
<p><em>What truly makes Eternal Strands stand out is the well-realized magic system. Every spell, from the simplest elemental shots to the more complex gravity-based ones, interacts not only with the environment and the enemies but also with one another. One gravity spell, for example, can propel Brynn forward and up in the air, but it can also be used to push enemies into chasms or to extend the range of elemental shots. In other cases, another spell can make other spells whose effects go off after a short while activate instantly.</em></p>
<p>The story follows Brynn, a young magical weaver and treasure hunter, as she seeks&nbsp;to unravel the secrets of the Enclave with the help of her companions. Long ago, the Enclave was a center of magical development, trade, innovation, and social life. But after arcane disasters spread across the Mayda region, it sealed itself off behind a magical wall known as the Veil. Now, it falls upon Brynn and her fellow weavers to unlock their secrets.</p>
<p>While there will be dialogue choices, despite Laidlaw's background, do not expect big moral choices leading to different endings. However, from what we've played, the action should be very fun. Eternal Strands is also expected to last a decent amount, between 25 and 35 hours, <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-qa-game-length-confirmed-between-25-and-35-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the studio</a>. More content is coming after the January 28 launch, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-launches-january-28-2025-post-launch-collab-with-square-enix-creative-studio-iii-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnership</a> with Square Enix’s Creative Studio III Lead Artist Yusuke Mogi (known for FINAL FANTASY XIV Online) to design a new Epic creature, weapons, and armor set. The system requirements for Eternal Strands are listed below; the game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Game Pass subscribers will get it on day one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Minimum</em></strong><br>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-platformer-antonblast-is-already-profitable-developer-says.1073244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antonblast-already-profitable<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>developer Summitsphere has announced that the game has already recouped all of its costs related to development, marketing, and production, officially making it a profitable endeavor less than a month after release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tonycomputerentertainment.com/post/3lesqbhu4ys2y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on social media platform Bluesky</a>, Summitsphere's Tony Grayson reveals the happy news and says it "looks like Summitsphere is going to be making a lot more games for a lot longer", thanking&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>players for their support.</p>

<p>Just in case you aren't familiar with&nbsp;<em>Antonblast</em>, it's a 2D "explosive action platformer" with a visual style that owes a heavy debt to&nbsp;<em>Wario Land</em>. You can think of it as a cousin to&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pizza Tower</em></a>, although the two are developed by different studios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/antonblast-profitable-boss.jpg?itok=M1d8LByN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/antonblast-profitable-boss.jpg?itok=KTiKLFyv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Antonblast</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Wario</em>-style shenanigans are already profitable, developer Summitsphere says.</figcaption></figure><p>Playing as either the titular Anton or his "cranked-out coworker Annie", you must do battle with Satan in order to retrieve Anton's prized collection of spirits.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll explore "bizarre worlds", battle "screen-filling bosses", and experiment with what Summitsphere calls a "totally dynamic playstyle" that allows you either to rush through stages at speed or explore them at your leisure.</p>

<p>All of this is wrapped up in what the developer calls an "urban graffiti-inspired art style", which is certainly true, although it's also quite clearly a&nbsp;<em>Wario Land</em>-inspired art style as well (no shade; I love that art style).</p>

<p>Screenshots don't quite do&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>justice, so check out the trailer below to see what the game looks like in motion.</p>




<p>A game like&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>achieving profitability in just under a month is no mean feat. It's not quite&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>becoming profitable <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">just a few days after its launch</a>, but hey, maybe Summitsphere's next game will achieve that lofty goal.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1887400/ANTONBLAST/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/antonblast-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. There's no word yet on whether the game is coming to other consoles, but given that it's already profitable, I wouldn't be surprised if it did.</p>

		<p>As we get back up to speed in 2025, our first What We Played of the year is more about 2024 and all the holiday gaming we snuck in over the past fortnight. Visiting family for Christmas meant I didn’t have the big consoles to play on, but that just meant I got completely hooked on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/19/game-of-the-year-2024-best-independent/">Balatro</a> for about a week. I clearly wasn’t the best boy in 2024, because Santa gave me the flu for Christmas, and along with the tail end of the NFL season, Retro Bowl was the perfect minimal thought game. I’ve now taken the Seahawks on a three-peat and am looking to right the wrongs of Atlanta Falcons history in my current season.</p>
<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> holiday gaming has included a review of Threefold Recital and some more of The Witcher 3. There was also some more Football Manager 24, where he’s mounting a title challenge with Valencia and into the knockouts of the Champions League.</p>

<p><strong>Steve’s</strong> now on the hunt for a new headset, but that hasn’t stopped him from playing a bunch of games over the past couple weeks. He finished off the excellent Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, completing all of the side quests and achievements, and has moved on to Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, “which is great but feels a lot less expansive than the first one as most action taking place in the one big open world planet so far.” He’s also finished 9 Sols, though this did mean dropping the difficulty down about two thirds of the way through.</p>
<p>While he’s got Cuisineer and Behemoth on the go for review, <strong>Gamoc’s</strong> Christmas &amp; New Year gaming has also included Black Ops 6 and started Dragon Age The Veilguard – “The latter is as magenta as it gets, but still seems good. The former is, indeed, a Call of Duty game.”</p>


<p>It was a very Bohemian Christmas for <strong>Jim</strong>, who’s continued on his playthrough of Kingdom Come: Deliverance. He did a bunch of errands and local mysteries, and has found that everything from eating food, to maintaining Henry’s gear and sparring with a weapons trainer is a bit of a time sink, but he’s enjoying it and is now pushing on with the main quest because he knows there’s a lot of new games coming soon!</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> played Skull &amp; Bones and….. he didn’t like it – “It looks and plays like someone knock off studio tried to make Black Flag, I really couldn’t believe a full priced game could look that ugly in 2024.” So he tried to have a better time with some Transformers: Galactic Trials, but this part racing game and part shooter “should live up to it’s name and be put on trial, sentenced and thrown in to a pit of Sharkticons. […] By far the worse game I have played in 2024 and thankfully, the last one.”</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> bought Animal Crossing New Horizons for his wife and they’ve been playing it together. “It’s not my usual speed of game, but it’s really cute and a nice thing to do together,” he said, though he’s no doubt a bit befuddled why they’re catching all these bugs and fish and then not turning them into armour.</p>
<p>Rounding us out, <strong>Reuben’s</strong> absolutely hooked on Marvel Rivals and is foaming at the mouth for Season 1 to start, and <strong>Dom’s</strong> basically just found time for some Overwatch 2, Snow Bros. Wonderland and Songs of Silence.</p>
<p>Now then, what did you play over the holidays?</p>

			<p><span>A new&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-mind-blowing-8k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto V mod</a> released this week introduces an extremely accurate recreation of GTA IV's Liberty City, complete with all the elements that make it feel like a living, breathing city.</span></p>
<p>The Liberty City Preservation Project isn't the first modding project that attempts to recreate Liberty City in the latest main entry in the series, but it's definitely the most accomplished, as the recreated map features NPCs, vehicles, and sound effects from the original game. In addition, the recreated city also features a fully functional subway system, map, radar, and radio stations. As if all this wasn't enough, the mod also supports an HD texture pack that improves the visual quality of the map and makes it almost feel like the proper Grand Theft Auto IV remaster that has yet to be released. You can check out the mod in action in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Liberty City Preservation Project - Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Ot_iuEb-ok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first release of the Grand Theft Auto V Liberty City Preservation Project is only the beginning for the development team. As revealed in a fresh interview posted on <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/how-world-travel-created-the-liberty-city-preservation-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockstar Intel</a>, the team is looking to restore the majority of the interiors to be identical to those in GTA IV, destructible props, and completely redo the entire maps vertex paintings to make them look even better in Grand Theft Auto V. Once the project is done, the team is also looking to start a similar one, so there may be some amazing recreations of older games' maps in the future.</p>
<p>The Grand Theft Auto V Liberty City Preservation Project mod can be downloaded from the modding project's official <a href="https://discord.gg/worldtravel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord server.</a></p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch helped the Japanese company to rebound spectacularly after the WiiU’s underwhelming tenure. The hybrid console has sold millions in hardware and software and is responsible for some of the highest-reviewed titles of all time. But I think it’s high time the Nintendo Switch 2 scoots its way into 2025.</p>



<p>I’ve always been a “PlayStation” guy, ever since I was a kid. I’ve had the odd Game Boy and DS, but they were fleeting and flirtatious moments—outside of excessive Pokémon&nbsp;binges. I missed out on Metroid, the best Mario games, Zelda, etc, you name it. This all changed the day I decided to invest in a Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>As a proud Switch owner, I’ve spent the last few years catching up, and I think the Nintendo Switch is a monstrous marvel. However, it feels like it’s outstayed its welcome—despite the addition of the OLED line—and I want something new to play with.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-nintendo-switch-has-has-a-good-run">The Nintendo Switch Has Has a Good Run</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Simple and superb. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s get the obvious downer out of the way—<strong>the Nintendo Switch isn’t very powerful and never has been</strong>. This hasn’t been much of a problem for its colorful and cartoony, first-party titles though. Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 3, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-super-mario-mario-kart-sets-announced-for-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart</a> 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-super-smash-bros-stages-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> have sold a couple of hundred million copies between them, and they aren’t games designed to stretch a console to its limit—<em>maybe</em> for the Switch.</p>



<p>The optimized performance and sheer smoothness of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom feel like a minor miracle. But most games can’t hit 60 FPS, and performance varies from title to title—even if the unit is docked. The Switch has reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-sells-over-146-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 146 million units</a>—apparently making it the third-best-selling console behind the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS—but consumers deserve the best.</p>



<p>I may come across as entitled, but after years of enjoying crispy 4K HDR, 60 FPS gameplay on my PlayStation 5, I want the same for the Switch. I didn’t want to do this, but Pokémon&nbsp;Scarlet and Violet was the final straw. What should’ve been Game Freak’s magnum opus, turned into a performance PR nightmare. I bought Pokémon&nbsp;Scarlet on day one, and it doesn’t matter how many times Sprigatito bats its precious eyelids at me, I can’t ignore the ugliness of Scarlet and Violet’s choppy frame rate, endless bugs, and lackluster performance across the board.</p>



<p>Nintendo’s array of exclusives is second to none. This is highlighted by the returning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announced-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> in 2025, and a new 3D Mario would benefit massively from a Switch 2. First-party content isn’t an issue for Nintendo and never has been. However, one of Nintendo’s biggest problems could be solved by a Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-third-party-isn-t-bouncing-enough">Nintendo’s Third Party Isn’t Bouncing Enough</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I count two pixels here. Credit to IGN’s Mortal Kombat 1 For Switch Review.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When you have exclusives selling like hotcakes, I get third-party isn’t much of a concern. I do find it puzzling Nintendo is happy to overlook this segment of the market though. Many third-party titles never see the light of day on Switch, and this is presumably due to technical limitations.</p>



<p>Those that do release have to make serious reductions. Take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-switch-hate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat 1 on Switch</a> and the image of Johnny Cage above. 2023’s fighter is an unbelievable beat ’em up on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with some of the most lifelike graphics and rapid response times. Its Switch port is a shell of its next-gen contemporaries with laughably long load times, blurry graphics, and a huge reduction in textures and performance.</p>



<p>On the other hand, bigger open-world titles don’t perform too badly on Switch. Hogwarts Legacy is still quite rough around the edges but manages to hold up, and The Witcher 3 miraculously plays well—again, at the expense of huge graphical and performance-related downgrades. It’s less a case of “if it can,” and more “should it?” It earns Nintendo more money, but these are titles deserving to be experienced as they were intended.</p>



<p>If the Nintendo Switch 2 can improve its performance, even more consumers might favor the portability and dual accessibility of the Switch 2 over a PlayStation or Xbox. More sales mean revenue and happier shareholders. The next console is rumored to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced before April 2025</a>—possibly to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-releasing-march-2025-rumor-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in March 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Providing Nintendo nails it, the long-awaited follow-up could eclipse its younger sibling, and eventually become the top-selling Nintendo hardware in history.</p>



<hr>



<p>The Nintendo Switch’s run is one of the most successful and prolific in gaming history. But are you ready to see what Nintendo has in store with the Switch 2? Which potential titles and franchises would benefit the most?</p>

            <p>If you, like me, rather enjoyed The Rise of the Golden Idol - a game we called "a compelling modern mystery thriller that's bigger, better and more ambitious than its already brilliant predecessor" - then this news may be right up your alley.</p>
<p>Will Ackermann, one of The Rise of the Golden Idol's game designers, has today unveiled his next game: City of Voices. He's working on it in collaboration with pixel artist Matt Frith through his own studio Kini Games.</p>
<p>Described as a "Golden Idol-like" release, City of Voices takes place in suburban England, and focuses on a young girl who on her first day at secondary school gets bullied. If that wasn't enough to deal with, she is soon "thrust into a fantastical adventure", putting even more on her plate.</p>

<p>Like the Golden Idol games, City of Voices will similarly challenge players to "investigate a series of moments frozen in time, examining clues and solving deduction puzzles to uncover a rich story". However, in a change from the Golden Idol games, players will instead need to answer questions by choosing from a selection of images (see below), rather than dragging and dropping words into place.</p>
<p>If this sounds like City of Voices is still treading <em>a little too closely</em> to the Golden Idol formula, don't worry. Ackermann made sure he got the blessing from their creators before cracking on with his own game.</p>
<p>"I was quite nervous about asking Andrejs and Ernests, who co-created those games, for permission to essentially steal their mechanics," Ackermann admitted, "but luckily, they were flattered!"</p>
<p>Frith added: "Since then, they've both been really supportive, and have even said they 'loved every minute of the demo' we've made, which means so much to us. We hope other players will feel the same way."</p>
<p>There isn't currently a release date for City of Voices, but it is available to wishlist now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3342470/City_of_Voices/">Steam</a>. You can check out a trailer for it above.</p>

<p>As for The Rise of the Golden Idol, we awarded it four out of five stars on its release.</p>
<p>"This is a brilliantly plotted thriller story stuffed with an enormous cast of memorable scoundrels, buffoons and quietly tragic onlookers, and it's all backed up by wonderfully devised puzzles that really give your brain a good runaround before you're able to prise open its hard-won secrets," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review">Eurogamer's Rise of the Golden Idol review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
