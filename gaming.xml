            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse has revealed the release date for Version Luna II, the gacha action RPG's next major update, and it's arriving later this month.</p>

<p>Version Luna II continues the new naming conventions established for the game with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-luna-i" rel="nofollow">September's Version Luna I</a>, and it's set to land on October 22nd. You can expect the advent of the new user-generated content system, plus a new character and much more.</p>

<p>As teased during Version Luna I's cycle, the Miliastra Wonderland, which serves as&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s UGC hub, will make its debut in this new update. That means "hundreds of Stages that encourage creativity and exploration", according to HoYoverse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-ii-nefer.jpg?itok=_3su92lj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-ii-nefer.jpg?itok=Zmzjtfi3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nefer is your new playable character in the latest&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update.</figcaption></figure><p>The Miliastra Wonderland will allow you either to experience other players' creations or to make your own as a Craftsperson, utilizing the built-in editing tool to create whatever&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>experience your mind can conjure up.</p>

<p>If you're not into the whole user-generated content stuff, though, don't worry; there's still plenty of classic&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>for you to enjoy in Version Luna II, including a new Archon Quest that will see the return of "many old friends".</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a new playable character in the form of Nefer, a Dendro catalyst user who utilizes her diverse toolkit to empower her Charged Attacks and deal extra damage to enemies on the field.</p>

<p>Nefer will appear as part of this update's first half, alongside a rerun of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-furina-gameplay-video" rel="nofollow">Furina</a>, and you can expect repeats of Arlecchino and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zhongli-conducts-in-lovely-genshin-impact-anime-style-trailer-teasing-upcoming-concert" rel="nofollow">Zhongli</a> during Version Luna II's second half, so if you missed them the first time around, now's your chance to re-add them to your team.</p>




<p>News of the latest&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update comes after the announcement of two brand new HoYoverse games, namely <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim" rel="nofollow">cutesy cosmic life sim&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim" rel="nofollow">Petit Planet</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">creature-collecting auto-chess game&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Genshin Impact</em>'s Version Luna II update launches on October 22nd. The game is available to <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">play for free</a> right now on PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices, but bear in mind that support for the PS4 version <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">is ending next year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Greenheart Games has finally announced the&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, so it looks like the game is about to see the light of day after eleven (!) years of development.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>will be launching into Early Access on PC on November 3rd. The game was originally slated to hit Early Access last year, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tavern-keeper-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed to 2025 to iron out bugs</a>.</p>

<p>If you've yet to try out&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>'s demo, you can also take a look at an updated demo right now. It lets you loose on a chunk of the game's "interactive storytelling", according to Greenheart Games, as well as giving you a look at the Item Workshop and Freeplay features.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tavern-keeper-early-access-release-date-pub.jpg?itok=syvNDwv5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tavern-keeper-early-access-release-date-pub.jpg?itok=DQm473X3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date is almost upon us.</figcaption></figure><p>Greenheart director and co-founder Patrick Klug says his studio is finally "ready to open the doors" to&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>following eleven years of development, and that he's "thrilled" the game is finally about to let players experience its cozy atmosphere and management gameplay.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>, well, it's one of those games for which the name rather says it all. Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greenheart-games-announces-tavern-keeper" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2016</a>, it's a tavern management sim that lets you run your very own inn "in a humorous fantasy world".</p>

<p>You can decide whether you want to delve deep into the game's management systems or "simply relax and decorate" to your heart's content, and you'll also experience a story unfolding within the walls of your tavern.</p>

<p>To commemorate the release date announcement, Greenheart Games has also released a brand new trailer that should give you a sense of what you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. You can check that trailer out right here.</p>






<p><em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC via Steam Early Access on November 3rd. There's no word on other platforms yet, so stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>When you read this, the Chicago Cubs will have either tied up their series with the Milwaukee Brewers or start turning the page to a strange offseason.</em></p><p><em>Expectations for the Cubs weren't great to start the season. Then, right as things kick off, their best pitcher—one of the best in baseball—goes out for the season. What exactly is the point of watching, then? Well, because anything can happen.</em></p><p><em>Anything and everything did happen for the Cubs, too. They were, at one point, the best team in baseball. It both was, and wasn't, a mirage. Where they've ended up—fighting to advance in the playoff, struggling on offense, rotating through pitchers too quickly because they can't keep up—is where I expected them to be, really.</em></p><p><em>And yet, there's one at least more goddamn game. What's better than that? There's a little bit of "anything can happen" with the NFL right now, too, which Rob and Patrick spent trying to figure out. </em></p><p><em>Or, well, not figure out.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob</strong>: Patrick, I’m not sure I know what to do with myself in a world where the Chiefs and the Ravens have become mediocre teams and the Jaguars are suddenly decent.</p><p>I’ve found this season of football more disorienting than most, in part because it’s highlighting how much I’ve relied on teams’ reputation to frame my expectations and understanding of the league as a whole. For <em>years </em>I’ve been able to half-follow the regular season knowing that there were a couple teams who would probably be making it to a conference championship game or at the very least would be a tough divisional round opponent. Likewise, there were teams I just didn't need to think about. The Jags? A punch-line on <em>The Good Place </em>and personified by a Football Fabio underperforming expectations every season. The Steelers? Almost religiously average, a team built to clear the bar of a .500 record and no more. Whatever happens, Mahomes will pull out the necessary wins. The Ravens will be excellent. The Bills will look unstoppable at times. The NFC would continue to exist, its fate mostly dependent on whether it was a “bones” or “no bones” year for the Eagles.</p><p>In my head, the Chiefs dynasty is still young and Mahomes, Jackson, and Allen are cutting-edge quarterbacks, not guys approaching the end of their first decade as starters. Likewise, I’ve <em>never </em>had to think about perpetual losers like the Jaguars. I only have one space in my heart for a team like that, and it’s filled by the Bears.</p><p>And I think what I’m realizing is I <em>liked </em>being able to just delete a half dozen of the NFL’s 32 teams from my consciousness entirely, and place another three or four of those teams on a shelf labeled “Save for the Playoffs”. This year, however, I feel like I’m following a Bizarro World NFL where the uniforms are all the same (except for those godawful Rivalry jerseys) but everything else is different or opposite to how I remember it. Now, to know what is going on in the NFL I need to <em>watch more games </em>and read about <em>all </em>the teams? And worst of all, apparently I need to discard prior knowledge and expectations and internalize <em>new </em>information? This is awful.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@aussiedave?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Dave Adamson</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I’d say the rapidly changing landscape of the current NFL season would be a reason to inspire hope in what the Bears could accomplish, but we’re writing this less than a week away from the team being forced to head back to Washington to traumatically re-live the moment that broke them last year!</p><p>Did the Jaguars win that game or did the Chiefs toss it away? Are the Bills showing weakness or did the Patriots simply take advantage of a misstep game? Are the Ravens actually bad or do they have the worst injury luck in football? Some of what makes football magical is that it doesn’t fucking matter! You have to prove competence over and over and over again in sports like basketball and baseball, which itself is part of what makes <em>those </em>sports statistically delightful over the course of a long season. But one of the reasons football is my preferred sport is specifically because it’s hard to tell if a mirage is a mirage, but at the end of the day, a win is a win and losing a single game in the NFL can be hard to come back from.</p><p>Do you think Jaguars fans give a shit if what’s playing out is real? I sure as hell didn’t in 2018, when the Bears put together their best season since 2005. I lapped up every strange victory, every defensive touchdown, because it was my one shot at feeling joy and hope—feelings <em>we</em> do not have very often.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over 250 developers at <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108"><em>MindsEye</em> maker</a> Build A Rocket Boy were laid off earlier this year following the AAA open world shooter’s disastrous launch. Over 90 current and former staff have now signed an open letter blasting the studio’s management, including founder and former long-time <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-gta-leslie-benzies-ioi-hitman-everywhere-mmo-1851673924"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em>&nbsp;producer Leslie Benzies</a>, over what they claim were poor working conditions and a chaotic layoff process that allegedly broke the law. “The arrogance of leadership to believe they can act with impunity throughout development and the following redundancies has pushed myself and many former and continuing employees to take a stand,” ex-employee Ben Newbon wrote in a statement.</p> <p>Published by<em> Hitman</em> maker IO Interactive, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-steam-reviews-bugs-glitches-update-refunds-1851784312"><em>MindsEye</em> launched in early June</a> and was immediately met by harsh criticism from players, streamers, and reviewers. It was pitched as the first building block in the well-funded studio’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-gta-leslie-benzies-ugc-roblox-minecraft-1851783117">ambitious user-generated metaverse MMO</a> called <em>Everything</em>. In reality, it was hard to see it being the start of anything but painful cuts for the new startup studio with offices dotted around Europe. Mass layoffs, first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">reported by IGN</a>, immediately followed. According to the open letter, organized by Britain’s IWGB Union trade group, over 250 developers at the company were eventually swept up into its hasty and chaotic layoff process despite having been allegedly forced to work mandatory overtime in the four months leading up to launch.</p>

 <p>“This week, members of the Game Workers Branch of the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB) union are filing multiple legal actions against BARB, claiming failure to carry out fair consultation ahead of redundancies as well as multiple cases of unfair dismissal,” the trade group announced on October 10. “In an open letter&nbsp;to BARB leadership, employees describe a record of&nbsp;systemic mistreatment, mismanagement, and mishandling of the redundancy process.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We stand in solidarity with employees and ex-employees at Build a Rocket Boy as they file legal claims through our union and publish an open letter, condemning the way in which they’ve been mistreated and discarded by the studio’s millionaire executives. <a href="https://t.co/WWm4vxKEfd">https://t.co/WWm4vxKEfd</a> <a href="https://t.co/bOOHaQEakQ">pic.twitter.com/bOOHaQEakQ</a></p> <p>— IWGB Game Workers (@IWGB_GW) <a href="https://twitter.com/IWGB_GW/status/1976622237848658253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Concerns outlined in the letter include poor transparency and communication, extended crunch, and a “disastrous” handling of the layoff process. The current and former developers who signed it are calling for a public apology, the option for staff who haven’t hit their layoff date to take payment for it without working, a promise to use professional partners outside the studio for any future layoffs, and a “documented effort” to improve working conditions, including acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union for the studio.</p>

 <p>“Many fantastic, hard-working developers have felt used and discarded, while public statements of care have not matched the reality of working conditions,” <em>MindsEye</em> audio engineer Isaac Hudd said in a statement. “A pattern of poor decisions from senior management has led to a disappointing launch and ongoing challenges for both players and employees.”</p>

 <p>Despite a concerning swirl of exiting executives and broken promises at launch,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-devs-uk-workforce-of-around-300-receive-at-risk-emails-as-former-gta-lead-leslie-benzies-finally-addresses-staff"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> over the summer that <em>MindsEye</em> director Benzies, who worked on <em>GTA</em> at Rockstar Games for over a decade, blamed the studio’s troubles on internal and external saboteurs hoping for Build a Rocket Boy’s failure. “The callousness shown by management towards staff at Build A Rocket Boy is truly awful,” Ben Newborn, former lead games analyst at the studio, said in a statement. “Even before the disastrous launch of<em> MindsEye</em>, staff had suffered months of crunch, resulting in some horrific mental and even physical illnesses, beyond the typical widespread burnout.”</p> <p>He continued, “Studio leadership have chosen not to take responsibility for the game’s failure and instead blamed saboteurs, as if individual employees or online influencers could have caused this.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PS6 To Release In 2027, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps6-to-release-in-2027-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1321765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release of the PlayStation 6 (PS6) is only two years away. That, according to a known gaming hardware leaker.</p>



<p>After a recent video featuring PlayStation’s Mark Cerny and AMD’s Jack Huynh was posted, discussing the future of technology between the two parties, questions began to mount about when the next PlayStation console would be released. On the discussion forum <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/from-project-amethyst-to-the-future-of-play-amd-and-sony-interactive-entertainment%E2%80%99s-shared-vision.1688947/page-4#post-270885018">NeoGAF</a>, a user mentioned 2027 being “on the table” for the new system. That led to KeplerL2, who’s been accurate with hardware information in the past, to chime in.</p>



<p><strong>“Not just on the table,”</strong> they said, <strong>“it’s the plan unless any unexpected delays happen.”</strong></p>



<p>A 2027 release date shouldn’t surprise too many people. Rumors have long suggested that Sony’s next-gen console is expected in either late 2027 or early 2028. As far as what to expect from the system, there have been claims that Sony is planning to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-console-and-new-ps6-handheld-canis-specs-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release a standard</a> PS6 along <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-handheld-console-will-be-dockable-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a dockable</a> PS6 handheld. </p>



<p>Rumored specs for the PS6 include 40-48 RDNA 5 compute units, 160W TBP, 8 x Zen 6 Cores, a 160- or 192-bit memory bus, and backwards compatibility with PS5 and PS4 games, among others.</p>



<p>As with any claim like this, please take the information with a grain of salt until Insider Gaming can independently verify the plans or Sony confirms them itself.</p>



<p>Do you believe the release of the PS6 will happen sometime in 2027, or will it be later? Leave your thoughts down in the comments below, and&nbsp;join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Green letters</strong> are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>

The game tasks players with guessing a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

Following the previous Archon Quest, players will continue to face the threat posed by the “Racher of Solnari,” Rerir. However, the unyielding Grand Master Varka will finally make an appearance to lend a hand. At the same time, unexpected allies including “The Knave,” and “The Marionette” from the Fatui Harbingers will also join the fight. Under the guidance of The Damselette, Nefer from the Curatorium of Secrets will provide further intel on Rerir, possibly uncovering his obsessions and unveiling new ways to confront him. The players’ fierce battle with Rerir will yield rewards, as they can claim an extra 560 Primogems upon completing the Archon Quest in Version “Luna II.”</p><p>Nefer becomes playable as a 5-star Dendro catalyst wielder, introducing new ways to unleash Lunar-Bloom damage. She can harness Verdant Dew to trigger powerful Lunar-Bloom damage. By using her Elemental Skill, she can absorb Verdant Dew, transforming her Charged Attacks into special Charged Attacks that consume no Stamina and deal Lunar-Bloom damage. Additionally, once the party enters Ascendant Gleam state, Nefer can convert Dendro Cores on the field into Seeds of Deceit, which can be used to further enhance the damage of her special Charged Attacks. What’s more, as the head of the Curatorium of Secrets, she possesses an uncanny ability to sense when even the most unassuming people are hiding something. Players can trade all the intel she collects at the Adventurers’ Guild in exchange for access to fun side stories.</p><p>In the first half of Version “Luna II,” Event Wishes feature Nefer alongside the rerun of Furina, while the second half brings back both Arlecchino and Zhongli.</p><p>The adventures continue in various events and activities, offering an abundance of rewards. Players can assist The Damselette with Commissions in exchange for rewards, including the Ascendant Gleam state and exclusive namecards. In addition, by uncovering new secrets in the Seasonal Event in Sumeru, players can get Primogem rewards and invite Collei to join their party for free.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,590 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,075 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,426 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,501 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

			<p>The Xbox next-generation system is reportedly targeting a 2027 launch window, according to a new rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>The rumor originates from a new video shared by Moore's Law is Dead on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">YouTube</a>, whose track record regarding console rumors has been solid with <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/">on-point leaks for the PlayStation 5 Pro and the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a>. According to the YouTuber, multiple unspecified sources have revealed that Microsoft is talking openly about the 2027 release window with partners behind the scenes, with reports having become even more frequent since earlier leaks of the APU..</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-next-amd-magnus-apu-leaked-specifications">Xbox Next AMD Magnus APU Leaked Specifications</h2>



<p>Besides discussing the potential Xbox next-generation system release window, the new video by Moore's Law is Dead also discussed some of the specifications of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-codename-3nm-rdna-5-magnus-apu/">AMD Magnus APU</a> that will power the system, which you can find summarized below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Xbox Next (Magnus APU) Rumored Specs</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>APU ARCHITECTURE (Chiplet Design)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Total Die Size</td><td>408 mm² (Full Size)</td></tr><tr><td>Chiplet 1 (SOC)</td><td>144 mm² (CPU Core, Video Out, AI Engine)<br>Node: TSMC N3P (Node confirmed in alleged external documentation).</td></tr><tr><td>Chiplet 2 (GPU)</td><td>264 mm² (Shared with desktop Radeon products)<br>Node: TSMC N3C or N3P (Unconfirmed).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>GPU</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Compute Units (CUs)</td><td>68 RDNA5 CUs (Disabled from up to 70 CUs)</td></tr><tr><td>Shader Engines</td><td>4 Shader Engines (3 standard engines + 1 lopsided shared engine with either 8 or 16 CUs). Each engine has 2 Shader Arrays.</td></tr><tr><td>L2 Cache</td><td>At least 24 MB L2 Cache (5x the Xbox Series X)<br>*Note: Speculative, based on desktop Radeon products.*</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>CPU</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Core Architecture</td><td>Zen 6</td></tr><tr><td>Core Count</td><td>Up to 3 Zen 6 cores (Faster than the PS6 Orion cores) + 8 Zen 6c cores<br>Shared 12MB L3 cache<br>*Note: Final usable core count is unknown.*</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>MEMORY AND POWER</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Memory Bus</td><td>192-bit Memory Bus</td></tr><tr><td>Total RAM</td><td>Up to 48 GB of GDDR7 (Possible configurations: 24 GB, 36 GB, or 48 GB)</td></tr><tr><td>TDP (Estimation)</td><td>250W to 350W (60-70% more than the PS6).<br>*Speculation: reportedly still aiming for a traditional console form factor.*</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>NPU</strong></td></tr><tr><td>NPU Architecture</td><td>110 TOPS (at 6W) or 46 TOPS (at 1.2W)<br>*Note: Two power modes are likely for energy budgeting to meet Microsoft Copilot requirements.*</td></tr><tr><td>AI Performance (TOPS)</td><td>110 TOPS (at 6W) or 46 TOPS (at 1.2W)<br>*Note: Two power modes likely for energy budgeting to meet Microsoft Copilot requirements.*</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Unlike for the PlayStation 6 Orion APU, Moore's Law is Dead doesn't know the final clock targets for the CPU and GPU of the Xbox next-generation system, so it's impossible to make a solid performance comparison between the two systems. </p>



<p>Even in the most extreme scenario of a 350W TDP, GPU clocking above 3GHz, and some CPU cores above 6GHz, the Xbox Next is expected to be no more than a third faster than the PlayStation 6. Considering Microsoft did lower the expected clock speeds of the Xbox Series X, the same could happen for the Xbox next-generation system, especially if the company is going for the expected power target of a console.</p>



<p>As such, on average, the Xbox next-generation system should be expected to offer the premium version of the performance the PlayStation 6 will offer, according to Moore's Law is Dead. If a game delivers 4K@120 FPS with ray tracing on the PS6, it will likely deliver 4K@144 FPS on the Xbox next-generation system. This is a small difference that will probably go unnoticed by anyone who isn't a PC-focused gamer playing on a high-refresh monitor looking for the very best.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As Moore's Law is Dead, the track record is not perfect, we have to take everything with a grain of salt until Microsoft announces the Xbox next generation system <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ceo-were-designing-a-full-roadmap-of-gaming-chips-for-xbox/">in much better detail than they have in the past</a>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/">With both systems reportedly targeting a 2027 release window</a>, the next console generation is fast approaching.</p>

            <p>Right, it's that time again. Get ready to slide back down the ladder of powerfulness, because mandatory wipeage is required to stick everyone back on the same trajectory ahead of [insert new thing here]. No, say the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>. They will not bow before the mandatory wipe gods at this time, instead trying out a voluntary wipe system dubbed Projects.</p>
<p>Yep, rather than leaning on the same unavoidable resets which plenty of extraction shooters and survival games employ to ensure newbies aren't always guaranteed to run into folks with more levels someone playing a platformer in a regularly-stopping elevator to the sun, Embark Studios plan to do their own thing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides. Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities, Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins wrote in a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/">blog post</a> about wipes of the non-moist tissue variety.</p>
<p>"However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall. So, as we have done with several other mechanics, before mimicking other established mechanics, we’d like to try our own method."</p><p>That method revolves around Projects, with the first one being dubbed the Expedition Project and unlocking upon hitting level 20. Once you complete it, you'll be given the option of a voluntary reset. The project'll run on a rotation lasting roughly eight weeks, and if you don't manage to complete it within that time, your progress towards doing so will roll over into the next eight week window. Embark say there's a "somewhat large time investment" involved to complete the project, so this move aims to ensure folks who don't have time to play as often aren't facing constant resets.</p>
<p>The likes of levels, skills, items/inventory, workshop, and crafting capabilities will be wiped when you reset, while you'll keep the likes of cosmetics, awards, achievements, and rankings, with Embark making clear anything paid for with real money lands in the latter category. As such, the rewards for taking the rest bullet will be stuff like "permanent account unlocks", unique cosmetics to show off, and buffs to your account for the next Expedition Project window. The studio also teased the idea of other sorts of projects with different rewards being introduced down the line.</p>
<p>Whether this'll prove an ideal or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-was-delayed-so-much-because-of-a-surprisingly-simple-reason-not-even-its-devs-thought-it-was-fun">fun</a> approach remains to be seen, and Embark look to be hedging their bets. "It’s not a silver bullet, and won’t achieve the clean break that a mandatory global reset does, but it does aim to be more equitable to all players," Watkins wrote. "Wherever possible, we want to value your time spent in the game as much as you do. Of course, this is a complex topic, so we’ll be keeping an eye on the discussion around this message and [will] follow up as necessary."</p>
<p>Personally, I hope it results in folks chanting 'wipe, wipe, wipe' over voice chat whenever foe deemed too powerful approaches, inflicting a form of peer pressure that happens to vaguely resemble someone trying to get over the final hurdle of toilet training a toddler.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Well, the week is nearly at its end and Prime Big Deals Days have come to pass. This was Amazon’s giant Fall sale stretching from October 7 to October 8 in which you could save buttloads on all sorts of cool products you didn’t know you wanted. Had you wished to pick something up this season, but time got away from you, the good news is you’re not out of luck just yet. Some consumer tech products are still on sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4688/">Take a gander at this GMKtec Mini PC. It’s usually priced at $240, but this week and still right now it’s come down to only $170. That’s a $70 savings representing 29% of the total price.</a></p>
<p>A quick dive into the specs — this GMKtec Mini PC is working with a 2025 Intel Twin Lake N150 processor with an integrated graphics card. It’s got 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage on its SSD. The two HDMI ports and DisplayPort will let you plug into up to three monitors at once.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4688/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What’s the Appeal of a Mini PC?</h2>
<p>If you’re not living in the biggest house or apartment, you’ve probably come to know that space is a hot commodity. This is especially true if you’re living with roommates or when living in an already expensive city. That small amount of space you have is precious and you may not be willing to give up a huge chunk of it to a massive PC tower. A mini PC on the other hand offers the versatility of a dedicated desktop PC while only taking up a fraction of the space.</p>



<p>Beyond that, you may find use in using a mini PC as a multimedia player. Tons of modern TVS may already have their built in smart features with apps like Netflix and Hulu, but there is still value in using a mini PC to power your home theater instead. These are full-on Windows devices, which means they can support a much wider range of formats than you are on a smart TV natively or via a streaming stick — especially for locally save files you’ve a acquired through 100% legal means.</p>
<p>On that note, a mini PC makes for an excellent PLEX server, allowing you to access your media files from anywhere. Plus they are great for turning into an emulation machine for retro games due to the low amount of processing power needed for ROMs. Again, just make sure they are games you already 100% legally own.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Shujinkou Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159509/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>In all the world, few things are as powerful as language. We use it to communicate all our hopes and fears and inner thoughts to each other. Words have a power all their own, which is why <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shujinkou">Shujinkou</a> struck me as such an interesting concept; a JRPG that aims to teach players the fundamentals of Japanese. While I applaud the ambition behind that lofty goal, the Switch port of Rice's dungeon-crawling-focused RPG held some technical missteps that keep it from truly shining.</p>
<p>Like many JRPG fans who don't speak Japanese, I’ve always had an ambition to learn. After two years of lessons, I could count myself as conversational; I was able to make my way around Japan on multiple trips without embarrassing myself, but couldn’t call myself anywhere near fluent. Shujinkou doesn’t seem like it is going to help anyone reach fluency — the lack of voice acting so you can hear the words and symbols you are learning prevents that — but the aim here is to hammer home the basics, and that is something the game does remarkably well.</p>
<figure><a title="Shujinkou Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159508/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat in Shujinkou centres around Japanese words. Creatures pop up at semi-random intervals and attack your party. You can fight them with your swords, but early on, you unlock the power of Kanakae Orbs, each of which contains a symbol from one of two Japanese syllabaries, hiragana and katakana. Each character can equip up to five of these Kanakae Orbs and choose one per turn to attack with. If the symbol you attack with is in the enemy’s name, you’ll do extra damage.</p>
<p>This is a fun mechanic, and it will help you learn the names of the animals you come across. The first dungeon, for example, is filled with cats (neko), dogs (inu), birds (tori), and demons (oni). Remembering the Japanese word for these common creatures is essential to getting through the many battles you’ll face in the game. The game also throws in some vocabulary in the menu and in dialogue, giving you the option to have a translation of certain words as they are dropped into conversation.</p>
<p>I will note that some of these translations are less helpful than others. While it is useful to know that 'chizu' means map, it is somewhat baffling that it offers a translation of 'shogun' as simply shogun or 'daimyo' as daimyo, with no effort to explain the English equivalent of those terms. It was a small detail that struck me as humorous, considering how much effort went into making the language lessons a core part of the gameplay.</p>
<figure><a title="Shujinkou Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159510/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Battles take place in dungeons scattered around the map. Fans of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/etrian_odyssey_origins_collection">Etrian Odyssey</a> series will immediately spot the influence here. While towns feel like something out of a point-and-click adventure like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/return_to_monkey_island">Monkey Island</a>, dungeons switch to a first-person perspective. A map is given and must be filled in as you travel through it, complete with one-way passages and doors. Most monsters appear randomly, with a symbol in the lower right corner giving you an indication of how likely you are to be attacked as you explore.</p>
<p>These battles can be difficult enough, with some deadly enemies coming out of nowhere, even in the first one, to deliver a devastating party wipe, but the real danger comes from the larger enemies that roam the map.</p>
<p>In Shujinkou, these are called Yaiuu, but Etrian Odyssey fans will recognise these as reskins of the iconic Field On Enemies (FOEs) from that series. They pursue you around the map and are significantly more powerful than the standard enemies you run into. When you first encounter them, you should avoid them at all costs, though you’ll probably want to grind in each dungeon until you can comfortably take them on. I spent a lot of time running through the dungeon, jumping back to town to heal and upgrade my equipment before setting off to try my luck again.</p>
<figure><a title="Shujinkou Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159505/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The combat in Shujinkou is better than the rest of it, unfortunately. The characters and scenery are all flat, standing there doing the gentle swaying that I usually associate with a Flash game. The graphics are simple, but they work during the also-simple cutscenes; where I struggled with them was in navigating through the towns. Because everything is 2D, towns become awkward to move around in. Trying to remember where anything is becomes a chore, especially in areas larger than the starting town.</p>
<p>The actual enemies look better, with an almost watercolour feel to them that fits with the world Shujinkou is building. Similarly, the music is very Japanese-inspired, with a high-pitched whistle at the start of combat that feels straight out of a samurai film. It is a little predictable but, again, it works within the world.</p>
<p>Some small questionable narrative choices — we’re expected to believe that Shu retired as a samurai at the age of 24, for example — are overshadowed by the unique combat system that centres language-learning without making it feel like an educational game.</p>
<figure><a title="Shujinkou Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159507/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>My biggest complaints from my time with Shujinkou are things that I expect are only present in the Switch port. The non-combat inputs aren’t intuitive, so I found myself opening the party menu when I meant to close the map constantly, and I would have given anything for a quick save feature. There are also long load times that are thankfully infrequent but still frustrating.</p>
<p>Language is at the heart of Shujinkou, but it is much more than an educational game. There is a solid, unique dungeon crawler in here, which is refreshing considering how underrepresented the genre has been in recent years. A unique combat system overshadows the basic art, counterintuitive controls, and frustrating town navigation.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>You won’t become fluent in Japanese by playing Shujinkou, but it will introduce the basics of both hiragana and katakana to you in a game that features the best bits of the Etrian Odyssey series in a very clever way. The combat system is solid enough that not even the counterintuitive menus could keep me from diving back in for more.</p></section>

              <p><em>War of the Worlds</em> will inevitably go down as 2025’s worst film, with its coveted <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/war-of-the-worlds-2025/">Metascore of 6</a> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/war_of_the_worlds_2025">Rotten Tomato rating of 4</a>. But if you thought that might mean the end of sci-fi movies based around surveillance footage, boy do I have a trailer for you. The first promo for Chris Pratt’s&nbsp;<em>MERCY</em> just dropped, and it stinks worse than sewage-filled socks.</p> <p>I love/hate&nbsp;<em>everything</em> about this trailer. The central premise is so stunningly stupid: a near-future world where people are tried for crimes by an AI via, um, strapping them into a chair in the middle of a colossal auditorium and then having them scour all surveillance, mobile and TV footage for proof of their innocence, but only with the run-time of a movie to do it all in. Should they fail to evidence their own lack of guilt in 90 minutes, they’re instantly murdered. It’s as stupid as a hundred ’80s Arnie movies put together, but delivered without a wink of irony.</p>

  <p>LAPD officer (because of course) Pratt has been accused of the murder of his wife. BUT GET THIS! He’s also <em>the very guy</em> who designed the MERCY system! What a piece of screenwriting mastery! Will he learn a valuable life-lesson about authoritarianism? Well, given the trailer begins with a murder mystery and appears to end with car chases and an entire city blowing up, I’m going to guess no.</p>

 <p>Look, I’m mostly ambivalent about boring Chris Pratt. Yes, he’s irritatingly ubiquitous and frustratingly average, and certainly his gross personal views are far from my own, but then I enjoyed him as Starlord and there’s no taking away from his performance in <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em>. Which is to say, I didn’t head into this trailer with an agenda. I sure came out of it with one! And I’m not even sure what I think about the usually excellent Rebecca Ferguson after this shitshow. She’s playing an AI, sure, but oh my goodness, even the current awful LLMs have more personality than is on display here.</p>

 <p>This really has everything. A woman fridged from before the film even starts; a cold, calculating female antagonist faced off against by the big, buff man; a countdown clock for literally no possible reason; animated percentages measuring guilt popping up like scores in a game; and just some of the most excruciating dialogue you could hope for. “I shouldn’t be here! I helped <em>create</em> the MERCY program!” “Do you honestly think that I killed my wife, or were you just programmed wrong?” Glorious stuff.</p>

 <p>But what I’m enjoying most of all is just how much <a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-prime-review-2000616263">it reminds me of&nbsp;<em>War of the Worlds</em> 2025</a>. Those same faux-surveillance camera angles, the crappy quality phone footage, actors trying to do naturalistic while sounding like elementary school nativity performances (I’m talking to you, Jamie McBride). The only disappointment is that Pratt’s clamped into that chair so he can’t get up and rattle a glass door. Can you imagine being in the editing suite for this movie when Amazon drops its ultra-stinker, and realizing that all you’re going get is grim comparisons.</p>

 <p>Perhaps Chris Pratt was just tired of all the running and jumping, and wanted to make a movie where he just got to have a sit down? Fair play to that. And look, I’m willing to admit I can be wrong. I am, after all, the person who (oh God, why can’t I just delete it?) wrote the post, “<a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-prime-ice-cube-movie-trailer-1851786939"><em>War of the Worlds</em> Via Found Footage Looks Like A Good Time”</a>. I’m really hoping this is the yang to that yin, and this time I’m ensuring that&nbsp;<em>MERCY</em> is an all-time classic. It is, after all, from the “Academy Award winning producer of&nbsp;<em>Oppenheimer</em>“!</p>

 <p>Well, um,&nbsp;<em>sort of</em>. One of the listed producers of <em>MERCY</em>, Charles Roven, was a producer on <em>Oppenheimer</em> and that movie won Best Picture. So, technically? But far better, <em>MERCY</em>‘s director, Timur Bekmambetov (best known for the wildly overrated&nbsp;<em>Night Watch</em> and&nbsp;<em>Day Watch</em>), was a producer on&nbsp;<em>War of the Worlds</em>! Yay! Why wasn’t&nbsp;<em>that</em> mentioned in the trailer?!</p> <p>It’s out in theaters January 23, 2026, although I rather strongly suspect it won’t be the&nbsp;<em>longest</em> wait before it hits streamers after that.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t normally associate Battlefield 6 with Star Wars. This is the case, though, as a fascinating video has shown how easy it is to use Battlefield 6’s Portal tools to create Star Wars Star Destroyers to engulf the sky.</p>



<p>The force is with Battlefield 6 players. Well, it’s with those who have the imagination to use it. We’ve already reported on people <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remaking classic Call of Duty maps</a> within hours of the game’s launch. If you thought to yourself, ‘How do you better this?’ the answer is simple: Make Star Destroyers, of course.</p>



<h2 id="h-people-are-making-star-destroyers-in-battlefield-6-portal-mode">People Are Making Star Destroyers in Battlefield 6 Portal Mode</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re going to see a lot of crazy creations. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even if you’ve never watched a Star Wars movie, chances are you’ve seen the mammoth Star Destroyers, which are comically large, and their construction is used for a sole purpose: Occupying space.</p>



<p>We’ve seen Star Destroyers for decades in Star Wars movies, and they’ve been a prominent presence in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnitemares-2025-twitch-drops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>. It’s time for the behemoth-like vehicles to enter the fray in Battlefield 6—as shown by <a href="https://x.com/Matavatar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Matavatar</a>.</p>



<p>As you can see in the video below, using basic Battlefield 6 Portal assets, you can easily make a Star Destroyer. It feels on brand with what Portal is going for, but it remains to be seen if the content is allowed to remain.</p>



<p>Disney is infamously hard on copyright and licensing infringements, and this could be considered such. Hopefully, this isn’t the case, and we can have custom Battlefield Star Wars maps!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What wild and wacky creations have you seen in Battlefield 6 so far? Is there anything on his level or scale?

            <p>There are still secrets in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> fans are yet to discover, but its director won't give any hints.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer about the game's forthcoming update and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/incredibly-moved-and-grateful-clair-obscur-expedition-33s-director-talks-success-art-house-aspirations-and-the-scope-of-future-projects">the future of the Clair Obscur franchise</a>, director Guillaume Broche discussed inspiration taken from the Final Fantasy games. While there's a reference to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a> specifically in the Gestral Village - with characters swapping "Double Dyad cards" in a nod to that game's Triple Triad card game - overall Broche simply took inspiration from the general vibe of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s iconic series.</p>
<p>But are there other secrets yet to be uncovered? "There are, but I don't want to say them because they won't be secrets anymore," Broche told Eurogamer. "Maybe they have been found, but I haven't seen anything about it. There are still a few things, yeah."</p>

<p>Fans have scoured Expedition 33 for hints and references, but it seems some of these weren't intentional.</p>
<p>"The funny thing is [fans] found secrets that were absolutely not secrets originally," said Broche. "And we are just like, ok cool. I guess that's a secret!"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">Ahead of the game's release</a>, Broche told Eurogamer he was keen for players to experiment with the game's battle system to create "broken builds" and - as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> speedrunner himself - he was looking forward to seeing no-hit runs of Expedition 33.</p>
<p>So did the community live up to his expectations?</p>
<p>"They are up to my expectations, which were very high," said Broche. "They destroyed the game very fast. My personal speedrun record was broken in one week, maybe even less."</p>
<p>The team did release an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quick-clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-will-soon-nerf-the-games-best-move">update to fix one particular ability</a> that proved a little too powerful. But other than that, Broche is "very happy that people found crazy builds that even [he] didn't really think about. It's exactly what we made the system for."</p><p>What he perhaps didn't expect was for the community to discover his workings out. Fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-french-inspired-setting-was-originally-steampunk-london">uncovered a trailer for an early version of the game posted on reddit</a> by Broche in a bid to find voice actors, which showed it in a very early state.</p>
<p>"It was like everybody entered my room and saw my underwear," Broche joked. "I completely forgot that it was still accessible."</p>
<p>"It's funny," he continued, "because I think that not often enough do we see real behind-the-scenes footage of games in general, like the very first prototypes that very often look terrible."</p>
<p>Sandfall CTO and lead programmer Tom Guillermin added the discovery helped to "demystify" the early stage of a project. "I think it's not that bad in the end that people found out," he said. "It's actually the same project in Unreal that we just upgraded iteratively and in the end that's the game people get to play. I think demystifying that great games are not great from the beginning, it's maybe good for the industry and also for the hobbyist as well."</p>
<p>Sandfall Interactive is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">release an update to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soon</a>, adding new quality of life options and new story scenes offering "a bit of whee and a bit of whoo".</p>

		<p>Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era will not be entering early access this year, developer Unfrozen has announced. The studio has stated that it will be making some changes to the game based on player feedback including changes to the user interface, and redesigning some of the units. Doing this will also allow Unfrozen to carry out more tests on Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era before it goes into early access, which is now slated for 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era - Demo Now Available | Fantasy Turn-Based Strategy" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wxAOAxq13IA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>On the plus side, those of you looking forward to Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era have the chance to play it now, with a new demo that has been released. This demo gives access to the tutorial, three single player modes including Arena, Classic (Multi Hero), and Single Hero. On top of that, those playing the demo will be able to choose from four of the six factions planned for Early Access. The four selectable factions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temple – Classic Humans</li>
<li>Necropolis – Undead and Vampires</li>
<li>Dungeon – Underground creatures and Dark Elves</li>
<li>Schism – Altered Elves and Eldritch Abominations</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sylvan and Hive factions are not going to be playable. The demo for Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era has no time limit on it, so players can spend as much time as they want digging into what is available. The game itself is a prequel to the Heroes of Might and Magic games, with events from this release referenced in other games. The combat in Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era will be turn based.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week, a group of former ZeniMax developers revealed that they'd <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-microsofts-mass-layoffs-former-elder-scrolls-online-and-blackbird-devs-form-worker-owned-studio">formed a new worker-owned studio</a> in the aftermath of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a>. It's called Sackbird Studios, and the logo's a bird with a sack. Following <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hownottodraw.bsky.social/post/3m2rx65rjlk2v">accusations that this bird looked like it could be AI-generated</a>, the studio have responded that it isn't, but some of the images on their website were.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Kotaku's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3m2s4u4igjk2f">Ethan Gach</a> reached out to Sackbird amid questioning of their avian adumbration on social media. "Our trademarked logo was hand-drawn by a human artist working directly with the founding team," reads the response from a studio spokesperson. "Some supporting visuals on our website, like the Baltimore skyline and social icons, were generated with AI image tools and then customised and polished by us."</p>
<p>"At the time, we didn't have an artist on staff and were racing to meet a launch deadline, so AI helped us prototype quickly," they continued, adding that they don't view the controversial tech as "a replacement for artists", but rather "just another brush in the box". "The final look, humour, and heart are all Sackbird," the statement concluded.</p>
<p>It's certainly not a great look for the new studio, who'll rightly face strong scrutiny about use of AI going forwards. The aspect of the statement which has caught my attention is the idea Sackbird were racing to meet a launch deadline. Given how strongly the group emphasised being "fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games" in their launch press release, I'm struggling to see how that deadline can't have been self-imposed to at least some degree if the staff have the level of control they're suggesting.</p><p>That said, getting the ball rolling quickly on a new venture so you minimise any delays in re-establishing an income is at least understandable as a motivation, especially given the Sackbird team were recently laid off from their previous jobs. Whether that justifies leaning on AI, rather than ensuring that paid artists were employed or commissioned to handle every bit of art necessary to get through the all-important launch phase of your new studio is a judgement each of us'll have to make individually.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You only have to look at the previous platforms the Little Nightmares franchise has appeared on to see how inclusive the series is. As time moves on, so do business decisions. We’re seeing if Little Nightmares 3 is available on PS4, Xbox One, as well as current-gen consoles, and PC.</p>



<p>We remember the PS4 and Xbox One era like it was yesterday. It was a better time in many ways, with regular exclusive releases, brands genuinely competing to be the best, and before game and console price increases became the norm. Titles releasing on old-gen hardware—like the PS4 and Xbox One—are becoming more antiquated by the second, which brings us to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>



<p>You’re here to see if Little Nightmares 3 is on PS4 and Xbox One—as well as other platforms—and we have the answer you seek.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-little-nightmares-3-on-xbox-one-or-ps4">Can You Play Little Nightmares 3 on Xbox One or PS4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This one certainly isn’t floating away from anyone. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Little Nightmares 3 is available to buy digitally and physically on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles.</strong></p>



<p>The love for old-gen continues with <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>. It’s hard to believe that the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S came out five years ago. The PS4 and Xbox One generation feels like a lifetime ago. As such, many companies are foregoing old-gen development as it costs too much money, and the de-optimization required can be time-consuming.</p>



<p>We’d argue it’s easier for a title like Little Nightmares 3 to make this transition. Not to disrespect its graphics, it still clearly boasts a premium, high-quality polish—but not having to generate a large open-world should make development easier.</p>



<p>You only have to look at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-game-size-pre-load-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s file size</a> to see this. With the Little Nightmares franchise already past the 20 million mark in lifetime sales, having PS4 and Xbox One versions will help bolster this number. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-little-nightmares-3-platforms-explained">All Little Nightmares 3 Platforms, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>You can buy and play Little Nightmares 3 on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>Short of a mobile port, or even VR, this is as complete as a release gets in 2025! PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, and PC owners can all procure and play! Its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-little-nightmares-3-cost-price-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price</a> is slightly greater than recent games, but it’s still a fair price for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-to-beat-little-nightmares-3-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game of its length</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>You certainly aren’t starved of options when it comes to buying Little Nightmares 3, then.

            <p>MMORPG Blue Protocol: Star Resonance was finally released in the west yesterday, and is already off to a strong start on Steam.</p>
<p>It's already peaked at almost 95k concurrent players, meaning it has more players at the time of writing than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, Marvel Rivals, and EA Sports FC 26.</p>
<p>The anime MMO from Bandai Namco was previously released in Japan and was set to receive a western release by Amazon Games. However, in August 2024 the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-and-amazon-games-published-mmorpg-blue-protocol-has-worldwide-release-cancelled">Japanese servers were shut down and the western release cancelled</a>.</p>

<p>Since then, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namcos-cancelled-mmorpg-blue-protocol-is-coming-back-as-star-resonance">Tencent-funded developer Bokura picked up the project</a>, added Star Resonance to the name, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namcos-cancelled-mmorpg-blue-protocol-will-release-outside-of-japan-this-year">now released it as a free-to-play game</a> across PC (Steam, Epic Games Store) and mobile (iOS, Google) in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Oceania.</p>
<p>But after all that, was it worth the wait?</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681810/Blue_Protocol_Star_Resonance/#app_reviews_hash">Steam reviews</a> from players so far would suggest not. Blue Protocol currently has a Mixed rating, with criticisms of its lack of content, generic gameplay, and gacha mechanics.</p>
<p>"Just once I would love to get an anime MMO without 1000 currencies, gacha, 5000 'presents' with no real value and overloaded UI," wrote one Steam user. Wrote another: "This absolute slop represents the culmination of the cancer that has killed the MMO genre."</p>
<p>Other players, meanwhile, are more positive, claiming it has "great art and visuals" and that for a free-to-play game it's worth a go.</p>
<p>At the time of its Japanese cancellation, the developers stated the "difficult decision" to end service was made as "it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you".</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-protocol-is-amazons-next-punt-on-east-meets-west">hands-on with Blue Protocol</a> ahead of its release way back in 2023, and while it was enjoyable I questioned if it could do enough to differentiate itself from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a> competition. Once the game was released in Japan, it didn't receive a particularly positive reception, which ultimately led to its cancellation.</p>
<p>Blue Protocol's Star Resonance revival will certainly give it a second lease of life, but whether it was worth it remains questionable.</p>

<header><section>
<p>Well that's... unexpected</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="def3cfcd30d27"><a title="Mario Kart World Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/def3cfcd30d27/mario-kart-world-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, you read that headline correctly, rather than pushing the prices up to match what we've seen everywhere else in the industry of late, select EU retailers appear to be <em>cutting</em> the cost of Switch 2 consoles and bundles (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/10/10/amazon-france-reduces-price-of-nintendo-switch-2-and-bundles/">My Nintendo News</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Nintendo-10015151-Switch-2/dp/B0F2JCL3NZ?th=1&amp;tag=nintlife09-21" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon France</a> was the first retailer brought to our attention to be implementing such a cut, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> Switch 2 bundle and pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> option now down to <strong>€469</strong> (a 6% drop from the previous €499,99). Standard Switch 2 purchases are currently sold out on the online storefront, but French outlet <a href="https://www.nintendo-town.fr/2025/10/10/france-amazon-et-e-leclerc-baissent-le-prix-de-la-nintendo-switch-2-et-de-ses-bundles/">Nintendo Town</a> reports that it has seen the same discount and is now listed at €419.</p>
<p>It's currently unclear whether this is a temporary or permanent discount, though it follows the same price cut seen at French retailer <a href="https://www.e.leclerc/fp/pack-console-nintendo-switch-2-le-jeu-mario-kart-world-sur-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-2-0045496321529">E.Leclerc</a>, where the console and bundles can now be found with the 6% reduction.</p>
<p>Now yes, €30 might not be the most drastic of price shifts, but it's a notable discount all the same — that's a decent chunk of money towards a new game or accessory, let's not forget.</p>
<p>It's a similar trend for the region as what we initially saw with game listings. Mere days after the Switch 2 was revealed, a handful of French retailers were already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/select-eu-retailers-are-abandoning-nintendos-suggested-retail-price-for-switch-2-games">abandoning Nintendo's suggested €80 price tag</a> for titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">TOTK</a>, and were listing each for closer to €60 instead.</p>
<p>From a global perspective, it'll be all eyes on Black Friday next month where we'd <em>assume</em> Switch 2 discounts will be available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned AMD leaker Kepler has <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/from-project-amethyst-to-the-future-of-play-amd-and-sony-interactive-entertainment%E2%80%99s-shared-vision.1688947/post-270885018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed on the NeoGAF board</a> that Sony is planning to launch the PlayStation 6 console in 2027, with the caveat that 'unexpected delays' could still happen.</p>



<p>This would be right on time for a 7-year lifecycle, just like its predecessor, the PlayStation 4. The main difference would be with regards to the PlayStation 5 Pro, which was released four years after the PS5 (and therefore only three years before the alleged PS6 launch window), whereas the PlayStation 4 Pro appeared on the market three years after the PS4 and four years before the launch of the PS5.</p>



<p>Rumors about the specifications of the PlayStation 6 have been circulating for a while, mainly due to YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked</a> an estimated computing power of 34 to 40 Teraflops with a massive ray tracing performance uplift of 6x to 12x compared to the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, AMD and Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have divulged new details on their ongoing Project Amethyst collaboration</a> to improve hardware and software in future GPUs and consoles. Three technologies were singled out at this time: Radiance Cores, Neural Arrays, and Universal Compression. </p>



<ul>
<li>The first one is specifically designed to deliver that rumored ray tracing performance boost: the Radiance Cores hardware blocks will accelerate the computationally intensive ray tracing traversal calculations, freeing shader cores to work on the rest of the rendered scene. </li>



<li>Neural Arrays, on the other hand, are dedicated AI accelerator units integrated into the GPU architecture. They are designed to handle machine learning inference tasks natively on the console hardware, achieving much greater efficiency compared to current methods.</li>



<li>Finally, Universal Compression is a new device-agnostic compression technology that reduces the data footprint across textures, geometry, and other game assets without significantly reducing quality. It optimizes memory bandwidth and storage, allowing games to load faster and operate more efficiently. This should also translate into improved streaming performance, possibly reducing stuttering during gameplay.</li>
</ul>



<p>Interestingly, in that video, PlayStation System Architect Mark Cerny also <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-amd-mark-cerny-jack-huynh-project-amethyst-ps6-playstation-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased that these technologies would appear on a new console (the PlayStation 6) in a few years' time</a>. If the rumor is true, that just means two years, possibly a bit sooner than most expected. Indeed, it feels like we only started getting 'next-generation' games in the past couple of years, whereas most titles previously supported cross-generation releases. Still, this generation has a few aces left, like The Witcher IV and The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-little-nightmares-3-connected-to-1-and-2-do-you-need-to-play-little-nightmares-1-2-first.1321654/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Little Nightmares 3 offers a new world with new characters. As this is the third game in the series, onlookers finally peeking into the franchise are curious as to whether this is a direct sequel, if the worlds are reconnected, and also if you need to play either of the first two games before hopping into Little Nightmares 3 for the first time.</p>



<p>This might surprise you, but the Little Nightmares franchise has sold over 20 million units worldwide! This is a phenomenal achievement for an indie title. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-little-nightmares-3-have-crossplay-cross-platform-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> is moving closer to AA territory with the introduction of Supermassive Games—a renowned horror expert.</p>



<p>But today, we’re seeing if there’s a disconnect between Little Nightmares 3 and the titles that came before it, and tell you everything you need to know if you’re on the fence about buying.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-to-play-little-nightmares-1-or-2-before-playing-little-nightmares-3">Do You Need To Play Little Nightmares 1 or 2 Before Playing Little Nightmares 3?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A lot to explore, but you’re not Alone. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You do not need to play Little Nightmares 1 or Little Nightmares 2 before playing Little Nightmares 3, as this is a new adventure independent of the first two games.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> features two brand-new characters—Low and Alone. The side-scrolling puzzle-platformer also takes place in a fresh location—The Nowhere. None of these properties has featured in previous Little Nightmares games. </p>



<p>So if you’re worried about missing out on crucial story lore or not understanding the game due to missing a piece of the puzzle, we can assure you that everything is learned and uncovered as you play.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-little-nightmares-3-connected-to-the-first-two-games">Is Little Nightmares 3 Connected To The First Two Games?</h2>



<p><strong>The short is no, we don’t think Little Nightmares 3 is directly connected to either of the first two games.</strong></p>



<p>At best, there’s a loose sense that Low and Alone share the same world, although it’s not directly implied. Whereas Little Nightmares 1 and 2 are more overt, as Six—the main character in Little Nightmares 1—also appears alongside Mono in Little Nightmares 2.</p>



<p>The second game is a prequel to the first, which is why they tie together so nicely and fittingly. But Little Nightmare 2 is its own entity. Everything about it is fresh, and we think it symbolizes the new beginning as the series’ development shifts away from Tarsier Games to Supermassive Games.</p>



<p>There could be some subtle clues we’ve missed throughout our playthrough—which we discussed in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-review-a-familiar-dream-but-one-you-shouldnt-sleep-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3 review</a>—otherwise, you should be fine if this is your first LN experience!</p>



<hr>



<p>To recap, you don’t need to play either of the first two games before playing Little Nightmares 3. The world may be faintly connected, but this is a new adventure, and a new story. Let us know how you get on with Little Nightmares 3 via the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Forthcoming extraction shooter Arc Raiders will make progression wipes voluntary, through its newly revealed Expedition Project.</p>
<p>Progression wipes essentially reset a player's progress in a game and are a blunt method of putting all players on an even field. These are used in plenty of shooters, particularly at the start of a new season, but can be controversial. While Escape from Tarkov has had regular wipes, for instance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1975305060574732357">recently u-turned</a> on a decision to reset power in its forthcoming Renegades expansion due to player backlash.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders will include voluntary progression wipes, <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/">Embark Studios has now explained</a>, but the developer has its own method of implementing them.</p>

<p>"Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides," the studio wrote in a blog post. "Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities. At least for a little while.</p>
<p>"However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall."</p>
<p>The system in Arc Raiders is called the Expedition Project. The explanation is a little complicated, at least until we go hands-on and try it ourselves, but the full game will introduce the Expedition Project at level 20.</p>
<p>This ongoing project (or mission, really) operates on a repeating cycle of roughly eight weeks, with players gradually contributing towards its progression. Once complete, a progression reset will be available. If progress is not complete, players will be able to carry it over to the next finalisation window.</p>
<p>A progression reset will wipe character levels, skills, inventory, crafting capabilities, and everything else associated with progress. Cosmetics (both earned and purchased), awards, achievements and the like will remain.</p>
<p>To incentivise completing the Expedition Project, players will be rewarded with permanent account unlocks, unique cosmetic rewards, and buffs for the following Expedition cycle.</p>
<p>"One point to drive home is that we are being very careful about the nature of these benefits," the blog post reads. "Completing a reset should never give a player a power or combat advantage over anyone who has not completed a reset.</p>
<p>"Initially, these benefits will centre around cosmetics and bragging rights, quality-of-life, and smoothing out some aspects of progression for those who have gone through a reset."</p>
<p>Essentially, this system gives players the power to reset their game in their own time, prolonging the game's longevity through repetition with less pressure on endgame activities.</p>
<p>"It's not a silver bullet," the studio admitted, "and won't achieve the clean break that a mandatory global reset does, but it does aim to be more equitable to all players. Wherever possible, we want to value your time spent in the game as much as you do.</p>
<p>"Of course, this is a complex topic, so we'll be keeping an eye on the discussion around this message and follow up as necessary."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/play-online-shooter-arc-raiders-free-next-month-in-final-test-weekend-before-release">Arc Raiders will have a free public network test later this month</a>, to test out the game ahead of its full release on 30th October.</p>
<p>It's releasing, therefore, between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> as something of an underdog of the three. Still, you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-censor-arc-raiders">can't type "Arc Raiders" into the Call of Duty chat</a> as it's been censored.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Discord has confirmed that a data breach of their customer support platform has leaked at least 70,000 government IDs that were being used for age verification, something required in the UK since July to satisfy the Online Security Act.</p>
<p>I think you’ll agree that this is pretty much the exact opposite of online security.</p>


<p>Amongst the leaked information was personal information, including partial credit card details, messages to customer support agents and, with the need to diagnose and manually verify disputed age checks, government ID images. No full payment details or user login details were affected.</p>
<p>The attack on Discord didn’t affect the company’s main servers and infrastructure, but instead targeted a third-party customer support service. This is a particularly common avenue that bad actors use to gain access to company data, by obtaining logins for external services used for internal communication and customer support.</p>
<p>The extent of the cyber-attack is in dispute, with Discord admitting to 70,000 government IDs being leaked, but the hacker group that has claimed responsibility say that they had access for 58 hours by compromising the account of a support agent at an outsourced provider. This let them download 1.5TB of sensitive data that includes over 2.1 million government IDs. Discord disputes these figures, telling the BBC that these numbers were inflated and “part of an attempt to extort payment”.</p>

<p>While Discord did not name the third party service, the hackers said that it was the Zendesk portal that was affected. Speaking to the BBC, Zendesk said that its systems were not compromised through a vulnerability within its platform.</p>
<p>Discord is still in the process of investigating the attack and working with law enforcement, and they are getting in touch with affected users.</p>
<p>They state:</p>
<p>“If you were impacted, you will receive an email from <em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="83edecf1e6f3effac3e7eaf0e0ecf1e7ade0ecee">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em>. We will not contact you about this incident via phone – official Discord communications channels are limited to emails from <em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f39d9c8196839f8ab3979a80909c8197dd909c9e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em>.”</p>
<p>So…. remind me again why successive UK governments decided to not only pass online age verification laws, but also not take a hands on approach to securely implement an anonymised form of this?</p>
