			<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/">Deadline</a>, Netflix is once again looking at making a TV series adapted from a video game, but it's not something like its <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth/">adaptation of The Witcher</a> or its <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-premiere-netflix-ubisoft/">new Splinter Cell animated series.</a> Alongside A24, Netflix is reportedly making a reality TV cooking competition, based on the beloved indie co-op cooking game, Overcooked.</p>



<p>The report describes it as a show that'll follow a similar path to Netflix's other viral cooking shows like 'Nailed It!' and 'Floor is Lava.' Phil Duncan, Oli De-Vine, and Gemma Langford from Ghost Town Games, the studio behind Overcooked, are reportedly working on the adaptation as executive producers.</p>



<p>Both Netflix and A24 declined to comment on the report, so for now, we only have Deadline's report to go off of. While Deadline has the kind of track record where we can safely assume that this will be confirmed soon, nothing's impossible, and it could be the case that this project, if it is in development, never makes it across the finish line.</p>



<p>If that were to happen, though, what a disappointment that would be, because there is no game better suited to be adapted in this way. Of course, some of the shenanigans that players get up to in Overcooked are too fantastical to be feasible in the real world, but it would be an undeniably entertaining show if chefs had to toss ingredients to each other, jump over gaps to get to different stations, and cook with the kinds of insane limitations and obstacles players face in Overcooked.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this is not a project that ends up in the trash.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blizzard announced that tickets for BlizzCon 2026 will go on sale on Friday, November 7, 2025, at 9 AM Pacific Time through Sunday, November 9, at midnight Pacific Time. These will be 'Early Bird' tickets available for $249.99 (a price that includes all taxes and fees) while supplies last. The organizers also confirmed that the maximum number of purchasable passes per account has been increased from two to four.</p>



<p>The second wave of tickets will go on sale starting Tuesday, November 18, 2025, at 9 AM Pacific Time, for $289.99. A ticket grants two-day weekend admission to BlizzCon 2026 on both Saturday and Sunday, including access to all Halls and Arena, during show hours. Moreover, fans will also obtain some in-game goodies (currently unspecified) and exclusive items to commemorate the event. Tickets will go on sale <a href="https://www.tixr.com/groups/bc/events/blizzcon-2026-159916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Tixr</a> and you'll need an account to buy them.</p>



<p>As usual, the main event will be the Opening Ceremony, where Blizzard holds the biggest announcements and reveals. The Opening Ceremony will take place on the Main Stage in Hall D, with seats available on a first-come, first-served basis. In this case, we might see the launch news of the next Diablo IV expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to be released at some point in 2026</a>. World of Warcraft: Midnight, on the other hand, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to be scheduled to launch in February</a>. That said, there will undoubtedly be news about updates for World of Warcraft, Overwatch 2, Hearthstone, and Diablo Immortal throughout the event, especially in the dedicated developer panels.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-makes-a-return-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had confirmed earlier this year</a>, BlizzCon 2026 will take place at the usual venue, the Anaheim Convention Center, on September 12 and 13. The fan-focused convention returns after a three-year hiatus; the last BlizzCon took place on November 3 and 4, 2023, and the big announcement was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-worldsoul-saga-the-war-within-midnight-the-last-titan-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldsoul Saga</a>, a trilogy of World of Warcraft expansions (The War Within, Midnight, and The Last Titan) featuring a continuous storyline written by returning writer guru Chris Metzen.</p>

That’s because there still aren’t many controllers that can mimic one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">$89.99 Switch 2 Pro</a>’s biggest selling points, which is letting owners turn the console on from their couch. It’s still something to brag about, and yet notable accessory company 8BitDo doesn’t seem keen to boast that it recently debuted new firmware for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/755307/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-review-pc-nintendo-switch-2">Pro 3</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619229/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-tmr-anti-drift-joysticks">Ultimate 2</a> that enables this handy trick.</p><p>Version 2.0 of its firmware for both controllers (available now in its <a href="https://app.8bitdo.com/Ultimate-Software-V2/">Ultimate Software V2</a> on Windows and Mac) brings shake-to-wake support on Switch 2. Once either controller is paired with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLT-fUVxsBU">goofy one-time procedure</a>, you can simply turn on your gamepad, give it a little shake, then your console will wake up. I’ve confirmed that it works on my Switch 2 with both controllers.</p><p>The lack of Switch 2 wake-up in 8BitDo’s latest controllers was one of the reasons why I’ve been suggesting other models to <em>Verge </em>readers. At around $69.99 each, these aren’t cheap. And yet, models that are considerably less expensive (like GuliKit’s $29.99 ES Pro and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/791574/best-switch-2-controllers">other solid controllers</a>) shipped months ago with the ability to wirelessly wake the Switch 2.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/814551/8bitdos-latest-wireless-controllers-can-now-shake-to-wake-the-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

<p>What appears to be a nearly full lineup of Intel Core Ultra 300 Panther Lake CPUs has been leaked online ahead of an official announcement. </p>



<p>The new CPUs, which were listed by known hardware leaker <a href="https://x.com/jaykihn0/status/1986086104286597269">jaykhin0</a>, show processors ranging from the high-end Core Ultra X9 388H to the Core Ultra 3 322. When it comes to Cores, Panther Lake features a max of 16 cores, depending on the chip. For clock speed, users are looking at a max boost of 5.1 GHz for the top processor while the more entry-level options reach 4.4 GHz. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A24 and Netflix are teaming up for a new video game adaptation: Overcooked. Furthermore, it will take the form of an unscripted reality cooking competition.</p>



<p>If you are an avid multiplayer fan, no title has come close to being as fun and frustrating as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overcooked</a>. Created by Ghost Town Games, the cooking simulator made waves in 2016 for its stressful yet enjoyable gameplay. Since then, a sequel and remaster have come out and it remains one of the best co-op indie titles in recent years. Now, it seems the concept of the game is making its way to one of the world’s biggest streaming platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-and-a24-planning-unscripted-competition-show-based-on-overcooked">Netflix and A24 Planning Unscripted Competition Show Based on Overcooked </h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive report from Deadline</a>, the outlet revealed that A24 has acquired the rights to Overcooked and wants to adapt the game into a cooking competition. With that, Netflix is said to be teaming up with the company to stream the series. No official comments from Netflix or A24 are available at this time. </p>



<p>As for what the show will look like, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the report</a> says it’ll be similar to Nailed It! and The Floor is Lava, two family-friendly shows Netflix has. Still, the high-octane challenges and ensuing chaos will remain, which were key to the game’s rapid success. Gemma Langford, Oli De-Vine, and Phil Duncan from Ghost Town Games and A24 are set to executive produce the show.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see how Overcooked is translated into reality TV. Fortunately, we won’t be the ones cooking and stressing out this time. Still, seeing how fun it is to watch people play it will definitely make for some fun television. As a fan of cooking shows myself, Overcooked is a great IP to bring to life in that way and I look forward to seeing how it comes out.</p>



<p>What do you think of Overcooked being a cooking competition? Did you play the game? Any good (or bad) memories with it? Could you do it in real life?

It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,770 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,231 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,720 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. <span id="more-1004892"></span></p><p>In a message, the companies said the delay is the result of “[quality assurance] [hitting] a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable,” which fixing would require pushing the console release back due to certification timelines, and they would rather not release for all platforms at once, versus PC first and consoles later.</p><p>Here is the full message from Playstack and D-CELL:</p><blockquote><p>Hi! <em>UNBEATABLE</em> was supposed to come out tomorrow!</p><p>That’s a scary sentence. Here’s a worse one: <em>UNBEATABLE</em> will now release on December 9.</p><p>I hate that I have to say this. There’s no way to apologize for it that feels like enough. I’m personally sorry about this and I wish it was different.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Why Would You Only Tell Me Now?</strong></p><p>Because the decision was only made a few hours ago. (No, really, I’m writing this right after the meeting where the decision was made). We are telling you this as soon as we possibly can.</p><p><strong>But Why? The Game’s Done, Right?</strong></p><p>There’s a very boring and frustrating reason; [quality assurance] hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable. Fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of [certification] timelines, and not fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We’re fixing it.</p><p><strong>But Why Not Just Delay the Release of the Console Port?</strong></p><p>That’s very messy! We’d rather release the game all at once for everybody.</p><p><strong>But Why Release on December 9? That’s a Whole Month Away!</strong></p><p>Another boring reason you can figure out pretty quickly by googling the phrase “2025 game release calendar” and looking at what’s hitting this month. We had a pretty good spot on November 6 where we made a small little island for ourselves, and skipping that date necessarily means skipping forward a lot to find another island, and that’s the closest one we had. On the plus side, it gives us breathing room we didn’t have before to do some pre-launch things we wanted to do that had to get pushed back because of finishing the game in time for, well, tomorrow.</p><p><strong>…But is the Game Good?</strong></p><p>It’s very good, and I’m very biased. We’ll see what reviewers think. But for those of you waiting the longest for this thing to come out, it makes me feel a bit crazy knowing how much you still don’t know about what’s this thing is. I’m very excited about it. I wish it could have been tomorrow, but.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who’s rooted for us up until this point. It’s not much longer now.</p><p>—RJ Lake and everyone at D-CELL and Playstack</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/unbeatable-delayed-to-december-9]]></content:encoded>

                <p>You'll take on a lot of quests that send you to the Dam Battlegrounds in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, including one from Tian Wen who wants you to search for Major Aiva's Mementos in some apartment buildings. This is a straightforward quest on paper, but because there are multiple buildings to explore and the ever-looming threat of ARC and other raiders, it's best to know right where to find these mementos so you can get out quickly.</p><p>Since you need to extract with Major Aiva's Mementos, it's a good idea to equip an augment that lets you store an item in a safe pocket. Once you pick up the mementos, you can toss it in that safe pocket and take it home with you even if you end up dead before you can extract.</p><p>With that out of the way, let's find Major Aiva's Mementos and wrap up The Major's Footlocker quest in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Where to find Major Aiva’s Mementos for The Major's Footlocker quest</h2><p>Major Aiva's Mementos can be found in an apartment building located at the Ruby Residence POI. This area is located in the northwestern section of the Dam Battlegrounds map.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597138-arcraiders_20251105131903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597138" data-ratio="0.58616404308202" data-width="2414" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597138-arcraiders_20251105131903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597138"></a><figcaption>Ruby Residence</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597138-arcraiders_20251105131903.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the apartment complex, you'll want to head into the leftmost building. The item you're looking for is on the top floor (not the roof). Head up two flights of stairs, then wrap around and follow the rooms until you reach a dead end with a window and a box on a desk in the corner.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597053" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597053"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg"></figure><p>This box contains Major Aiva's Mementos. You'll need to interact with it, then pick up the item and store it in your inventory.</p><p>As stated above, you're required to extract with this item. Hopefully, you have a safe pocket slot! Either way, your closest options are likely to be the Central Swamp Lift to the south or the North Complex Elevator to the east. The safer choice is probably the latter, as the former tends to stay pretty busy with other players perusing the swamp for mushrooms and other quests. Whichever you choose, play things safe and get out alive, raider.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>Early Black Friday deals are slowly trickling in, including a limited-time offer on NordVPN. The VPN company is offering its several of its <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=NordVPN%27s+Black+Friday+Deals+Will+Save+you+Hundreds+Of+Dollars&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-11-05+10%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-05+12%3A07%3A31&amp;fnarticle_id=6535963&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F417838%2F7452%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnordvpn.com%252Foffer%252Fpricing%252F%253Ftag%253Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnordvpns-black-friday-deals-2025%2F1100-6535963%2F%3Fi%3Dxly&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subscription plans for up to 77% off</a>, with an additional 3 months tacked on for even better value</strong>. Using a VPN is a good way to buff up your privacy capabilities and maintain access to region-locked content while traveling. If you've been on the fence, NordVPN's discounted prices make now a great time to consider a subscription.</p><p>NordVPN is offering all 24-month and 12-month versions of its Basic, Plus, Complete, and Prime subscription tiers at significant discounts, with an additional three months included. That's 15 total months of VPN service for far less than you'd normally pay.</p><p>The 24-month Prime plan offers the best value. It includes full access to the VPN, plus additional incentives such as 1TB of cloud storage, advanced identity protection, and the NordProtect service, which has a robust suite of insurance, Dark Web monitoring, and credit freeze assistance options. The 24-month Prime plan normally costs $836.73, but with the discount, new subscribers can sign up for just $186. That's a whopping $650 savings, and it includes the bonus three months, for a total of 27 months.</p><p>If you're looking for something in the short term, the 12-month plans are also discounted, and each one includes the three extra months. For example, the 12-month Prime subscription includes everything in the 24-month plan, but instead costs $127.35 (normally $464.85/year), and you're getting 15 months at that price thanks to the bonus three months.</p><p>We've included a quick breakdown of NordVPN's discounted plans below, and you can browse the full details of the deal at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=NordVPN%27s+Black+Friday+Deals+Will+Save+you+Hundreds+Of+Dollars&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-11-05+10%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-05+12%3A07%3A31&amp;fnarticle_id=6535963&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F417838%2F7452%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnordvpn.com%252Foffer%252Fpricing%252F%253Ftag%253Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnordvpns-black-friday-deals-2025%2F1100-6535963%2F%3Fi%3Dxly&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NordVPN's website</a>. NordVPN lists the monthly cost of its plans, but the 2-Year plans are actually billed every 24 months, and the 1-Year plans are billed annually, so you'll pay the full price for the subscription period upfront when you sign up. NordVPN also offers monthly plans, but these are not eligible for the Black Friday deal. It's also important to note that your subscription will revert to the standard price after the promotional period ends, unless you cancel or update your plan before the end of the promotional period.</p><h2>NordVPN Black Friday Deals</h2><h4>2-Year Plans</h4><ul><li>Basic 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $80.73 (<del>$313</del>)</li><li>Plus 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $105 (<del>$404.73</del>)</li><li>Complete 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $132 (<del>$493.83</del>)</li><li>Prime 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $186 (<del>$836.73</del>)</li></ul><h4>1-Year Plans</h4><ul><li>Basic 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months --$68.85 (<del>$173.85</del>)</li><li>Plus 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $82.35 (<del>$224.85</del>)</li><li>Complete 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $97.35 (<del>$274.35</del>)</li><li>Prime 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $127.35 (<del>$464.85</del>)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-preorder-guide/1100-6534713/">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment Launch-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-officially-licensed-wireless-controllers-zelda-super-mario-pokemon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Zelda-Themed Switch 2 Controllers For As Low As $25 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller On Sale For Lowest Price This Year</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-best-deals-black-friday-2025/1100-6534446/">Xbox Wireless Controllers Discounted To $40 In Early Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; PC Controller Discounted To New Low Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-classic-tv-series-batmobile-building-set-amazon-deal/1100-6535836/">Lego Classic TV Series Batmobile Gets Rare Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/digimon-the-movies-4-6-blu-ray-collection-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6535809/">Digimon The Movies 4-6 Blu-Ray Collection Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-best-official-playstation-figures-plush-collectors-box/1100-6535705/">Adorable New Astro Bot Collectibles Are Waiting To Be Rescued By You</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/unbeatable">Unbeatable</a> is an anime-inspired "arcade-flawless" rhythm game that was set to launch tomorrow, on November 6, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. However, developer D-Cell Games has delayed Unbeatable to next month, just hours before the game's launch, citing a progression-blocking bug that it says must be fixed before release.&nbsp;</p><p>"Unbeatable was supposed to come out tomorrow," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2240620/view/598542531394797771?l=english">announcement</a> on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/">Steam page</a> reads. "That's a scary sentence. Here's a worse one: Unbeatable will now release on December 9. I hate that I have to say this. There's no way to apologize for it that feels like enough. I'm <em>personally </em>sorry about this and wish it was different."</p><p url="https://youtu.be/ASRfsN8-okg" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASRfsN8-okg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The delay announcement features a QA and in the "Why would you only tell me now?" section, D-Cell responds, "Because the decision was only made a few hours ago (No, really, I'm writing this right after the meeting where the decision was made). We are telling you this as soon as we possibly can."&nbsp;</p><p>As for why the very last-minute delay, D-Cell says, "QA hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that's serious enough it's considered unreleasable," and that "fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of cert timelines, and <em>not </em>fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We're fixing it."&nbsp;</p><p>As for why the game is being delayed more than a month to December 9, it is due to other games launching over the next month. D-Cell says the team had a pretty good spot on November 6, "where we made a small little island for ourselves, and skipping that date necessarily means skipping forward a <em>lot </em>to find another island, and [December 9] is the closest one we had. On the plus side, it gives us some breathing room we didn't have before to do some pre-launch things we wanted to do that had to get pushed back because of finishing the game in time for, well, tomorrow."&nbsp;</p><p>Unbeatable will now launch on December 9 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/anime-inspired-rhythm-game-unbeatable-releases-in-november">check out the Unbeatable reveal trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/05/anime-inspired-rhythm-game-unbeatable-delayed-to-december-hours-before-its-launch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s easy to grow jaded as a gamer, and even easier to forget why you got interested in games to begin with. As trends in video games change, you may find yourself longing for an imagined yesteryear, where that spark was still fresh. As a member of the diehard cult that hopes that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/telltale-delays-the-wolf-among-us-2-till-at-least-next-year-because-if-its-half-baked-were-going-to-get-torn-to-shreds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Wolf Among Us 2</em> will ever see the light of day</a>, <em>Dispatch </em>feels like a return to the experimental golden age of episodic choice-driven storytelling, where fun isn’t in photorealism but in the online water cooler buzz of what you chose and why.</p><p>After bingeing the first four playable episodes of <a href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, I found myself swept back (<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-narrative-superhero-game-episodic-telltale-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alongside other like-minded, nostalgic players</a>) into the magic of<em> Life is Strange</em> and <em>The Walking Dead—</em>the very games that ignited my love for storytelling in my teens when an innocuous <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/life_is_strange/b/playstation4/archive/2015/01/29/life-is-strange-episode-one-chrysalis-review-game-informer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameInformer magazine blurb</a> first sold me on the dream of games playing like episodic TV. It follows Robert Robertson (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/aaron-paul-dispatch-video-game-interview-2000672017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played by Aaron Paul</a>), a semi-retired superhero turned mission coordinator, assigning heroes to crises based on their skills and (difficult) personalities, both with the promise of leveling up over time. Your squad of “heroes” is the Z-team in every sense. It’s a <a href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chaotic mix of washed-up villains no one expects to redeem</a>, each carrying enough emotional baggage to test the most seasoned therapist (caped or otherwise) a headache.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dispatch | Episodes 5 &amp; 6 Preview" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zidpOy-Zta4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While <em>Dispatch</em>’s branching choices aren’t quite as splintered as the most procrastinated windshield spider cracks, it has already revived the lost art of player-driven internet chatter—debating everyone’s choices, overlooked details, and speculating on how the story might unfold in the remaining four episodes.&nbsp;</p><p>Being on the ground floor of something gaming-related that’s tied to players’ choices, discussing them, and trying to figure out how they’ll play out as the entire story unfolds in semi-weekly releases allows for community-driven conversations without the frustration of an episodic narrative that’s incomplete. This way, we see the whole work as evolving, rather than judging it based on unfinished pieces, which often leads to tired debates about graphics instead of emotional storytelling and character banter that really tug at your heartstrings or make you laugh.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">She’s insecure without her powers without her necklace but Robert? Who’s almost a parallel to her? He likes both the hero she is and the human being that she is.

In <em>Dispatch</em>’s fandom, players feel less like rivals in a competitive arena and more like a community—eager to swap decisions, analyze tiny details, trade puzzle tips, and even talk about romance without feeling juvenile or ironic.</p></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election"><h3>Mamdani Won, And Also Cuomo Lost</h3></a><p>Mamdani can't solve all our problems, but at least he solved the problem of having to talk about Andrew Cuomo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kodansha-studios-akira-anime-live-ation-chloe-zhao-nicolas-gonda"><h3>Somehow, The Threat Of A Live-Action Akira Refuses To Die</h3></a><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is Akira</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump"><h3>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On</h3></a><p>Big companies have shown time and time again that they'll say whatever is necessary to get mergers approved</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5"><h3>How Am I Supposed To Review Europa Universalis V</h3></a><p>There is simply too much video game here, and it's always in motion</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-cheap-indie-game-sale-roguelike-metroidvania-2000641389</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-the-most-underrated-roguelikes-of-the-past-6-years-is-just-3-on-switch-right-now.1344853/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Dicey Dungeons</em> came out <a href="https://kotaku.com/dicey-dungeons-is-a-good-entry-point-for-deck-builders-1837283279">way back in 2019</a>, a fact that blew my mind when I went to go double-check it today. That feels like a lifetime ago, but the deckbuilding roguelike itself still feels surprisingly fresh. Developed by Terry Cavanagh (<em>Super Hexagon</em>, <em>VVVVVV</em>), it combines two of my favorite things, turn-based combat and getting burned on RNG re-rolls, into a great dice battling game that too often goes overlooked. Somehow it’s currently just $3 on Switch.</p> <p>The premise is basically “what if you took a traditional turn-based dungeon game and ran every action through a jumble of chaos?” You collect equipment in the form of cards which dictate what actions you can take, and dice which are used to activate the cards. Some cards can only work with certain dice, and certain abilities will be stronger or weaker depending on the rolls you link them with. It’s a multi-layered math problem that sounds like homework in theory but is actually quite straightforward to navigate and slickly implemented in practice.</p>

 <p>There’s a bit of <em>Slay the Spire</em>, a bit of <em>Balatro</em>, and a whole lot of Cavanagh’s own clever design work going on. It’s not the only great Switch indie game on sale right now, though. A whole bunch of them are super cheap for the next week or so:</p> <ul> <li><em>Sifu</em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em> – $4 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em>The Pathless</em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Haiku, the Robot</em> – $4 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em>Ashen</em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Dredge</em> – $10 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Gorogoa</em> – $4.50 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em>Citizen Sleeper</em> – $6 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em>Blasphemous</em> – $6.25 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Dicey Dungeons</em> – $3 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em>Darkest Dungeon</em> – $7.50 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em>Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition</em> – $10 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Risk of Rain 2</em> – $6.25 (75 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>I’ve already sung <em>Dicey Dungeons</em>‘ praises, but I want to give another special shoutout to <a href="https://kotaku.com/haiku-the-robot-hollow-knight-silksong-review-metroidva-1848910676"><em>Haiku, the Robot</em></a>. This is another one that was easy to miss when it came out a few years back. It’s a retro-styled Metroidvania that has some neat ideas but doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. There’s fun combat, some light platforming, and a great soundtrack. Plus a grappling hook. But it’s not an overwhelming maze or a gauntlet of brutal boss fights. It’s inspired by <em>Hollow Knight</em> but a much friendlier version of that formula, while still feeling authentic and charming. At just $4, it’s also a steal.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-store-app-music-too-many-switch-2-iphone-phone-2000641401</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wow-there-are-way-too-many-nintendo-apps.1344850/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-store-app-play-time-session-switch-3ds-wii-u-2000641372">Nintendo launched a new Store app</a> for mobile phones that lets you wishlist, search for, and buy Switch and Switch 2 games on your phone. And that’s neat, but uh, why is this a separate app? Why does Nintendo keep insisting that you need one app to listen to music, another one to handle parental controls, and yet a few more to buy games, get news, and manage your Switch 2 console? It’s getting ridiculous.</p> <p>On November 5, the Nintendo Store App was released on mobile phones, letting users check out the Switch and Switch 2 eShop and even dig into some really interesting playtime data that the Mario maker has been collecting for years. Yet, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/nintendo-co-ltd/id1062496488">it also means Nintendo now has five separate non-gaming apps</a>.</p>

 <ul> <li>Nintendo Switch App</li> <li>Nintendo Music App</li> <li>Nintendo Today!</li> <li>Nintendo Switch Parental Controls</li> <li>Nintendo Store App</li> </ul> <p>Want to see which of your friends are online or manage your screenshots? <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-app-update-screenshots-upload-qr-code-1851782946">Use the Switch mobile app</a>. Want to buy a Switch 2 game on your phone? Well, download the newly released store app and use that. Also, the store app just opens a browser when you try to buy a game, so it’s not even that useful. Want to manage your console’s parental controls? Guess what, buddy? Go download another app. Curious about any new Nintendo news or announcements today? Fuck you, go download yet another app. Perhaps you wish to enjoy some music from your favorite Switch game, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-music-app-update-nes-games-donkey-kong-1851786691">Oh, you already know what I’m going to tell you: Download another app</a>.</p>

 <p>It’s all so strange and unnecessary. All of these apps feel barebones and not very useful because individually, each one only offers a few options and features. I’d much rather have a single Nintendo Switch app on my phone that contains a store, a little news section, and a way to manage my console and friends list. Breaking that out across three apps is silly. I’d even shove the parental controls into the main Switch app, too. This is mostly how Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation handle it, though Sony and Microsoft <em>also</em> break out parental controls into separate apps like Nintendo.</p> <p>Anyway, I’m excited for Nintendo to announce another new app next year that lets me change the visual settings on my Switch 2 and then another app that lets me manage my saves. I want 18 different Nintendo apps that I bounce between by 2030!</p>

                <p>In 2010, Visceral Games and Electronic Arts unleashed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dantes-inferno/" data-ref-id="5000-40808">Dante's Inferno</a>, an action-adventure game that was their answer to God of War. The story was very loosely inspired by Dante Alighieri's classic text, The Divine Comedy, as Dante sought to retrieve the soul of his wife, Beatrice, from Hell while facing Lucifer and the forces of evil. Now, 15 years after the game's release, new details have emerged about the canceled sequel, Dante's Inferno 2: Purgatorio.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-dantes-purgatorio-the-cancelled-sequel-to-eas-dantes-inferno" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> has an extensive report about Purgatorio, which includes a comprehensive breakdown of the story. The follow-up was envisioned as the inverse of the first game, as Dante was meant to scale Mount Purgatory to reunite with Beatrice and reach the Garden of Eden on top. However, each layer of the mountain represented one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and Dante had to both purge himself of those sins and defeat the embodiment of each one.</p><p>Dante also would have found himself in the middle of a war between Heaven and Hell, which he inadvertently set off by allowing Lucifer to escape Hell and invade Purgatory. St. Lucia--Dante's guardian angel from the first game's DLC--and the poet Virgil would have returned to guide Dante on his journey. To reach his goal, Dante would have to defeat some lethal archangels who considered him to be their enemy.</p><p>Along the way, Dante would have reunited and reconciled with Beatrice and banished her evil side from her. Or at least that's what he thought he did. In the game's closing moments, Dante and Beatrice made it all the way to Heaven, just for the former to discover that Lucifer had tricked him again. Through Beatrice, Lucifer murders Dante and casts him all the way back down to Hell. The only hope that ending offered is the spirit of St. Lucia, who assures Dante that even his death was part of God's plan.</p><p>The proposed third game, Dante’s Inferno 3: Paradiso, would have brought the war between Heaven and Hell to Earth and introduced Dante and Beatrice's daughter, who would be among the mortal warriors who fight alongside angels to reclaim Heaven from Lucifer and save Beatrice. God's plan would have been revealed as a plot to tear down the unforgiving ritual of sending souls to Heaven or Hell and replace it with something more compassionate.</p><p>Unfortunately, these ideas will likely never see the light of day as a game. But it's an intriguing look at what could have been.</p>

At least one expert believes the Switch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-is-about-to-pass-ds-to-become-nintendos-best-selling-platform-ever-but-may-not-beat-ps2/1100-6535912/" data-ref-id="1100-6535912">will not catch the PS2.</a></p><p>Earlier this year, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/" data-ref-id="1100-6533633">raised prices on the original Switch and a variety of accessories</a> due in part to the impact of tariffs.</p><p>Looking ahead, Nintendo is predicting to sell fewer Switch consoles than before. For the current fiscal year, Nintendo is now expecting to sell 4 million units, down from a previous prediction of 4.5 million. However, Nintendo is revising Switch game sales up from 105 million to 125 million.</p><p>For the Switch 2, meanwhile, Nintendo is raising projections from 15 million to 19 million for the current fiscal year. The Switch 2 has sold more than 10 million units worldwide, making it the fastest-selling Nintendo platform ever over its first four months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/suiting-back-up">Dispatch</a>, the episodic superhero narrative adventure, has been a critical success since the launch of its first two episodes on October 22. This positive word of mouth seems to be working, as developer AdHoc Studios has announced it has sold over 1 million copies of Dispatch within its first 10 days of launch.</p><p>The game, which stars <em>Breaking Bad</em>’s Aaron Paul as a down-on-his-luck former superhero working as a dispatcher for reformed supervillains, is created by former Telltale Games writers and sports a similar choice-driven narrative-focused format. Dispatch is an eight-episode adventure, with Episodes 5 and 6 dropping today (and every Wednesday). We still have to wait until next week’s finale to see how AdHoc sticks the landing, but Dispatch has garnered near-unanimous praise for its writing, story, character development, and performances from actors such as Laura Bailey, Jeffery Wright, and Erin Yvette, to famous content creators including Jacksepticeye, Joel Haver, and MoistCr1TiKaL. Its impressive sales numbers complement an overwhelmingly positive 93% critical rating on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dispatch/">Metacritic</a>.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTVgX7b1N8E"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTVgX7b1N8E" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“It’s always a little strange when the numbers get so big you have to talk about them,” says Michael Choung, AdHoc Studio's CEO and executive producer, in a press release. “A week ago, we were just as thrilled watching Let's Plays and reaction videos. But milestones like this matter. They mean AdHoc will be able to make more story-driven episodic originals, and we hope it means it'll be easier for other devs to do the same. Hard to believe we’re only halfway done.”</p><p>Dispatch is available now on PlayStation 5 and PC for $29.99.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disneyland-game-rush-brings-the-disney-parks-to-fortnite-for-a-limited-time-starting-tomorrow.1344817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Starting tomorrow, Fortnite players will be able to jump into a new creative island made by Epic Games called Disneyland Game Rush. It's a limited-time creative island that includes seven mini games, each inspired by different famous Disneyland and Disney World attractions and rides as part of the 70th anniversary of Disneyland.</p>



<p>It's not the massive persistent universe that Fortnite and Disney <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-a-persistent-universe-in-fortnite-based-on-its-franchises/">have been planning and working on for more than a year now</a>, but it's perhaps a small glimpse as to what that might look like, and from a technical standpoint, a big step forward towards creating the look of the Disney theme parks within Fortnite.</p>



<p>The seven mini-games include games based on newer attractions, like the Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: Sneak Out! game, based on the Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: Breakout ride, has you sneaking around and completing the mission without being caught. A Star Wars: Stormtrooper Showdown mini-game has you putting down as many Stormtroopers as possible.</p>



<p>However, for the big Disney parks fans, the more meaningful mini-games are likely the ones based on Disney parks classics, like the Space Mountain: Rocket Race mini-game, the Metterhorn: Slip-and-Climb mini-game, and the Haunted Mansion: Scavenger Haunt mini-game.</p>



<p>A report from<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-disneyland-game-rush-is-an-incredibly-authentic-first-step-into-fortnite-for-disney-parks?utm_source=threads,twitter"> IGN includes some screenshots</a> of the game modes and what players can expect when they jump into the island once it is available to the public tomorrow, November 6, 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda Movie Has Seemingly Started Filming]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-filming-rumor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-has-seemingly-started-filming.1344811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to an updated listing, The Legend of Zelda live-action film has started production. Previously, the Nintendo/Sony movie, based on the iconic franchise, was in pre-production and set to release in 2027.</p>



<p>The success of Nintendo’s film projects has only gained speed thanks to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-bros-movie-record-breaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Super Mario Bros</a>. Movie in 2023. Its blockbuster sales at the Box Office proved that bringing iconic IPs to the screen can work if done well. Interestingly, the next project announced was a highly ambitious live-action adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda</a>. Helmed by The Maze Runner’s Wes Ball, the film plans to release on May 7th, 2027. Casting has been done for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/link-and-zelda-actors-confirmed-nintendo-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Link and Zelda</a>, but not much else is known. Well, now we may be getting some more information soon, if the listing is correct.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-live-action-legend-of-zelda-film-is-in-production-listing-claims">The Live-Action Legend of Zelda Film Is In Production, Listing Claims</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://productionlist.com/production/the-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a listing from ProductionList</a>, it says that Sony’s The Legend of Zelda is now in production. If true, this means that casting and crew have been assigned and filming has begun. The filming dates are from November 4th, 2025, to April 7th, 2026. As for where it’s set to film, the site lists Wellington, New Zealand. Wellington is a major hub for movies like Avatar, The Lord of the Rings, and King Kong, so it makes sense for The Legend of Zelda to be there.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that Nintendo has not confirmed that filming has started, so take the news with a grain of salt until then. However, seeing as the world of Hyrule will likely spend some time in post-production for CGI and such, filming now makes sense. The film had already been delayed from March 2027 to May 2027. Coincidentally, the movie is being filmed during the 40th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda franchise. Perhaps we could see some set photos and maybe even a teaser in early 2026? We’ll have to wait and see for now!</p>



<p>What do you think of The Legend of Zelda starting filming? Do you think the series can work in live-action? Who’s your dream Ganondorf casting? Any game you hope it adapts? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

This is a variant of Treyarch's iconic Nuketown map, which is reimagined with the aesthetics of a near-future design. Nuketown 2025 is not available at launch, but it will arrive before the start of Black Ops 7's first season of content.</p><p dir="ltr">There are 12 game modes confirmed for launch, and these are featured for the game's standard core and hardcore playlists. Many of the modes are Call of Duty staples, such as Team Deathmatch, Domination, Search and Destroy, and Hardpoint. However, Black Ops 7 does introduce the 20v20 objective-based Skirmish mode and the new Overload mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Overload is a 6v6 respawn mode that tasks teams with fighting to gain possession of an overload device. Overload begins with players rushing to grab the overload device. Once they have it, the team possessing it must protect the carrier as they attempt to bring it to a designated zone. Overload is a back-and-forth game of attack and defend, and this is also the new competitive game mode for the Call of Duty League.</p><h2 dir="ltr">All MP game modes at launch:</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Overload</li><li dir="ltr">Team Deathmatch</li><li dir="ltr">Domination</li><li dir="ltr">Search and Destroy</li><li dir="ltr">Kill Confirmed</li><li dir="ltr">Free-for-All</li><li dir="ltr">Hardpoint</li><li dir="ltr">Kill Order</li><li dir="ltr">Control</li><li dir="ltr">Face Off Moshpit</li><li dir="ltr">Skirmish (20v20)</li><li dir="ltr">Gunfight (2v2)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4597139-bo7-rfl-multiplayer-027.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597139" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4597139-bo7-rfl-multiplayer-027.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597139"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 7 operators</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4597139-bo7-rfl-multiplayer-027.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 has 24 playable operators, but not all of them are available right away. Some operators are available immediately, while others require specific unlock criteria to be accomplished.

"The explosion for really amazing new games, which we're already seeing and it's gonna continue growing markedly, it's going to put the importance of AI-driven discovery ever more in the forefront."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bromberg's reasoning is that Unity is in a position to help developers and publishers sort through what is a difficult market, because there will be "so much more content" in an already competitive marketplace. "We think we have a role to play in helping our customers take advantage of that growing path," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is related to a previous remark during the earnings call, in which the CEO spoke about Unity's goal for the democratization of game development that can allow individuals to "build a game that millions of people can play," after mentioning recent examples of Unity-made successful titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which surpassed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/peak-has-surpassed-4-5m-sales-within-a-month">4.5 million sales within a month</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ball x Pit</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which sold over 400,000 copies on its first week (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BALLxPIT/status/1981449708787659090">via the official account on X</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), amid others.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-collect-the-data-and-share-the-data-how-can-game-companies-support-women-with-leadership-ambitions-" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Collect the data and share the data:' How can game companies support women with leadership ambitions?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As such, Bromberg posited that we're seeing a "kind of next turn of the wheel" now, in which "AI technologies are gonna allow us to make that game development process ever more accessible," adding that these tools will allow developers to spend less time "mired in the start line" of building features and functionalities to spend time "innovating" instead. This also includes offering tools to non-software developers and content creators to push for interactive short-form content.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unity's third-quarter financials &quot;exceeded expectations&quot; thanks to Vector AI and &quot;continued strength&quot; in Create">Unity's third-quarter financials "exceeded expectations" thanks to Vector AI and "continued strength" in Create</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bromberg's comments don't come as a surprise, considering Unity has been leaning heavily on AI.

This was driven by "strong growth in subscription revenue, offset by decreases in consumption services revenue, driven by our portfolio reset."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, Grow Solutions revenue was $318 million, up 6 percent year-over-year. This increase was driven by "strong performance of the Unity Ad Network, powered by Unity Vector."

While runtime data is a multi-year growth opportunity for the company, absent any contribution, Unity is "confident" on the growth trajectory of Vector.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked about how the revenue from Solutions excluding Unity Vector did in the quarter, and how to think about that long-term, whether it'll see growth or stay flat, Bromberg said the company isn't reporting breakdowns in ad revenue.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-persona-5-series-has-sold-over-13-million-copies" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Persona 5 series has sold over 13 million copies</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I would say in general we couldn't be more proud of the progress we're making across the entire segment, we're seeing really positive trends across all of our ad businesses, and we expect that number to grow over time, but beyond that I don't think we want to comment too much," he said.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>When Square Enix announced <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> during a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-is-a-remake-of-the-classic-rpg">Nintendo Direct held in September</a>, players were left with all kinds of questions regarding this remake. <em>Game Informer </em>has learned quite a lot about the game after visiting Square Enix's Tokyo, Japan, offices last month <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">for the latest magazine cover story</a>, and we'll be sharing details all month long.&nbsp;</p><p>Curiously, many Dragon Quest fans have questions about the game's producer, Takeshi Ichikawa. He's a relative newcomer, at least in a role capacity as large as producer, which means his job is to help get Reimagined across the finish line as a successful business product (rather than a work of art, which Ichikawa tells me is the job of the game's director, Masato Yagi). On <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/1051523/takeshi-ichikawa/">Moby Games</a>, which is a database that tracks the credits of developers, Ichikawa has a special thanks credit on last year's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest III: HD-2D Remake</a>, a staff credit on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/dragon-quest-monsters-the-dark-prince/a-surprisingly-common-experience">Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-quest-treasures">Dragon Quest Treasures</a>, and assistant producer credits on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-an-elusive-age">Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-quest-builders-2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a>, which is seemingly the first game he ever received a credit in.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z13aCVkZaaw?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z13aCVkZaaw?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>During my visit to Square Enix's Shibuya offices, I interviewed Ichikawa (and various other team members working on Reimagined) for hours, and I learned a lot about him. Here's what I learned:&nbsp;</p><h3>Ichikawa's Start In Game Development</h3><p>"I've been playing video games all my life, ever since I was a student, and then ever since then, I have always had this dream of becoming a game developer and becoming involved with the game industry," Ichikawa tells me. "So I wanted to be a game developer, a creator myself. I interviewed at a lot of video game publishers and developers, and in the end, I had the opportunity to work for Square Enix, and that's how I started my career. And at the time, I was asked by my boss what kind of game I wanted to make, and I responded, 'I'll do anything,' and that's how they put me into the Dragon Quest team."</p>

<p>Though he eagerly said, "I'll do anything," Ichikawa tells me he had a goal of working on the Dragon Quest series because of his childhood fascination with it. "I was fascinated by the story focus," he says. "As a kid, I actually really liked playing Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Wonderland, so it is a great joy for me to be involved with the series."&nbsp;</p><p>Ichikawa tells me he was born the same year Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride launched in Japan, but he thinks his generation's Dragon Quest is Dragon Quest VII: Warriors of Eden and Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King. "You know, the later installments in the series," he adds. "I hadn't had much chance to play the older ones, so after I joined the company, I started playing the older mainline titles."&nbsp;</p><h3>Remaking Dragon Quest VII</h3>

<p>I ask Ichikawa if, given his history with Dragon Quest, it's intimidating to remake a pretty beloved game in the series. He says there is certainly pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>"There certainly was that pressure, considering that Dragon Quest VII is actually the best-performing PlayStation title in history [<strong>Editor's Note: </strong>I didn't catch this mid-interview, but I presume he's referring to Japanese sales numbers – not worldwide, as Dragon Quest VII is not the best-performing PlayStation title in history worldwide]," he tells me. "When I first started the project, there were certainly pressures of how much I can actually alter or change with this remake. But after I started talking with Horii-san, he was actually pretty open to a lot of ideas, and even some you could consider very ambitious [<strong>Editor's Note:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/11/04/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-have-a-new-never-before-seen-conclusion">a new, never-before-seen conclusion</a> is pretty ambitious, I'd say]. I did have a lot of fun working on this."&nbsp;</p><p>I took this opportunity to ask Yuji Horii, the creator of Dragon Quest, who is seated beside Ichikawa during this duo interview, how he feels seeing Dragon Quest VII remade by a new generation of developers. He calls it an "interesting sight to see."&nbsp;</p><p>"Way back then, when I originally created the original title, there were a lot of platform limitations at that time," Horii says. "We were confined a lot [...] so seeing this new generation of creators reimagining [I know Square Enix's PR loved this nod] and remaking these titles, it's an interesting sight to see; to see them create a modern remake for the current generation of titles."</p><p>I follow up by asking Ichikawa what his initial discussions with Horii were like regarding the remake of Dragon Quest VII. He tells me their conversations focused on three components:&nbsp;</p><p>"I had three components I wanted to propose to him," Ichikawa says. "The first one was the visuals of the game, so we proposed the handcrafted doll style of the game. We also wanted to suggest making some adjustments to the scenario, to the narrative of the game. And the third [component] being the adjustments made to battles and combat. For the scenario, Horii-san was welcoming to the changes, and he gave me the okay. For the battle, the only feedback he had was he just wanted us to make sure the combat wasn't too convoluted –&nbsp;he wanted to make sure it was easy to digest and understandable to players."&nbsp;</p><h3>Why Ichikawa</h3>

<p>I'm jumping ahead here, but at the end of my interview with Horii and Ichikawa, I ask the former about the latter's work producing Reimagined.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm incredibly, incredibly happy that these two [<strong>Editor's Note: </strong>the other person being Reimagined director Masato Yagi] are working on the Reimagined title," Horii says. "I like the doll aesthetics, the handcrafted style; I also like the diorama elements on the field. I was playing the game, and it was just really fun to even just walk around a field. So yeah, I'm really happy that these two are taking the helm."&nbsp;</p><p>I ask Ichikawa how that makes him feel, recognizing that I'm probably embarrassing him with this question.&nbsp;</p><p>"I am super happy," Ichikawa says with a beaming smile, an embarrassed laugh, and a reserved humility.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ichikawa's First Dragon Quest</h3>

<p>"Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry's Wonderland was my first ever Dragon Quest title, and I was actually still in Kindergarten; it was actually before I even started in elementary school," Ichikawa tells me. "So I didn't really have a full understanding of what the story was about, but I do remember the battle system, like the monsters fighting each other was just so fun to me. And then one of the features of Terry's Wonderland is that you can actually acquire monsters on the field to join your party. One of the very first monsters that I obtained or acquired was the [Garuda], and it's actually my favorite monster to this day."&nbsp;</p><p>From here, I ask Ichikawa about growing up in Japan and seeing Dragon Quest's continued rise in the country (and worldwide).&nbsp;</p><p>"I've witnessed firsthand how Dragon Quest is such a huge cultural phenomenon, but I think one of the really strong points about Dragon Quest is the story, because even if a child plays it, I think the story can really resonate with them," Ichikawa tells me. "Even playing as an adult, it's still good, [and] seeing those stories as an adult really adds another layer of depth that you never got to feel when you were a kid. So I think the fact that it resonates with generations of players – not just kids, but also adults – I think that's really one of the strong points of the series."&nbsp;</p><h3>Ichikawa's Development History</h3>

<p>I note to Ichikawa that his history in game development only spans back to 2018, based on official findings available online; I ask if that's the case.</p><p>"This is my seventh year in the game industry, and as mentioned in my earlier responses, the very first title I worked on was Dragon Quest Builders 2 [released in 2018]," he tells me. "And then I worked on Dragon Quest XI S, the multiplatform release of Dragon Quest XI. So for those two titles, I served as the assistant producer, whereas for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, I'm working on the title as the producer of the game. When I was working as the assistant producer for Dragon Quest Builders 2 and Dragon Quest XI S, I had a really different perspecitve – I would focus more on the day-to-day operation as part of the development team, whereas being the producer of one game, not the assistant producer, means I have to oversee everything, including all of the development team as well."&nbsp;</p><h3>The Slime</h3>

<p>I couldn't talk to people developing a Dragon Quest game without asking about the series' most iconic monster, the slime. Here's what Ichikawa has to say about it:&nbsp;</p><p>"Since I was young, at the time, the slime was already the iconic character that it is today, but one thing that I recall was that I saw a lot of slime merchandise in stores and such, and I [liked that] there were variations to the slime, too," he says. "One thing I really recall thinking is that, 'Oh, since it's a gooey character, that means it has the versatility to adapt into a lot of different things,' so that was one thing that impressed me with it."&nbsp;</p><h3>His Favorite Aspect of Dragon Quest</h3>

<p>When I ask Ichikawa why he thinks the Dragon Quest series continues to be the cultural phenomenon it is today, he explains it's the "Horii-esque" elements.&nbsp;</p><p>"I think all the RPG elements the series has to offer are the biggest strength of the Dragon Quest series, and I like to call it part of the Horii-esque elements," he says. "All the humor, the jokes in the narrative, the dialogue, and the expressions and the portrayals; It's just so adorable at times, and when you look at the story, it's an epic story but also somehow feels relevant to you at the time."&nbsp;</p><hr><p>I hope this feature gives you some more clarity about who Ichikawa is and why he's producing Dragon Quest VII Reimagined.

            <p>
There are many words that could be said, and I'll attempt to say a few of them here, on the gamification of both menial labour and tasks, but it is always fascinating to me when a new game crops up that somehow makes me go "oh, sure, why not!" Today that applies to a game called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/leaf-blower-co">Leaf Blower Co.</a>, which is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> game about exactly what you'd expect (blowing leaves) and I suppose not what you expect (blowing paper boats and coconuts).
</p>
<p>
I bring your attention to Leaf Blower Co. because it just released a release date - November 17th, later this month, very seasonally appropriate - but also because of how specific a task it is. Said task is one that is, as many of these games often are, satisfying. Hurray, no more leaves on my front lawn, and I did so by blowing them around, what fun! It is also the kind of task that many of us who face this problem will inevitably put off until it is not so putoffable.

<p>
Here though, there is an opportunity to do it recreationally, without the requirement of physical effort, and no so to speak real-world punishment (messy lawn your neighbour doesn't like and moans about at you) for not finishing or even starting it.
</p><p>
You don't have to just blow the leaves in Leaf Blower Co. You can jump in them, of course, or burn them, rake them, suck them up, magnetise them. Not entirely sure how that last one works, but the world of video game logic is infinitely confusing, so we'll put that to the side. There are secrets to discover too apparently, one of the trailers on Steam shows that you can, quite quietly, play a bunch of different horns that all toot one note by blowing into them with your blower.
</p>
<p>
There is some of that ickiness that can come with these games, in that the goal is to build up your leaf blowing business. I think games like these often end up becoming so popular because they are (almost) tangible ways to accomplish these tasks that in reality we just might not be able to because of external factors like mental and physical health, or a simple lack of time due to feeding that disgusting beast called capitalism. So, I don't entirely judge games like Leaf Blower Co., I do think it looks like a relaxing time, but I wonder how we can reframe, or even just frame, ideas of what relaxing is or could be.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, as mentioned, Leaf Blower Co. is out November 17th, and you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571710/Leaf_Blower_Co/">here</a>.

              <p>I often have to play a game for a few hours before I feel confident in saying I liked it or didn’t like it. Before I can say this is good or this is bad. Sometimes you play a game that, within 20 minutes or less, makes it clear that it ain’t very good. Sadly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-cthulu-sure-lets-do-it-1841477897"><em>Dead Static Drive</em></a> was one of those games.</p> <p><em>Dead Static Drive </em>has been in some form of development for <a href="https://www.killscreen.com/dead-static-drive-road-trip-horror-vintage-americana-style/">nearly a decade</a> and has repeatedly gone viral online thanks to its eye-catching art style. And now the isometric survival horror game is out on Xbox, PC, and Game Pass. Often marketed as “<a href="https://www.deadstaticdrive.com/">Grand Theft Cthulu</a>,” <em>Dead Static Drive </em>has you stealing cars, completing missions, and exploring a monster-infested world that provides a lot of freedom to go where you want to go while trying to gather the supplies you need to stay alive. It’s a cool idea, for sure, but it never comes together. Most of this game doesn’t really work, and with the exception of <em>Dead Static Drive</em>‘s wonderful low-poly art style, there’s little about this game that I enjoyed.</p>

  <p>The biggest issue I encountered is how horrible it feels to drive cars in the newly released game. In something describing itself as Grand Theft Chthulu, I expected the cars to handle well and feel fun to drive around desolate cities and highways. Nope! No matter what camera or controller settings I changed, driving in <em>Dead Static Drive</em> is a mess. I never felt in control of any vehicle I entered, and getting around corners without crashing proved to be the biggest challenge. I’m also baffled by the decision not to include any engine noises. The first time I got into a car and drove off, I assumed the game had bugged out and the car should be making noise. Restarted, tried a different car, and nope. Nothing. Silence. I looked at other people’s gameplay and it turns out that this isn’t a bug, but a design choice. And it’s odd! This robs the different cars you encounter of a lot of the personality and makes the game feel unfinished.</p>

 <p>A lot of this game feels unfinished, though, so that’s probably why I assumed the missing audio was a bug at first. Combat is a slog, animations are clunky, quests break all the time, and NPCs get stuck on geometry. The inventory screen seems half-finished, missing features like “Quick Move” which makes managing all the gubbins you find annoying as heck on a controller. Characters also don’t have voice lines, which could have been fine, but in a game where cars make no noise beyond tire squeals and the world around you is empty, it just leads to <em>Dead Static Driv</em>e being a boring experience.</p> <p>After about three hours of playing <em>Dead Static Drive</em>, I pulled over and got out. It’s a shame because the world looks amazing, and I like the premise a lot, but what’s here just isn’t worth any more time.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a> <span>is an incredibly dense RPG, and I’m sure there are still players who have yet to see everything in Larian Studio’s </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </span></i><span>adventure. However, for the sickos who have been combing through the game for two years and wish they had a reason to go back to it, a group of dedicated fan modders is working on what is essentially the expansion Larian chose not to make.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Path to Menzoberranzan” is an entirely fan-made campaign separate from the story and characters of </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>. Around 130 modders are working on this original tale. Though the full campaign is still far off, the alpha is projected to launch in the “first half of 2026,” and will include the mod’s prologue chapter. As the name suggests, the mod’s campaign will take players to Menzoberranzan, a prominent Drow city in the fantastical world of Faerûn. Even if you’re a casual Forgotten Realms fan, you might have heard about the city from </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>companion Minthara, who originated from the city before becoming a pawn of the Absolute.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Though it remains to be seen if the campaign will have any overt references to the main game’s crew, “Path to Menzoberranzan” will feature an entirely new cast of characters, each with an original backstory and voice acting. While development is ongoing, the team is still actively recruiting team members, auditioning voice actors, and providing semi-regular updates on </span><a href="https://discord.com/invite/ptm"><span>its Discord server</span></a><span>. So if you’re looking for something to do while you wait for whatever Larian is working on next, here’s another </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>project to distract you.</span></p> <p><span>Despite </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>’s resounding success, Larian seems to be done with the series and is instead </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-director-teases-next-crazy-thing-sequel-2000614546"><span>working on two new </span></a><a href="http://projects.we/"><span>projects</span></a><span>. We don’t know what either of them is yet, but the team is likely much further along than the ideation phase it was in when Larian </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-next-game-excalibur-1851509450"><span>first started discussing these games last year</span></a><span>. Despite moving on from the game, Larian put out some massive patches and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-notes-crossplay-photo-mode-1851776211"><span>free updates for </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a><span>, so if you haven’t played it since launch, there’s plenty new to see.</span></p>

            <p>
It's hard to believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-zoo">Planet Zoo</a> - still the best of developer Frontier's modern-day management sims - is six years old. But six it is, and today's birthday celebrations have brought major news, confirming a sequel is on the way.
</p>
<p>
Planet Zoo launched back in November 2019, bringing the striking presentation and rich customisation of its sister game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a>, to the world of zoo management. It was brilliant stuff; gorgeous (just look at those animals!) but with a rock-solid management core. In the six years since, Planet Zoo has received 20 expansion packs - adding new animals, new campaign scenarios, and new themed scenery - and it's even come to consoles too.
</p>
<p>
But there's still more in store for Planet Zoo, as teased in the game's newly released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0S7C8alumY">sixth anniversary trailer</a>. It concludes with a ticker counting up through the years from 2019 to 2026, after which all but one number fades away - the number two. And if the implication wasn't obvious enough, Frontier <a href="https://www.planetzoogame.com/news/celebrating-six-years-planet-zoo">made a more explicit announcement</a> on its website.
</p>

<p>
"Since we launched Planet Zoo back in 2019 we've been blown away by the creativity, passion and dedication of you, the community," the studio wrote. "But what does the future hold? Well, today we are delighted to reveal that we are hard at work on a sequel to Planet Zoo! We're really excited about this project, and we look forward to sharing more with you next year!"
</p><p>
It's not entirely clear if Planet Zoo 2 is <em>launching</em> next year, or if that's purely when Frontier will start talking about it, but it'll certainly be interesting to see how the studio plans to meaningfully build on the already pretty definitive first game, particularly after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-review">disappointing Planet Coaster sequel</a>. Here's hoping it can do the excellent original proud! And also for flying birds.
