            <p>Good news for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-ultrawide-gaming-monitors">ultrawide monitor</a>-owning Nic Reubens of the world: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will, unlike its narrow-eyed predecessor, natively support stretchy displays up to the 21:9 format when it finally releases tomorrow. Silksong marketing-man-at-large Matthew Griffin shared some demonstrative screenshots <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1963104885722730672">on Xitter</a>, confirming that it won’t require any of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1566566333">weird bodging</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> did to fill out those bigger screens.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Maybe that’s not of great concern to the metroidvaning masses: Steam’s most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">hardware survey</a> suggests that players whose primary monitor tots up to either 2560x1080 or 3440x1440, the two most common 21:9 resolutions, make for less than 4% of users. But dammit, accounting and accommodating for offbeat niches is what PC gaming does best, and Silksong launching with ultrawide support indicates it was built as such from the start. That’s important, as modding in or otherwise forcing ultrawide ratios on games that weren’t expecting them can sometimes reveal, around the edges, visual clunkiness that innocent 16:9 eyes were never meant to see. Unloaded chunks of level, enemies whose animations haven’t started yet, that sort of thing.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Team Cherry</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s the second positive update on Silksong’s techy credentials in recent days, after it was quietly marked as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> Verified on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/">Steam store page</a>. That was arguably more of a formality, given the original runs and controls just fine on Valve’s handheld, and Silksong (while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-faster-prettier-and-harder-yet-still-feels-like-a-safe-sequel">prettier to my eyes</a>) doesn’t seem to make much in the way of extra hardware demands. Though speaking of resolutions, Hollow Knight never officially supported the Deck’s 16:10 aspect ratio either – I confess that I forgot to check this when I played Silksong at Gamescom last month, but you’d think that if 21:9 is doable, 16:10 would be an absolute doddle.</p>
<p>We’ll find out tomorrow (Thursday 4th September), I suppose, when Silksong finally beats the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-videogame-vapourware-no-silksong-allowed-edition">vapourware</a> allegations. Here be the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-time">exact release times</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-hints-that-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-was-unfinished/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-hints-that-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-was-%E2%80%98unfinished%E2%80%99.1287243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is likely going to go down as Hideo Kojima’s final-ever MGS title. The director has since moved on to create Kojima Productions, but an interesting social media post from him seemingly reaffirms a long-standing theory.</p>



<p>The Phantom Pain is still an unbelievable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid</a> game. Its open nature and complete freedom and flexibility to complete MGS missions in all-new ways were another evolutionary step forward for the series. If you’ve played it, though, you’ll know the game’s final official moments are abrupt and, dare I say, unfinished?</p>







<figure><figcaption>We nearly had it all. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-written-concept-death-stranding-3-wont-make/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> has been quick to distance himself from his former work in recent times—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wont-play-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he won’t play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. After all, why wouldn’t he? <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-tops-uk-physical-sales-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a> is another acclaimed piece of media, and Kojima is busy working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojimas-od-is-reportedly-safe-from-recent-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OD</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Physint</a>.</p>



<p>But a September 3 post from Kojima seems to highlight and double down on the notion that Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain was incomplete when it was released. Kojima natively posted an article by <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/metal-gear-solid-v-phantom-pain-hideo-kojima-anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inverse</a> to his X account: “10 Years Later, Hideo Kojima’s Unfinished Masterpiece Is Still Influencing Games Today.”</p>



<p>This is likely Kojima hinting at the theory that a whole chapter was missing at the end of The Phantom Pain. Kojima and Konami infamously fell out toward the end of The Phantom Pain’s development, and necessary missions and storytelling ended up on the cutting-room floor.</p>



<p>The Phantom Pain’s original Collector’s Edition notoriously featured concept art and footage of the unfinished episode, which supposedly wrapped up the game’s story. To this day, The Phantom Pain is considered an incomplete and unfinished game, which is unfortunate, as it’s probably the last piece of Kojima-created MGS content we’ll ever get.</p>







<p>Do you still enjoy The Phantom Pain even with its missing content? Are you still hoping and praying that Kojima makes another MGS title one day? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced another game coming to the mature corner of its Switch Online subscription service. That game is shooter Forsaken 64, which first released on Nintendo 64 all the way back in 1998.</p>
<p>When Forsaken 64 arrives on 4th September, it will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-adds-mature-games-selection-starting-with-perfect-dark-and-turok">join the likes of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Perfect Dark for those members aged 17 and up</a>.</p>

<p>"You are a ruthless mercenary, sent to the condemned remains of Earth as part of a covert operation codenamed Forsaken," the official blurb teases. "Your mission is to infiltrate and destroy the last bastions of the mechanised terror that wiped out all life on the planet. Earth is a death trap riddled with merciless mechanoid adversaries and gangs of rival bounty hunters, and you'll have to brave them all astride your anti-grav pioncycle to make your fortune...or meet your doom." Sounds chill.</p>
<p>As per Nintendo, players will be able to join in either single or multiplayer mode. "Then, select your bike," the company says, noting that each bike has different attributes, and each biker has a "different attitude". So, just find the one you vibe with the most, and drive on into the fray.</p>
<p>"The availability of weapons, enemies, and powerups changes depending on the level you play, so stay sharp," Nintendo closes. You can check out a trailer for Forsaken 64 below.</p>

            <p>Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot could have been saved from cancellation by Take-Two.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through">Bloomberg</a>, the publishing giant was in talks with Embracer - which owns Perfect Dark co-development studio Crystal Dynamics - and was willing to acquire the project from Microsoft. Had this deal gone through, the plan would have been for Take-Two to then fund and publish Perfect Dark itself.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>However, according to Bloomberg's sources, this deal was ultimately never realised due to "disagreements over long-term ownership of the Perfect Dark franchise". Crystal Dynamics was therefore forced to abandon the game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">lay off staff towards the end of last month</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-announced">Perfect Dark reboot was initially announced back in 2020</a>, with Microsoft studio The Initiative set to lead development. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-co-developed-by-crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics was then brought in to support</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>The reboot did not have a smooth time of things, however, and in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-made-little-meaningful-progress-since-2020-reveal">it was said "little meaningful progress" had been made</a>. In 2024, it was then said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-in-a-very-rough-state-and-a-big-protracted-mess">Perfect Dark had become "a big, protracted mess"</a>, and was in a "rough state".</p><p>Things seemed to be taking a turn for the better later that year, though, and we were treated to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/at-long-last-the-perfect-dark-reboot-gets-a-first-gameplay-trailer">first gameplay trailer for Perfect Dark</a>. However, this glimmer of hope was soon extinguished, and in July of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Microsoft pulled the plug on Perfect Dark and closed down The Initiative</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We all love a new MMORPG, but what about testing a new one out before it launches? Chinese publisher Netease are on something of a tear lately, with the recent launches of Destiny: Legacy and Fragpunk sitting alongside huge hits like the Overwatch-eradicating Marvel Rivals. While they remain mobile specialists, Sword of Justice is a brand new Chinese-influenced MMORPG which is coming to both mobile platforms and PC, and it’s looking spectacular. If MMORPGs are your sort of thing, as of today you can <a href="https://qnv2.ux-jp-01.easebar.com/qnv2/a553d3e2-50a1-4860-8f35-3f9aef06139e/?shortlink=cdens2o1&amp;c=PR%20Pitch&amp;pid=CBT%20PR%20Pitch&amp;af_xp=custom&amp;source_caller=ui#/">sign up for the upcoming closed beta</a> which starts on the 26th of September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sword of Justice - Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ob_tjShS5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Developed by ZhuRong Studio, as the team head towards Sword of Justice’s international launch, the Closed Beta Test will take place on a North-American server, with players from the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil able to experience the game. The Closed Beta Test will start on September 26th at 10:30 AM EDT and you can <a href="https://mail.yahoo.com/d/folders/1/messages/AOp8cjmuZ2gpK30GMV29XNhi5Ng?.intl=uk&amp;.lang=en-GB#:~:text=https%3A//swordofjustice.onelink.me/PNY2/cdens2o1">sign up for the beta</a> until September 16th at 11:59 AM EDT.</p>
<p>Sword of Justice is an open world MMORPG for PC and mobile devices that’s completely free to play, with the team promising that there are no pay-to-win elements. Set in a world inspired by the Northern Song Dynasty in 12th-century China, Sword of Justice allows players to live out their martial arts dreams in a stunning Eastern aesthetic world. It does look deeply impressive, and, as we’re seeing with titles like Infinity Nikki, mobile games are pushing the envelope in terms of gameplay and visuals to a point where they sit happily alongside fully fledged consoles.</p>


<p>A major feature that players can experience in the Sword of Justice Closed Beta Test is the implementation of path tracing on PC and ray tracing on mobile devices. Path-tracing is a visually stunning effect, offering near-photorealistic reflections and lighting. Coupled with the game’s dynamic weather system, Sword of Justice offers gorgeous visuals that they liken to CGI movies, providing an ultra-realistic presentation of its world. If your phone is up to snuff, it’s well worth checking out, just to see how far the technology has come.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in finding out more, there’s plenty of information on the <a href="http://swordofjustice.com/en/index.html">official website</a>. We’ll definitely be watching this one with interest!</p>

            <p>
Another one for the "not news, but news to me" pile: you can download a free updated version of classic 4X space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim Starships Unlimited from creator Andrew "APEzone" Paul Ewanchyna's website. Originally released in 1999 - an era of relative mental calm, before the Broadband Blight - it's a turn-based affair with four ages of technology to discover, a range of alien factions who (in the original version, anyway) all look like gurning hoover attachments, and the prospect of zesty tactical combat involving ships of your own design. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There are few pleasures in the games journalist's life richer and more poignant than the opportunity to write about a game you'd totally forgotten you played. I didn't recognise Starship Unlimited at first, when I saw it on the 4X subreddit. The madeleine-soaked-in-tea moment was a screenshot of ships in orbit featuring firing ranges - arcs and wedges of yellow, red and green painted onto an invisible tabletop around each craft. I adored those firing ranges as a kid. I used to field highly specialised fleets consisting of acutely near-sighted, 360-degree firing escort cruisers and tunnel-vision artillery vessels that couldn't win a dogfight against a cactus.
</p>
<p>
The free version <a href="https://apezone.com/posts/201114/">available on APEzone's site</a> is Starships Unlimited 3.5 - sadly, Ewanchyna doesn't seem to have preserved the older versions, including the one I played with the (imo) very <em>best</em> nozzle-faced aliens. If you're interested, you'll need to sign up with your email to access the download page.</p>
<p>As ever with these projects, part of the thrill is the weird time-traveller condescension that comes from digesting a set of two-decades old system requirements. 50MB of HD space? Woah, guess I'll have to suck it up and delete my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> install. 64MB of RAM? I'd better close all applications before starting this game. Vintage spec sheet notwithstanding, Starship Unlimited seems to run happily enough on a current-gen Windows PC, like the Dell thinkpad I'm writing this on.
</p>
<p>
Stumbling on this has charged my torpedo tubes and suffused my phaser banks with rampant enthusiasm for games involving genuinely tactical fleet combat. Any lesser-known favourites you'd like to share? Anything new and unexpected, or old and unfairly overlooked?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With the Little Nightmares series, Swedish development studio Tarsier Studios entered the map of survival horror fans with some rather unique experiences that managed to blend the genre's staples with some puzzle and platforming elements that made the franchise rather popular. Having had to leave the franchise behind after getting acquired by Amplifier Game Invest in late 2019, Tarsier Studios started working on Reanimal, a survival horror game featuring everything that made their survival horror series so popular, with some choice enhancements, including co-op.</p>



<p>Although Tarsier Studios isn't adding co-op as an answer to Supermassive Games doing the same in the third entry in the series the Swedish studio has created launching this year, the gameplay similarities between Reanimal and Little Nightmares 3 were uncanny, with setting and characters doing most of the differentiating work. In the Tarsier Studios' developed game, two players, or a player with an AI-controlled partner, will take on the role of an unnamed brother and sister as they traverse a hellish version of their home and attempt to save three friends. As they make their dangerous journey through this world, the two will have to cooperate to solve puzzles, which include activating different contraptions at the same time, moving objects to create platforms upon which the other can climb to reach important items or switches, and avoiding getting captured by massive enemies.</p>

</figure>



<p>Beginning after getting stranded on a beach, the Reanimal Gamescom demo provided a decent look at the game and what its co-op-focused experience offered. While the puzzles were nicely designed, but not very surprising, I felt the game was at its best during a hectic escape sequence where the players had to combine stealth and platforming to escape from a nicely designed and animated giant doll-like creature.  These escaping sequences were undoubtedly the highlight of the short demo, and the most hilarious, which made it easy to look past the puzzle design, which was too familiar at times, even with the tweaks made necessary by the co-op approach of the game.</p>



<p>Familiar is possibly the best way to describe what I have seen of Reanimal during this year's Gamescom. While an around 20-min session is obviously not enough to paint a whole picture, there's no denying that Tarsier Studio's first game after the Little Nightmares series will not disappoint fans of the series looking for an experience carrying the developer's trademark style when it launches sometime next year on PC and consoles.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft%E2%80%99s-2026-27-lineup-includes-new-ghost-recon-far-cry-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-more.1287204/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned insider Tom Henderson has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-rayman-games-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided</a> an overview of Ubisoft's 2026-27 game lineup, which includes several new installments in big franchises.</p>



<p>According to Henderson's sources, the next Ghost Recon game is reportedly called Project Ovr and may ditch the AnvilNext 2.0 engine in favor of Epic's Unreal Engine 5. The game is also supposedly switching perspectives: the most recent games, 2017's Ghost Recon: Wildlands and 2019's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint, used a third-person view with an optional first-person view only available when aiming weapons. However, most of the previous entries in the 24-year-old franchise were in first-person, and Project Ovr should return to those historical roots. </p>



<p>Ubisoft is also making two new Far Cry games, which in itself is entirely unsurprising. It's one of the publisher's most successful franchises, as evidenced by Far Cry being one of only three IPs (the others being Rainbow Six and Assassin's Creed) that were deemed critical <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when establishing the new subsidiary</a>. About a year ago, job ads for a new Far Cry title were <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-far-cry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> online. Tom Henderson revealed that the two projects are codenamed Blackbird and Maverick, with the former being a regular sequel and the latter an extraction shooter that could be canceled before actually launching. There's also supposed to be an engine change here from the proprietary Dunia to Massive's Snowdrop.</p>



<p>Then there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-project-red-japan-project-hexe-witchcraft-infinity-hub-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Hexe</a>, the next mainline Assassin's Creed game that is being spearheaded by Clint Hocking (Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, Far Cry 2, Watch Dogs: Legion). Unlike most of the recent entries in the IP, it won't have roleplaying elements. Its setting has already been announced to be dark and medieval, likely based around witch hunts, as suggested by the codename. Finally for the sequels, Henderson is adamant that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still happening.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is also looking to deliver on three long-awaited remakes: <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-continuing-to-progress-according-to-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Splinter Cell</a> (Project North), <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-it-is-still-deep-in-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia</a> (Project Rewind), and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (Project Obsidian). The remaining lineup for 2026-27 should include Assassin's Creed Invictus (the Fall Guys-like multiplayer spin-off) and two new IPs, an extraction shooter set in World War II (Project Crest) and a game inspired by Nintendo's Animal Crossing (Project Alterra). Beyond 2027, there will be more Assassin's Creed games, The Crew 3, and The Division 3.</p>



<p>What do you think of this lineup? Is there anything that excites you?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-beaten-to-steam-arena-breakout-infinite/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-being-beaten-to-the-steam-launch-punch-by-its-number-one-rival.1287201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is coming to Steam later this year, but in a new announcement, it was confirmed that it’s being beaten to the punch by its number-one competitor, Arena Breakout: Infinite. In a post on Steam, the Arena Breakout team confirmed that on September 15, ABI will hit Steam, delivering a free-to-play extraction experience to many expectant fans.</p>



<p>This does mean that those interested in extraction shooters have a couple of months to try out Arena Breakout: Infinite before Escape from Tarkov hits Steam at some point this year, after the game’s 1.0 release on November 15.</p>



<h2 id="h-arena-breakout-infinite-heads-to-steam">Arena Breakout: Infinite Heads to Steam</h2>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite has been playable for quite some time, but fans have had to use a proprietary launcher offered by MoreFun, the game’s developer. With ABI coming to Steam on September 15, one of the most popular and free extraction shooters is set to hit an entirely new audience.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Arena Breakout: Infinite is in eighth place on the Steam wishlists chart, sitting just behind ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 but ahead of Dying Light: The Beast and ARK 2.</p>



<p>It has more than <strong>two million wishlist spots</strong>. Escape from Tarkov’s Steam page isn’t yet live, so it has <strong>zero</strong>.</p>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite has managed to keep a core audience pleased over the last year or so, with MoreFun rolling out constant updates, including new maps, modes, weapons, and various collaborations. In July, the studio pushed out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinites-cyberpunk-2077-crossover-introduces-new-events-weapon-skins-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Cyberpunk 2077 crossover</a> that few people saw coming.</p>



<p>I sat down with MoreFun Studios at Gamescom 2024 to learn about some critical aspects of the game. I was interested in their rationale around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-offline-mode-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having no ‘offline mode’</a>, and learned more about their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-facul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revolutionary AI NPCs</a> that could understand live voice commands.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073620/view/496079294980687187?l=english&amp;curator_clanid=3693985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Steam</a>, MoreFun promoted the game with every ounce of pulling power possible, flexing everything available in the game when it hits full release on the platform in just a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>It might have been seen as a carbon copy for a while, and even came under fire from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-dev-arena-plagiarism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlestate Games for alleged plagiarism</a>, but Arena Breakout: Infinite has managed to hold its own over the last year or so. It looks superb on the surface, has plenty of meat on the bones, and despite some sketchy microtransactions, is <strong>free to play</strong>, and that’s a huge advantage.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Arena Breakout: Infinite on Steam when it drops on September 15? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fcd6f6dd4267/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>Resident Evil</strong> series has seen pretty strong representation on the Switch, but it's perhaps safe to say that fans aren't best pleased with some titles being relegated to 'Cloud Versions'.</p>
<p>We're still waiting to see whether Capcom is keen to re-release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">RE2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_3_-_cloud_version">RE3</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_7_biohazard_cloud">RE7</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_village_cloud">RE Village</a> natively on the Switch 2, but for now, it seems the company is <em>potentially</em> considering bringing its latest entry to Nintendo's new hardware.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is due for release on <strong>27th February 2026</strong> and, according to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Dusk Golem</a>, who has been known to leak RE news prior to official announcements, the game is supposedly being planned for release on both the Switch 2 and the PS4.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067joixmw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's what they had to say via <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963021049014190354">X</a> (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/resident-evil-requiem-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Everything</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I won't be at around the bush, Resident Evil Requiem should be releasing in PlayStation 4 &amp; Nintendo Switch 2, seems this was kinda' known behind the scenes &amp; in the grapevine.</p>
<p>"I'm not the first person to say this publicly actually, just corroborating. Talked about it with five different people in the last few weeks and know another guy with a good reputation said as much less than a week ago. So not from me, but I have been hearing the same thing.</p>
<p>"Unsure if it'll be at launch, and my guess is it'll be a different version with different tech, sorta' like the 360 / PS3 &amp; Wii / PS2 era, since some features of Requiem like ray tracing are focused on modern platforms.</p>
<p>But if the question is, is it happening or not, the answer pretty much is, yeah it's happening."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, as mentioned, if Requiem were to come to the Switch 2, then it may not release day-and-date with the scheduled launch in February. As for the visuals and performance, well... that seems somewhat obvious, right? Still, if this is true, then it's not <em>entirely</em> surprising. <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en">Capcom's president recently</a> stated that the initial response to the Switch 2 caught the company off-guard, so it seems reasonable to assume that it'll want to take advantage of the exceptionally strong sales.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem will star Grace Ashcroft, daughter of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a>'s Alyssa Ashcroft, who is instructed to investigate a series of strange deaths at the sinister Wrenwood Hotel. The game will also pay a visit to the ruined wasteland of Raccoon City, and it's heavily rumoured that RE veteran Leon Kennedy will play a role, possibly as a second playable protagonist.</p>
<p>The Resident Evil franchise will also be celebrating its 30th anniversary next year, with Capcom recently launching a <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/30th.html">dedicated website</a> to commemorate the milestone.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-76-c-a-m-p-revamp-is-out-now.1287195/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Bethesda Game Studios released a Fallout 76 update that includes a major revamp of the C.A.M.P. feature, which allows players to build their own home bases within the game world.</p>



<p>The enhancements have been detailed in an official developer preview by Fallout 76 Game Director Jon Rush:</p>



<p><em>We wanted to create an update that empowers our amazing building community by making it easier to build and giving you more tools to build with. C.A.M.P. Revamp features a revised workshop menu that streamlines navigation, allowing you to build quicker than ever before. We've arranged our thousands of items into main categories and subcategories. For example, our lighting main category now has multiple subcategories, such as freestanding lights and wall-mounted lights. An equally exciting addition within C.A.M.P. Revamp is that we're getting rid of our building restrictions regarding placement, allowing you to toggle snapping, intersecting, and free place anywhere. We see and hear you, Sky Campers. These changes allow you more freedom than ever to build in Appalachia. And to really show off our wonderful community's creativity, we'll be kicking off a series of exciting monthly camp building competitions later this year with huge prizes.</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout 76: C.A.M.P. Revamp - Developer Preview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hlz9Bqp26BU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As with any decent patch, though, C.A.M.P. Revamp doesn't actually improve just player bases in Fallout 76. For example, the Caravan event has been modified to ensure that players will get rewarded if the Brahmin is alive, even if they do not complete the route. The event now also has a maximum duration of seven minutes. </p>



<p>Item locking has been introduced as a means to prevent accidental scrapping of important items. Moreover, the developers (who have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-new-content-double-eleven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working alongside Double Eleven</a> for several years now) have pushed a new batch of combat balancing tweaks:</p>



<ul>
<li>Improving the manual aiming experience.</li>



<li>Improvements to the V.A.T.S. formula.</li>



<li>Providing significant buffs to melee and ranged weapon damage.</li>



<li>Boosts to damage-over-time effects.</li>



<li>Increases to weapon ranges.</li>

<p>The most prominent Resident Evil leaker has doubled down on the claim that Resident Evil Requiem will release on Nintendo Switch 2 and PlayStation 4, albeit with a version that has some reduced visual effects. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about this, but with new power behind the claim, Dusk Golem has stressed that ‘five different people’ have corroborated this with them.</p>



<p>Fans are sceptical about Resident Evil Requiem dropping on PlayStation 4, but for the most part, they’re welcoming the Switch 2 release claims with open arms.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-resident-evil-requiem-coming-to-ps4">Is Resident Evil Requiem Coming to PS4?</h2>



<p>In a post <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963020567076077587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a>, Dusk Golem bolstered their claim that Resident Evil Requiem, which is shaping up to be one of 2026’s most highly anticipated titles, is coming to PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I won’t beat around the bush, Resident Evil Requiem should be releasing in PlayStation 4 &amp; Nintendo Switch 2, seems this was kinda’ known behind the scenes &amp; in the grapevine. I’m not the first person to say this publicly actually, just corroborating. </p>



<p>Talked about it with five different people in the last few weeks and know another guy with a good reputation said as much less than a week ago. </p>



<p>So not from me, but I have been hearing the same thing. Unsure if it’ll be at launch, and my guess is it’ll be a different version with different tech, sorta’ like the 360/PS3 &amp; Wii/PS2 era, since some features of Requiem like ray tracing are focused on modern platforms. But if the question is, is it happening or not, the answer pretty much is, yeah it’s happening.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth highlighting a few critical points about this post before going any further. While reputable, Dusk Golem stresses that much of this post is <strong>guesswork </strong>and that the ultimate delivery is built on a foundation of ‘<strong>pretty much</strong>‘.</p>



<p>Users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6zqzw/dusk_golem_doubles_down_on_resident_evil_requiem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Reddit</a> were quick to pick up this comment and try to rationalize it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Capcom’s president said that the price point of PS5 (in Japan, but he also mentions others regions) is a “barrier” for (people to buy) Monster Hunter Wilds. He also said Switch 2 reception was ahead of their predictions.</p>



<p>It’s not so hard to guess that a PS4 or Switch 2 port is coming after that.</p>



<p>But yeah, still crazy see publishers aiming games for PS4 while we see rumors about PS6.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On August 20, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new gameplay surfaced online</a>, showcasing the stunning visuals present in Resident Evil Requiem, which was revealed in June during Summer Game Fest.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-camp-revamp-update-notes-new-season-22-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-76-c-a-m-p-revamp-adds-long-awaited-features-to-build-mode.1287177/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout 76 continues to live its best life, with Bethesda Game Studios pouring updates into the MMORPG ecosystem and fleshing out the post-apocalyptic landscape that joined the franchise way back in 2018. The latest update, C.A.M.P. Revamp, adds new build rules, a reworked UI, item locking, and introduces Season 22: Appalachian Modern Living.</p>



<p>This supersized update (1.7.21.25) is available to download now, and it’s set to change how you build C.A.M.P.s in Bethesda’s popular open-world multiplayer shooter that was, once upon a time, hugely divisive. It’s now the number-one played major Fallout game, how about that?</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-76-update-1-7-21-25-notes-in-full">Fallout 76 Update 1.7.21.25 Notes in Full</h2>



<p>In a post <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1962933445375480295" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a>, the team at Bethesda Game Studios outlined everything added in the C.A.M.P. Revamp update.</p>



<p>I have to lead with this, as I’m particularly excited about it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Snapping Items</strong></p>



<p>Items can still snap together in the way that they used to, but now items that used to require snapping are allowed to not snap. Over-snapping your walls to get wallpaper on both sides is also possible now. Walls can also be built beneath the floor, and upper floors can be attached to walls without the need for a staircase.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you know how insane it is that we can now add wallpaper to <strong>both sides of the wall?</strong> That has been a bugbear for me since day dot, and I’m so happy it has now finally been resolved.</p>



<p>Players will now also be able to alter the rules that control their C.A.M.P. builds, choosing between three new options:</p>



<ul>
<li>Snap Mode (Normal) – Place items the way you’re used to.</li>



<li>Collision Mode – Items will not auto-snap but will consider collisions.</li>



<li>Free Mode – No snapping and no collisions.</li>
</ul>



<p>Placement restrictions have also been opened up, which means that players can make some items float or break the rules of physics to create more interesting, free-flowing builds. Foundations have also been adjusted so that items that <strong>used to require </strong>them no longer will.</p>



<p>Before we go any further, here are the update sizes for 1.7.21.25:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC (Steam)</strong>: 9.9 GB</li>



<li><strong>PC (Microsoft Store)</strong>: 23 GB</li>



<li><strong>Xbox</strong>: 26.4 GB</li>



<li><strong>PlayStation</strong>: 25.6 GB</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-workshop-2-0-explained">Workshop 2.0 Explained</h3>



<p>Fallout 76 now has ‘Workshop 2.0’ in this latest update:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Coming along in this update is a complete rework of the Workshop menu! With a refreshed focus on findability and organization, this new UI should make it a lot easier for you to get to the items you need. We’ve been testing this internally and are excited for you to get your hands on it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This update incorporates a stack of new categories and subcategories, and there are <strong>dozens </strong>of them to make searching for and controlling furniture and item types a more granular process.</p>



<p>The modify menu has also received a sizeable facelift, with edit mode, wallpapers, locks, and blueprints all being overhauled. The team has also added a ‘Replace’ mode, which allows you to swap placed items without needing to scrap and rebuild them. Again, that’s a lifesaver for avid C.A.M.P. builders.</p>



<h2 id="h-elsewhere-in-the-season-22-update">Elsewhere in the Season 22 Update</h2>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios also added Item Locking as part of the update that introduces Season 22: Appalachian Modern Living:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Say <strong>NO</strong> to accidental scrapping because you can now protect your favorite items by locking them!</p>



<p>Lock your weapons, lock your armor, lock your Power Armor. Heck, you can even lock your meds too!</p>



<p>This new feature will prevent locked items from being sold, scrapped, traded, and even dropped. Item Locking has been a long-requested quality-of-life request from many in the community. We’re really excited about bringing this feature to you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On October 7, ‘Mischief Night’ returns to Appalachia, and the arrival of Season 22 brings about changes to combat, manual aim, V.A.T.S., weapon mods, and perks. There’s so much to learn about these combat changes that Bethesda penned <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/3T4SEomfktJyMolMvpvUp5/fallout-76-c-a-m-p-revamp-combat-release-notes-full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an entirely separate blog post</a>.</p>



<p>I can’t stress how huge this update is. It impacts everything from fishing (added in Gone Fission), world events, creatures, skill books, outfits, and food. It’s super sizeable, but it’s still not the ‘biggest update ever’ that Bethesda has been touting for a while.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-sequel-confirmed-as-in-development-now.1287168/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Stellar Blade was one of the standout titles of 2024, emerging as a new IP with fantastic combat mechanics and an intriguing story. It also helped that the protagonist, Eve, was able to lure in many gamers on account of her character model being just a little bit scandalous.</p>



<p>Insane body model aside, Stellar Blade represented something fresh and energetic, and it offered intense boss battles, a killer soundtrack, and a lot of meat on the bones, enough to keep gamers occupied for many hours.</p>



<p>Now, a sequel has been confirmed as being in development.</p>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-2-is-being-developed-by-shift-up">Stellar Blade 2 is Being Developed by Shift Up</h2>



<p>In a recent financial update, Shift Up confirmed that a sequel to 2024’s Stellar Blade is in active development. It was just a few <strong>weeks </strong>after the game was released that Shift Up announced an intention to make a sequel, but now those cogs are actively turning.</p>



<p>Here’s a snippet of that <a href="https://dart.fss.or.kr/dsaf001/main.do?rcpNo=20250814004388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">financial report</a>, translated by <a href="https://x.com/genki_jpn/status/1963102317886283809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki_JPN</a> on X:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are actively pursuing the franchise development of the ‘Stellar Blade’ IP and are currently developing a sequel to ‘Stellar Blade’.</p>



<p>This sequel will inherit the action-packed nature of the original ‘Stellar Blade’ while incorporating an expanded worldview and enhanced gameplay, further solidifying its position as a franchise IP. We anticipate that this will result in even greater success than the original.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stellar Blade continued to be a rampant success this year, with Shift Up releasing the game on PC. The anticipation was so high that it hit one million sales <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-pc-hit-1-million-sales-faster-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19 times faster</a> </strong>on PC than it did when it originally launched on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>It was also said earlier this year that the intention is to release a Stellar Blade sequel by 2027, so we won’t have to wait too long. Not only that, but Shift Up is considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-devs-are-considering-a-switch-2-port-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Switch 2 port</a> for the first Stellar Blade game.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade was one of my favorite games of 2024, which is strange, because the genre isn’t usually one that would attract me. I was won over by the post-apocalyptic setting, the accessible boss battles, and the plot. Definitely the plot.</p>



<p>Do you want to see Stellar Blade 2 emerge soon? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Playing Borderlands 4 on a PC with the right requirements is likely going to be the best place to get the best graphical quality and performance when compared to consoles.</p>



<p>Luckily, games these days are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-borderlands-4-have-crossplay-split-screen-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to have crossplay</a>, so you don’t even need to force yourself to play on console with friends. All <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future content</a> within the game can be accessed at your desk without any issue, provided your setup can run it.</p>



<p>While the ceiling on AAA games being played on a PC is higher, there is also a lot more room for something to go wrong. In many cases where that happens, it has to do with players trying to run a game on hardware that just can’t handle it. Here are the minimum and recommended specs to play Borderlands 4 on PC.</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-minimum-system-requirements">Borderlands 4 Minimum System Requirements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Gearbox</figcaption></figure>



<p>While not providing the unmatched amazing experience while playing the game, the Borderlands 4 minimum system requirements will let you play the game, hopefully with the least number of issues possible.</p>



<p>If you try to run the game with specs that fall below this, you may run into quite a few issues with loading times, freezing issues, crashes, and more. Here is what Gearbox on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> considers to be the minimum requirements to play Borderlands 4.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Minimum Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating System</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 64-bit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">100 GB available space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As long as your PC meets all of these requirements, you should be able to play Borderlands 4 with fewer issues holding you back. If you are unsure if you meet the criteria above, you can consider <a href="https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">using this tool </a>to help you understand. If you think you do meet the minimum, but things aren’t working, try updating your graphics drivers.</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4-recommended-system-requirements">Borderlands 4 Recommended System Requirements</h2>



<p>As you might expect, the specs definitely take a step forward for the recommended hardware to play Borderlands 4. These are the things that will help your experience on PC outperform those who are playing on a console.</p>



<p>Below are the recommended system requirements for Borderlands 4 on PC.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Recommended Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating System</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 64-bit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">32 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">100 GB available space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>With the above, you should not experience many issues at all when playing Borderlands 4 on your PC. You might not be blowing away the competition, but you can<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-pitchford-nervous-challenge-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> definitely take on difficult enemies</a> and gather all the loot they leave on the ground with the confidence that you’re not seconds away from an unexpected crash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this update, we made specification changes to some main weapons to make their individual characteristics stand out. We also made balance changes to multiplayer based on changes observed after adding the Splatlands Collection.</p>
<p>For three types of main weapons—Splash-o-matic, .52 Gal, and Splat Brella—rather than simple upgrades, we made specification changes to make their individual characteristics stand out.</p>
<p>For Splash-o-matic, we extended the flight distance for shots to make it easier to take advantage of its characteristic where the accuracy of your aim directly applies to your ability to defeat opponents. On the other hand, we decreased its ability to ink to make it more difficult to fight in ways that don’t take advantage of accurate aim, such as maintaining battle lines without direct confrontations or using special weapons with high frequency.</p>
<p>For the .52 Gal, we increased the speed of shots to make it easier to fight by taking advantage of its high attack power to defeat several opponents in a short time and create big opportunities. On the other hand, we increased the amount of ink consumed to make it harder to fight in a way that maintains battle lines over time.</p>
<p>For the Splat Brella, we expanded the area of its inking to make it easier to fight by taking advantage of its ability to defend from attacks to keep opponents in check and maintain battle lines, or to use the canopy to prolong the durations of battles to cooperate with allies. We also created a distinction between it and other Brellas by expanding the area of its shots. This makes it easier to support allies by dealing small, reliable damage, while at the same time making it so that in one-on-one fights, players must get closer than before to fight in ways that can quickly defeat opponents. We have also adjusted the number of points required for special weapons to ensure that special-weapon frequency does not rise higher than necessary as a result of expanding the area it inks.</p>
<p>For other main weapons, we made changes to make them easier to use by shoring up their weaknesses.</p>
<p>As for special weapons, for the Zipcaster we made changes so that it’s easier to fight with in combination with certain main weapons.</p>
<p>For the Ink Vac, we made changes so that when used in one-on-one situations, it is harder to be left open by quickly filling up the ink tank, but it also has greater effect when used well to block opponents’ shots.</p>
<p>For the Ink Storm, by expanding the area of effect, we made it easier to use it to force opponents lying in wait in advantageous positions to move, and easier for allies to fight within the area.</p>
<p>Additionally, we made changes to the points required for special weapons, taking into account changes observed since the addition of the Splatlands Collection.</p>
<p>The next update will focus on changes to the balance of battles.</p>

<p>Forsaken 64 is coming to Nintendo Classics</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has announced it's bringing the first-person shooter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/forsaken">Forsaken 64</a> to its "Mature" Switch Online + Expansion Pack app.</p>
<p>The Acclaim Entertainment title, released on the Nintendo 64 in 1998 and developed by Iguana UK, will be arriving for the Switch and Switch 2 online service on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>. Here's the official Nintendo description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You are a ruthless mercenary, sent to the condemned remains of Earth as part of a covert operation codenamed "Forsaken." Your mission is to infiltrate and destroy the last bastions of the mechanized terror that wiped out all life on the planet. Earth is a death trap riddled with merciless mechanoid adversaries and gangs of rival bounty hunters, and you'll have to brave them all astride your anti-grav pioncycle to make your fortune...or meet your doom. Choose between different modes in this first-person shooter title released for the Nintendo 64™ system in 1998, and enter the fight in Single Player Mode or Multi-Player Mode. Then, select your bike. Each bike has different attributes, each biker a different attitude. Pick one that suits your style, then dive into your mission. The availability of weapons, enemies, and powerups changes depending on the level you play, so stay sharp!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind, you'll need to have an active Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription tier as well as the "mature" version of the N64 app to play this game on your Switch or Switch 2. You can download this version of the app from the Switch eShop.</p>
<p>This latest N64 Switch Online announcement also happens to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/blurred-art-in-nintendos-n64-switch-online-trailer-suggests-exciting-upcoming-additions">follow a rumour in July</a>, which may have identified unannounced releases for this particular app. Apart from Forsaken 64, the games spotted included <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_smash_bros">Smash Bros.</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/glover">Glover</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2</a>.</p>
<p>In Japan this week, Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers get to revisit Brownie Brown's GBA RPG, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/magical_vacation">Magical Vacation</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like many of you, I was once a guy who either thought he could build his own PC, or knew a guy who knew some stuff and who offered to scrounge some parts together for a bargain price. I lived a formative part of my life like this, and let me tell you, it fuckin <em>sucked</em>.</p><p>Whether it was my own bumbling hands or the ultimately unqualified bluster of A Guy, for years my PC gaming life was plagued by hardware conflicts, <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-dont-understand-my-pc-which-i-built" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part failures</a>, a need to constantly be <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-bought-the-wrong-graphics-card-and-i-am-full-of-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgrading</a> one part or another and just a general sense I was living on a knife's edge, always one bootup or overclock away from something dying and needing to be replaced. It was stressful when everything was going OK and it was a huge pain in the ass when it wasn't, and considering video games are supposed to be a fun and cool way to relax, I was not having a great time.</p><p>So a decade ago (August 2015), with "getting to enjoy <em>The Witcher 3's</em> visuals as God intended" foremost in my mind, I decided I was going to stop being such a tight-fisted weirdo with my time and money, suck it up, risk the ridicule of friends and peers and just buy a prebuilt PC. Yes, they were more expensive, which meant yes, I was getting less PC for my buck, but given the hell I'd been living through for years previously, I figured it would be money well spent.</p><p>A decade later I am happy to report that it was indeed money well spent, and that I have finally found peace. I have just <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-keep-my-pc-on-the-floor-where-it-belongs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought</a> my third prebuilt PC in that time, and whatever extra money I've poured into having someone else put the things together has been more than worth it. In that decade, do you know how many times I've had a part fail, or had a weird driver conflict, or mystery reboot cycle, or have <em>anything </em>go wrong? Across three computers and a decade spent using them all day for work and playing games all night and on weekends?</p><p>Not one! Not a single issue. I paid some guys a premium of probably $300 per PC to make sure everything fit and worked and that the cables were braided nicely and that's exactly what they've done, and I couldn't be happier. I turn my PC on and it works, every time! I play games on it for years at a time and nothing ever goes wrong! All three times a big box got delivered to my door and I opened it up and plugged it in and everything was set up and already running!</p><p>I recognise there's a degree of privilege to this scenario; the fact I was scrounging for parts in my 20s then spending extra for the luxury of convenience in my mid-30s and beyond says as much about my income situation as it does my desire for convenience, not to mention the fact I'm lucky enough to be able to claim a new gaming PC as a tax deduction.</p><p>Even taking that into account, though, I cannot recommend it enough. I know there are already loads of people reading this more skilled and knowledgeable about this stuff than me, thinking "building a PC isn't hard, you big baby", or that the need to save $300 overrides all other considerations, and I get that. But also: have you ever considered that instead of me "blowing" hundreds of dollars per PC I have actually invested that money in peace-of-mind? One of the best things you can <em>ever </em>spend money on?</p><figure><figcaption>My latest PC, with a Fractal North case.

<section><p>The latest Nightdive remaster is an excellent example of bringing beloved classics into the modern age.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>When it comes to preserving long forgotten or unavailable shooters, Nightdive Studios is leading the charge. While older games often struggle to be preserved properly due to a myriad of issues--licensing disputes, asset loss, tech limitations and simply being forgotten chief among them--studios like Nightdive have made a concentrated effort to prove that no game is beyond preservation. In the past few years, Nightdive has restored and released new versions of System Shock 2, Star Wars: Dark Forces, and Turok, bringing the beloved classics to modern audiences. Yet even more impressive is the studio's commitment to including a wealth of accessibility options, making these titles more playable and accessible than ever before.</p><p>Nightdive's most recent re-releases, Heretic and Hexen, are prime examples of this. Released in 1994 and developed by Raven Software, Heretic was one of many “Doom Clones” from that era. Instead of a space marine taking down the hordes of Hell, players took on the role of a spellcaster named Corvus who navigates a dark fantasy world brought to ruin by the Serpent Riders. Heretic is notable for being far more interactive in its environments compared to Doom and even allowed players to look up and down: a rarity for shooters at the time. A year later, Raven Software released Hexen: Beyond Heretic, a distant sequel to Heretic that saw players pick one of three protagonists as they set out to defeat the second of the Serpent Riders. Like its predecessor, Hexen was notable for its distinct features, such as a darker fantasy setting and a central hub that connected all the game's levels.</p><p>While these games had their devoted followings, neither reached the popularity of games such as Doom and Quake and, as such, fell into obscurity. For a long time it felt as if these games would never get their proper due. That all changed, however, at this year's Quakecon, when Microsoft and Nightdive announced a remastered collection featuring both games--complete with numerous accessibility options and enhancements--was now available. According to Nightdive founder and CEO Stephen Kick, Heretic and Hexen's focus on accessibility is not a passive effect of remaking the games, but an intentional choice that reflects the studio's larger priorities.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4560227-heretic-hexen_03_heretic-6b3df5c67c3176057f9c-scaled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560227" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4560227-heretic-hexen_03_heretic-6b3df5c67c3176057f9c-scaled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560227"></a><figcaption>An image from the Heretic + Hexen collection.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4560227-heretic-hexen_03_heretic-6b3df5c67c3176057f9c-scaled.jpg"></figure><p>"Accessibility is a 'key part' of our mission at Nightdive. When we remaster a classic game, we’re not just making it look better--we’re making sure it can be played and enjoyed by as many people as possible, regardless of their hardware, preferences, or physical limitations,” Kick said.</p><p>One of the main new features of Nightdive’s Heretic and Hexen remaster is the addition of a map and waypoint system. The original releases were labyrinthine in design, and a lack of navigational tools resulted in the game turning into a slog. As such, Nightdive's director of business development Larry Kuperman confirmed that a map was "the feature most requested by fans," as well as the most praised addition at QuakeCon.</p><p>“We knew that Hexen and Heretic could be frustrating to new players not accustomed to this style of gameplay so we implemented a pseudo-waypoint system that marked important objectives on the map," Kick added. "It doesn’t show you how to get there, but it does give you an idea of where you need to explore which is an extremely helpful feature.”</p><p>In addition to the new waypoint feature, Nightdive also included its trademark visual and controller options such as controller and keyboard bindings, visual filters, and anti-aliasing, allowing players to customize the whole experience to their liking. It can be hardcore, like the original release, or more accessible--the freedom of choice is in the player’s hands.</p><p>“We have always treated the games that we work on with respect and [aim] to respect the original developers. We know that they did all they could given the software and hardware limitations of the times," Kupperman added. "We see ourselves as helping to fulfill the original vision using today’s tool[s]."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4560229-heretichexen.png" data-ref-id="1300-4560229" data-ratio="0.5596546310832" data-width="1274" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4560229-heretichexen.png" data-ref-id="1300-4560229"></a><figcaption>An image from the Heretic + Hexen collection.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4560229-heretichexen.png"></figure><p>Heretic and Hexen is a prime example of Nightdive succeeding in its goals. While the game is far more playable due to the gameplay and visual changes, the original intent is still there. At the remaster’s core, it is still Heretic and Hexen, just made available to a modern gaming audience. The level layouts remain the same, the gameplay remains as frantic as ever, and the atmosphere lives on in Nightdive’s retooling of it.</p><p>Nightdive promises to keep its sights on accessibility for future titles as well, though the team admits there are areas where they can improve. “One area I think we could do better is to include options for colorblind players,” Kick said.</p><p>According to Kick, the studio will always strive for more accessibility for the sake of getting beloved and forgotten titles to the widest of audiences on modern hardware. A great example of this besides Heretic and Hexen is the studio’s recent System Shock remake and System Shock 2 remaster. While the former is a full, from-the-ground remake and the latter is an update to current modern hardware, both feature a wealth of options to fine tune the player experience from puzzle difficulty to combat assists. These once inaccessible games (System Shock in particular has often been described as playing an operating system) are now available to anyone to enjoy without the headaches of the past.</p><p>While game preservation will always remain an important topic in gaming and could always use more support, Nightdive is leading the charge by helping games not only fall out of obscurity, but also by making them more enjoyable to play. In an era where more and more games are falling into obscurity due to not being preserved properly, Heretic and Hexen is a glimmer of hope for the future of our industry.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/bet-kakegurui-netflix-live-action-anime</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-unironically-like-netflix%E2%80%99s-live-action-kakegurui-tv-series.1287036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like video game adaptations, live-action anime adaptations get a bad rap for being so rancid that fans preemptively sling shit at their creators for having the audacity to attempt them. Having been a card-carrying member of that camp for years, when I tuned into <em>Bet</em>, Netflix’s live-action take on <em>Kakegurui</em>, I expected an irredeemable trainwreck. What I got instead was a surprisingly entertaining, campy fever dream. I take pride in contributing to getting it greenlit for a second season.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bet | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R7xl9QjtNDc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Developed by Simon Berry, <em>Bet</em> reimagines Homura Kawamoto and Tōru Naomura’s 2014 psychological drama series <em>Kakegurui: Compulsive Gambler</em>. The original manga follows Yumeko Jabami, a precocious high school transfer student at a prestigious academy where one’s social status is determined by underground gambling. Think <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em>’s early manga chaos meets <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-things-to-check-out-after-youve-binged-squid-game-1847875371/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kaiji</em></a>’s debt-riddled death games. The anime adaptation by Mappa in 2017 catapulted the series into pop culture prominence, and I even ranked it as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-anime-ranked-decade-attack-on-titan-demon-slayer-1850117910/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30th best anime of the decade</a> at the other website.</p><p>Visually, <em>Bet </em>is Netflix’s CW-esque answer to <em>Riverdale </em>with BBC’s<em> Sherlock</em> levels of overproduction. Its set design and costuming go hard—like, somebody put their whole bussy into it hard. Sure, the show is still campy and wacky, just like its source material, but it leans into that chaos rather than apologizing for it. Unlike Hollywood's more infamous anime misfires (cough cough <em>Dragon Ball Evolution</em> and <em>The Last Airbender</em>), Bet embraces its eccentricity with pride, and while being a more palatable thing to have folks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS7mdn4DFuc&amp;pp=ygUaa2FrZWd1cnVpIGd1biBzY2VuZSBtaWRhcmk%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walk in on you watching</a> than its anime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p><em>Bet</em> doesn’t just cosplay the source material—it remixes it by Americanizing it in the most contemporary camp way possible. And in doing so, <em>Bet </em>fixes things that even the manga and anime never quite nailed. Mainly, how it handled adapting three characters from the source material.&nbsp;</p><p>First off is actor Miku Martineau’s Yumeko. In the anime, she’s a manic enigma who gets turned on by the danger of gambling even when the odds are stacked against her. With each episode, she inexplicably wins every game (even when her opponents are cheating), making the viewing experience bereft of emotional stakes. <em>Bet </em>gives her gravity. While she’s still as much a thrill-seeker as her counterpart, her backstory as a girl haunted by the murder of her parents and her quest for revenge, wrapped in that grief, is lampshaded at the start of the show, giving viewers a tangible character to root for from the get-go.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kakegurui | Trailer [HD] | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTlHQiRNVl0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In contrast, the anime takes forever and a day to reveal that plot point. Thanks to this change, Yumeko’s highs and lows feel earned. Every rare stumble, recalibration, and fight from beneath make her victories feel like actual triumphs instead of a narrative inevitability.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there's Ryan, the race-swapped version of Ryota, played by Black actor Ayo Solanke. In the manga and anime, Ryota is basically a glorified background character whose only purpose is to react to all the wild shit Yumeko does as an analogue for the audience. <em>Bet</em> gives Ryan his own arc where his one-sided crush on Yumeko, in tandem with his own family issues, gives him a seat at the table as a character with as much agency, if not more so, than the show’s leading lady. Even original show moments where the series feels like it's dipping into eye-rolling territory, like a plot line where the school places bets on Ryan losing his virginity to Yumeko, are played with emotional maturity and care. Where the anime would have Yumeko handwave away the danger her gambling has on her cohorts, like a bullishly written Batman, <em>Bet</em>’s Yumeko doesn’t unwittingly gamble with her friends' lives like an asshole.</p><p>Another character I was surprised by was how much I loved Netflix’s adaptation compared to the anime was <em>Bet</em>’s reimagined version of the early villain, <a href="https://kakegurui.fandom.com/wiki/Itsuki_Sumeragi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Itsuki Sumeragi</a>. In the anime, Itsuki is a one-note sadist who takes joy in collecting her victims’ fingernails as trophies. But the adaptation transforms her into <a href="https://kakegurui.fandom.com/wiki/Suki_Hennessey#Appearance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suki Hennessey</a>, a gender-nonconforming character with a shady influencer past, akin to James Charles. Suki actor <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dnybackact/video/7523628335675575557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Sutherland</a> might as well have been Denzel Washington, given how he chewed up the scenery in every scene he was in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Yumeko Accepts Mary’s Challenge to Skirmish | Bet | Netflix Philippines" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MSASvyra1ZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Bet</em>’s whole vibe isn’t far off from Netflix’s live-action <em>Death Note</em>—which, yes, features Margaret Qualley for some reason—but Bet scratches the same “if this anime took place in America” itch with more confidence. And, unlike Death Note, which survives almost entirely on the galaxy-brained casting of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMHFlD65hY4&amp;pp=ygUXd2lsbGVtIGRhZm9lIGRlYXRoIG5vdGU%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Willem Dafoe as Ryuk</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1mcQ6CzXo8&amp;pp=ygUcbGFrZWl0aCBzdGFuZmllbGQgZGVhdGggbm90ZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LaKeith Stanfield as L</a>, <em>Bet</em> doesn’t hedge its bets on a single saving grace. It’s just top-to-bottom unpapologetic cringe, as it was meant to be.</p><p>My inciting incident that convinced me and my friend to watch the series was our collective curiosity about how WWE champion Seth Rollins would make a cameo in the series—a cameo that, out of context, reeked to us of shameless brand synergy following Netflix’s own hosting of WWE Raw. Spoiler: <a href="https://x.com/25_Saurav/status/1906705868831228331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rollins’ already cunty wardrobe</a> and shrill, whiny tone fit right into the show’s madness as another brilliant point of casting.&nbsp;</p><p>In comparison to <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-one-piece-yu-yu-hakusho-anime-live-action-netfl-1850050620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other upcoming live-action anime projects </a>fans are biting their nails to the nub in anxiety over, <em>Kakegurui </em>isn’t a sacred cow in the grander anime community. It’s a weird, horny, and chaotic mess—and <em>Bet </em>understands that. It doesn’t try to sanitize it. Instead, it Westernizes it in ways that feel playful rather than disrespectful. Like <a href="https://kotaku.com/one-piece-netflix-live-action-oda-luffy-review-anime-1850788857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em></a> being a similar&nbsp; to <em>Percy Jackson</em>’s whimsical energy or <em>Death Note</em> morphing into <em>Final Destination</em>, <em>Bet </em>knows where not to overstep and where to play loudly within its adaptation.&nbsp;</p><p>So if Netflix’s export of live-action anime series going forward is going to lean into CW-style camp, then I welcome it as a chaotic but valuable addition to the anime and manga ecosystem. Adaptations like <em>Bet </em>aren’t slop or guilty pleasures—they’re gateways where normies could join in the fold and check out the anime and manga that inspired them. If Netflix’s <em>One Piece</em> live-action series could become a talking point on <em>The View</em>, pulling normies like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceLiveAction/comments/16t4ric/actually_insane_whoopi_goldberg_gave_a_raving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whoopi Goldberg into Luffy’s warm light</a>, then why not let lesser-known titles like <em>Kakegurui </em>get their moment alongside shonen royalty? <em>Bet </em>was wildly fun, and if that fun gets more folks to check out the manga and anime, then let the cringe renaissance continue.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-demonschool-delay-silksong"><h3>Why Demonschool Got Delayed, Even Though It’s Nothing Like Silksong</h3></a><p>"It’s frustrating because we’ve really tried very hard to let people know that this game exists"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/long-story-short-bojack-netflix"><h3>Long Story Short Is A Lot, In A Good Way</h3></a><p>The new family drama from the creators of Bojack Horseman is funny, moving, and just the right amount of intense</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/vivi-is-screwing-up-magic-the-gathering-and-you-know-what-good-for-him"><h3>Vivi Is Screwing Up Magic: The Gathering, And You Know What?
