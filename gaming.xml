                <p>Nintendo has revealed four new games coming to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy library today, May 23. They are Kirby Star Stacker, Survival Kids, Gradius: The Interstellar Assault, and The Sword of Hope.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kirbys-star-stacker/" data-ref-id="5000-6379">Kirby Star Stacker</a> is the highest-profile addition. Originally released by HAL Laboratory in 1997, it is a puzzle game with gameplay similar to Tetris Attack or Pokemon Puzzle League. Players have to match blocks that look like Rick, Coo, and Kine from Kirby's Dream Land 2. The Super Famicom version of this game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-brings-three-games-to-us-for-first-time-ever/1100-6517513/" data-ref-id="1100-6517513">came to Nintendo Switch Online in 2023</a>, but now the original release also has a place as part of Nintendo's subscription service.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRmpwGGTXOo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BRmpwGGTXOo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/survival-kids-1999/" data-ref-id="5000-11627">Survival Kids</a> is another notable inclusion this month because it's a Konami franchise about to be reimagined for Nintendo Switch 2. The original Survival Kids is a cult classic that tasks players with surviving on a deserted island. If you enjoy modern <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-games/2900-5289/" data-ref-id="2900-5289">survival games</a>, they owe a lot to games like Survival Kids that helped trailblaze some of the genre's mechanics. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Nintendo Switch 2 version</a> of Survival Kids looks like a lighthearted, cooperative reinterpretation of the series' formula, it's nice to have the rare Game Boy original available through Switch Online now.</p><p>Game Boy enthusiasts will also enjoy the other two games coming to Nintendo Switch Online. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gradius-the-interstellar-assault/" data-ref-id="5000-15933">Gradius: The Interstellar Assault</a> is a solid Game Boy version of Konami's classic arcade shoot 'em up. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sword-of-hope/" data-ref-id="5000-16075">The Sword of Hope</a> is an ambitious but lesser-known RPG for Nintendo's handheld console.</p><p>Kirby Star Stacker, Survival Kids, Gradius: The Interstellar Assault, and The Sword of Hope all now available to play through Nintendo Switch Online.</p>

The clip here is only 40 seconds long and it contains brand-new footage, but don't get too hyped up unless you're a fan of post-apocalyptic environmental ASMR.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRutwoEyG3s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dRutwoEyG3s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In case you can't click the video above, all you're missing out on is a brief clip of an open prepper shelter waiting for a brave deliveryman to come pick up some cargo. At the very least, it's a nice look at the more arid terrain that you'll be able to explore in Death Stranding 2.</p><p>Beyond that tissue-pack marketing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-is-getting-a-limited-edition-dualsense-controller/1100-6531400/">fans of Death Stranding can also preorder a special DualSense controller</a>. This model features a sleek black finish and insignia based on the fictional Drawbridge company in the sequel, and it's priced at $85. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2 releases for PS5 on June 26</a>, and several previews for the game recently went live.</p><p>While feedback has been mostly positive so far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2s-scoring-well-with-test-reviewers-but-kojima-isnt-satisfied/1100-6531555/">game director Hideo Kojima isn't satisfied</a> and he wants to see a few "controversial" opinions about the sequel.</p><p>"I played 30 hours of Death Stranding 2 before writing this preview. I can confidently say that it’s excellent, and I can’t wait to do it all again (and much more) when it releases next month," Dan Ryckert wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/">Death Stranding 2 preview</a>.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While the current Switch doesn't ask for a phone number for voice chat, a separate mobile device is still needed to talk with friends through the Nintendo Switch Online app. This will eventually get renamed to the Nintendo Switch app sometime this month and will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-notes-lets-players-swap-items-between-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6530614/">where you find Zelda Notes</a> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/">the enhanced Switch 2 Editions</a> of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, a report pointed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-includes-these-helpful-gamechat-accessibility-features-report/1100-6531631/">GameChat including a couple of helpful accessibility features</a>: text-to-chat speech functionality and live chat translation. However, both were showcased in Japanese, so it's unknown officially what languages may be supported on the upcoming system.</p><p>Switch 2 is set to launch on June 5 for $450, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">preorders sold out</a> almost immediately. That said, Nintendo of America president <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-supply-should-be-ready-for-demand-in-us-says-nintendo-of-america-boss/1100-6531600/">Doug Bowser believes the company can meet demand for the console</a> throughout the rest of this year.</p>

            <p>Project Milo was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lionhead-project-milo-existed-before-wed-even-heard-of-kinect">initially revealed alongside Microsoft's Kinect device all the way back in 2009</a>, and featured a young character named Milo who players could interact with. However, it never actually made it to release, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rumour-project-milo-cancelled">the project was cancelled in 2010</a>.</p>
<p>So, what happened? Well, Peter Molyneux recently shared his side of the story during Nordic Game 2025 in Malmö, explaining how changing priorities led to the end of the project and how he didn't want to "prance around like a twat".</p>

<p>"I'll tell you exactly what happened," Molyneux said, as transcribed by Eurgamer's sister-site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/peter-molyneux-recalls-how-project-milo-the-kinect-game-with-revolutionary-promise-died-a-death">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "Microsoft had [bought] us, we were owned by Microsoft, and they had...I'm going to say this, I might get in trouble...what I thought was a bit of a crazy idea. And that was to do gesture recognition as an input device, rather than a controller. They showed me this stuff, and Microsoft had this amazing research building. Incredible.</p>
<p>"It was run by this brilliant bloke called Alex Kipman. Makes me look boring and passionless – he had ten times more passion than I had. He had this demo of this device, and when he showed me this demo, it could see people's faces. He said, 'it can do voice recognition', and it had a massive field-of-view so it could see this whole room."</p>
<p>When Kipman first asked Molyneux his thoughts on the tech that would ultimately end up as the Kinect, the game developer replied:</p>
<p>"'Well, firstly' - when he did the demo, he was jumping all over the room - 'I'm a gamer, I don't want to play games standing up. That's the first thing. It doesn't appeal to me, I want to sit back, I want to smoke what I smoke, and I want to drink what I want to drink, and I don't want to prance around like a twat'."</p>
<p>Molyneux said he would go and instead create a demo of how he believed the technology should be used, with a more sedentary slant with a focus on feeling. For this, he took inspiration from his then seven-year-old son, Lucas.</p>
<p>"Anyone who's a parent will probably experience this: there was this moment where you realise you're <em>crafting</em>, inspiring, a human being," the developer said. "Wouldn't it be an incredible thing to create a game around that feeling… About inspiring, in Milo's case, a boy. That was contentious in itself, because of course, lots of people go to the dark side with that [idea]."</p>
<p>Staff at Molyneux's studio Lionhead subsequently started work on the demo, and began collaborating with a technology company on Project Milo's voice recognition.</p>
<p>"We had all sorts of experiences, like you could hand things to Milo in the game world and he would take them. They really worked well."</p>
<p>The team "cheated in a big way about how you could talk to Milo",  Molyneux said, adding he wanted to make sure that players would be able to relax on the couch at the end of a day (or, to be fair, in the middle of it), and "just experience things with this game character".</p>
<p>"Even though voice recognition now is almost a solved problem, back in those days we solved the problem by cheating," Molyneux explained. "So, when Milo asked you the player a question, we had set that question up to different points, so he knew what sort of answer he'd give."</p>
<p>The developer went on to explain some more about the behind the scenes of Project Milo, admitting it was unfortunate that at the same time as all of this was going on, Microsoft was also working on its Kinect device.</p>
<p>"And [Microsoft] realised that the device that Alex Kipman first showed off would cost $5k for consumers to buy. So they cost-reduced that device down to such a point, where the field-of-view… I think it was a minuscule field-of-view. In other words, it could only just see what's straight in front of you."</p>
<p>In the end, changing priorities at Microsoft, which wanted to focus on the Kinect, led to the end of Project Milo. Molyneux said the "death blow" which still "breaks his heart" today, "was that it was decided that Kinect shouldn't be a gaming device: it should be a party device. You should play a sports game with it, or dancing games with it."</p>
<p>Project Milo, then, "didn't fit into the Microsoft portfolio", and the whole thing was ultimately canned.</p>
<p>"No one ever saw the complete experience," Molyneux closed. "We didn't finish the experience. But it was a magical thing. What was so magical about it: it wasn't about heroes and aliens coming down, there wasn't this 'end of the world' narrative scenario.</p>
<p>"It was just experiencing what it's like to hang out with someone that loves you."</p>

<p>Eurogamer spoke to Molyneux last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peter-molyneux-a-fallen-god-of-game-design-seeking-one-final-chance">about his Masters of Albion project</a>. Masters of Albion will take place "in the land of Albion", and has - in the words of Katharine Castle - big Black and White energy, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">a more customisable bent that lets you design buildings, meals, armour and more</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch lineup mainly consists of existing games ported to the new console, with very few exceptions, and one of them is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fast-fusion-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2-will-run-at-4k60-with-hdr-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAST FUSION</a>.</p>
<p>The anti-gravity racing game series made by Munich-based developer Shin'en Multimedia is exclusive to Nintendo consoles. The first installment, FAST RACING LEAGUE, debuted on the Wii in May 2011. FAST RACING NEO then launched on the Wii U in 2015, and an enhanced version of that game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fast-rmx-worth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAST RMX</a> debuted as a launch title for the Switch in March 2017.</p>
<p>FAST FUSION is also a launch title. However, this time around, it's a brand new installment with new features like Hyperjumps and Vehicle Fusion. As usual, it'll also be a technical showcase, and the studio has already shared that it will run at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with High Dynamic Range support. Jack Merluzzi, the announcer known for his work on F-Zero GX, is returning from FAST RACING NEO.</p>
<p>We sent Shin'en Multimedia a few questions to learn more about their new game and discuss their experience with the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p><em><strong>When did you start working on your Nintendo Switch 2 game?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We have been working since 2024 on the game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Wow, that's not long at all. Were you really able to make FAST FUSION in just one year, or was it in development before?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The game wasn't in development before, but as we work on our own tools and engine and had done several FAST games before, we were able to speed up development a lot.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>After some time with the new hardware, what was the most impressive&nbsp;new feature for you and why?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The new GPU features are, of course, most interesting to us from a developer's perspective. Having an HDR compatible display now makes quite a big difference in our game's look.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the Joy-Con 2 improvements? How are you taking advantage of the improved HD Rumble?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Yeah, the new HD rumble is very impressive. We use it in many places in FAST FUSION and it intensifies the action quite a lot.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What are the main improvements that players will notice in FAST FUSION over the previous installment?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>First of all, players will of course notice the much more detailed, alive and vibrant tracks, but the new core elements like Vehicle Fusion and Hyperjumps are what take Fast Fusion to the next level.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>How will the Vehicle Fusion feature work?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>You can use any vehicles you acquired in the game for Fusion (just by playing, we have no microtransactions). With Vehicle Fusion, you bring together two vehicles of your liking to create a hybrid of both. So you can, for instance, fuse a fast vehicle with low acceleration with a heavy vehicle that has fast acceleration. The new vehicle will combine the best of both worlds. Also, the looks of both vehicles will be merged into a totally new one.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Very interesting. Can't wait to try it. Thank you for your time!</strong></em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025 globally. Nintendo won't be providing pre-release review units and codes to the press, but look forward to our reviews of the new hardware and some of the launch games later in June.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-17-release-date" rel="nofollow">April's Version 1.7</a>, Version 2.0 will arrive on June 6th across all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is available. It'll bring a new area to explore, new characters to add to your lineup, and more, just as you'd expect from a HoYoverse update.</p>

<p>First up, you'll be embarking on "an exhilarating new journey" that will take you to the Waifei Peninsula, a "remote yet vibrant district of New Eridu". There, you'll discover new exploration gameplay mechanics, "further uncover the hidden secrets of Phaethon", and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.0-ju-fufu.jpg?itok=LkhdIlPG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-2.0-ju-fufu.jpg?itok=lZik-r6k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0 has three new fighters for you to add to your team.</figcaption></figure><p>The first of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0's three new characters is Grandmaster Yixuan, an S-rank agent who can ignore defense to deal huge damage, which can also scale with her attack power and max HP.</p>

<p>She's joined by fellow S-rank Agent Ju Fufu, a Yunkui Summit disciple who deals Physical and Fire damage and boosts her squad's critical damage with her Tiger's Roar buff.</p>

<p>Finally, rounding out the playable character roster for Version 2.0 is the A-rank Physical Defense Agent Pan Yinhu, a "kitchen-savvy panda" who brings some serious attitude to your team. S-rank Bangboo Belion will also be added to the game in this update.</p>

<p>They'll join Astra Yao and Caesar, two S-rank Agents who are getting reruns as part of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>'s Version 2.0 banners. Not only that, but since this update marks the game's first anniversary, you'll be able to "choose one S-rank Agent and one S-rank W-Engine from the Stable Channel for free".</p>




<p>Of course, this update also introduces plenty of quality-of-life improvements like a new 3D map for navigation, new beacons that allow you to revive characters and restore HP, and other optimizations.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.0 launches across <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a> on June 6th.</p>

            <p>
An <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> live action film is in the works from Ex Machina director Alex Garland, film production company A24 and game publisher Bandai Namco. It’s not clear whether developers From Software are involved, but Game Of Thrones novelist George R. R. Martin - who worked on Elden Ring’s story and characters alongside From boss Hidetaka Miyazaki - is contributing as a producer. All of this comes via <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-directing-a24-movie-1236408999/">Deadline</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
 Miyazaki has dangled the prospect of a movie adaptation in the past, while making it clear that film-making very much isn’t his wheelhouse. “I don’t see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of Elden Ring, a movie for example,” he told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Guardian</a> last year. “But I don’t think myself, or FromSoftware, have the knowledge or ability to produce something in a different medium. So that’s where a very strong partner would come into play. We’d have to build a lot of trust and agreement on whatever it is we’re trying to achieve, but there’s interest, for sure.” 
</p>
<p>
There’s no word yet as to the story, characters and cast, let alone a release date. Perhaps predictably, I struggle to imagine a film that captures the ambience of a From Software game, in which so much of the charm is being the one real agent of change in a static, ruined world. But I can think of a few references for the moodboard: David Lowery’s silty cinematic adaptation of The Green Knight and Matteo Garrone’s dynastic triptych Tale of Tales. Perhaps they could pay homage to the soapstone functionality by encouraging audiences to write “is this a dog?” on the box office posters.
</p>
<p>It'll be a while till we learn more, I expect. In the meantime, you can get your fix of Limgrave from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Enemy level scaling is an age-old issue that folks complained about back in the Xbox 360 days, and yes, it’s still problematic in <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>. Every enemy you face scales alongside you, so they’ll grow in power as you level up. It makes for a challenging RPG, to say the least. Thankfully, this version of the game altered how leveling works slightly, so you can place points into three Attributes each time you gain a rank.</p><p>To avoid becoming overwhelmed, don’t opt for an entirely passive playthrough, though. It won’t work well to just avoid fights. Instead, mix and match your skills by, say, choosing Mercantile <em>and </em>Blade. After all, anyone traveling the roads of Cyrodiil could benefit from a hidden knife.</p><h2 id="h335974"><a id="2"></a>Stealing is lucrative, so long as you can find a fence</h2><figure id="" data-id="5afe24d11d6123366e28487a85e84896" data-recommend-id="image://5afe24d11d6123366e28487a85e84896" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ongar the fence of Bruma in Oblivion Remastered" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ongar the fence of Bruma in Oblivion Remastered" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5afe24d11d6123366e28487a85e84896" data-recommend-id="image://5afe24d11d6123366e28487a85e84896" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ongar the fence of Bruma in Oblivion Remastered" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re playing a stealth-focused character, specifically a thief making a living robbing everyone in sight, you’ll soon learn that selling stolen goods proves problematic in Cyrodiil.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, May 23, 2025. Below, we look back at how its villains were unusually sympathetic, lending weight to the story.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It's one of the most haunting scenes in any Fire Emblem game. A soldier and temporary king, Orson, is seen talking with the reanimated corpse of his wife, Monica. She only says one thing--"darling"--over and over again.</p><p dir="ltr">Orson, one of the many antagonists in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-review/1900-6126647/">Fire Emblem Sacred Stones</a>, was a man devoted to Monica long before the campaign of the game began. He's only present during a short part of the story, but he leaves a major impression once the credits roll after the game's 30 chapters come to a close. While you'll first meet him as a playable character, he eventually betrays Ephraim, Eirika, and the other heroes in order to (as he believes) save his wife's life.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though this story plays out solemnly on a 2.5 inch Game Boy screen, it packs a punch that remains one of the most memorable parts of Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones. Orson's tale, along with those of the other villains in Sacred Stones, exemplifies the type of personal story that sets the Fire Emblem series apart from other strategy games. It provides a personal, intimate look at enemies before we fight them on the battlefield.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LmocGJOdZk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9LmocGJOdZk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Orson's betrayal comes as a shock. When the idea of a turncloak hiding in Eirika and Ephraim's forces is brought up by an enemy commander, it's not immediately clear who he's referring to. We find out when Orson tries to trick Eirika into handing over one of the keys to the games namesake, the sacred stones, while leading her right into the hands of the enemy. Then, he's dismissed and nearly disappears from the story.</p><p dir="ltr">We see him nine chapters later in a terrible state, living for nothing but the reanimated corpse of his wife. We witness brief scenes where he brings her gifts and lashes out at the people around him for the mere act of interrupting their time alone. These moments are short, intimate looks at an unwound man who has forsaken everything in his life for the memory of his love. Our last look at Orson comes from combat dialogue right before he is killed.</p><p dir="ltr">"For the one I love, I betray everything," Orson tells Eirika before they cross swords near the halfway point of Sacred Stone's campaign. "My country, my lord and master… everything."</p><p dir="ltr">While few would endorse his actions, it's easy to understand why Orson made them. Laying the scene out before us--as unsettling as it is--puts him in the spotlight as if he was one of the games' protagonists.</p><p dir="ltr">We get a similarly personal look at Lyon, the prince of Grado who serves as the secondary antagonist in Sacred Stones, that gives plenty of weight to his villainy. Like Orson, one of Lyon's primary drivers is saving someone close to him through experimentation with dangerous magic. He uses the sacred stone, which is a seal that helps contain a powerful demon, to push healing magic, which isn't known to help with grievous injuries in the world of Sacred Stones, further than it's ever been pushed before.</p><p dir="ltr">"If I can just press my studies a little harder [...] I think I might be able to use it to heal my father’s illness," Lyon says at one point in the story. "If that works, there’s no telling how many other people I can help as well."</p><p dir="ltr">As you might have guessed, Lyon's experimentations backfire. He eventually loses control and is influenced by the demon sealed through the sacred stones, before being finally convinced that the only way to prevent a cataclysmic event is to free the demon.</p><p dir="ltr">We see the backstory of Lyon's father sickness, his childhood relationships with Ephraim and Eirika, and his struggles with his poor health and lack of self-confidence throughout the game. Flashbacks, combat dialogue, and story sequences lay out the motivations of a ruler in complete despair.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4499303-fireemblem%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499303" data-ratio="0.66701461377871" data-width="958" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4499303-fireemblem%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499303"></a><figcaption>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4499303-fireemblem%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Getting such a sincere look at the villain's perspective is one way to convince us that Ephraim and his army aren't just cutting down evil, faceless enemies. The scenes with Orson and Lyon throughout the campaign overshadow the fantastical demonic villain that enters the fray later on.</p><p dir="ltr">Fire Emblem is a franchise that wants you to care about the units you fight with and against. You're not sending nameless soldiers to their deaths, you're sending characters that you've recruited, trained with, leveled up, and grown closer to over the course of the game. It's not uncommon for fans of the series to abort missions and start over as soon as one of their heroes falls on the battlefield. The thought of going on without them is too much.</p><p dir="ltr">Sacred Stones exemplifies this part of the franchise. Moulder, a gentle priest who acts as a father figure to other units and Joshua, a talented swordsman with an unhealthy obsession with gambling, are just two of the 30 units that you can learn about as you watch them interact with one another before each mission. Building out your go-to squad is like choosing which friends you want to spend time with over the course of the games' story.</p><p dir="ltr">Orson and Lyon--villains that are only roadblocks in the path to the game's main demonic antagonist--serve as sobering examples of villains who are tragically relatable. We see why they do what they do firsthand, giving them just as much of a story as any other character in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">Later Fire Emblem games have built on what entries like Sacred Stones established for the franchise. Fire Emblem: Engage and Fire Emblem: Three Houses gave us more ways to build relationships with our soldiers on the field. Few games, however, have given us an equally as disturbing look into what would drive good people to commit horrible crimes.</p>

A global Go Fest event is scheduled to follow June 28-29, and like previous years, there will be rotating habitats with different Pokemon, event-themed Research tasks to complete, and various other in-game bonuses. Players who purchase a ticket for the event will also receive an exclusive Special Research story that leads to an encounter with the mythical Pokemon Volcanion.</p>

"Guns are upgradable in Firebreak, but we now think we went too far with how weak they felt at the earliest levels," Kyatta said. "In response, we are making all level-one guns radically more powerful, while adjusting other parts of the game to maintain the challenge balance."</p>

<p>Kyatta added that it heard from players that the double-barrel shotgun did not feel quite right, and the studio agrees, so it's making some changes to "make sure it meets the expectations of its shooting style." The developer also mentioned how "everything" related to general combat intensity and difficulty levels has been overhauled. "Among other things, we're tying different enemy types to different threat levels, adjusting wave frequency and composition, and removing awkward lulls in the action," Kyatta said.</p><p>Also in the blog post, Kyatta said Remedy has added "dynamic tutorials" to the game to help players have a "clear path forward without limiting them from discovering alternate ways of going about things."</p><p>Additionally, Kyatta mentioned how the "visual clarity" of FBC wasn't quite right. "The chaos stops being fun when players can no longer make meaningful decisions based on what they're experiencing." With that in mind, Remedy is spending time "cleaning up and reducing a lot of effects in the game, both on-screen and in-world."</p><p>What's more, Kyatta said it was a known issue that the general in-game audio was too quiet in the early tests. The studio is now putting together the final audio mix for the game that should address this.</p><p>Finally, Kyatta said Remedy continues to work on "performance testing and improvements" for PC, which is why the minimum and recommend PC specs have not been announced yet. "We'll share those results as soon as we're confident in them," Kyatta said.</p><p>"We've still got a lot to do to make the launch experience the best it can be, but the team is feeling really good about where we are," he added.</p><p>FBC officially launches on June 17, and it's included as a day-one launch title for Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. Alternatively, it can be purchased outright for $40 for console and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/an-elden-ring-movie-is-in-the-works-for-some-reason.1197384/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware's runaway smash hit&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is getting a movie adaptation, and a celebrated sci-fi director and writer is attached to the project already.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-directing-a24-movie-1236408999/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>movie will be produced by indie studio A24, which is also responsible for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-movie-a24" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>movie adaptation</a>, although adapting&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is arguably going to be significantly more of a challenge than Kojima's already-fairly-cinematic game.</p>

<p>Helming the project is Alex Garland, the creative force behind movies like&nbsp;<em>Annihilation</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ex Machina</em>, and his most recent movie&nbsp;<em>Warfare</em>, an on-the-ground depiction of the Iraq war. He's also on writing duties.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-movie-erdtree.jpg?itok=qHpVIosd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-movie-erdtree.jpg?itok=CqPD1w-W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is getting a movie adaptation, because money is really, really appealing, I guess.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>co-writer George R.R. Martin will serve as a producer on the movie, but Deadline makes no mention of either FromSoftware or Hidetaka Miyazaki, which could suggest they're not involved in the project.</p>

<p>Naturally, movies are a very different business to games, but it's still a little troubling that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s chief creative force doesn't appear to be a part of the movie. I suppose he's busy with next year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 exclusive&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em></a>.</p>

<p>I can only speak for myself here, but an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>movie seems like a pretty bad idea right from the outset. FromSoftware's open-world masterpiece is, after all, a game that tells its story in a fragmented, non-linear fashion, and it's hard to see how that's going to work in a two-hour ultra-linear movie.</p>

<p>Garland isn't necessarily the worst choice to helm&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>; he's got form when it comes to intelligent fantasy and sci-fi, after all. Still, I can't shake the feeling that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is unfilmable, and that A24 and Garland have made rods for their own backs here.</p>




<p>We're likely a couple of years away from the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>movie at the very least, but for now, if you want more&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>shenanigans, you can content yourself with upcoming multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">due to arrive next week</a>.</p>

<p>The Fall Of Avalon is set in another dark reimagining of Arthurian myth, one less abundant in beauty influencers than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tides-of-annihilation-brings-devil-may-crys-speed-and-god-of-wars-scale-to-post-apocalyptic-arthurian-london">Tides Of Annihilation</a>. It takes place about 600 years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-arthur">King Arthur</a>'s fall, in a realm of "unending strife" and plague that is divided into three zones.</p>
<p>The game is said to span 50-70 hours, with over 200 sidequests and an assortment of miscellaneous activities such as decorating your house, farming and "sketchbook journaling". I sincerely hope that last one is a fully fleshed-out illustration subgame, or at least some kind of fantasy photography mechanic. We need more virtual idylls like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eastshade">Eastshade</a>.</p>
<p>One overarching device is that the world worsens at night - that's when the Wyrdness, "a chaotic primordial force", comes out to play, making foes tougher. I too experience Wyrdness at night, but this is generally because I have decided to eat a family-sized bag of Flaming Hot Wotsits. The Fall Of Avalon's Wyrdness is a touch less gastric in origin. According to the backstory, King Arthur actually ousted it many centuries before during his conquest of Avalon. Now, it's back with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Avalon, you are an omni-capable RPG everyperson who can go about wyrdo-murdering using any combination of stats, perks and equipment. "Want to be a crazy alchemist-berserker punching enemies to death? Sure," promises the Steam blurb. "A mystical blacksmith-mage summoning undead hordes? We've got you covered. A stealthy archer lurking in the shadows? Say less - this is the game for stealth archer enthusiasts." Cry more, Thief.</p>
<p>I'm not keen on everything I've read about the game. There's talk of a "mature, morally grey story", for example. "Mature" and "morally grey" are terms used by rosy-cheeked children to describe the act of lying about whether they've brushed their teeth. Between that and the boilerplate industry talk of "limitless playstyles", "meaningful choices" and "love letters" to the Elder Scrolls-style RPG genre, I doubt this will be very surprising on the whole.</p>
<p>Still, I quite enjoy the art direction's core theme of "everlasting autumn", and I like the environment design's somewhat Fromsofty sense of rot. Did I mention there's a plague? It's called the Red Death. A bunch of priests are searching for a cure by means of torturous experimentation upon victims who are slowly transforming into monsters. Perhaps it's the Flaming Hot Wotsits talking, but that sounds like just the thing for a Friday night. Let us know if you've played this and Have Thoughts.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I expect to see people in lifelike masks, some twists, some turns, a few dangerous stunts, a car or motorcycle chase, and a villain trying to do something terrible. Oh, and one more thing I expect: Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt sporting a new hairstyle. </p><p>Yes, in nearly every <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-characters-luther-owen-ethan-ilsa-1851781537&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-characters-luther-owen-ethan-ilsa-1851781537"><em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie</a></span>, Cruise is rocking a new hairdo. Sometimes his hair is long. We like that. Sometimes it’s short. We aren’t as excited about that. So we decided to rank each of these haircuts from worst to best. </p><p>And before we hop into the list, just a heads-up that we are only focusing on the main movies starring Cruise. This isn’t about the OG show or any of the games or whatever. We are only ranking cinematic hair, the best kind of hair. Anyway, here’s the best haircut out of all the <em>Mission: Impossible </em>movies...</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f382df5c64a927b6c102f2cda983df6e" data-recommend-id="image://f382df5c64a927b6c102f2cda983df6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f382df5c64a927b6c102f2cda983df6e" data-recommend-id="image://f382df5c64a927b6c102f2cda983df6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If I were to rank all of the films, <em>Mission: Impossible 2 </em>would (probably) be at the bottom. While it has some fans and it has some cool moments, it’s a bit of a mess and feels out of place compared to all the other films. But damn, Hunt’s hair in this one is the best. It’s the longest it will ever be and looks fantastic.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a0c54c080ea05a49f0b05c74f59ae9b3" data-recommend-id="image://a0c54c080ea05a49f0b05c74f59ae9b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a0c54c080ea05a49f0b05c74f59ae9b3" data-recommend-id="image://a0c54c080ea05a49f0b05c74f59ae9b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The fourth film in the series is one of the best and also serves as a bit of soft reboot for the franchise after the so-so <em>MI3 </em>and the (as mentioned already) not great <em>MI2. </em>And it appears that director Brad Bird and Cruise wanted to make a clean break from <em>MI3</em>'s short hair. So once more, Hunt has grown his hair out, though this time it’s a bit more styled than in <em>MI2. </em></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8e47b6d43039c025ae759e978f93221a" data-recommend-id="image://8e47b6d43039c025ae759e978f93221a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8e47b6d43039c025ae759e978f93221a" data-recommend-id="image://8e47b6d43039c025ae759e978f93221a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The latest movie in the series (and maybe the last...) seems to be designed to be more fan-service-y than usual. I guess after eight films, the series has earned one movie that is filled with callbacks and references. And that’s why, I think, Cruise is sporting some very long and messy hair. He knows, like we know, that it’s Hunt’s best look. So why not bring it back for one more go?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d94a5e064d23e84a02505f44b6e182e2" data-recommend-id="image://d94a5e064d23e84a02505f44b6e182e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d94a5e064d23e84a02505f44b6e182e2" data-recommend-id="image://d94a5e064d23e84a02505f44b6e182e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Rogue Nation</em>, we get a medium-length haircut on Ethan for the first time in the series. It looks fine, though it mostly just reminds me that I’ll always prefer a longer style on the world’s best super spy.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2520b93b565459d8d6f82d3c7056b4d" data-recommend-id="image://b2520b93b565459d8d6f82d3c7056b4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2520b93b565459d8d6f82d3c7056b4d" data-recommend-id="image://b2520b93b565459d8d6f82d3c7056b4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Perhaps the nicest thing I can say about this haircut is that of all Hunt’s shorter styles, this is the least bad. I think that’s down to it having some good volume and shape. It’s not just a buzz cut or crew cut. There’s a bit more going on and I appreciate that.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a9d507ff69063065ba7db189504f48d" data-recommend-id="image://8a9d507ff69063065ba7db189504f48d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a9d507ff69063065ba7db189504f48d" data-recommend-id="image://8a9d507ff69063065ba7db189504f48d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is the perfect cut for a movie like <em>Mission: Impossible 3</em>. It’s not horrible, but it’s pretty forgettable. It’s not the worst, but you’ll likely never say you love it. It’s just fine. It gets the job done. It’s a utilitarian cut that feels very generic, but has just enough style that you don’t mind looking at it. And all of that could apply to the middle-of-the-road <em>MI3 </em>as well<em>. </em></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="765ed7c058177b30745ff1ebea0af19b" data-recommend-id="image://765ed7c058177b30745ff1ebea0af19b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="765ed7c058177b30745ff1ebea0af19b" data-recommend-id="image://765ed7c058177b30745ff1ebea0af19b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Wowza, what a not-great look! I think this cut—which is similar to his hair in <em>Fallout</em>, but a bit shorter and less voluminous—when matched up with some of his outfits in this movie just ends up creating a bad combo. It almost feels unfinished and tired. Sounds a lot like <em>Dead Reckoning</em>!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="32358e150375c4f08b6f86a743744b1c" data-recommend-id="image://32358e150375c4f08b6f86a743744b1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32358e150375c4f08b6f86a743744b1c" data-recommend-id="image://32358e150375c4f08b6f86a743744b1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And so, we reach the worst haircut out of all of them. What a shame this military-like crew cut is what Tom Cruise has in the very first film. The OG <em>Mission: Impossible </em>is a great film, one of the best in the series. But Hunt looks like a soldier more than a spy with this boring and aggressively dull haircut. At least the movie is awesome. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has dropped its case against Microsoft that sought to block the company's blockbuster $75.4 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The deal was already approved, but the FTC was appealing the decision.</p><p>A memo from the FTC states that, "The Commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative litigation in this case. Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that the complaint in this matter be, and it hereby is, dismissed."</p><p>Microsoft president Brad Smith <a href="https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1925660906702156072" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> this was a "victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, D.C."</p><p>This result was expected. Earlier this month, a US appeals court <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-scores-key-victory-in-activision-acquisition-with-ftc-appeal-denied/1100-6531378/" data-ref-id="1100-6531378">denied the FTC's appeal</a> of the original judgment that the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard deal could go through. It's not clear how the two companies could have been untangled had the appeal been successful.</p><p>To appease regulator concerns, Microsoft carved out deals to bring Xbox games to non-Xbox streaming platforms and also continue to release games on non-Xbox platforms. Microsoft is indeed doing that, and for April 2025 in the US, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-sales-charts-thanks-to-ps5/2900-6605/" data-ref-id="2900-6605">five out of the top seven best-selling PS5 games were published by Xbox</a>.</p><p>The FTC's case against Microsoft was driven in part by FTC head Lina Khan. When President Trump took office in January 2025, he installed Andrew N. Ferguson as the new FTC chair.</p><p>Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $75.4 billion was Microsoft's biggest-ever acquisition by purchase price, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/" data-ref-id="2900-4718">biggest gaming buyout of all time.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/half-life-3-main-story-hook-may-not-be-widely-appreciated-%E2%80%93-rumor.1197351/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-main-story-hook/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>HLX, the game rumored to be the long-anticipated Half-Life 3, will feature a main story hook that may not be widely appreciated, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-Life subreddit</a>, known leaker GabeFollower commented on the game's main hook during a livestream of another known Valve leaker, Tyler McVicker, saying that he thinks people may not like it. As leakers have been avoiding revealing story details, which are reportedly being discussed online in some circles, no other comment was provided, but it will be very interesting to see why this story hook may prove to be divisive, considering Valve's known rigorous playtesting process.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1ks6nbi/gabefollower_claims_that_people_might_not_like/">GabeFollower claims that people might not like the story of HLX (rumored Half-Life 3)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Evol-Chan/">u/Evol-Chan</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/">HalfLife</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Even if the main story hook of the game ends up being as divisive as suggested by GabeFollower's recent comment, there's no doubt that it probably wouldn't be a massive problem for a game like Half-Life 3 that many have been waiting for decades. Thankfully, it shouldn't take too long to learn more about this HLX project, rumored to be the third main entry in the series, as the game is undergoing playtesting for a <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">possible Summer reveal and Winter release</a>. Development is reportedly also close to completion, as the game is playable from beginning to end and the development team is focusing on optimization and polish, with content and mechanics already likely locked.</p>
<p>HLX - Half-Life 3 isn't the only gaming project in development at Valve. <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-new-project-tf/">Earlier this month</a>, we learned that another project codenamed Tf is in the works, but being in a very early stage of development, it is impossible to learn what this project will be about.</p>

    <p><span>Season 2 begins alongside Xbox Series release.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.0 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [25 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Where Clouds Embrace the Dawn,” will launch on June 6, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [196 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. As <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/zenless-zone-zero-for-xbox-series-launches-in-june-alongside-version-2-0-update">previously announced</a>, the <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,236 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a> versions will launch alongside version 2.0. <span id="more-966809"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this expansive update, Proxies will venture into the all-new Waifei Peninsula alongside trusted allies such as Yixuan from Yunkui Summit, revitalize the Suibian Temple nestled within the bustling Failume Heights, and take on more challenging Hollow combat in a more open and spacious environment. To commemorate the game’s first anniversary, Version 2.0 will bring a wide array of celebration rewards including a free S-Rank Agent, a free S-Rank W-Engine, 1,600 Polychromes and 20 Encrypted Master Tapes.</p><p>Following the resolution of the Sacrifice crisis in previous chapters, players will embark on an exhilarating new journey in Waifei Peninsula, a remote yet vibrant district of New Eridu. Guided by Yi Xuan, the High Preceptor of Yunkui Summit, Proxies will further uncover the hidden secrets of Phaethon and experience new Hollow exploration gameplay that harnesses the forces of Ether. The region’s main city Failume Heights thrives near the Lemnian Hollow, renowned for the rare resource Porcelume. It offers distinctive tea houses, pawnshops, and dessert stalls, inviting Proxies to immerse themselves in the local atmosphere. Meanwhile, Proxies will take on management of their very own Suibian Temple, upgrade the temple’s facilities and earn in-game rewards by dispatching Bangboos, completing commissions, and collecting resources from the Hollows.</p><p>The Lemnian Hollow is an area rich in resources, yet fraught with danger. Due to the perilous Miasma widespread in the Hollow, formidable foes will enter the Miasmic Field state under certain conditions, gaining shields and enhanced abilities. To counter this, several powerful allies will join the roster. Yixuan, also known as the Grandmaster, will join the combat as an S-Rank Agent. With her unique Attribute Auric Ink and Specialty Rupture, Yixuan ignores enemies’ Defense and deals all damage based on her Sheer Force, which can be increased according to her Attack and Max HP. She also utilizes a special mechanic called Adrenaline instead of just regular Energy, and possesses 2 distinct Ultimate modes for varied combat scenarios, bringing Void Hunter-level prowess to the team. Joining Yixuan is Ju Fufu, the senior disciple of Yunkui Summit, who will debut as an S-Rank Fire Stun Agent. Ju Fufu and her mighty weapon Hu Wei can accumulate Might and Momentum points to deal both Physical and Fire damage. Her Chain Attack grants the entire team the Tiger’s Roar effect, boosting the squad’s CRIT DMG as well as the damage of Chain Attacks and Ultimates.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_966810"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Also stepping into the spotlight is Pan Yinhu, Yunkui Summit’s A-Rank Physical Defense Agent, who proves that even a kitchen-savvy panda can be a force to reckon with. Completing the squad is Belion, an S-Rank Bangboo from Yunkui Summit. Meanwhile, the S-Rank Ether Support Astra Yao and the S-Rank Physical Defense Caesar will return to the Version 2.0 banners.</p><p>Apart from new narrative and characters, Hollow Zero: Lost Void will also be updated with new commissions and the possibility to equip multiple Gears to different Agents, adding more strategic options to battles. In Version 2.0, Proxies will be able to enter the cinema in Lumina Square to enjoy movies with different characters during the Gravitational Attraction event and obtain exclusive rewards by completing certain tasks, including an A-Rank W-Engine Reel Projector. In the Soul of Steel: Golden Bond event, Proxies can pilot sleek mechs into the Hollows, take on a variety of challenges, and earn abundant rewards.</p><p>To support more convenient exploration across the expanded New Eridu and Hollows, Version 2.0 will introduce a brand-new 3D map and enhanced navigation features. The newly implemented Fissure Beacons will allow Proxies to restore HP, revive Agents, and teleport, allowing Proxies to resume combat more efficiently. Furthermore, new players who complete Season 1 Chapter 2 Interlude can directly unlock and switch to Season 2’s main storyline.</p><p>Beyond new content and optimizations, Version 2.0 will deliver generous anniversary rewards in appreciation of the players’ continued support. Proxies will be able to choose one S-Rank Agent and one S-Rank W-Engine from the Stable Channel for free, along with receiving 1,600 Polychromes, as well as an anniversary-exclusive title and avatar upon the Version 2.0 release. Furthermore, players can also obtain a variety of in-game rewards, including 20 Encrypted Master Tapes, 10 Boopons, and new Outfits for the protagonists by completing specific challenges and event commissions.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,523 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [23,191 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

What's interesting here is that Id will make use of what it calls "Tunables," a system that allows it to update parts of the game without needing to release a patch.</p><p>While Tunables can't fix complex systemic, content, or code-related bugs, they can adjust parts of the new Doom game to create subtle but noticeable changes. Overall, players wanting to test their mettle on Nightmare difficulty can expect to start sweating, as enemies like the Cosmic Baron and Hellknight will start doing more damage. <a href="https://x.com/DOOM/article/1925721303987757124/media/1925707376557977600" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Id says that it wanted to increase the threat level</a> of these enemies on Nightmare difficulty, and as an example, missing a parry on the Agaddon Hunter's overhead slash will break your shield and leave you vulnerable for a short period.</p>

      </div>
<p>"There are systems under the hood that are designed to give players a better chance to survive when near death, and those systems were being too generous," Id explained. "Players were able to brute-force their way through situations that should've resulted in costing a Life Sigil or death, and we want to make sure we are keeping the player in check and asking for better tactical decisions. These changes will have an impact on player survivability and will be more noticeable the higher up the Damage Scale slider you go."</p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages launched last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-hits-3-million-players-right-away-and-the-majority-of-them-are-on-game-pass-apparently/1100-6531702/">and right out of the gate, it hit 3 million players</a>. That's seven times quicker than Doom Eternal, but it's worth noting that 2 million players came from Game Pass alone, as The Dark Ages was a day-one release on that service. While that figure is impressive, it's still not clear if The Dark Ages is doing well commercially, given how cagey Bethesda is with details on development and marketing costs for the game.</p><p>"Doom: The Dark Ages reinvents and reins in with equal measure, taking the series in a bold new direction without straying from its captivating roots," Alessandro Barbosa wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>.</p>

			<p>Resident Evil 9 began development as an open-world multiplayer game, and though the game was rebooted, the current version retains some of its original premise.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1925562211206103333#m">X</a>, well-known CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem commented on the latest rumors on the yet-to-be-revealed new entry in the survival horror series, revealing that the game started development back in 2017 and was originally meant to be the exact opposite of Resident Evil VII: Biohazard, an open-world multiplayer game starring Leon Kenney and Jill Valentine set on a fictional island based off Singapore. The reason why CAPCOM was going with such a game was due to Resident Evil VII: Biohazard underperforming at the time, and the desire to make something that was the exact opposite of a game that was not meeting sales expectations. Resident Evil 9, however, didn't remain an open-world game for long. Development was rebooted around 2021 when Resident Evil Village came out, and most of its premise changed, although some elements remain the same, as well as Leon being the protagonist.</p>
<p>Besides revealing these interesting Resident Evil 9 tidbits, Dusk Golem provided a minor update on other series projects in the works. The Resident Evil Zero remake underwent some significant changes around half a year ago, and he believes what another leaker said regarding its reveal timing, which should be soon. In addition, Revelations 3, which was revealed a few years ago via a massive leak, was canceled in 2022.</p>
<p>Very little is known about Resident Evil 9 at the moment, other than the fact that it has been in development for a while. Despite the silence, however, the game is reportedly still set for <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-still-reportedly-planned-for-2025-reveal-and-2026-launch/">a 2025 reveal and a 2026 launch</a>. With plenty of showcases and events in the next few weeks, the wait may finally be over to see how the game will <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-reinvention-series/">reinvent the series</a>, which is reportedly why it is taking so long to release.</p>

                <p>Google has released a new AI video generation tool, and it's clearly very familiar with what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> gameplay looks like. The advanced AI tool generated some very convincing Fortnite footage in response to a simple prompt, churning out a clip that's almost indistinguishable from the real thing.</p><p>Veo 3, the latest video generation model from Google DeepMind, released this week, and already is creating some concerningly realistic footage with its added capacity to generate lifelike audio. The AI tool is also showing a blatant disregard for intellectual property--which may be of more concern to many of the companies that have been quick to implement AI technology.</p><p>As picked up by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dystopian-google-ai-video-generator-generating-fake-fortnite-clips-and-its-tough-to-tell-the-difference" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, X user <a href="https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/1924994290729599222" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Matt Schumer</a> posted a short clip generated by Veo 3 that shows a streamer winning a game of Fortnite. While it looks a little odd to have the streamer's face cam superimposed over a shot of a computer monitor, rather than direct gameplay footage, the clip is otherwise indistinguishable from real Fortnite gameplay.</p><p>Schumer later shared that the prompt for the clip didn't actually mention Fortnite at all, and was just nine words long--"Streamer getting a victory royale with just his pickaxe." While a direct prompt to generate Fortnite footage would get blocked by Veo's content filters, Schumer discovered that key terms like "Victory Royale" and "pickaxe" were enough for the tool to understand that he was talking about Fortnite. Schumer also showed that the AI tool will generate pure gameplay footage without a streamer overlay.</p><p>Veo 3's ability to generate such convincing Fortnite footage shows that the tool has likely been trained on plenty of copyrighted content, and raises interesting questions about how copyright law will handle generative AI. It's yet to be seen if Epic--or any other company whose IPs can be this easily copied by AI--will do anything in response.</p><p>Epic Games also uses AI tools, including in the development of Fortnite. Most recently, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-ai-darth-vader-in-fortnite/1100-6531612/" data-ref-id="1100-6531612">allowed players to interact with</a> an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">AI-powered Darth Vader</a> who interacts with the player in the voice of James Earl Jones. Voice actors union SAG-AFTRA has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-voice-draws-union-complaint/1100-6531662/" data-ref-id="1100-6531662">filed a complaint</a> against Epic Games for its use of AI voice acting.</p>

                <p>A big new update for SteamOS is here, after months of development in beta. SteamOS Version 3.7.8 includes a lot of fixes and improvements on a system level, and will also introduce a battery saver feature for the Steam Deck for the first time.</p><p>The new battery saver option is called Battery Charge Limit, and can be found under the Power submenu in Settings. The feature allows users to set a maximum charge limit for their Steam Deck, with a maximum of 80% charge recommended for devices that are usually left on charge, or that rarely have their battery fully depleted.</p><p>This kind of feature, designed to prolong the working life of lithium-ion batteries, is already commonly implemented in devices like mobile phones and laptops, and now is starting to become more common in the gaming space. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-a-switch-2-setting-that-prevents-its-battery-from-deteriorating/1100-6531462/" data-ref-id="1100-6531462">Nintendo recently revealed</a> that the Switch 2 will have a similar feature, which will stop the hybrid handheld console from charging once it reaches 90%.</p><p>The SteamOS update also includes a number of other notable changes that will improve the OS from the ground up--with upgrades to the system's Linux base, and the Mesa graphics driver base. Version 3.7.8 will also improve the Steam Deck's desktop experience, with an upgrade to Plasma 6.2.5 for an overall smoother and more modern desktop experience.</p><p>The latest update also improves support for third-party devices, including AMD-powered devices like the ROG Ally and original Lenovo Legion Go, as well as adding official support for the newer Legion Go S.</p><p>SteamOS users can also expect a decent amount of other bug fixes, compatibility improvements and other enhancements to the system.
