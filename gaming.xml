            <p>
I'm writing up Astro Prospector for a couple of reasons: firstly, it reminds me of two childhood favourites, Atari's Asteroids and the less-known Crystal Quest for the Macintosh. And secondly, there's something appealingly perverse about a <em>bullet hell</em> of all gametypes that is always simulating the player nodding off at the keyboard.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's an "incremental" single-screen shmup and office burnout spoof in which you control a spaceship with the mouse, auto-mining asteroids for giant coffee beans, while avoiding or destroying the forces of the villainous SpaceCorp.</p>
<p>The length of each round depends on your pilot's starting caffeine intake: after a few seconds, their eyelids will droop shut and obscure the view. But you can grind your beans between missions to unlock buffs that empower your ship and prolong your wakefulness. One of the unlocks lets you fly through hoops that generate Flow, the productivity guru's favourite tipple.
</p>
<p>
The first SpaceCorp enemies consist of lethargic fidget-spinners - easily flummoxed by orbiting slowly around them. Later enemies deliver the expected screenfuls of projectiles, obliging you to follow very particular paths across the screen while continuing to excavate the swirling spacerocks.</p>
<p>As frenetic as the battles get, though, it seems you'll always have to worry about your pilot falling asleep. To sleep: perchance to dream of upgrade screens. And then, back to the gauzy brown starfields for a top-up. Such madness. So sadness. Nice pixel HUD and ship designs, though. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3503440/Astro_Prospector/">Find the demo on Steam</a>.

Again, this is all about point of view. I never approach this as, like, a territory I’m carving out for my thing,” said Johnson. “In my perspective, J.J. did the same thing with the third that I did with the second, which is not digging it up and undoing — just telling the story the way that was most compelling going forward. That means not just validating what came before, but recontextualizing it and evolving and changing as the story moves forward.”</p><p>“I didn’t feel resentful in some way,” continued Johnson. “But you’re talking about a movie made by my friends, with my friends in it. I sit down to watch a movie, and it’s a <em>Star Wars</em> movie. It’s all stuff I love. I’m not the one to come to for a hard-hitting critique. You can go to YouTube for that.”</p><p>Johnson also made it clear that he didn’t intend to retcon any moments from 2015's <em>The Force Awakens,</em> directed by J.J. Abrams as well.<em>&nbsp;</em>In fact, they communicated during the production of <em>Force Awakens. </em></p><p>“We communicated. We met and I spent days with him and was able to get into his head and all the choices he had made,” said Johnson. “That having been said, I communicated and I went and made the movie. And he was in the middle of <em>Force Awakens</em>.”</p><p>Ultimately, I feel like the choices in [<em>The Last Jedi</em>], none of them were born out of an intent to ‘undo’ anything. They were all born out of the opposite intent of, how do I take this story that J.J. wrote, that I really loved, and these characters he created that I really loved, and take them to the next step? Kathy [Kennedy, the president of Lucasfilm] said, ‘We’re looking at someone to do the <em>Empire </em>[<em>Strikes Back</em>] of this series.’ I took that assignment very seriously. Maybe more seriously than someone would have liked. I guess to me that didn’t mean making something that just had nods to <em>Empire</em> — that meant trying to genuinely do what <em>Empire </em>did.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-last-jedi-director-rian-episode-9-jj-retcon-1851786221]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus savings on Suikoden, AirPods Pro, and more</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you collect Pokémon cards or just like staying ahead of the curve, Best Buy just opened preorders for Pokémon TCG: Mega Evolutions. This set is shaping up to be a big one, bringing back classic mechanics with modern flair, and preorders tend to sell out quickly once word gets out. This also means that other big box retailers should be going live with their preorder allocations soon, so make sure to keep an eye on Target and Walmart below.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the Mega Evolutions preorders, today’s lineup has a few other bangin deals. Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered is down to $48.31 for the Day One Edition on Nintendo Switch, and The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Edition hardcover is sitting at just over $30. If you’ve been eyeing AirPods Pro 2, they’re holding steady at $199, offering great value with active noise cancellation and personalized spatial audio. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Mega Evolution Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is it, the beggining of a new expansion for Pokémon TCG. Best Buy have gone live with their preorder allocation for Mega Evolutions today, which mean Target and Walmart won't be far behind. Here's all the links you need and good luck trainers!</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Price Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't believe I'm writing this, but Amazon has quite a bit of sealed Pokémon TCG product for under market value. Whilst that unfortunately means it's still way above MSRP, some of these sets are at the best prices they've been in the last month.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As newer Pokémon TCG sets grab the spotlight, Paradox Rift is seeing its high-rarity SIR ex cards drop in value while several Illustration Rares quietly climb due to shifting collector interest and low inventory. Cards like Altaria ex, Gholdengo ex, and Steelix have dropped between 16% and 25%, while Illustration Rares including Morpeko, Plusle, Minun, Groudon, and Iron Valiant ex are climbing fast, with Morpeko leading at a 43% increase. This mirrors earlier trends where less flashy cards gain traction as availability tightens.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Pricing Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a bit of a mixed back for Magic: The Gathering prices this week, so it's always worth double checking eBay before TCG Player and Amazon for a last minute bargain. Also, whoever thinks a Theros Beyond Death booster is worth north of $700 needs to have a word with themselves.</p><p id="yu-gi-oh-early-days-collection-swi"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Yu-Gi-Oh!

Early Days Collection (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up the Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection for Switch and it’s been a solid throwback to the old Duel Monsters days. I grew up playing these games, so jumping back in with the ability to duel online and unlock classic cards feels pretty great. The save-anywhere feature makes it easy to squeeze in a match during a break and come back to it later. I also like that you can rewind or fast forward during duels which makes testing out new strategies a lot more flexible.</p></div><p id="superman-blu-ray-digital"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)">Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225245"><div id="225245" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I was hoping to grab the steelbook edition of Superman but it looks like that’s already sold out. The standard Blu-ray is still available though if you’re just looking to watch the movie without the collectible packaging. James Gunn delivers a Superman story that feels fresh while staying true to the character. There’s a solid balance of action, humor, and heart, and it sets a strong tone for what’s next in the DCU. If you’re into superhero movies that keep things grounded while still feeling big and cinematic, this one’s worth picking up.</p></div><p id="split-fiction-ps5"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Split Fiction (PS5)">Split Fiction (PS5)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225246"><div id="225246" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Split Fiction (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed Split Fiction on PS5 recently and it’s been a great pick for co-op sessions. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">We gave it a 9 out of 10</a> and after playing it I can see why. It focuses on split-screen teamwork where you and a partner have to sync your actions to clear each challenge. I really like how each level introduces new mechanics and switches between sci-fi and fantasy settings so it never feels repetitive. Mio and Zoe’s story adds some extra depth too since they do not get along at first but that dynamic makes the whole adventure feel more personal as things ramp up.</p></div><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-earbuds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds">Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225247"><div id="225247" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features. At $199, they offer a strong balance of value and performance. The active noise cancellation blocks out a lot of background noise while adaptive audio automatically adjusts based on your surroundings. You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions. The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switc">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225248"><div id="225248" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake</a> caught my attention for how it brings that classic RPG feel into a modern format. At $34.99, it’s a pretty big discount compared to the usual price, which makes it an easy pick if you’ve been waiting to try it. The HD-2D visuals really stand out with that mix of pixel art and depth that makes the world feel fresh but still familiar. Battles stick to the traditional turn-based system but with small updates like adjustable speed and auto-battle, so it doesn’t feel stuck in the past. The soundtrack ties it all together with that same timeless vibe DRAGON QUEST fans already know.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-illustrated-t"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (T">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225249"><div id="225249" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Edition feels like more than just a regular hardcover. At $30.07 it is a big drop from the usual $90 which makes it a sound deal. What really sets this edition apart are the illustrations with Tolkien’s own drawings maps and sketches included throughout. The full text is printed in red and black ink and there are details like sprayed edges and a ribbon bookmark that make it feel more like a collector’s item.</p></div><p id="suikoden-i-ii-hd-remastered-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (Switc">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225250"><div id="225250" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered at $48.31 for the Day One Edition is an essential pickup for JRPG fans. The updated pixel art looks sharp without losing the original style and the new environmental sounds add a little more atmosphere as you move through towns and dungeons.  Fattle fast forward and auto-save features make revisiting these games more modern and easier to play in shorter sessions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-exclusive-hands-on-preview-ign-first</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mafia-the-old-country-%E2%80%93-exclusive-hands-on-preview-ign-first.1243227/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Before I sat down to play about three hours of Mafia: The Old Country, Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes repeatedly mentioned his team’s desire for players to finish this prequel’s story. And so with that goal in mind, the latest Mafia game turns back the clock both chronologically – it’s set in the early 1900s in Sicily – and in game design as well. Mafia 3, though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/mafia-3-review"><u>very good</u></a>, went full open-world, and the developers seemed to feel similarly about it in hindsight as players did: it just didn’t fit Mafia well. The first two Mafias were gorgeous, narrative-driven, linear games set against the backdrop of a stunning and highly detailed world that, while explorable, really only existed as a beautiful backdrop for your main mission, rather than trying to keep you busy with menial tasks and sidequests. In fact, Baynes seemed to suggest that the positive reception to 2020’s remake of the first game (Mafia: Definitive Edition) served as something of an inspiration to and north star for this fourth entry in the mainline series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m pleased to report that after playing through Chapters 3, 4, and 5 of The Old Country, the development team has seemingly succeeded in returning Mafia to its gameplay roots. This is, like Mafia 1 and 2, a story-first, not-open-world action-adventure. And interestingly, your primary, upgradeable weapon isn’t a gun – though they are certainly here – but rather, your knife. Stealth is fully supported, and even better, it’s only going to be $50 at launch, or as I like to call it, the Reverse Randy Pitchford price tag.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">That Old Familiar Feeling</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">When I first picked up the controller – playing on a high-end PC, which is where the footage you’re seeing in the video at the top of this page and directly above came from – it’s the early 1900s and late-teenager Enzo Favara has recently escaped the sulfur mines he spent his childhood laboring in and started to become his own free man while working in the vineyard of Don Torrisi, a Sicilian mafioso who protects the people and property of the region from the thieving bandits that lurk in the hills – in exchange for monthly protection payments, of course. I really like how The Old Country tries to depict Enzo’s progression from a very innocent kid into a bound-by-blood, fully vetted member of the Torrisi outfit who’s got the green light to do anything he thinks needs to be done for the good of the family. We see this play out in Chapter 3, where Enzo’s first taste of life outside the vineyard with the Torrisis comes when he’s brought along on a series of collections by Luca, the Don’s right hand man, and Cesare, another made member of the family.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Luca and Cesare are essentially the mafioso version of an angel and devil on your shoulders.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Luca and Cesare are essentially the mafioso version of an angel and devil on your shoulders, where Luca preaches patience and using violence only as a last resort, while Cesare is more of a “shoot first and ask questions later” kind of guy. For example, on our first collection stop, we visited Marco, an olive farmer. Marco always pays on time, but on this occasion, he’s late. Luca gives me an unloaded gun to be used only as an intimidation tactic to get Marco to pay up, but Cesare told me, “An extra pair of hands helps jog their memory” about the late payment. Side note: I think I saw more fruit in three hours of playing Mafia: The Old Country than I’ve seen in any game ever. We might need a new Game Awards category for this. Ultimately, no bullets were fired nor punches thrown, and I got the Don’s money from Marco’s safe after finding the combination nearby. I appreciate that Hangar 13 put thought into Enzo’s journey into the Torrisi crime family here and didn’t just instantly let you become a murdering psychopath.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Things escalated slightly on our second stop, though, after we rode our horses across the Sicilian countryside to the farm of Mr. Bangalino, whose workers, led by a man named Manuele, are on strike. “We can't have strikes around here, Manuele,” Luca told the not-working men. “You and your friends need to get back to work. This is bad for business.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the way, I can’t emphasize enough how much I enjoyed staring at the countryside while riding to each destination on this mission. Mafia: The Old Country ditches the proprietary engine it’s used in all three previous Mafia games and moves to Unreal Engine 5 for this installment. To be fair, the previous engine was no slouch; Mafia 2 in particular was a strikingly good-looking game at the time it came out, and Unreal maintains the series’ reputation for delivering lovely locations. The perfect blue skybox and pillowy clouds that set atop the rolling green hills and farmlands did a great job of establishing The Old Country’s Sicilian setting. I can’t wait to see more of this world in the rest of the campaign.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mafia: The Old Country May 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, Manuele pulled a knife, introducing me to what is, as I mentioned earlier, perhaps the weapon that Mafia: The Old Country puts the most importance on. You can unlock and earn new knives, and each has unique modifying properties, giving you a reason beyond the cosmetic appearance of each blade to choose a specific one that suits your combat preferences. You’ve got a lot of moves in a knife fight: thrusts, slashes, parries, and dodges (like in the Batman: Arkham games, heavy attacks can’t be parried and must instead be dodged). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there was still one final collection errand to run in Chapter 3, and as you may have guessed by now, the cannoli hit the fan on this one. A visit to a farmer named Fichera sees him yell at us, in a reversal, because his new water pump was stolen by bandits and the protection he pays Don Torrisi handsomely for didn’t protect his valuable property. It’s finally here that the patient Luca tells Enzo that he’s got free reign to put live ammo in his gun and not be afraid to pull the trigger, as these lawless bandits were effectively putting their hands in the Don’s pocket by stealing from Fichera. This leads to a hunt up the hillside through two separate bandit camps before we finally squared off with – and shot many bullets into – the dozen or so wayward thieves that stood between us and the water pump they stole. The familiar third-person cover-based shooting gameplay will be instantly recognizable not just to Mafia series regulars but also anyone who’s played a good third-person action game in the past decade. The Old Country isn’t breaking the mold here, but the gameplay systems are comfortable, effective, and fun. Less comfortable – at least for me – was the cutscene that followed the death of the last of the bandits, when Cesare cuts off the finger of one of the bandits, takes his gold ring as a bonus payment for his troubles, and tosses the detached digit into the well. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Forbidden Love</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">With all of your onboarding completed in Chapter 3, the next section of Mafia: The Old Country saw one massive mission play out, involving the Don’s daughter Isabella, who Enzo clearly has reciprocated feelings for, and Gennaro, the son of Baron Fontanella, who’s arguably an even bigger fish in the Sicilian mafioso sea than Don Torrisi is. Gennaro wants to show off his fancy new car – and he also wants to woo Isabella – so he sets up a picnic date in the nearby ruins. It starts with Enzo having to babysit the gathering and ends with a kidnapping, a car chase involving you on a horse, a trail of bodies left in Enzo’s wake, a stabbed double-crossing business partner, a happy Don Torrisi, and an even-more-smitten-with-Enzo Isabella. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It started quietly, with Gennaro driving Cesare in his car to the ruins, and Isabella insisting on riding there on horseback alongside Enzo. Yes, you’ll be able to choose and ride your own horse in Mafia: The Old Country, with each steed even having its own personality and characteristics. Based on what I played, it didn’t necessarily seem like your choice of horse would materially affect gameplay, but it was a welcome way to add a bit of life and meaning to the narrative nevertheless. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A pit stop en route showed off the camera you can take pictures of scenic spots with; unfortunately it was the only opportunity I had to use it in the three hours I played, but hopefully you get to use it semi-regularly over the course of the campaign. You’re also introduced to the driving mechanics of The Old Country after you rendezvous with Cesare and Isabella in the form of a low-stakes race around the ruins – perhaps a nod to one of Mafia 1’s most infamous missions.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There was no bringing a knife (let alone stealth chokeouts) to a gunfight here...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Cesare and Enzo are messing around with Gennaro’s car during his date with Isabella, bandits – I won’t spoil their identity here – swooped in with guns blazing and kidnapped them both. They were really only after Gennaro, and having to take Isabella as well proved to be…well, as you can imagine it ended up severely complicating things for the kidnappers. I got to wield a shotgun in this segment and found that it packed a satisfying punch. There was no bringing a knife (let alone stealth chokeouts) to a gunfight here; I brought Enzo in with an itchy trigger finger.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After the aforementioned chase, I was able to run down their wagon – and gun down plenty of the kidnapping cadre – and rescue Isabella, who rewarded Enzo with a kiss (don’t tell the Don!). But while Cesare brought Isabella back home, Enzo still had to get Gennaro back, because returning without either one would leave Enzo equally dead from either father. It’s this section that allowed me to really unleash my inner Sam Fisher, as it was set up for stealth rather nicely in an open area, letting me pick my path and remain undetected. If you give me a stealth option in a game I am going to take it nine times out of ten, and Mafia: The Old Country was no different. The developers told me that they don’t expect most players to make it through the entire area – which was admittedly quite large and stocked with a ton of bad guys – without alerting anyone. I took this as a personal challenge, and while I held out for quite a while, eventually I did get spotted and had to start shooting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while you are in The Old Country’s stealth segments, basic Splinter Cell rules are in effect. You crouch to make less noise, throw coins (or picked-up objects like bottles) to distract bad guys, and can either knife them quickly or try to strangle them unconscious, which triggers a button-mashing QTE you’ve got to be quick about, lest they slip out of your grasp. There are even conveniently placed empty containers around that you can hide the bodies in so that they’re not discovered. The Old Country doesn’t break any new ground here, but in my experience, it does familiar stealth gameplay reasonably well. I do appreciate that there are upgradeable bead slots on your rosary that affect gameplay, like one that dampens the sound of your footsteps.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And I appreciated those dampened footsteps until I reached the last man standing for the kidnappers: Messina, whose real story you’ll learn when you play the game yourself. Enzo challenged him to a knife fight, which Messina accepted by dropping his gun and engaging Enzo on his terms. I was having trouble timing my parries just right in the ensuing battle, but I kept enough blood in Enzo’s body for him to emerge as the victor in the fight. (Side note: I died a couple of times during my three hours while playing on Normal, but there are multiple difficulty levels to choose from if you want to ratchet things up or down.) And after returning to the vineyard, Don Torrisi, after hearing of Isabella’s kidnapping, tells Enzo he wants Messina alive. Whoops. Um, yeah, about that…But ultimately, I did good, the boss said. And Isabella made her feelings quite clear with the smile on her face directed at Enzo.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Home Invasion</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Chapter 5 – the final one I got to play – let me again flex my stealth muscles by tasking me with infiltrating the home of the man ultimately responsible for calling for the Gennaro (and by collateral damage, Isabella) kidnapping and dragging him out of his house and back to my boss. Or, put another way, to kidnap the kidnapper. This mission could truly have been pulled straight from a Splinter Cell game, as I had my choice of ways up the hillside to the large villa at the top. I kept it quiet, stabbing my way through the human obstacles in front of me before eventually getting into the house and to my target.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I wouldn’t be so lucky on the way out, though, as by the time I walked out with my target in tow, everyone still left standing knew what was going on, and I had to shoot my way out. As to what happened to that man I brought to the Don? Well, you’ll find out.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Old Country, the New Anticipation</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I left my extended hands-on session with Mafia: The Old Country with very few concerns. In roughly three hours I played three chapters, but how many chapters are there? Whatever the number is, it didn’t feel like a story that was going to be wrapped up in a tidy six hours. I don’t know how long The Old Country ultimately is, but when factoring in the studio president’s comment about wanting everyone to see the end credits roll – as well as the $50 price tag – it’s safe to presume that this won’t be a 40- or even 30-hour game. But for my money, that’s fine. I’m a dad with a job; I’m good with Mafia: The Old Country being a game I can get through in a weekend or two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And more importantly, I’m now quite confident I’m going to have a lot of fun playing through this one, however long it lasts. The gameplay mechanics are all solid if familiar, with enjoyable stealth, shooting, knife combat, and driving. And perhaps the most important ingredient in a Mafia game – the story – had me engaged and eager to see where it was going to go. It’ll be good to get back to a Mafia 1 and 2 vibe again. It’s been a long time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring Nightreign GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Given that Elden Ring Nightreign already has a procedurally generated system, the modder notes that players may only notice the difference of the randomizer with variations of Night Bosses. "Under the hood, it's creating map patterns nearly from scratch and has a tremendous amount of freedom in its placements," they write. "In the future this can be extended to randomizing enemies and bosses within maps and in-depth placement customization."</p><p dir="ltr">Compared to the vanilla maps, the map randomizer has three option presets. One is similar to the base game, another adds randomization to item rewards, as well as the circle timing and size, while reducing repeating camps in consecutive runs, and another is "extra random" by removing certain guardrails.</p><p>The randomizer mod is also compatible with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod-on-pc/1100-6531963/">Seamless Co-op mod</a> that enables two-player co-op, a feature that is missing from the base game, which can currently only be played solo or as a group of three. From Software has confirmed that an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-co-op-confirmed-coming-at-a-later-date/1100-6532013/">official two-player mode will be coming</a> to Elden Ring Nightreign, although there is no date for when this will be. The developer's focus instead has been on an update that rolled out earlier this month to address <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-1-01-4-is-here-and-delivers-even-more-bug-fixes/1100-6532907/">bug fixes</a>, with also no news yet on balance adjustments.</p>

                <p>It sounds like big changes are on the horizon for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>. A group of Diablo 4 content creators recently took to social media to announce they'd seen the future of developer Blizzard's ARPG after attending a special presentation, and that Blizzard has "been cooking" with what it has planned.</p><p dir="ltr">Content creators like Maxroll's <a href="https://x.com/wudijo/status/1943990268035830074" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wudijo</a> and <a href="https://x.com/LuckyLuciano610/status/1943739809945534558" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lucky Luciano</a>, as well as <a href="https://x.com/WarlugTv/status/1944097949648114097" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Warlugtv</a> from Mobalytics, took to social media over the weekend to share their excitement and give Diablo 4 players some hope for the future based on what they had seen during a closed Blizzard presentation. Actual concrete details on what was shown weren't shared, but the social media reactions hint at updates or changes to Diablo 4's core systems as opposed to new features related to the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">second expansion slated to arrive in 2026</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth keeping in mind that some of these content creators have officially worked with Blizzard in the past, and it is currently unclear if any of them were compensated for attending the meeting and offering feedback.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/wudijo/status/1943990268035830074" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Last night some people including myself got a glimpse of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DiabloIV?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DiabloIV</a> 's future.

Look forward to a lot of stuff coming, let's hope it pans out the way it was discussed," Warlugtv said. "Super excited and actually makes me want to log in."</p><p dir="ltr">When asked on X if the plans Warlugtv saw during the presentation were intended for this year or for 2026, Warlugtv in a <a href="https://x.com/WarlugTv/status/1944135837450416160" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reply</a> said "not sure."</p><p dir="ltr">What all changes are coming to Diablo 4, and when they will be arriving, are still largely a mystery then.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-graphics-lead-puts-out-tone-deaf-hiring-call-with-ai-slop-shortly-after-devastating-layoffs.1243194/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>July 2025 kicked off with devastating news for Microsoft employees, as it laid off <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">9,000 workers across the entire company,</a> with a significant number of those layoffs hitting Xbox and Microsoft's gaming division. <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Studios</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">game projects</a> were shut down, veteran developers were either laid off or<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/"> left</a> because of the cuts, and amid reports that the layoffs are directly related to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft wanting to invest more in its AI efforts</a>, Microsoft and Xbox executives have failed to read the room multiple times.</p>



<p>While claims were circulating that Microsoft and Xbox are<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/"> "<em>trying their damndest to replace jobs with AI agents</em>,"</a> it was unfortunate, to say the least, that a seemingly automated invite went out to developers inviting them to a roundtable at Gamescom 2025 all about <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-tools-game-development-laying-off-thousands/">how AI tools can aid in game development</a>. Disdain towards Xbox, Microsoft, and the c-suite executives who didn't lose their jobs compounded when an executive producer at Xbox suggested that <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-microsoft-layoffs-ai-prompt-chatgpt-matt">laid-off workers confide in ChatGPT to help them cope with being laid off</a>.</p>



<p>At least executive producer Matt Turnbull's ill-advised LinkedIn post was, at least on the surface, an attempt to help laid-off workers. Principal development lead for Xbox Graphics, Mike Matsel's post, however, is somehow even more tone-deaf and bull-headed. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mmatsel_the-xbox-graphics-team-is-hiring-folks-with-activity-7349539853866344449-O1G3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">Matsel put out a call</a> that the Xbox Graphics team was hiring two roles. He specified that the team is looking for people "<em>with experience with device drivers, GPU performance, or related validation or engineering system experience</em>." He then links the two job postings, and tells people to message him directly if the postings on Microsoft's website claim to be closed. </p>



<p>That's all fine and well, and even though putting out a hiring call a little more than a week after mass layoffs is never a good look, it's unfortunately a common occurrence. What cinches Matsel's post as tone-deaf, is that he shares an AI-generated image along with his post, which shows someone working at a desktop, presumably looking at nothing, since the image shows their screen on the backside of the monitor. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The comments are, unsurprisingly, filled with people digging into Matsel for posting the image, with one person saying "<em>You could have just sketched an ad on paint, at least it would have been funny. This is just embarrassing.</em>" Another, seemingly referencing Matsel's lack of care in his post, wrote, "<em>I too can post AI slop. Put me on the team, coach!</em>"</p>



<p>You have to wonder whether Turnbull and Matsel made their posts earnestly, or if they were baiting the uproar that both posts have caused. Neither is a good look, because if they earnestly made these posts, then that shows a huge inability to read a room, and a lack of understanding as to how they should communicate with others, whether that's trying to communicate a message of empathy, or opportunity. </p>



<p>If they were baiting the reactions, it's surprising and disappointing to see two high-level executives seeking enjoyment out of a situation that has devastated hundreds of their former coworkers and each of their families. </p>

            <p>Gun.</p>
<p>There are a lot of them in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, it being a shooter and all. HD2 players aren't happy for it to end there though.</p>
<p>They've been asked for their input in renaming the single city on Super Earth they've so far succeeded in rebuilding since all of that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">Illuminate invasion business</a>, and they're voting for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-warbond-is-full-of-funky-alien-tech-including-a-somewhat-stable-wormhole-teleportation-pack">Gun</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Let's face it, given the precedents set by the likes of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36064659">Boaty McBoatface</a> and its lesser known NASCAR twin the <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2021/05/01/why-kansas-nascar-cup-called-buschy-mcbusch-race-400/4897438001/">2021 Buschy McBusch Race 400</a> (yes, that was a name given to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Buschy_McBusch_Race_400">actual professional motor race</a>), this isn't a surprise.</p>
<p>Having managed to rebuild the city of Remembrance through their recent Galactic War efforts, players are currently voting in an <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1391934973841375273">Arrowhead-run Discord poll</a> dedicated to deciding on a new name for it. A new name by which to remember Remembrance. Yep, the whole thing's the usual kind of Helldiversy meta-joke that's still managed to make me crack a grin.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Cue the equally jokey response thus far. 35k and counting votes, that's over 70% of the total share, to rename the city 'Gun'. Well ahead of the second place runner 'Everlasting Memory', which currently boasts just over 9k votes, and third place 'New Remembrance' at 3k. Now, the option that's currently last, 'Peacebeacon's Bloodlight', I'd argue deserves to be there, but I think fourth place 'Winds of Change of Tides of War' warrants a bit more than just over 1k votes.</p>
<p>Sure, it's far too long, but you could abbreviate it to the snappy WoCoToW, which would only make you sound a bit like an alarmed space bird being attacked by a Terminid whenever you say it. Plus, long-winded and grandiose bollocks is the name of the game with HD2's Starship Troopers-ish <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-just-helldivers-2-plenty-of-games-owe-a-lot-to-the-films-of-paul-verhoeven">satire of the fash</a>. Did everyone just forget naming their ships something like 'Ombudsman of Individual Merit'?</p>
<p>Anyway, they're clearly gonna name it 'Gun', which is still at least minor chuckleworthy and also feels very 2025. That is to say, I'm not too pistolff about it.</p>

Hype levels are starting to run dangerously low. While<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is shaping up to be a big shot in the console’s launch window arm later this week, the rest of the Switch 2's first year is filled with question marks right now. Fans desperate for new shiny objects just over the horizon <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352?_gl=1*11iwvyw*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI1MDUzNzgkbzQyJGcwJHQxNzUyNTA1Mzc4JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352?_gl=1*11iwvyw*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI1MDUzNzgkbzQyJGcwJHQxNzUyNTA1Mzc4JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">need reasons to justify dropping $450 on new hardware</a></span>. They might finally be in luck. According to reliable leaker NatetheHate, a new Nintendo Direct is coming before the end of July. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,197533" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“From what I have been told, there is a direct this month,” the YouTube podcaster, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-announcement-nintendo-console-rumor-date-1851738104&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-announcement-nintendo-console-rumor-date-1851738104">who correctly reported</a></span> the timeframe for the Switch 2's original showcase, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y&amp;t=1920s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y&amp;t=1920s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said on his latest episode</a></span>. “So, the month of July, but that Direct will not take place until after <em>Donkey Kong Bonanza </em>releases.” That game comes out July 17, and with Nintendo often opting for showcases in the middle of the week, we’re left with likely dates of July 22-24 and 29-31. </p><p>“Beyond beyond that, I have no additional information. I do not have information as to the exact timing at this point,” NatetheHate continued. “If I had to speculate, I would say probably the last week of July because Friday of that week is August 1st which is Nintendo’s earning report day. So, I could see them having a Direct that week leading to that investors’ report.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the episode, the leaker dives into all the reasons fans are getting impatient for the next Switch 2 showcase. Nintendo has a big first-party fall lineup, but not much of it is Switch 2 exclusive at the moment. We still need dates for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> (cross-gen) and <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>(Switch 2 only). All of the big third-party ports like <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake </em>are slated for 2025 but haven’t been nailed down either. </p><p>According to NatetheHate,<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is definitely coming to the Switch 2, but it’s unclear if that would get announced in a Nintendo Direct or via a standalone trailer by Rockstar Games. There’s also been a surprising lack of support from Microsoft so far. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded </em>is seemingly feasible on the new hardware, but is currently only announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is also getting ported to Xbox. While a stretch, that would probably be the biggest Switch 2 surprise of all if it somehow became a reality.</p><p>There’s also the mysterious absence of <em>Call of Duty</em>. Microsoft made promises to bring the franchise back to Nintendo platforms as part of its Activision acquisition, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/will-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-come-to-switch-2-1851784023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/will-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-come-to-switch-2-1851784023">and the latter confirmed</a></span> that both sides were working on something that would be announced in the future. Does that start this year with <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, or in 2026 with the next sequel? Nintendo was reportedly being very precious with Switch 2 devkits during development, so it’s hard to have a good sense of who may have projects in the pipeline already and who is playing catchup. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-3d-mario-odyssey-donkey-kong-bananza-director-1851785403?_gl=1*1l973qf*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI1MDMwMzgkbzc5JGcxJHQxNzUyNTA2ODE2JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-3d-mario-odyssey-donkey-kong-bananza-director-1851785403?_gl=1*1l973qf*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI1MDMwMzgkbzc5JGcxJHQxNzUyNTA2ODE2JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">Finally, there’s the question of Mario</a></span>. It seems clearer than ever that <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is being made by a portion of the <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> team but not all of it, freeing up the others, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pauline-donkey-kong-bananza-timeline-dk-lore-1851786019&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pauline-donkey-kong-bananza-timeline-dk-lore-1851786019">like Nintendo veteran Yoshiaki Koizumi</a></span>, to work on the next 3D <em>Mario</em> game. It feels like we’re running out of time (and room) for the next one to arrive this fall, but the 2026 spring window could be a decent bet. Nintendo rarely teases things that are more than a year away at this point, but I’m hoping they make an exception in this case. They’ll want to have the next<em> Mario </em>ready for the next <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> movie anyway, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-movie-nintendo-bananza-super-mario-bros-1851786191&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-movie-nintendo-bananza-super-mario-bros-1851786191">that’s coming in April</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-direct-july-mario-red-dead-2-1851786219]]></content:encoded>

This stemmed from the game's newest client update for the Battlefield Labs test. This kind of thing is never meant to be seen by the public, so it's possible "Battlefield 6" is a placeholder name, or that there is no open beta and that the text itself is a placeholder.</p><p>Previous datamining efforts have revealed things like the first glimpse at a<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> rumored Battlefield battle royale mode</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alleged-battlefield-6-leak-shows-first-look-at-single-player-campaign/1100-6532642/" data-ref-id="1100-6532642">the game's campaign.</a></p><p>The Battlefield Labs test is closed, so you have to hope to be chosen to gain access.

It wouldn't be surprising, though, a Battlefield 2042 and other entries in the series had open betas prior to launch.</p><p>EA will formally reveal the next Battlefield game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reveal-still-happening-this-summer-ea-assures/1100-6532481/" data-ref-id="1100-6532481">at some point this summer</a>. Some fans thought there might be a reveal in June to join in with the numerous other gaming industry events, but that didn't happen. Now, some are theorizing that the official Battlefield 6 reveal might be accompanied by an announcement of an open beta, but none of this is confirmed as of yet.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is the first new entry in the franchise since 2021's Battlefield 2042, a poorly received entry in the series that EA management said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">suffered in part due to the remote-working experience during COVID.</a> It was, however, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-vanguard-and-black-ops-cold-war-were-no-1-and-2-best-selling-games-of-2021-in-the-us/1100-6499720/" data-ref-id="1100-6499720">No. 5 best-selling game in the US in 2021.</a></p><p>In other news, EA and DICE have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-add-something-close-to-an-ultimate-ability-for-each-class/1100-6533119/" data-ref-id="1100-6533119">discussed ultimate-like abilities coming to Battlefield 6</a> and defended the decision to not have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-brings-back-controversial-change-from-battlefield-2042/1100-6531734/" data-ref-id="1100-6531734"> class-locked weapons</a>.</p>

                <p>Following observations last week that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blue-archive-pc-release-appears-to-break-steam-rules/1100-6533084/" data-ref-id="1100-6533084">Blue Archive PC release</a> could be breaking Steam policies, Nexon has announced that it has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3557620/view/514089434949353483?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">terminated a controversial in-game event</a>. The Steam event incentivized players to leave reviews for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-archive/" data-ref-id="5000-527462">Blue Archive</a> on Valve's storefront, which goes against the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/reviews" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steamworks documentation</a>. Alongside the event's termination, no rewards earned for reaching the goal will be distributed.</p><p>In a statement posted to the Steam news section for Blue Archive, Nexon says that "following the launch of the Steam client, we prepared this event and rewards for all Senseis as a way to create a better service together through your valuable feedback. However, during the process of announcing the reward distribution linked to review submissions, we discovered that certain aspects could potentially conflict with platform policies. As a result, we have decided to terminate the event early."</p><p>It continues, "Please understand that, in order to comply with platform policies, the rewards for this event will not be distributed." Nexon goes on to promise that it will "take even greater care" when planning future events to ensure it is not going against any other platform policies, while striving to "provide a better service" for its players.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4531901-blue-archive-steam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4531901" data-ratio="0.635" data-width="2000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4531901-blue-archive-steam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4531901"></a><figcaption>The Blue Archive Steam event has been terminated early.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4531901-blue-archive-steam.jpg"></figure><p><span>Blue Archive was released on Steam last week, where it peaked at over 22,000 concurrent players.

            <p>
If you were previously excited about the impending arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-war">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</a>'s Definitive Edition release, there are now two additional reasons to be excited. Firstly, it's out very soon on the newly announced date of 14th August, and secondly, there's a nice chunky discount if you own the Anniversary edition of the game.
</p>
<p>
Dawn of War's Definitive Edition was announced back in May, amid a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-and-space-marine-1-spruce-ups-are-coming-this-year">wave of other Warhammer 40K news bits</a>, promising a fancied-up version of the original 2004 real-time strategy game intended to be more palatable on modern day hardware.
</p>
<p>
There's 4K support, for instance, alongside upscaled textures (4x the originals, supposedly), an enhanced battlefield camera, "optimised" HUD and screen layouts for widescreen viewing, plus improvements to world lighting, units reflections, and shadows.
</p>

<p>
And it's not just the base game getting those enhancements, seeing as the Definitive Edition also includes Dawn of War's three expansions: Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm. That, according to developer Relic Entertainment, amounts to "four Classic Dawn of War Campaigns, nine Armies, and over 200 maps". Plus, the Definitive Edition remains compatible with "over 20-years of lovingly crafted community mods".
</p>
<p>
Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition will cost $29.99 USD (or your local equivalent) when it launches for <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warhammer_40000_dawn_of_war_definitive_edition">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3556750/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Definitive_Edition/">Steam</a> on 14th August. And anyone that already owns the game's Anniversary Edition, which released back in 2006, will be able to purchased the new version with 30 percent off as a "thank-you to our loyal fans."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-warhammer40kdawnofwar-pc">gave the original version of Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 8/10</a> back in the day when numbers still went above five. "It's a perfect gaming world," Eurogamer contributor Keiron Gillen wrote, "being exploited perfectly, for the first time."

            <p>Armchair History Interactive would like to you know that their upcoming strategy game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/master-of-command">Master Of Command</a> is full of smart, unforgiving systems. I know that because they emailed RPS saying that our "strategy features often spotlight smart, unforgiving systems".</p>
<p>I imagine several other outlets also received this exact email but this didn't stop me thinking "you know what - they're right! I <em>am</em> strategy-clever and tactics-tough! And what better way to show that than by covering this game, completely of my own volition and with no outside influence from cleverly worded PR emails playing on my sense of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>-knower's pride. That'll show those fatcats down at the community historical strategy club treasury committee. Who's "making too many explosiony noises during this serious reenactment of the Somme" now, eh?</p>
<p>Truthfully though, I probably would have covered this without the email. It looks suitably grand, and I really dig the idea of a strategy where the management isn't about empires, but the personal journey of your army on campaign. Plus, you get to play uniform dress-up. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The game is set during the Seven Years' War, and you'll be managing your army's supplies, soldiers and equipment across the campaign. Lose all your lads, you lose the run. The line from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878450/Master_of_Command/">Steam</a> description that really hooked me is this'n:</p>
<blockquote><p>At its core, Master of Command is about the relationship between your army and the world around it. March too far and your men will starve. Rest too long and the enemy will reinforce. Your troops rely on you not just to lead them into battle, but to keep them fed, equipped, and alive long enough to reach the final objective.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don't march on an empty stomach, though. That'd be madness. First, fill your belly with features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>Real-Time Tactical Battles:</strong> No turns, no pausing. Engage in historical combat where morale, stamina, terrain, and timing determine the outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Fully Customizable Regiments:</strong> Equip your troops with historical equipment and weapons that affect accuracy, stamina, morale, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Campaign:</strong> Choose a region and enter a fully real-time map with fog of war, branching encounters, and a mobile enemy presence.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent Army Management:</strong> Every loss matters. Units gain experience, officers level up, and your choices carry across each region of the campaign.</li>
<li><strong>150 Historical Units:</strong> Recruit from an extensive roster of 18th-century European forces, each with unique stats, roles, and visuals.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Master Of Command is out sometime this year. I'm going to paint all the hats pink, see how those damn fatcats down at the community historical strategy club treasury committee like that one.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/master-of-command-is-a-strategy-game-of-crunchy-musketry-and-total-war-style-battles-that-tells-the-story-of-an-army-not-an-empire]]></content:encoded>

Eventually, <em>Guitar Hero</em> sales tanked, and Neversoft was closed in 2014, with its remaining staff shoved into the <em>CoD </em>mines. A sad and frustrating end for a great studio.

                <p dir="ltr">Not even a month after launch, Broken Arrow has received a hefty new update for the real-time strategy game. The patch lets players alter their map size in skirmish and custom lobbies; previously, this was automatically selected by the game. In addition, developer Steel Balalaika Studio has addressed anti-cheat issues.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1604270/view/521970734297251862" rel="nofollow ">Update 1.08</a> for Broken Arrow introduces new PvE scenarios on the Kaliningrad and Ruda maps, for up to three players. Meanwhile, the sprint cooldown for infantry is being slashed in half, down to 30 seconds. Steel Balalaika says it doesn't want to make too many balance changes all at once, so is starting with this alteration.</p><p dir="ltr">As for cheating, there have been over 2,000 players banned in Broken Arrow. However, the developer is investigating possible banishments that were unfairly handed out to people. For instance, Steel Balalaika noted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1604270/view/537731883551691566" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a> that players utilizing cheats only in single-player modes could have been banned from multiplayer, since the anti-cheat system can't differentiate between the two.</p><p dir="ltr">Broken Arrow launched on June 19 and costs $50. Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1604270/charts/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>, the RTS game is a top 100 seller on Valve's platform and appears to be averaging a peak of 20,000 concurrent players daily for July. It's a realistic take on the genre, offering a single-player campaign with 19 missions following US and Russian forces. The game also has more than 300 military and tech units to utilize.</p><p dir="ltr">Below are the full patch notes:</p><h3 dir="ltr">Added:</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Added option to change map size in Skirmish and Custom lobbies.

<p dir="ltr">While story is not usually a focus in the Donkey Kong series, Donkey Kong Bananza see the titular ape partnering with a teenaged Pauline, a character who had previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-character-leak-spurs-speculation-over-dk-lore/1100-6530707/">leaked</a> before her official reveal in last month's Donkey Kong Bananza Direct.

			<p>I’m slowly maneuvering through a neon-lit club that’s been the site of a casualty-heavy shooting alongside another teammate. The music is blasting and the lights are dazzling, but nobody is here save for a few terrified civilians, a handful of armed attackers, and crude piles of innocent bodies on each dancefloor. It’s grim, and I’m tense as I search every room for enemies. I slowly swing a door open…and it swings back towards me to close. I swing it open once more, and it returns back at me yet again. Before I can press the button to open it a third time, it pulls all the way back to reveal a shotgun-toting enemy who was behind it all along, and I laugh and scream as I frantically start shooting take him down. It’s fun and tense, it’s stupid and scary, and it’s Ready or Not.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ready or Not: Weight of the Badge - Console Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5eMHPLjBgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At face value, Ready or Not is an incredibly serious game. Whether you boot up the single player Commander mode or a co-op lobby, you’re initially tossed into a realistic police station, and given a list of almost two dozen different S.W.A.T. encounters to take on – each one either based on an eerily familiar real-life tragedy, or simply set in the kind of speculative or terrifying circumstance that I would never want to find myself in. It’s easy to see a mission list that includes an active campus shooter level, a club shooting level, and a sex trafficking level and think the game is going out of it’s way to pursue shock value above all else. The game doesn’t just agree that these situations are awful and terrifying, though, but it also smartly acknowledges that the deliverers of justice can be awful and terrifying too.</p>


<p>When you load into a mission, your base objectives are always to rescue every civilian and “bring order to chaos” – this means killing or arresting every armed enemy on the premises. Your only option for securing an innocent life, though, is to yell them down and cuff them as they question what you’re doing in a terrified or confused tone. And while you’re hunting down a primary armed suspect, you’ll encounter questionable activities or environmental details that go strangely ignored by your direct objectives, yet slowly paint a clearer picture of corruption and ignorance that, instead of feeling like shock value, rings startlingly true with how cops in America are perceived and behave today.</p>


<p>This helps to provide a lot of nuance to the scenarios, but you can also play with four friends in co-op and watch each other get flung across a hallway by a booby-trapped door. The wild tonal ping-pong that happens when you play Ready or Not in co-op makes for some of the most entertaining multiplayer gaming I’ve dug into all year. Guiding AI companions through slow, narrow corridors is challenging, but nowhere near as engaging as the cops-and-robbers roleplaying that you get with real people. It’s so&nbsp;easy to either lock in and pursue objectives, or slip up and laugh until your belly hurts when a friend messes up or the mission goes south.</p>
<p>There is a staggering amount of hardware at your disposal in Ready or Not that makes it incredibly easy to tackle the same mission a dozen different ways. Besides multiple kinds of primary and secondary weapons to choose from, you’ve got a variety of attachments, scopes, and special gear that can help you lock in a particular specialisation and role. Maybe you want to rock a nimble amount of armour and non-lethal suppression gear. Maybe you want to be the first through every opening with a bullet proof shield. Maybe you just want to shoot the hinges off every door with a shotgun.</p>

<p>The mechanical variety at your disposal can get tripped up while playing on console by an equipment wheel that’s a bit too unwieldy to navigate – with the game’s PC origins, it’s great to see there’s support for keyboard and mouse controls, if you want to circumvent this issue. The UI in general is also just very small for playing on a TV, compared to playing on PC.</p>
<p>A few situations in Ready or Not&nbsp;do bring the experience to a screeching halt, though. As mentioned earlier, playing with AI isn’t nearly as thrilling. At times, they’re almost&nbsp;<em>too</em> competent and can clear out an entire room with the precision of RoboCop before you’ve even realized that room exists. The main single-player Commander mode attempts to add a layer of meta-progression with a squad of partners who you dynamically manage and upgrade as they go on missions, get injured, face failure, and can even die. It’s interesting, but not nearly enough and not all that exciting. Perhaps a roguelike spin on your mission objectives and gear could add a lot to the experience, but as it stands, I had no reason to get attached to the identical gruff old police men the game threw at me.</p>

<p>I also repeatedly faced an awkward moment in each mission where, as you get done exploring the level and have taken care of nearly every objective, there’s always just one more civilian or enemy hiding somewhere. Thus, you’re forced to slowly backtrack through the map to find them – a repetitive task that immediately strips away all tension and often brings the silly co-op fun to a screeching halt. Until one of you rounds the corner and yelps in surprise while firing wildly.</p>
<p>These are minor flaws, though, in what is otherwise an incredibly addictive and punishing co-op thrill ride. Ready or Not is an absolute blast, and the huge variety of levels and equipment provide a feast of equally intense and hilarious co-op possibilities for you and your friends.</p>
