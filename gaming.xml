<p>THQ Nordic and Tarsier Studios <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2129530/view/613180506112000708">have announced</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a> will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>13th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The highly-anticipated spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-enhanced-edition">Little Nightmares</a> (which was also handled by Tarsier Studios before handing the reins over to Supermassive Games for the third entry) will also gain a free demo in the coming weeks, just in case you want to try it out yourself before opting for the full game.</p>
<p>A $59.99 Digital Deluxe Edition will be available on launch, and this will include the base game, Season Pass, and the exclusive Foxhead and Muttonhead masks. Tarsier has also stressed that while this is primarily a co-op experience, solo players can also experience the game, with an AI taking on the role of your companion.</p>
<p>It looks awesome, and we genuinely can't wait to dive in. For now, let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Horror With Hope</strong> – In this unsettling tale, the emphasis is on tension and thick atmosphere, as you join the two orphans on a desperate search for hope and redemption in the direst of circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>- Across a Dark and Twisted World</strong> – Traverse an intriguing but terrifying world, where the main path is only one part of the fragmented story. Discover all sorts of mysterious locations on your perilous journey, each with its own story to tell.</p>
<p><strong>- A Dread-Filled Adventure</strong> – Tarsier Studios is bringing their unique visual style to bear on a whole host of new twisted monsters and broken, yet resilient, child characters. Fragments of the children’s troubled past have been used as inspiration for their character design, and for the monsters that now torment them.</p>
<p><strong>- Share the Scare</strong> – Nobody should be forced to go through hell alone! Fully playable in single player and local and online cooperative play, <em>REANIMAL</em> has a shared, directed camera, designed to maximize claustrophobia and tension.</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! Welcome to the coolest show in town, <em>Kotaku’s</em> Morning Checkpoint. This is our daily roundup of video game news and other interesting stuff you might care about. Squeeze in, find a seat, and get ready to be blown away by this morning’s showcase, which includes bad news for fans of <em>The Finals</em> on PS4, more layoffs, Sakurai wanting to live a chill life, and more.</p> <h2>Some games that sold a single physical copy in October</h2> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m632god4cc25">According to data from Circana’s Matt Piscatella</a>, some odd, old games sold exactly one new physical copy in the United States during October. If you were the person out there who bought a physical copy of <em>Spore</em> in October, email me a photo of the receipt. I want to talk to you about your life. I hope things turn around for you. And if you are the person who bought <em>Incredibles 2: Rise of the Underminer</em> on GBA last month, you are a wild individual, and I respect it. Here’s the full list:</p>

 <ul> <li>360- <em>Burnout Paradise</em></li> <li>3DS-<em> Carnival Games: Wild West 3D</em></li> <li>GBA-<em> Incredibles 2: Rise of the Underminer</em></li> <li>NDS- <em>Imagine Fashion Stylist</em></li> <li>PC- <em>Spore</em></li> <li>PS2-<em> Backyard Baseball</em></li> <li>PS3- <em>Hasbro Family Game Night 3</em></li> <li>PS4- <em>Cooking Mama Cookstar</em></li> <li>XBX- <em>Ultra Bust A Move</em></li> </ul> <h2>Avalanche Liverpool closes, 31 devs laid off</h2> <p>In September, Avalanche Liverpool, the studio behind the <a href="https://kotaku.com/just-cause-makers-xbox-exclusive-contraband-canceled-amid-recent-cuts-2000616371">canceled Xbox game <em>Contraband</em></a>, announced it would be shutting down. And now that has happened. On November 19, <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool">the studio announced via its official website</a> that it had completely closed its doors and 31 developers had been laid off as a result.</p>

 <p>“The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project. We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios&nbsp;Group. Our focus remains on supporting the Avalanchers through the transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities.”</p>

 <h2>Leave <em>Smash Bros.</em> creator Masahiro Sakurai alone</h2> <p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/18/159625.html"><u>Game*Spark,</u></a> <em>Smash Bros.</em> and Kirby creator Masahiro Sakurai talked about how he doesn’t consider his life all that interesting and wishes people would just focus on the games and not who made them. So he was surprised that people wanted to turn his story into a manga.</p>

 <p>“I think I’ve always wanted to live an unassuming life,” Sakurai told the outlet, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-smash-bros-and-kirby-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-its-best-to-just-play-games-instead-of-looking-at-who-made-them-so-please-dont-perceive-him/">as translated by <em>Gamesradar.</em></a> “Even with [being contacted about creating the manga], I’m sure my response was something like ‘really?'”</p>

 <p>“I try my best to communicate my work to others, but I refrain from trying to promote myself. I think I’ve always wanted to live an unassuming life. I think it’s best if people just play games, instead of looking at who made them.”</p>

 <h2><em>The Finals</em> on PS4 will be shut down next year</h2> <p>Before Embark Studios released the massively popular <em>Arc Raiders</em> last month, the company published the destructive shooter <em>The Finals</em> across consoles and PC. It wasn’t as big of a hit, but it’s still kicking and getting updates. But not for much longer on PlayStation 4, <a href="https://x.com/reachthefinals/status/1990810282529046592?t=swsOGicwN1vsbqWO-_CZjg&amp;s=19">as confirmed by the studio earlier this week</a>.</p> <p>“When Season 10 begins (18th of March, 2026), we’ll be retiring <em>The Finals</em> on PlayStation 4 and focusing our support on current generation hardware,” posted Embark Studios. “From that point on, you’ll need to play there to keep enjoying the game. Your progress and purchases will be stored in your Embark ID and will transfer to anywhere you choose to play. We’re incredibly grateful to everyone who’s been part of the PS4 community.”</p> <h2>Huh, Panic Button handled some Switch 2 port upgrades for Nintendo</h2> <p>Remember how, when the Switch 2 launched, some popular OG Switch games published by Nintendo, like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, got upgrades to look and play a bit better on the new machine? Well, turns out that Switch port experts Panic Button were contracted by Nintendo to handle those upgrades.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Panic Button was honored to be selected by Nintendo to help update marquee games from the Nintendo Switch™ library.  Nintendo asked us to help demonstrate new capabilities of the Nintendo Switch 2 system, while remaining faithful to the original games. <a href="https://t.co/5P96V9DFUq">pic.twitter.com/5P96V9DFUq</a></p> <p>— Panic Button (Official) (@PanicButtonGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/PanicButtonGame/status/1991264499676930507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I find this very interesting, as it seems like something Nintendo could have done internally. But instead, they trusted the folks at Panic to handle the upgrades. I bet Panic is feeling very good about that right now, and it will likely help the studio get even more work porting games to the new Switch 2.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514"><em>Deadpool VR</em> is perfect…for fans of Deadpool</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/beast-land-mrbeast-theme-park-saudi-arabia-2000645495">MrBeast’s new “theme park” looks…uh…not great</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-reviews-nintendo-switch-2-2000645412">Critics seem to mostly like <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="158" data-end="922">For PlayStation 5 owners who regularly find themselves bumping up against the console’s limited storage, keep reading. In the lead-up to Black Friday, Crucial has cut the price of one of its PS5-compatible SSDs, making it easier and more affordable to expand your game library.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5752/"> The 2TB Crucial P510 Gen5 NVMe SSD normally priced around $210 has been discounted by 29%, bringing the cost down to $150.</a> That’s a meaningful $60 reduction on a high-performance SSD equipped with its own heatsink for seamless compatibility right out of the box.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5752/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="158" data-end="922">PS5 &amp; PC Compatible</h2>
<p data-start="924" data-end="1686">One of the most common frustrations among early PS5 adopters is the reality of the console’s internal storage limitations. Even though Sony technically lists the system as having an 825GB SSD, the usable space is significantly smaller. After accounting for system files and required software, players are left with roughly 667GB for game installs—a number that feels increasingly cramped as modern titles frequently climb past 100GB each. For anyone with a growing collection, or for those who enjoy bouncing between several big releases at once, that space disappears almost immediately. Installing Crucial’s 2TB expansion effectively triples the amount of room you have to work with, reducing the need to delete old favorites just to make space for new ones.</p>
<p data-start="1688" data-end="2423">Beyond the raw storage boost, the drive is built to meet the PS5’s demanding performance standards. With read and write speeds up of to 11,000 MB/s, the Crucial P510 far exceeds what’s needed to keep pace with Sony’s ultra-fast architecture. The included heatsink, which is required for PS5 internal installation, helps maintain stable temperatures and prevent thermal throttling during extended gaming sessions.</p>


<p data-start="2425" data-end="3119">If you’re planning to install the Crucial P510 SSD into a PC gaming desktop, you’ll be able to make the most of its insanely fast read and write speeds. Just make sure your motherboard supports Gen5 NVMe SSDs. A Gen4 slot will still work with it, just won’t be able to reach the maximum speeds supported by the P510. With optimal conditions, you’ll be able to experience lightning fast load times in your games as well as when working with high-intensive applications such as when video or photo editing. Plus with a full 2TB, you’ll have plenty of room for not just your games, but any important pictures or vids you want to hang onto.</p>
<p data-start="3121" data-end="3308" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With its generous performance, significant storage increase, and a timely discount, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5752/">Seagate’s 2TB Game Drive stands out as one of the most practical PS5 upgrades you can grab this season.</a></p>

              <p><i><span>Kirby Air Riders </span></i><span>is out today, and it sounds like the chaotic kart racer is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-reviews-nintendo-switch-2-2000645412"><span>exactly what fans of the GameCube original wanted</span></a><span> (and like it’s probably not for anyone else). One of the ways the Switch 2 game embraces disorder is in its vehicle customization, which lets you paint your hoverboard to look like pretty much whatever you want. Some players are using this feature to make cool karts to race around in, and others are seeing what monstrosities they can put on the market for other players to use.</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo has held </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><span>multiple feature-length Direct showcases</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span>, so we’ve already known about its vehicle customization for a while. I wouldn’t be surprised if fans were planning some of their vehicular shitposts for some time and just needed the game in their Switch 2s to finally bring them to life. But the reason that people can make vehicles that look like Chef Kawasaki in a bikini from a </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chef-kawasakis-cursed-micro-bikini-look-from-banned-kirby-fangame-gets-revival-in-air-riders-custom-machine-market/"><span>banned fan game</span></a><span> (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/kirby/masahiro-sakurai-maybe-gave-kirby-air-riders-players-too-much-power-as-there-already-multiple-scantily-clad-versions-of-chef-kawasaki-flooding-the-vehicle-market/"><i><span>GamesRadar+</span></i></a><span>) is that the toolset is so good. So for every joke, you’ll find a custom kart that actually looks pretty incredible. Y’all haven’t even had the game for a day, and you’re already killing it.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">なんでもうコックカワサキマイクロビキニ部が二種類もあるんだよ <a href="https://t.co/KOxhFDLGMY">https://t.co/KOxhFDLGMY</a> <a href="https://t.co/GTSit5kUuT">pic.twitter.com/GTSit5kUuT</a></p> <p>— じごくのランチタイム (@lunchtime39439) <a href="https://twitter.com/lunchtime39439/status/1991282714637660553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">カイオーガつくれるじゃねぇか<br> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AC%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#オレマシン</a> <a href="https://t.co/3IO1yNOOXn">pic.twitter.com/3IO1yNOOXn</a></p> <p>— まʓくʓ (@marukurururu) <a href="https://twitter.com/marukurururu/status/1991228290716098822?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">オレマシン市場、もう既に闇市場になっててカオス<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%93%E3%82%A3%E3%81%AE%E3%82%A8%E3%82%A2%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#カービィのエアライダー</a> <a href="https://t.co/I3Sz115tPN">pic.twitter.com/I3Sz115tPN</a></p> <p>— ロジー&amp;マリオファンの集い (@7Roggie) <a href="https://twitter.com/7Roggie/status/1991313062759117150?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>        <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">流石エアライダー<br>色んな企業さんが参戦してるんだねー <a href="https://t.co/27vdhK9cqT">pic.twitter.com/27vdhK9cqT</a></p> <p>— あぽろ (@_aporoG) <a href="https://twitter.com/_aporoG/status/1991213110888403216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">とりあえず作ってみたフォーミュララティアス<br>オレマシンだけでもめっちゃ楽しい！！<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%A8%E3%82%A2%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#エアライダー</a> <a href="https://t.co/M219v7ChP1">pic.twitter.com/M219v7ChP1</a></p> <p>— おれお (@Atge799wE3PeveQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/Atge799wE3PeveQ/status/1991256890115002714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">カビカフェのオムライス🍽️<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%A8%E3%82%A2%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#エアライダー</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AC%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#オレマシン</a> <a href="https://t.co/lBRhUp1DTk">pic.twitter.com/lBRhUp1DTk</a></p> <p>— ミロルク (@zelro_ruda) <a href="https://twitter.com/zelro_ruda/status/1991471280407867605?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">プププランド住人の魂を生贄に、<br>降臨せよ！《地縛神 Ccapac Apu》！！ <a href="https://t.co/CjWJK9woMh">pic.twitter.com/CjWJK9woMh</a></p> <p>— えろす♈️ (@EROS_Last_JK) <a href="https://twitter.com/EROS_Last_JK/status/1991200757920723264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%A8%E3%82%A2%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#エアライダー</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AC%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#オレマシン</a> <a href="https://t.co/nsInIQKxMA">pic.twitter.com/nsInIQKxMA</a></p> <p>— くらげ (@oba08kekeke) <a href="https://twitter.com/oba08kekeke/status/1991242399117357249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>My favorites so far are the GameCube kart and the ship shaped like Latias from </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, but I’m sure we’ll see some even crazier designs by day’s end.

<p>The first gameplay trailer for Hellraiser: Revival has dropped, and it’s absolutely not for the faint of heart. If you thought the debut trailer was wince-worthy, this is just as nasty and as vile as you’d expect. It’s heaven, in hell.</p>



<p>A pleasant (also unpleasant) surprise dropped in July 2025 with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellraiser-revival-trailer-revealed-saber-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellraiser: Revival Trailer, revealed by Saber Interactive</a>. It marks the first time the horror title has ever had its own standalone game, and the first gameplay trailer shows that you should expect every bit of the nastiness of the movies rolled into one.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on Gamescom preview</a> tells you everything you need to know about Hellraiser: Revival.</p>



<p>An “hour-long theater of violence and sadism” was one of many lines we used. Now, you can see the evidence for yourself through the first Hellraiser: Revival gameplay trailer. It has everything a Hellraiser fan is looking for: Nudity, graphic violence, and a sprinkling of Pinhead.</p>



<p>There’s also a lot of visceral combat, a look into the game’s brand-new story, and you also get a look at the game’s insistence on going the extra length with platforming and puzzling.</p>



<p>You can check out the footage for yourself, if you dare. All jokes aside, <strong>viewer discretion is advised</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An insider has stated that Resident Evil Requiem is definitely getting at least one DLC, which is currently in development. </p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem doesn’t arrive until next year, and as we wait for the game’s launch, the only things getting us by are leaks. We recently saw the producer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-makes-interesting-comment-on-leon-kennedy-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">address rumours</a> about the photo of Leon Kennedy with an eye patch that surfaced online. Now, an insider has revealed some details about the DLC. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-dlc-might-star-alyssa">Resident Evil Requiem DLC Might Star Alyssa</h2>



<p>The details about the Resident Evil Requiem DLC come from Dusk Golem (Aesthetic Gamer), known for RE leaks. Their latest post on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1991047135551500624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) states, “There’s definitely at least one DLC for Resident Evil Requiem in development right now. I’ve heard about it a few times, believe it stars Alyssa.” The leaker had previously stated that Alyssa Ashcroft is also the giant monster following Grace in the trailer, and will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-have-3-playable-characters-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable for a bit</a> in the game. </p>



<p>Dusk Golem was also asked on the same day whether Leon Kennedy is being considered the main character or a side character in the upcoming title. Golem <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1991130594076696831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied</a> that they don’t have a blueprint for the game to give that answer, but they do know that Leon has “some very large levels, the biggest in the series to date”. Players should take both details with a grain of salt, as it does not come from an official source. </p>







<p>In other news, Capcom expects Resident Evil Requiem to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-expected-to-sell-better-than-re-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell better</a> than Resident Evil Village. Additionally, the developers recently revealed why they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-reveals-why-multiplayer-was-ditched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ditched the multiplayer aspect</a> of the title. What are your thoughts on the new claims about Resident Evil Requiem definitely having at least one DLC in development?

In a desperate act, she descends into the spirit world to fight for a second chance.</p><p>Minimalist in presentation but unafraid of raw, harrowing themes, <em>Death Howl</em> unfolds as a metaphorical journey through sorrow, <a title="Genres > Survival [483 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> and acceptance. It’s a hunt where every step forward carries a cost—and every enemy demands a study worthy of a huntress.</p><p>True to soulslike tropes, defeat is not the end, but part of the learning path. Resting revives fallen foes, and understanding enemy behavior is crucial to progress. <em>Death Howl</em> enhances this structure with tactical, grid-based combat, deck-building systems, and action-RPG exploration across eerie, hostile biomes.</p><p>Each region introduces not just new enemies and active and passive abilities, but also new cards that offer deck-tailoring possibilities, allowing players to shape their tactical approach as they progress. Every fallen spirit adds to Ro’s strength in this quiet war of grief and resolve.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Instead of having to pay gold to transmog individual gear pieces, players would instead transmog gear slots. That slot would then retain its appearance regardless of whatever item was equipped, useful as players level up and equip new gear over the course of an expansion or season.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmG98apVwKw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WmG98apVwKw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Sounds good on paper.

That means that unless a player changes their full set of gear five times, the current system is actually cheaper.</p><p dir="ltr">Transmog costs actually scale with level as well, so players will want to save their transmogs at lower levels to save on gold costs. It should be noted that players can save an appearance set for free just as they currently do, but actually equipping that set is where the gold costs comes in.</p><p dir="ltr">Outfit slots, a new feature in Midnight, also cost money. These are essentially saved transmog sets where players can go ahead and pay the transmog fee and then save that outfit for later use without having to pay the gold cost again. While players will be given two slots for free, additional slots (up to 20) cost increasingly more gold. The first few are hardly noticeable, with slot three costing 100 gold, slot four costing 500, and slot 5 costing 1,000. From there the gold costs begin to increase rapidly, with the last three slots costing 100,000 gold each.</p><p dir="ltr">Adding to the costs is the fact that outfits slots aren't account-wide and are instead on a per-character basis. For players who want multiple outfits on multiple characters, the gold costs begin to add up rather quickly, potentially costing millions of gold for those who want all 20 slots on multiple characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Outfit slots are mostly for players who want to be able to jump between transmog outfits frequently, and will work with the game's new "Situations" system. In this new system, players can change between their saved outfits automatically depending on the circumstances, and have a different appearance based on specific activities, like a cozy outfit when they are at their house or a different one when out in the open world or doing dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who change outfits often, the new system does technically save players gold. But for others who use transmog more casually, it could actually be more expensive. It's also a far more confusing system--one where players will now need to weigh the costs of buying new outfit slots and saving transmog sets versus overriding an existing set in an effort to save gold.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that all these prices are on the Midnight beta and will likely change before the expansion launches early next year, especially given the negative reception from players. But considering this feature was pitched as saving fashion-forward players money, as opposed to costing more, this feels like Blizzard took an easy win and instead turned it into a loss.</p><p dir="ltr">In other WoW news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-finally-arrives-december-2-after-decades-of-waiting/1100-6536160/" data-ref-id="1100-6536160">early access to the game's housing system</a> will arrive on December 2. Blizzard recently found itself in another controversy when it revealed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-new-premium-currency-is-player-friendly-and-more-efficient-blizzard-says/1100-6536042/" data-ref-id="1100-6536042">premium currency</a> that will be used just for housing items on WoW's in-game shop, despite other items like mounts and transmog sets having always been sold for real currency.</p>

Moreover, 77.5 percent of the grand total were smaller studios with fewer than five employees.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's worth noting that foreign-run companies, which the report says tend to be relatively larger businesses with 20 or more employees, generated more revenue than Canadian companies in 2022—$4 billion versus $3 billion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Two other notable metrics include that one in four employees in the Canadian game industry are women.

As per the report, entry rates for video game companies in Canada were higher from 2014 to 2018 but lower from 2019 to 2021, which is relative to all private employer firms. Then, from 2014 to 2021, exit rates for video game firms were much lower than those for all other private employer firms.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The conclusion by Statistics Canada is that studio closures in the Canadian video games industry are "relatively rare."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sadly, as we've seen in recent years, that metric appears to be changing.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="984f7facfc1a1"><a title="Pokémon Forest" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/984f7facfc1a1/pokemon-forest.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you may already be aware, <strong>PokéPark Kanto</strong> is officially opening to the public on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>. The Pokémon-branded theme park will be a permanent fixture in Yomiuriland in Tokyo's Tama Hills, and will be divided into two core areas: Pokémon Forest and Sedge Town.</p>
<p>The thing is, if you have limited mobility, then you might not be allowed into the Pokémon Forest area at all. Yes, as covered by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/can-you-walk-up-110-steps-without-help-the-pokmon-theme-park-in-japan-has-some-strict-safety-rules-that-could-exclude-many-visitors">IGN</a>, the <a href="https://www.pokepark-kanto.co.jp/ppark/ticketInfo/type/index">official PokéPark website</a> states that those "unable to climb 110 steps without assistance" will not be allowed to enter. In addition, the Japanese site states that those who require the use of a wheelchair will also be restricted. Understandably, the site clarifies that this is "to ensure visitor safety".</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22ftjskwx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Of course, it's not entirely surprising given the nature of the attraction. The Pokémon Forest is described as a 500m long nature trail featuring steep hills, tunnels, and stairs, and the site even says that visitors should expect "grassy areas and uneven paths". Children under 5 will also not be allowed to take part, even if accompanied by an older guest. Inclement weather may also lead to the suspension of the attraction altogether.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals for which any of the following applies cannot enter:</p>
<p>Those under the influence of alcohol, with heart conditions, who are pregnant, with high or low blood pressure, who are feeling unwell, who are unable to climb 110 steps without assistance, and those with conditions or symptoms that may worsen by using the park.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sedge Town, meanwhile, will offer up a whole bunch of additional attractions, including rides, stores, and Sedge Gym, where attendees can watch Pokémon stage shows. You'll also have a chance to connect with other 'Pokémon Trainers' at the Primarina Fountain.</p>
<p>So it sounds like there's at something for everyone at PokéPark Kanto, even if you won't be able to access the Pokémon Forest. Tickets will be available for Japanese residents from 21st November and issued via a lottery system.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Quest</em> has been having a renaissance with the recent releases of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-all-that-glitters-are-pixels" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></a>. These remakes garnered high praise among the masses for revitalizing three iconic classics for the modern era, and make no mistake—Square Enix has every intention of continuing to deliver amazing, creative remakes of timeless classics with the upcoming release of <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>. This game is sure to stun audiences with its beautiful hand-crafted 3D art style, modern gameplay features, and heartwarming story.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is based on the original PlayStation title released in 2000 in Japan, then remade for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013, and focuses on the adventures of a group of childhood friends who leave their home of Estard Island to embark on a high-stakes adventure across the seas and through time itself to battle against unknown, evil forces and discover the mysteries of their world.</p>

<p>My one-hour hands-on experience with <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>&nbsp;showed off a delightful game full of charm and mystique while also embodying the same fun, lighthearted spirit that made the original <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> such a well-revered title among fans of the franchise.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_01.jpg?itok=HhIbPh8P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_01.jpg?itok=jgVGCfKW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I started my time in the demo in Wetlock, a small town playing host to a traveling musician named Old Man Riffer. When I entered the village, Old Man Riffer was entertaining the villagers with his torban before quickly trying to leave despite the villagers' protests. At night, while staying in the inn, a haunting melody began to play, opening portals that spirit away the villagers into the unknown, prompting the party to investigate the strange disappearances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When traversing the continent in search of answers, I found myself stumbling across Spliton-on-Sea, an abandoned fishing village that exhibited signs of being plagued by the same mystery as Wetlock. While exploring the map and interacting with important locations, the playable characters would trigger opportunities to talk to certain characters to get their thoughts on current events and helpful hints on where to go next.</p>

<p>Eventually, I found my way to Highendreigh Tower and began uncovering the truth behind the disappearances in Wetlock and Spliton-on-Sea, which led to the sudden appearance of Gracos the Demon King, who submerged the entire small island continent in water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’ve ever played a <em>Dragon Quest</em> game before or if you’re new to the franchise, the mechanics are easy to catch on to. Players get four basic commands: Attack, which launches a basic attack with your equipped weapon; Skills, which allows players to chose from a variety of abilities and spells that can be used by each character based on their growth and class; Items that can be used to to heal and buff players or attack and debuff enemies; and Defend to reduce damage from incoming enemy attacks.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_13.jpg?itok=vhTcCOro 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_13.jpg?itok=YR950owq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Let Loose ability has also been added to <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, which activates after a character has been worked up during combat to allow them to unleash a powerful attack or skill.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> also introduces the brand-new feature called Moonlighting, where the player can assign an additional class to each playable character to gain special abilities and skills to the playable characters. These additional classes can be changed at-will while playing without having to go anywhere special, like a church, inn, or checkpoint to change that additional vocation, and I found it really fun to be able to switch them whenever to create different strategic combinations before heading into battle.</p>

<p>One of my favorite characters to utilize was Aishe, who had Destiny’s Dancer as one of her vocations, giving her access to M-Pathy, a powerful healing spell.</p>

<p>I also had her as a Troubadour, which allowed her to cast Divine Intervention to prevent the party from experiencing instant death from an attack. This combination made her a powerhouse healer while still being effective at offensive attacks with her sword. Ruff, Maribel, and the protagonist also had their own combination of unique spells and abilities in the demo, and being able to mix and match to address any combat situation helped to keep the game refreshing and engaging.</p>

<p>The second location available in the demo was Emberdale at an earlier part of the game, which allowed me the chance to play as Kiefer, the Prince of Estard, alongside Maribel and the protagonist. When the party arrived in Emberdale, the town had been experiencing strange tremors from the volcano near their town, so they started preparations for the Flaming Festival to give fire back to the volcano as a tribute in hopes of stopping it from erupting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_11.jpg?itok=kLZZdfU6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_11.jpg?itok=Fl2uWDb2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Meanwhile, Palmela, the town clairvoyant, had been trying to prevent the townspeople from doing that because she was certain the volcano would erupt because of it. At night, the townsfolk go to the volcano and begin feeding it their flames, but it slowly awakens the Glowering Inferno, a fire-based monster that had been living inside the volcano with plans to destroy the continent Emberdale sits on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The battle against the Glowering Inferno felt tense due to the limited abilities the party had access to in this demo, but it may also have to do with the fact that I sped down to the bottom of the volcano without fighting many enemies along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the difficulties of the battle, various vocational abilities aided in making the battle easier to progress through. The protagonist had the Fledgling Fisherman vocation, which allowed him to use Ocean’s Devotion, an ability that made it so each ally would neutralize the next attack that targeted them.</p>

<p>Maribel, as a Mini Mayoress, could use Shewrd Operator, which allowed her to see through enemy resistances to make elemental attacks more effective. Keifer with the Heir Apparent vocation would cast Royal Flush, which reduced his defense stats while significantly increasing his attack power and critical hit chances.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_emberdale_09.jpg?itok=w9zZYwh- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_emberdale_09.jpg?itok=RRMBwXn7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As I played through both demos, I couldn’t help but focus on the standout aspect of <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>: the graphics. The beautiful diorama-esque style makes it feel like the player is looking down on a miniature world while moving around living-breathing maquettes rather than just simple 3D models.</p>

<p>It makes sense given Square Enix scanned in hand-crafted, super-detailed dolls of all of the main playable characters to give the game its unique, distinct art style, differentiating it from other Dragon Quest games while still embodying the charm of the character designs illustrated by the late Akira Toriyama.</p>

<p>As I finished my time with <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, I couldn’t help but wish I could have played even more because of how much fun I was having. There were also plenty of hidden mysteries within the demo that I wished I had the chance to find and experience, but that just means I have plenty to look forward to when the game comes out next year, and fans of the franchise or newcomers looking for a new turn-based RPG will also have plenty to enjoy and explore, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Make it through the darkness—or become a part of it.</p><p><em>Brightfall</em> is a cooperative open-world survival roguelite for up to four players, set on a cursed 17th-century island erased from English maps. Build, craft, and push back the living darkness before it swallows the world.</p><p><strong>Welcome to the Isle the Crown Pretends Doesn’t <a title="Companies > Exis [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/exis">Exis</a>t</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The year is 1666. The Great Plague of London has just ended… But it seems your troubles are only just beginning. You awaken shipwrecked on Brightfall Island, a place so cursed that even the Royal Navy has orders to pretend it doesn’t exist.</p><p>They say every plague in history began here—the Black Death, the Justinian blight, and now, the darkness reborn.<br>Fog hides it from the world, storms guard its shores… and yet the Crown thinks it’s a perfect place to put its prisoners.</p><p>One of them was you.</p><p>Now you’ll have to scavenge, build, and fight to keep your light burning a little longer—because when it dies, your sanity follows. Explore abandoned Celtic ruins, upgrade your character, and craft stronger light sources to push deeper into the evershifting gloom.</p><p>But beware—light fades, monsters grow stronger, and even your friends can fall to the madness.</p><p><strong>Beware the Living Darkness</strong></p><p>Branches twist. Birdsong fades. Trees grow wild and unfamiliar. You have stepped into the darkness—and it is watching you.</p><p>On Brightfall, darkness is not just the absence of light. It bends trees, warps stone, and unravels the world until nothing human remains.</p><p>But you are not powerless.</p><p>Every torch buys you a minute of sanity.</p><p>Use it wisely to carve a circle of sanity in the gloom, pushing corruption back one trembling step at a time. The deeper you dare to go, the stronger that light must become.</p><p>Let it fade, and the island will take you back.</p><p><strong>Hold the Light—Alone or Together</strong></p><p><a title="Genres > Survival [483 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a> in <em>Brightfall</em> is a shared struggle against time, dwindling supplies, and the creeping dark. One up to four survivors can brave the island together. Scavenge, craft, and defend the light while your friends argue about who forgot the tinder again.</p><p>Prefer to walk the path alone? The island won’t let you face it completely unaided. A flicker of ancient will—a Celtic spirit bound to the light—can guide your steps, mend your wounds, and whisper warnings when the dark closes in.</p><p>Be kind to your companions—living or spectral. You might need them to drag you out of the grave within the next hour. When one of you falls, the others can bring them back by burning a Resurrection Token—a spark of the same light that keeps the darkness at bay.</p><p>Lose them all, and the expedition ends. The map collapses, the cycle resets, and the island changes its shape once more.</p><p><strong>Venture into the Unknown</strong></p><p>Beyond the fragile glow of your base lies an island that refuses to stay still. Each failure reshapes its coasts and ruins—twisting paths, swallowing landmarks, and spitting them out somewhere new.</p><p>But not all is lost. Every corrupted biome you cleanse and every ancient beast you fell leaves behind a sanctuary, a small fortress of light that endures through the resets. These sanctuaries let you push deeper—into deserts scorched by false suns, frozen cliffs where even shadows freeze, and finally, the Heart of Darkness itself.</p><p>The more you reclaim, the harder the island fights back.</p><p><strong>Turn Fire and Iron Into Salvation</strong></p><p>You start with nothing but your bare hands and a flickering torch. Hunt for scraps, stitch together rags, and raise a shack against the storm. Then come iron tools. Then musket fire. Then sanctuaries so bright the darkness itself shrinks away.</p><p>Each expedition expands your reach: sawmills, quarries, mines, even automatons that harvest while you explore. As you gather resources and unlock blueprints, your base grows from a flickering campfire into a safe haven.</p><p>Not all heroes wield swords. Some build the light that lets the rest survive.</p><p><strong>Die. Learn. Repeat.</strong></p><p>Every expedition is only the beginning. <em>Brightfall</em> remembers what you’ve earned, but never lets you rest easy.</p><p>Knowledge wrested from the dark becomes new skills, unique blueprints, and insights. With each run, you forge stronger tools, unlock fresh abilities, and carve your own path through the gloom. You can choose from distinct roles and looks, customize your path and skills, then update them independently from the World’ state.</p><p>The world reshapes after every fall—but wisdom endures. And in <em>Brightfall</em>, wisdom burns brighter than fire.</p><p><strong>Survive the Dark, or Become Part of It</strong></p><p>Your sanity fades with the light.</p><p>Stray too far into the dark, and it will begin to whisper. At first, it’s just the wind. Then footsteps. Then your own voice, asking you to stay.</p><p>The longer you linger, the more it takes—your sight, your thoughts, your name. Until nothing human remains.</p><p>Those who stray too far become Shadows, mindless hunters drawn to the warmth of their former allies.</p><p>Only your team can bring you back—if they’re fast enough. Drag your friend toward the firelight… or run before the darkness wears their face.</p><p>One way or another, everyone answers the dark eventually.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Beware the Living Darkness</strong> – Light is your only weapon. Ignite lanterns, push back corruption, and carve circles of sanity in a world that twists with every flicker.</li><li><strong>Survive Together or Perish Alone</strong> – Brave the cursed island with 1-4 players. Scavenge, craft, and defend your shared flame while arguing over who forgot the tinder again.</li><li><strong>Venture into the Unknown</strong> – Each fall reshapes the island. <a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>nse corrupted biomes, conquer ancient bosses, and anchor new sanctuaries that endure between runs.</li><li><strong>Turn Fire and Iron Into Salvation</strong> – Your torchlight may fade, but your creations burn brighter with every expedition.</li><li><strong>Die, Learn, and Rise Again</strong> – Every failure feeds your knowledge. Unlock new blueprints, roles, and skills that persist across resets, growing stronger as the island grows crueler.</li><li><strong>Resist or Embrace the Madness</strong> – The longer you linger in the dark, the more it calls your name. Save your friends from the abyss, or join it and hunt them instead.</li></ul><p><strong>Everything Clear?</strong></p><p>Jolly good—now try not to die, lad.</p><p>Or better yet: join our Discord or the Steam discussions and tell us what you’d like to see on the island.</p><p><em>Brightfall</em> is a story we want to write with you—one mad idea at a time.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/co-op-open-world-survival-roguelite-game-brightfall-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

                <p>PokePark Kanto is a new, permanent Pokemon theme park opening in Japan next February. It is designed to make visitors feel like real Pokemon trainers as they explore a lively town area and a large forest inspired by the anime and video games. While many fans may be excited to catch 'em all, they may be surprised to learn that a major part of the park comes with strict entry rules.</p><p>The Pokemon Forest has many safety restrictions that limit who can enter. According to the park's <a href="https://www.pokepark-kanto.co.jp/ppark/ticketInfo/type/index#about-forest" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">English-language site</a>, visitors must be able to walk up 110 steps without help, as well as wheelchair users and children under five are not allowed in the Forest. People who are pregnant, have heart or blood pressure issues, have been drinking alcohol, or feel unwell on the day of their visit are also restricted from entering.</p><p>The park will be situated within Yomiuriland, Tokyo's largest theme park. PokePark Kanto is split into two main areas: the Pokemon Forest and Sedge Town. The Forest is a 500-meter nature trail filled with hills, tunnels, and stairs, where visitors can find statues of Pokemon in their natural habitats. Sedge Town offers shops, rides, and a gym where guests can watch <a href="https://www.pokepark-kanto.co.jp/ppark/event/4/detail/index" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">special Pokemon stage shows</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4607751-chrome-capture-2025-11-20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607751" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4607751-chrome-capture-2025-11-20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607751"></a><figcaption>Sedge Town illustration.

The Ace Trainer's Pass (14,000 yen) allows free entry to both areas and offers extra perks like priority lines, reserved show seats, meet-and-greets, and special merchandise. The lower-priced Trainer's Pass (7,900 yen) includes unlimited entry to Sedge Town and a timed slot for the Forest. The park also forbids certain items, including drones, suitcases, and selfie sticks. Like most theme parks, it also bans most outside food and drink, with exceptions for infants and those with dietary restrictions.</p><p>The Sedge Town area will become more accessible as the park plans to introduce a Town-only pass by Summer 2026 to "ensure everyone can safely and comfortably enjoy the park." This new option will be the park's cheapest ticket, priced at 4,700 yen for adults, 4,200 yen for seniors, and 2,800 yen for children and guests with disabilities.</p><p>Residents of Japan can enter a ticket lottery by registering on the official PokePark KANTO website starting at 6 PM (JST) on November 21, 2025, which requires site membership and SMS verification using a Japan-capable mobile phone. The lottery covers tickets for the period of February 5 to March 31, 2026, with registration open from November 21 to December 8. Winners will be notified in the latter third of each month, and payments must be completed between December 21 and December 31. No information is yet available for fans outside of Japan about being able to come to the park.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/20/interview-sohei-niikawa-on-etrange-overlord-and-life-after-the-board-room/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/interview-%E2%80%93-sohei-niikawa-on-etrange-overlord-and-life-after-the-board-room.1359457/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>For many people, the absolute pinnacle of a career is the seat at the top of the table, to be president or CEO of a big international company. What people seldom think of is what happens after you step down. For Sohei Niikawa, who was president of Nippon Ichi Software until three years ago, it’s a chance to start over. This do-over, as he calls it, is one step towards his vision for a happier world.</p>
<p>On a crisp November’s day, Niikawa sat down with me to discuss not only his first game as an indie developer, Etrange Overlord, but how he got here and, most importantly, what comes next.</p>
<p><iframe title="Etrange Overlord - Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, and Steam)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_tbshWzk10c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“So in Japan, we’re calling it a ‘Sushi Lane Musical Action Adventure’,” he tells me, after watching the trailer together. “For the West, we’re calling it a ‘Revolving Lane Musical Action RPG’.”</p>
<p>These sushi lanes carry various power-ups and special weapons to our heroine, Étrange von Rosenburg — a duke’s daughter who was wrongfully accused of treason, condemned to hell and sentenced to death. Waking up after her execution, she finds herself beset by demons. Unperturbed, she sets about conquering Hell so that she can live her best afterlife.</p>

<p>It’s a light-hearted dark comedy that fits perfectly with the franchise Niikawa is best known for: Disgaea.</p>
<div id="attachment_135137"><p id="caption-attachment-135137">Sohei Niikawa was producer and writer for most of the Disgaea series to date.</p></div>
<p>The Disgaea series is set across various Netherworlds, and sees antihero demons embark on humorous stories between rounds of tactical RPG action. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/06/disgaea-7-complete-review/">Disgaea 7 Complete</a>, which was released earlier this year, is the latest edition of this, and we gave it a whopping 9/10.</p>
<p>“The thing that I really like about Etrange Overlord,” Niikawa said, “is the main character. She has a very free spirit. There’s a lot of overlap between her and I, with me also having begun my own sort of second life after leaving my previous company.</p>
<p>“I’m working really hard in a lot of ways because I want her to be popular.”</p>
<div id="attachment_466125"><p id="caption-attachment-466125">Étrange von Rosenburg front and centre in Etrange Overlord</p></div>
<p>Niikawa-san continues, “This will be the first title that I’m releasing since I started working independently from NIS.” This do-over, as he calls it, also has him starting from scratch as he claims to be in a relatively weak position within the games industry right now. He is, after all, an indie developer releasing the first game he wrote under his new pen name, Roman Kitayama, and his new company, Super Niche.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>“I’m working really hard in a lot of ways because I want her to be popular.”</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, that hasn’t stopped him from adding an impressive roster of names to Etrange’s credits.</p>
<p>“In Japan there’s a famous developer called Gemdrops, and the president of this company happens to be the same age as me.” This president famously worked on Niikawa’s first game, Rhapsody: a Musical Adventure. “As soon as he knew that I had left the company, he reached out to me saying he would like to make a game, and so that’s how Estrange Overlord came about.</p>
<p>“This will be the first time we’re making games together in about 30 years! Essentially, Etrange Overload is kind of a mix of that Rhapsody title we first worked on together and Disgaea.”</p>
<p>And this isn’t the only pedigree going into Etrange. “The character designer for the game is actually Shinichirou Otsuka, who’s very famous for his work on the RE:Zero series,” Niikawa adds.</p>
<h2>Famous names</h2>
<p>The talk of famous names turned our conversation towards Roman Kitayama, the name Niikawa used to pen Etrange Overlord. I asked what this name meant and why he chose it.</p>
<p>“So of course, in Japanese, ‘Kitayama’ can mean a ‘Northern mountain’. And the first place where I built my home was a northern mountain.”</p>
<p>But these are not the kanji Niikawa picked for himself. And in true Japanese fashion, there’s some wordplay at hand. Instead of the obvious 北山, Niikawa chose 喜多山 for Kitayama.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>“That’s a really uncool name, dad…”</h5>
</blockquote>
<p>The Yama bit (mountain) is the same, as a nod towards his home. “But for ‘Kita’, I purposefully used the kanji for both ‘to enjoy’ or ‘to be excited about something’ as well as the kanji for ‘a lot’. So, it means ‘to have a lot of enjoyment’.”</p>
<p>The Roman bit is a bit more complicated. “In Japanese, the phrase romantic doesn’t refer to romantic comedies etc, but more of a classical, romanticised idea —&nbsp;that sense of dreams or the kinds of things that that interest us or excite us.</p>

<p>The problem, however, is that as cool as Niikawa thinks his new name is, the younger generation may disagree.</p>
<p>“My daughter tells me that’s a really uncool name, dad…”</p>
<h2>Current games</h2>
<p>In the spirit of our regular What We Played column, and because it’s interesting to know what games fuel game makers, I asked Niikawa to name the last game he played that really stuck with him.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that Niikawa is working so hard on writing novels and designing games that he can only play games in short bursts —&nbsp;”I really like games that are very replayable, and I only need to play them for 5–10 minutes, here and there.”</p>
<p>“Solitaire is the game I’m playing most right now! To be honest with you, I never played Solitaire until this year. I’m like ‘Wow, Solitaire is really fun!’ So I’m actually doing a little bit of experimenting on my own right now to see if maybe I can make a game that’s like Solitaire but with a little bit of me in it?”</p>
<h2>Starting over</h2>
<p>Returning to Niikawa’s career arc, the idea of a career do-over by starting his second life at the same time as Etrange is a beautiful way to look at things.</p>
<p>“I want to take both my failures and my successes from my time at NIS into my second life,” he explains. “I’m in a very interesting situation where it’s kind of like I’m playing a roguelite.</p>
<p>“I’ve jumped in, I’ve built up experience and then I got game over. Now I’m starting over from the beginning, but I get to utilise my experience to drive me forward.”</p>
<p>Those experiences are clear, both in terms of game design and running a company.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>“I’m starting over from the beginning, but I get to utilise my experience to drive me forward.”</h5>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of game design, the tone is the most obvious thing he is carrying through. The mix of dark underworld vibes with light-hearted tone and at-times slapstick writing is something of a signature for Niikawa.</p>
<p>“There’s a couple of reasons for that,” Niikawa explains, when I asked what draws him to the theme of lighthearted darkness. “One is that there’s not too many other people that tend to do that, but then the other part is just simply because I like it.”</p>

<p>Ultimately, Niikawa says, games are entertainment, and he wants his games to bring people joy. This, he says, drives how he builds his games. They have to be both kind to the user and easy to understand. The problem is that if they’re too difficult to get into, the player won’t get to the bit that makes the game interesting.</p>
<p>“What really gives you a good idea about whether you’re going in the right direction is when somebody sits down to play your game and gets a game over. Do they still want to continue playing despite that?”</p>
<p>“I think what becomes important there is how interesting the story is and how interesting the mechanics are, but also is there a sense of ‘If I just keep going or keep trying a little bit more you know can I get a little bit further?’</p>
<p>“So whenever I’m working on a game I tend to pay close attention to those first two hours of gameplay to see if it meets those requirements: is it kind of the player and is it easy to follow?”</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>It’s difficult to look forward all the time, especially with such an impressive past. We are, after all, we’re all human. And as creators, it’s easy to get caught up in past projects. Not so for Niikawa. When asked if there were aspects of past projects he would revisit, his answer was instant.</p>
<p>“I don’t really think about it that much, to be honest! I don’t focus on the past. I just think about what I’ve learned so far and I build on it to keep making things better.”</p>

<p>So, what does Niikawa think about his legacy, if he’s not one to look over his shoulder?</p>
<p>“For NIS, I feel like the company itself is my legacy. I genuinely think that had it not been for Rhapsody and Disgaea, it wouldn’t exist as the company it is now. I take great meaning from having worked at NIS America and helped to build that company.</p>
<p>“But moving forward with Super Niche, I want my legacy to be more focused around not just games necessarily but all kinds of forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>“I’m 52 years old. I don’t know if I’ll live to be 70 or 80, but honestly right up till the end I want to keep making new content.</p>
<p>“And that could be multiple things — not just games but light novels, manga and board games. There’s a lot of different things that I’d like to work on.”</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>“I’m 52 years old. I don’t know if I’ll live to be 70 or 80, but honestly right up till the end I want to keep making new content”</h5>
</blockquote>

<p>Niikawa’s love for entertaining people really shines through as he picked up a Super Famicon cartridge that had been repurposed as a business card holder.</p>
<p>“This is actually an Indie game that’s in development right now,” he tells me. “There’s a man named Yoshitsuna Kobayashi who worked with me on the very first Disgaea, and he’s the person putting this video game together.</p>
<p>“He’s actually already quit the games industry once, but I’ve always thought he is a genius game creator and if he were to disappear from the industry I think it would be a huge blow. So I’ve kind of invited him to sort of come home, as it were, and work with me on making games in the future.</p>
<p>“And I look at that as a very meaningful activity. My greatest desire is actually to fill the world with more and more interesting pieces of media, whether it’s my own works that I’m invested in doing or helping someone else put their work out to the world as a producer.</p>
<p>“Really, behind all of that is just the idea that the more positive things that we can put out into the world for people to enjoy, the better. If people can enjoy them, and if that helps the world become a more peaceful place, nothing could make me happier.”</p>

            <p>Show me your quacking war face. Well, show the swarm of rubber ducks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> devs Embark have seemingly unleashed upon your character's living quarters your quacking war face. Otherwise you'd better be careful where you put your feet, lest you upset them and loose avian anarchy on the world. Also, a gun which might have been your favourite for decimating squads of poor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shootery</a> fools with other loadouts has been nerfed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The fully upgraded Venator has been over-performing recently, capable of outgunning full squads using close range weapons," Embark admit in the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/duck-update-patch-notes-1-3-0">notes</a> for patch 1.3.0. "We’re re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact. This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter. The community also rightfully pointed out that the weight of the Venator was inconsistent with the weights of our other pistols, so we’ve corrected that as well."</p>
<p>Its upgraded fire rate's been dialled down from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%, while its weight's more than doubled from 2kg to five. Meanwhile, the Deadline mine's been made more valuable when buying or selling, less plentiful in the inventories of traders, and requires more components to craft. Staying in the resupply zone, launcher ammo can now be crafted without blueprints, power cells sell for less cash, and any explosive weapons you strap to your back have had their damage rejigged.</p>
<p>In terms of that last bit, Embark have "adjusted explosive damage to make it more consistent across the board, and we’ve re-balanced the damage of the Hullcracker to account for that change". So, you'll need to be more precise to keep on taking down the likes of larger drones quickly with the launcher, while smaller foes should still behave largely as they did before if you try to blow them up.</p><p>Beyond those, two things have been made less rare. First, Aphelion blueprints. Second, rubber ducks. "Your Raider Den has been ducked out," the devs either warn, threaten or just say depending on your view of small birds. There are also plenty of tweaks to maps, including on stopping people using barricades to cheekily clip through walls into locked rooms where they might find a safe, duckless refuge.</p>
<p>If you're still busy raiding the non-lost arcs, make sure to check out our guides for everything from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">best guns</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-eyes-in-the-sky-quest-walkthrough">doing stuff with tripods</a> so you aren't left running around like a headless rubber duck.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-goes-hard-on-apple-2025-ipads-now-going-for-less-than-no-name-budget-alternatives.1359433/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple launched the 11-inch iPad with an A16 chip back in March of this year, and now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">Amazon’s dropping the 128GB/Wi-Fi mode to a record low of $279 for Black Friday, down from its $349 retail price</a>. You won’t find this discount on Apple’s official website or in their retail stores because the company keeps tight pricing controls.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>iPhone Performance to Tablet Form</h2>
<p>The A16 Bionic chip delivers processing power that rivals many laptops and maintains the instant responsiveness that iPads are known for. The 6-core CPU splits tasks between performance and efficiency cores that balance speed and battery life based on workload demands. The 5-core GPU accelerates graphics rendering, gaming performance, and augmented reality applications. It allows the <strong>16-core Neural Engine to process 17 trillion operations per second</strong>&nbsp;and powers machine learning functions like Live Text, subject isolation in Photos, and real-time translation.</p>
<p>The <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display pushes 2360 by 1640 resolution with True Tone technology</strong> that adjusts color temperature based on ambient lighting. The display covers the P3 wide color gamut, reproducing vibrant colors that look accurate for photo editing and creative work. The IPS panel maintains excellent viewing angles, so colors and contrast stay consistent when viewing the screen from the side.</p>



<p>A 128GB storage configuration provides enough space for essential apps and working files without forcing you into constant cloud storage management. Modern apps and high-resolution photos consume storage fast, and 128GB is the minimum viable capacity required to enjoy comfortable use. You can store dozens of apps, thousands of photos, hours of offline video content, and still have room for documents and downloads.</p>
<p>With WiFi 6 connectivity, this <strong>iPad offers faster and wireless speeds and better performance</strong> in crowded network conditions than earlier WiFi standards. The increased efficiency reduces battery drain when using the internet for several hours continuously, while the low latency further enhances video calls and online gaming. WiFi 6 routers are slowly becoming commonplace in many homes and businesses, and this iPad fully leverages the new and improved technology.</p>
<p>The<strong> Touch ID built into the power button</strong> allows for secure authentication without the TrueDepth camera setup of Face ID. The fingerprint sensor instantly unlocks the iPad, authorizes purchases, and allows you to switch between user profiles with the touch of a finger. This method of authentication works in any environment with no light limitation and does not require you to position your face in front of the device. Finally, <strong>with all-day battery life, up to 10 hours of web surfing</strong> or video playback on a single charge covers full work days, long flights, or weekend road trips without needing a charger.</p>
<p>The<strong> iPad runs iPadOS</strong> with access to millions of tablet-optimized apps that take advantage of the larger screen compared to the apps on the iPhone. The operating system supports multitasking with <em>Split View</em> and <em>Slide Over</em> which let you run multiple apps at the same time. Support for the Apple Pencil allows for note-taking, digital art, and document annotation, though the stylus sells separately.</p>
<p>For $279, this iPad is cheaper than a lot of budget Android tablets that deliver far worse performance, worse displays and app ecosystems that pale in comparison.</p>
