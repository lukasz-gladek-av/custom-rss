            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fromsoftware-raises-base-salaries<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Armored Core 6&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware has announced it's raising employees' base salaries by around 12% starting from April next year, and there's good news for graduate workers as well.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/jp/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20241004_wageincrease" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release on its official Japanese website</a> (for which we're using machine translation, since the release is, as you'd probably expect, in Japanese), FromSoftware says the decision is driven by wanting to create "a stable income and rewarding work environment" for employees.</p>
<p>The studio says its 12% employee raise, which kicks in from April 2025, is part of creating "an environment where each employee can focus on content development", presumably rather than worrying about whether they'll be able to pay rent.</p>

<p>Since FromSoftware doesn't have offices outside Japan, this is, of course, just for those who work in Japan. Still, it's a good sign that FromSoftware is doing alright, which is more than can be said for a lot of studios right now, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Hidetaka Miyazaki's studio is far from the only Japanese company to raise salaries for its employees in recent months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Others include Konami, which raised its employees' base salaries <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-salary-increase">for the third year in a row back in April</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-salary-increases"><i>Resident Evil&nbsp;</i>studio Capcom</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atlus-salary-increase"><em>Persona&nbsp;</em>developer Atlus</a>, among others.</p>

<p>By and large, the Japanese contingent of the industry appears to be a little more stable than studios in the West are, although companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-profits-down">Square Enix</a>&nbsp;have found themselves in a little trouble this year as well.</p>
<p>As for what lies in FromSoftware's future, we're not sure yet. The company is likely still basking in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales">hugely successful launch</a> of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC, but I'm betting work on their next project is already well underway. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Pocket Pair’s action-adventure title, Palworld, has finally been released for PS5s in Japan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pocket Pair Shadow released its popular 2024 title for PS5 in 68 countries and regions last month, but Japan was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-ps5-version-delayed-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excluded</a>. Many players speculated that Nintendo’s lawsuit against the developers could have caused the delay. However, the official Palworld Japan account on X has <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_JP/status/1842113232779243881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced today</a> that the game is now available on PS5 nationwide.</p>



<p>In the same thread, the Palworld Japan account added that the developers will “continue to provide exciting and large-scale updates to the PS5 version so that everyone can enjoy the game even more”. They have also apologised for the delay in release and look forward to continued community support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, PS5 isn’t the only new platform that Pocket Pair is targeting. An announcement on October 2 revealed that Pocket Pair is partnering up with Krafton to bring Palworld to mobile. Check out Insider Gaming’s full report <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-mobile-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pocket Pair has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-lawsuit-reponse-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already responded to Nintendo’s lawsuit</a>, stating that it is “unaware” of the specific patents it has been accused of infringing.</p>

This snowy location was featured in GTA 5's prologue as two of the main characters, Michael and Trevor, ran into some serious problems during their attempt to rob a bank and get away clean. GTA Online players have previously only been able to get back there by using glitches and exploits.</p><p>While Rockstar hasn't yet shared the full details about GTA Online's zombie mode, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-zombies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> notes that data miners have "found evidence of a wave-based survival mode," which suggests that it will be a horde-style event. However, there's no word about whether the zombie action will be limited to North Yankton or if it will spill out into the larger areas of San Andreas and Los Santos. Additionally, Rockstar has announced <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/9kkk2k11148825/gta-members-are-treated-to-special-gifts-this-halloween-season" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of Halloween-related items</a> for GTA+ members, including the fearsome-looking HVY Nightshark SUV and demon biker gear. </p><p>With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-breakdown-easter-eggs-references-and-teases/2900-4973/" data-ref-id="2900-4973">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> on the horizon for a 2025 release, it seems likely that GTA Online as we know it may be due for a significant overhaul in the future. But Rockstar has successfully kept the world of this game fresh for a long time, and players aren't ready to let go of it just yet.</p>

            <p>Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii has asked people not to "arbitrarily extract parts of comments for the purpose of reinforcing the legitimacy of your own opinion" after he was accused of blaming Western ratings board for having to put more modest clothing on characters in Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake.</p>
<p>Initially, it was reported that Horii was irritated at the missive to make the outfits less revealing, allegedly saying in a TGS interview that he blamed America's "religious" and "narrow-minded" approach for the changes, adding: "Doing business with such a ridiculous country is really frustrating. Because of that, Japan also gets negatively influenced" (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/10/dragon-quest-vets-claim-comments-on-censorship-were-mistranslated">Time Extension</a>).</p>

<p>The changes received significant attention, not least because X/Twitter owner Elon Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1840620975248785486">shared</a> mistranslated information to his millions of followers with the misleading caption: "Japanese Game Developers are frustrated at the forced ridiculous UN driven Globalist agenda compliance they have to include in their game".</p>
<p>Since then, however, Horii and podcast host and former Shonen Jump Editor-in-Chief Kazuhiko Torishima have <a href="https://x.com/KosoKoso_hoso/status/1841681747786006615">confirmed</a> the comments were not only mistranslated, but taken out of context, too.</p>
<p>Saying the word "puritan" had been mistranslated as "sex education", the pair then said they were "very sorry" that their words had been used out of context "outside of [Japan]".</p> <div>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the TGS interview was swiftly deleted.</p>
<p>The HD-2D Remake of Dragon Quest 3 features updated character designs that formed the basis of the original discussion, not least of all the female Warrior character (pictured above) who now wears additional underclothes instead of just a bikini.</p>

		<p>I feel like a permanently exhausted person right now, but it’s almost certainly my own fault for doing silly sports alongside a crazy work schedule. Fortunately, the kind embrace of games has eased some of the aches and pains, and I’ve been spending a lot of time with Overwatch 2, Star Wars Outlaws, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/03/windblown-preview/">Windblown</a> and some more PC previews that I’ll tell you about next week.</p>

Other than that, he’s played The Last Of Us Part 1, saying “It’s shockingly good-looking!” He continued, “I’ve also played EverSpace 2 because I bought so I’m committed to it for better or worse, two Beat Saber songs on expert to cool down after Vendetta Forever, and a little Ghost of Tsushima.”</p>
<p>It’s been a week with more demos for&nbsp;<strong>Aran</strong>, as he played &nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/01/pairs-perils-preview-remember-to-play-your-cards-right/">Pairs and Perils</a>, a promising card-based dungeon crawler, and an RPG called <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/03/on-a-journey-preview-turn-based-train-trouble/">On A Journey</a>. He’s also been playing Final Fantasy XVI saying, “I’m having a good time with so will get the DLC for that too.”</p>


<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has mixed songs and games, telling me he’s played Cubase and Until Dawn. He said,”Honestly I had forgotten just how much fun it is!” which I’m assuming is about the game, and not Cubase.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been playing Metroid Dread, and apparently dreading it, “I’ve been shrieking in panic every time I need to run away from an E.M.M.I. I also finished up the Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown DLC for review, The Mask of Darkness. So all the Metroidvanias then!”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has continued his old-school Fallout foray this week, telling us, “Having hit max level on Fallout: New Vegas I figured it was time to stop exploring the Mojave Wasteland and wrap things up. While I wasn’t entirely satisfied with the ending I was given, the journey was one that converted me into a proper Fallout fan and now I’m genuinely considering either a playthrough of Fallout 4 or Fallout 76.</p>
<p>“I’ve also played a fair chunk of Parcel Corps which is the closest I’ve come to riding a bike this year. It’s a brilliant take on the Crazy Taxi arcade experience, swapping out yellow cabs for nimble bicycles capable of wall-riding and other neat tricks to navigate each of the game’s urban sandboxes. We’ll have more on that in our upcoming review.”</p>

<p><strong>Miguel</strong> has been playing Emio The Smiling Man, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, and a bunch of UFO 50! Meanwhile, Steve has been playing Funko Fusion, saying, “It is utterly soulless and disappointing but has occasional flashes of what could have been an entertaining game. Like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/26/funko-fusion-review/">Dom’s review</a> stated, I just don’t know who it’s aimed at. Fortunately my time with Spoopy Halloween games has been more enjoyable with demos of Becrowned and Among Ashes being highlights. I also checked out demos for Hades-like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate and heavily Crash Bandicoot inspired Nikoderiko: The Magical World, both of which were fun albeit derivative. Alongside those I have been replaying Silent Hill 2 via the impressive PC Enhanced Edition mod and waiting to get my hands on the remake.”</p>
<p>And finally, it’s been a real party at <strong>Tef’s</strong> house as he’s continued on with playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/01/super-mario-party-jamboree-pro-rules-preview/">Super Mario Party Jamboree.</a> Admittedly, mainly on his own against AI, because there’s a lot of boards and game to get through for our upcoming review, but he’s enjoying some of the new features.</p>
<p>That’s enough about us, what have you played?</p>

			<p>New Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition footage was shared online, providing a new look at the unofficial remaster currently in the works by Revolution Team.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIUMrB7yhm8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new footage</a>, which can be watched below, focuses on the Trojan Voodoo mission, highlighting the improvements made in the unofficial remake to visual effects, such as explosions. Needless to say, the project is looking better and better with each new showing and will likely end up being a much better way to enjoy the classic entry in the series than the disappointing official remaster.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition VS Original game | Visual effects comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SIUMrB7yhm8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The aforementioned Grand Theft Auto: Vice City official remaster was released on PC and consoles three years back as part of the Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy—The Definitive Edition, which was universally considered a failure due to the disappointing improvements and the many issues that plagued all the included games. Rockstar Games released a few patches that improved the situation, but the collection still stands as a disappointing release, as highlighted by Nathan in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition collects some truly groundbreaking games that still provide their share of nostalgic fun, but little has been done to make them shine here in 2021. Ultimately, a shoddy visual upgrade, choppy performance, and a lack of meaningful updates or extras may leave you questioning why you loved them in the first place. Perhaps this collection can be brought up to snuff with updates from Rockstar (or modders), but for now, its Wanted Level remains low.</em></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition has yet to receive a release window. You can learn more about the project by joining the development team's official <a href="https://t.me/revteam">Telegram channel.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-7-pc-specs-revealed-ahead-of-february-launch.1000527/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-pc-specs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Firaxis and 2K have announced the&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>PC specs ahead of the game's launch in February, giving you plenty of time to potentially upgrade your machine if it isn't up to scratch.</p>
<p><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>launches on February 11th across PC and consoles, but it's the PC release in which Firaxis and 2K <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471" rel="noopener" target="_blank">are interested in today</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three different spec presets have been outlined by the two studios: Minimum, Recommended, and Ultra. As you've probably guessed, you'll need flashier and flashier components the higher up the preset list you climb.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-pc-specs-army.jpg?itok=EAmmpOn- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-pc-specs-army.jpg?itok=DcZcTv5Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Civilization 7</em>'s PC spec requirements are pretty broad, but making it look nice will cost you.</figcaption></figure><p>Here are the three different PC spec requirements for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>. Bear in mind that for all three of these, you're going to need an SSD with at least 20GB of free space; an HDD won't cut it. You'll also need to have upgraded to DirectX 12.</p>
<h3>Minimum (1080p, 30fps, Low settings)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i3-10100 or AMD Ryzen 3 1200</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 or AMD Radeon RX 460 or Intel Arc A380</li>
<li>8GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended (1080p, 60fps, Medium settings)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600X</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600 or Intel Arc A750</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra (4K, 60fps, High settings)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-14700F or AMD Ryzen 9 5950X</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 or AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT</li>
<li>32GB RAM</li>
</ul><p>Naturally, you're also going to need Windows 10 or 11 installed on 64-bit architecture for these presets. 2K and Firaxis say&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>will also be released for Linux and SteamOS, but no specs for those platforms are available yet.</p>

<p><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is, as you might expect, the seventh main installment in the&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>series. It'll feature a diverse roster of leaders, overhauled strategic gameplay, and, perhaps most importantly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-2k-launcher-civ-6">no 2K Launcher on PC</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>when it launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003168" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-for-xbox-series-xs/9N23HJHSC6BL" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on February 11th.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-and-disney-want-to-make-%E2%80%98what-every-disney-fan-has-ever-wanted%E2%80%99.1000524/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In February, Disney and Epic Games announced that they were collaborating on a “persistent universe” that would feature characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, <em>Star Wars</em>, and more. Disney franchises have been featured in <em>Fortnite</em> for years, but this new universe promises to be something grander — and will be interoperable with <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>Disney and Epic didn’t share many details about how this would all work <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065281/disney-epic-games-investment-fortnite-metaverse">when it was announced</a>. But after talking to Epic executives during Unreal Fest in Seattle this week, I’ve learned a bit more about what to expect.</p><p>A lot of it comes down to connecting into Epic’s ecosystem. “Disney wants a persistent place where all things Disney can be there, but they want to be part of an ecosystem we’ve built,” Epic Games EVP Saxs Persson says in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>. “We see the power of ecosystems interoperating as being really the magic here. From a player perspective, you want to be able to flow between a <em>Fortnite</em> experience, a Disney experience, or any experience really.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Characters from </em>The Incredibles<em> joined </em>Fortnite<em> </em><a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1839818531971482028"><em>last week</em></a><em>.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Epic Games</cite></p></div><p>Persson says players will be able to come into the Disney universe “in the Disney front door or the <em>Fortnite</em> front door.” But they’ll connect on the backend to the same cosmetic “lockers” and social graph. “From a player perspective, it just feels seamless.” (What Persson is describing sounds somewhat like how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"><em>Lego Fortnite</em></a>, which is a survival crafting game, ties into <em>Fortnite </em>more broadly.)</p><p>For Disney, teaming up with Epic makes plenty of sense. Many players already own a bunch of outfits from Marvel and <em>Star Wars</em> in <em>Fortnite</em>, so if Disney went to the considerable trouble of building a <em>Fortnite</em> competitor, players might not want to move over if they’re already heavily invested in Epic’s ecosystem. Epic has already proved that it can be a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date">great caretaker</a> of Disney franchises in <em>Fortnite</em>, too. And then there’s the business side of things: Disney <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23659691/disney-metaverse-job-cuts-eliminated">eliminated its own metaverse division</a> last year, and as part of this new arrangement, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065281/disney-epic-games-investment-fortnite-metaverse">Disney invested $1.5 billion into Epic</a>. If Epic succeeds, then Disney will succeed as well.</p><p>But the partnership doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be able to run around the <em>Fortnite</em> battle royale island as Mickey Mouse with a gun. “Not every outfit will be able to do everything,” Persson says. “A [Lego] minifig doesn’t hold a gun. Brands should be able to enforce the brand guidelines to the degree that they’re comfortable with that brand being associated with particular ratings.”</p><p>Disney understands that different franchises are suitable to certain experiences, Persson says. “Some IPs are not teen IPs or mature IPs. They are E for everyone IPs.” That’s why you can already play as many Disney-owned characters wielding a gun in <em>Fortnite</em>. Most are from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221374/fortnite-marvel-absolute-doctor-doom">Marvel</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/20/23131464/obi-wan-kenobi-fortnite-epic"><em>Star Wars</em></a>, but as of last week, the list now includes <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1839818531971482028">Mr. and Mrs. Incredible</a>, and Disney villains Maleficent, Cruella de Vil, and Captain Hook are set to be <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-hAJLqRYEl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading">playable characters </a>soon, too.</p><p>Epic and Disney haven’t said exactly when their persistent universe might be available. But Persson is clearly very excited about it already. “It’s one of those partnerships that you can only wish for,” Persson says. “This is all of Disney, and this is all-in from both companies to make what every Disney fan has ever wanted.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>FromSoftware has announced a salary increase for its employees of "approximately" 11.8 percent. This increase will begin in April next year.</p>
<p>Along with this salary increase for employees, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> developer is also raising the starting salary for new graduates from ¥260k to ¥300k. That's an increase of 15 percent.</p>

<p>"We want to convey excitement and create value. I want to please," Fromsoftware wrote in a press release on the salary increase (Google translated).</p>
<p>"That's what we are working on when making games. To that end, we believe that it is essential to have an environment where each and every employee can concentrate on content development, and we are working to create an environment where employees can stabilise their income and feel rewarded to work.</p>
<p>"The recent increase in basic salary and starting salary is one of these measures."</p>
<p>The company will "continue to work on game development" which will give its community "even more excitement and valuable games" in the future, the statement closed.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, FromSoftware released its Elden Ring expansion <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> to great acclaim. On its debut, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-hits-5m-sales">reached 5m sales worldwide</a> in just three days of release. Meanwhile, in June, the company announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-shipped-25m-units-worldwide">Elden Ring itself had shipped 25m units</a>.</p><p>So, what's next? While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-elden-rings-sole-dlc-but-may-not-be-the-series-end">Shadow of the Erdtree will be Elden Ring's only expansion</a>, perhaps the critically acclaimed game will be getting its own "feature film or TV" spin-off in the future. Writer George RR Martin seemed to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-writer-george-rr-martin-tells-us-nothing-and-everything-about-a-live-action-spin-off">hinting at something along these lines</a>, anyway.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Star Wars Outlaws. Final Fantasy 16. The list of big budget video game failures is growing longer each month, with triple-A publishers struggling to make a dent in the dominance of older, more established players in this most brutal of markets.</p><p>Throughout it all, massive hits come out of nowhere. One of those is <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, developed by World War Z and SnowRunner studio Saber Interactive and published by Focus Entertainment.</p><p>Of course, Space Marine 2 benefited from the strength of the Warhammer 40,000 brand, which is carefully managed by Games Workshop and about as big as it’s ever been. But still, Space Marine 2’s breakout success came as a surprise even to its developer, as Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN in a recent interview.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/03/gettyimages-971263864-1-1727959528024.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tim Willits. Photo by Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Bethesda Softworks.</figcaption></figure></output><p>As the video game industry comes to terms with the high-profile failure of the likes of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-game-director-steps-down-as-staff-at-sony-owned-firewalk-await-their-fate-report">Concord</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-lays-off-staff-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop">Suicide Squad</a>, what enabled Space Marine 2 to succeed? Both Concord and Suicide Squad took years to develop at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, and launched into genres some say gamers had long since moved on from. In some respects Space Marine 2 is similar. It is Saber’s biggest ever video game undertaking and took over four years to develop — a significant cycle as far as triple-A production goes although, as we’ve seen with Concord and Suicide Squad, hardly an outlier.</p><p>Indeed we’ve seen huge hits from video games that had similarly long developments. Arrowhead’s Helldivers 2, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time</a>, took just shy of eight years to develop and at significant expense. It is an oversimplification to say Concord and Suicide Squad's long developments were the root cause of their failure, although they clearly played a big part.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A lot of games are released with high budgets, and they're not selling nearly as well as expected.</p></div><p>This week, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said the games industry was going through what he called a “generational change” that had led to some games failing to sell as well as their publishers had hoped.</p><p>"One of the manifestations [of that change] we're seeing right now is that a lot of games are released with high budgets, and they're not selling nearly as well as expected," Sweeney said. "Whereas other games are going incredibly strong. What we're seeing is a real trend where players are gravitating toward the really big games where they can play with more of their friends."</p><p>That reads as a somewhat ill-advised dig at single-player games, or at least their sustainability as triple-A projects. Yes, Space Marine 2 and Helldivers 2 are boosted by their co-op play, but single-player games continue to sell in record numbers. Just look at FromSoftware’s Elden Ring and Game Science’s Black Myth: Wukong — both predominantly single-player games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Best Video Games of 2024 So Far</h3></div></output><p>Willits has his own theory on what’s happening. Speaking to IGN, Willits said that the problem isn’t necessarily that triple-A games take too long to develop and thus launch into already abandoned genres. Rather, Willits believes, triple-A developers are tending to “over-scope” their games, which in turn means they fail to do any one thing brilliantly.</p><p>For Space Marine 2, Willits explained, Saber made sure to nail the core combat and kept a handle on the scope of the game, so much so that some have praised it for rekindling memories of the Xbox 360 era of action games.</p><p>“It is not necessarily the genre that has moved on, because great games will always do well,” Willits insisted. “One of the things that we try to do at Saber, and this is part of my job as creative officer of all the teams, we have a core belief that what you do every second and what happens when you push these buttons and that core gameplay loop is so critical. So we focus on the moment-to-moment interaction in the gameplay and the feeling you have.</p><p>“And then we adhere to our core pillars, like be the ultimate Space Marine, melee, ranged, swarms, that's it. And a lot of teams throughout development will over-scope games. They look at some other game that just came out and say, ‘oh, we got to do that, let's add this, we got to do this.’ And they lose focus on the core, what actually makes the game fun.</p><p>“We are not in Space Marine 2 doing things that… well, the swarms are new technology, but there isn't some revolutionary new gameplay mechanic that no one's ever seen before. There are gameplay mechanics that people are familiar with, but we do it really, really well. And we execute really, really well.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What business are we in where you fail if you sell less than five million?</p></div><p>Then there’s the question of the cost of development, which pretty much every triple-A publisher has said has risen sharply (once again) with the launch of the latest generation of consoles. Development costs, Willits said, have got so out of control that some triple-A games, especially those in U.S. states such as California, now have unreasonable sales expectations set against their budgets. Saber, Willits insisted, developed Space Marine 2 “affordably,” with a budget less than half that of Doom Eternal, the last game Willtis worked on while boss of id Software before leaving to join Saber in 2019.</p><p>“We don't need to sell four million units to make it [Space Marine 2] a success,” Willits said. “There are many games, sadly, especially out of North American developers, where if you do not sell five million copies you are a failure. I mean, what business are we in where you fail if you sell less than five million?”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>He continued: “There are examples like that, and we do not want to be that business. We want to be a developer that focuses on the core experience, what makes the games actually fun, and then do it really well and then make it affordably.</p><p>“Look at SnowRunner! Dude, SnowRunner is literally driving trucks through mud. That's it, I'm done. I just described the game. 15 million people played it because the experience is perfect. Look at World War Z. Like, come on, we're not going to get an Academy Award for that game, but 25 million people have played it because it's just this perfectness, and that's what we do well.”</p><p>Even with Willits’ over-scope argument in mind, there are exceptions to the rule. Consider Larian’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> which, including its successful early access period, was in the works for around six years before its record-breaking launch in 2023. Predominantly single-player and with a “Rockstar-level nonsense for scope,” <a href="https://x.com/JamesBergCanada/status/1677770176153137152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as one developer put it</a>.</p><p>What to make of all this? Perhaps all we can say is that video game development is super hard and not an exact science. If it were, every game would be successful.</p><p>Willits had previously told IGN that the success of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii"><u>Space Marine 2</u></a> “changes everything” for Saber, and would even positively affect its future projects.</p><p>While neither Saber nor Focus have announced a sales figure for Space Marine 2, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-to-get-ultrawide-support-private-pve-lobbies-and-more-in-first-patch"><u>Focus has confirmed over two million played at launch</u></a>. In fact, Space Marine 2 is the most-played Warhammer video game of any type ever released on Steam, with 225,690 peak concurrent players on Valve’s platform.</p><p>Willits won't go into hard numbers for Space Marine 2's success, either in revenue or profit terms, but he has gone on the record to say <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-id-software-execs-space-marine-2-is-selling-faster-than-any-of-their-games-including-doom-and-quake"><u>Space Marine 2 is the fastest-selling game he's ever worked on</u></a>, and that includes all the Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, and Rage games id Software released over the 24 years he was at the studio.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>PC specs for the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/" data-ref-id="5000-631817">Sid Meier's Civilization 7</a> have been revealed, so PC gamers can check how their rig is going to hold up ahead of the game's release next February. As expected from a strategy title, the minimum specs are less demanding than your average AAA game, but running the game on ultra settings will require a surprisingly powerful PC.</p><p>The game's minimum standards ask for a Nvidia GTX 1050 GPU or better, Intel Core i3-10100 CPU or better, 8GB of RAM, and a 20GB SSD, meaning most PCs should be able to handle Civilization 7 on low graphics settings. Recommended settings, which will play the game on a medium graphics preset, requires a Nvidia RTX 2060 or better, Intel Core i5-10400 or better, 16GB RAM, and a 20GB SSD.</p><p>The game's requirements really jump up when it comes to playing on ultra settings, especially for a turn-based strategy game, though it's still not as demanding as other AAA games. The ultra standards ask for a Nvidia RTX 4070 or better, Intel Core i7-14700f or better, 32GB RAM, and a 20GB SSD.</p><p>Civilization 7 will also be released on Mac and Linux, however recommended specs for those platforms still have yet to be shared. While most PC gamers shouldn't have any issues meeting at least the minimum recommended specs, gamers still have a few months to make sure their rigs are up to scratch.</p><p>Civilization fans have waited a long time for the next game in the series, and it's finally coming to PC and consoles next February. The game has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-preorder-guide-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-nintendo-switch/1100-6525971/" data-ref-id="1100-6525971">four editions to choose from</a>, some of which will include early access starting February 6. The global release date for standard editions is February 11.</p>

			<p>A new Silent Hill 2 remake comparison video was shared online today, highlighting many of the changes introduced in the remake over the glorious original released on PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>The comparison, which was put together by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ElAnalistaDeBits</a>, puts the original side-by-side with the remake developed by Bloober Team releasing next week, highlighting gameplay and visual changes. Judging from the comparison, the remake seems to bring great improvements across the board, which wasn't exactly a given, as the first few showings of the remake weren't exactly impressive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 | Original VS Remake | Final Graphics &amp; Gameplay Comparison | Analista De Bits" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9KOt3JtkWQc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The consensus on the Silent Hill 2 remake is generally quite positive. The reviews that have gone live today have praised the game almost universally, highlighting how Bloober Team has done an excellent job modernizing one of the best survival horror games of all time. Our own Chris went so far as to name the game as the very best Bloober Team has put out to date in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>
<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake launches on October 8th on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft have released a big new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> patch which, amongst other things, tries to fix and improve the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game’s stealth. I’ve seen, read, heard, intuited and telepathically detected a lot of complaints about Outlaws stealth, ranging from “it doesn’t look realistic when she punches out stormtroopers through their blaster-resistant hats” to “please remove the hide-and-seek entirely, I wishly merely to pew-pew”. Seems likely that the patch won’t lay all these grievances to rest, to say nothing of the other problems people have with Outlaws. But I’m always interested in how developers Find The Fun in stealth mechanics, given that they are very easily unfun. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The patch has “tweaked the overall stealth experience by adjusting AI detection, the number of NPCs and their positioning, patrol pathing, camera detection and highlighting environmental opportunities to reduce player friction,” according to Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1Kq2ABlTdHgkdbGRQZ20he/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-12">full changelog</a>. 
</p>
<p>
It has also “scaled AI reaction to environmental actions from investigation to combat (e.g. when Nix detonates an NPC’s grenade more than once)” and reduced the odds of detection while you’re in cover. To that, add fixes for a bunch of issues with stealth or supporting systems – NPCs not being distracted by Nix,  Kay’s reputation not being impacted when she’s caught doing naughty things like stealing, or being incorrectly impacted by other actions or events. 
</p>
<p>
All this comes in the wake of Star Wars Outlaws creative director Julian Gerighty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-admits-forced-stealth-sections-are-incredibly-punishing-says-next-patch-will-ease-up-on-them">conceding that the game’s forced stealth sections can be “incredibly punishing”</a>, partly because Outlaws doesn't communicate the ins and outs effectively. “I do think there are millions of low hanging fruits where we can make it so much more enjoyable and understandable,” he said.
</p><p>
I’m focussing on the stealth here, because I am a deeply antisocial person, but the patch covers a lot more ground, including changes to open world events and fixes for various crash bugs, misfires when playing sabaac, dodgy cinematics and the UI in general.</p>
<p>On the graphics front, the update improves the performance of VRAM, RTXDI, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction, and makes Kay’s hair animate properly in different types of rain. Amusingly, Ubisoft have also “fixed an issue where Kay closed the wrong eye when aiming down sights”. Bless her, she’d probably make a great stormtrooper if the smuggling racket doesn’t pan out.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Outlaws had a “softer launch” than fondly hoped by Uncle Ubisoft. The publishers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">delayed Assassin’s Creed Shadows to make changes in response to Outlaws’ shortcomings</a>, though it’s possible this has more to do with developers further down the ladder telling management that Shadows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-due-to-ubisoft-finally-listening-to-developers-pushing-for-a-delay-for-some-time-says-report">simply needs more bloomin' time</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-lead-designer-mario-rabbids-director-announce-new-development-studio-day-4-night/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-release/">Red Dead Redemption</a> lead designer Christian Cantamessa and Mario + Rabbids director Davide Soliani announced a new development studio called Day 4 Night which is currently working on a completely original IP.</p>
<p>The new team, which received its first round of funding from Krafton and 1Up Ventures, also includes other members of the Mario + Rabbids team Cristina Nava, Gian Marco Zanna, and Luca Breda, who also worked on other Ubisoft games such as Just Dance, Ghost Recon, and the recently released Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
<p><em>"When I first fell in love with video games at the start of my career, I saw the power of this new medium to tell stories never told before and create worlds that could transform people,"</em> the Red Dead Redemption lead designer Christian Cantamessa said in a statement. <em>"Day 4 Night is a return to that innovative spirit, to that innocence, to that unbridled creativity."</em></p>
<p><em>"What we are crafting at Day 4 Night is a reflection of everything I’ve ever wanted to experience as a player - joy, adventure, poetry, action, wonder, and the pleasure of working with friends. It’s a lullaby for my soul and a serenade to our industry, to the magic and the madness of creating worlds from nothing. It’s a story about triumphs, challenges, dreams, to light the path we walk together,"</em> Davide Soliani added.</p>
<p>According to Krafton, the pitch for the studio's first game presented a highly engaging and captivating story, featuring a vision that stands out as both original and creative. These features make it a great match for the type of studio the publisher aims to support.</p>
<p>More information on the Day 4 Night development studio can be found on its <a href="https://d4nstudios.com/">official website.</a></p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> is, belatedly, now available in Japan on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Palworld first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation">released on PlayStation consoles last month</a>. However, while Pocketpair's monster-catching survival game debuted on PS5 across 68 countries and regions worldwide, it was not released in Japan at the same time.</p>
<p>A reason for this omission was not given, although it was surmised it was due to the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo is suing Pocketpair for patent infringement</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>However, while Japanese customers may have had to wait that little bit longer to get their hands on the PlayStation version of Palworld, that wait is now over.</p>
<p>"The PS5 version of Palworld is released today on the PS Store," the Japanese Palworld social media team shared this morning, with a couple of celebratory emojis.</p>

<p>It has been quite a ol' busy time for Palworld. After those aforementioned legal issues with Nintendo arose, Pocketpair reacted to say it was still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">unaware of which patents it had seemingly infringed</a>. Pocketpair has also recently signed a deal with Krafton to bring Palworld to mobile devices.</p>
<p>As we reported earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-headed-to-mobile-courtesy-of-kraftons-pubg-studios">Krafton's subsidiary PUBG Studios will handle development</a> of the mobile version of Palworld, which will see the company "faithfully reinterpret and implement the main fun elements of the original".</p>
<p>Palworld was the first big mega-hit of 2024, surpassing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">2m concurrent players on Steam back in January</a>. It was only the second game to ever achieve this, the other being - rather fittingly now - PUBG.</p></div>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-pro-controller-review/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-pro-controller-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>What is the coolest-looking controller on the market? It’s the Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra. It’s an easy question to answer when you see this Xbox, Mobile and PC-centric pro controller in all its glory. It has customisable RGB lighting and a mini-OLED screen smack bang in the centre, making this the street racer equivalent to Microsoft’s tried and tested formula. This a controller that you can’t help but be fascinated and oddly proud of every time you pick it up, and fortunately, good looks aren’t the only thing going for it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stealth™ Ultra – High-Performance Wireless Controller and Rapid Charge Dock for Xbox, PC &amp; Android" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bK72HmHoMoM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Stealth Ultra continues Turtle Beach’s design brief to create the best-looking peripherals. Just like the Stealth Flightstick, it packs an OLED screen into the body of the device that lets you see exactly what’s going on with your controller, and allows you to make changes on the fly. While we’ll still lament the Dreamcast’s under-appreciated innovation here, building a screen into a controller is absolutely a gimmick, it’s just one that happens to remove&nbsp;some of the fussy nature of a pro controller. Some, not all.</p>


<p>Alongside the requisite face buttons there are four back buttons, which sit in a row across the rear of the controller. I really like this layout, and they sit naturally under my middle fingers, though you do have to learn where the middle two buttons lie and get used to activating them. In some cases, the layout might be less useful than something like the Xbox Elite Controller’s setup, where you can use both middle and ring fingers to activate the rear buttons, but I found I adapted to the Stealth Ultra in a fairly short amount of time.</p>


<p>One of the clunkiest aspects of most pro controllers is changing up what the rear buttons actually do, but the OLED screen takes on that function in a clear and amazingly straightforward fashion. All of the options are accessed by the + button in the centre of the controller, and you then scroll and make selections with the D-pad and the face buttons.</p>
<p>You can change pretty much everything you would want to via the screen. From the stick and trigger axis, through to tweaking the vibration levels across four zones, and altering the RGB lighting or EQ settings for a connected pair of headphones. This isn’t just a simplified version of the control you might have via a phone or PC app, it’s complete and in-depth.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, you can also connect the Stealth Ultra up to your mobile phone, but with practically all the configuration done on device, you don’t really need the Control Center app for very much, other than tweaking power-saving modes and updating the controller. What you <em>can</em> do, is read your texts and notifications on the controller screen, which might be an interesting feature for some people. It’s not the ideal way to interact with these though, and other than prompting you to pick up your phone, it’s just an interesting feature rather than something lifechanging.</p>

<p>Up to this point, we’ve mostly covered how the controller looks. Fortunately, the Stealth Ultra Controller is just as impressive in use as it is to look at. It comes with a magnetic charging base, which also houses a proprietary USB-A dongle, though it also works with Bluetooth and can be wired up. Thanks to the dock, the Stealth Ultra is always ready to go, but Turtle Beach have it listed for 30 hours of battery life, just in case you forget, or you don’t like controllers lying about on your surfaces. It’s never run out of juice while I’ve been using it, and just feels like it’ll keep going forever. For most people, that’s going to be the norm.</p>
<p>From there, there’s a litany of smart design choices. There’s Hall Effect thumbsticks, the magnetic technology ensuring that these are sticks that should never start to drift. They’ve been absolutely perfect through our testing. You can also swap the caps of the thumbsticks, with an additional two pairs in the snug hard case that Turtle Beach have included.</p>
<p>All of the central face buttons, those on the rear, and the D-pad use microswitches, with every fast-feeling input accentuated by that wonderful clickiness. There’s also lock-outs for the triggers, shortening the distance needed to activate them, making them perfect for games like Call of Duty, Fortnite or Overwatch 2 where you want a hair trigger. I’ve played a lot of Overwatch 2 with the Stealth Ultra, and I’ve risen further up the rankings then ever before. It’s not just the buffs that Moira got this season, the Stealth Ultra has definitely helped.</p>

<p>When it comes to the competition, I have a hard time choosing between the Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra at £180 and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/victrix-pro-bfg-controller-review/">Victrix Pro BFG</a> at £170 (though it can be found for around £130 right now). Both of these latest pro controllers are light, well made, and boast a ton of features that will help you play better. If you want to be the best, both of these controllers can help you get there. Personally speaking, the Stealth Ultra’s astounding lights, actually useful OLED screen and ease of use make it the one that you want to pick up, and on a purely arbitrary front, the trigger lockout system on the Stealth Ultra is better too.</p>

			<p>Diablo IV and its soon-to-be-released Vessel of Hatred expansion will be PlayStation 5 Pro Enhanced titles.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, Activision Blizzard's Rod Fergusson confirmed that the latest entry in the popular ARPG series and its expansion will indeed be PS5 Pro Enhanced. Additional details on the enhancements will be provided later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I've been getting this question quite a bit recently and I'm happy to say that Diablo IV and Vessel of Hatred will indeed be PS5 Pro Enhanced!<br>
Very proud of our hardworking team to make this happen. More details at a later date. <a href="https://t.co/rvtUgmu6Ie">https://t.co/rvtUgmu6Ie</a></p>
<p>— Rod Fergusson (@RodFergusson) <a href="https://twitter.com/RodFergusson/status/1841960958672928893?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While we do not know if Diablo IV and the Vessel of Hatred will be among the<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-50-enhanced-titles-launch/"> PlayStation 5 Pro Enhanced launch titles</a>, it is good to know owners of the soon to be released system will be able to experience them with multiple enhancements. It is also somewhat ironic that a game that is now owned by Microsoft will play and look best on a PlayStation system, but with the current state of the gaming industry, everything has truly become possible.</p>
<p>Even if Diablo IV wasn't getting PlayStation 5 Pro Enhanced, it still had the chance to look better on the new system, thanks to its Game Boost mode, which can be used to stabilize framerate and increase dynamic resolution range without any input from the developer. PS5 Pro Enhanced titles, however, will definitely look best, as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has already shown in some <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vast-improvement-playstation-5-pro/">preview footage.</a></p>
<p>Diablo IV is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-trailer-gorgeous-eva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a new trailer at Tokyo Game Show 2024, where the highly anticipated remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-playable-at-tgs-konami-provides-progress-update-explains-why-they-stayed-so-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playable</a>.</p>
<p>At TGS 2024, Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/19148" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caught up with Production Producer Noriaki Okamura for an interview</a>. Interestingly, Okamura-san said that the difficulty will change drastically depending on the player's choice of perspective: legacy style or the new style.</p>
<p><em>The main feature is the ability to choose between "NEW STYLE," which is a third-person perspective, and "LEGACY STYLE," which uses a top-down bird's-eye view and has controls closer to those of the original version. We had planned to make it possible to switch between the two viewpoints at any time during gameplay, but we decided against it.</em></p>
<p><em>The difficulty level changes drastically depending on the viewpoint. The "New Style" has a wider linear field of view, and you can shoot your gun while moving Snake, so the difficulty level was lower than we had expected. However, if we adjusted it to match the "New Style," the "Legacy Style" would become too difficult. So, we decided to split the play style into two.</em></p>
<p><em>The "Legacy Style" is close to the difficulty level of the original version, and we are adjusting the "New Style" from scratch.</em></p>
<p>Famitsu also asked Okamura about the release date of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. However, he didn't commit to any specific windows yet.</p>
<p><em>That's a pretty difficult question (laughs), but the game is actually already playable to the end, and we don't expect it to take many years to complete. However, the most important thing in the development of this game is not to disappoint the fans. We want to finish it properly and announce it once it is in a state where it can be firmly confirmed. Game development doesn't proceed at a constant pace, so it's difficult to express, but... we can see the goal, and we're still adding the missing parts.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spongebob-squarepants-the-patrick-star-game-review.1000443/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/spongebob-squarepants-the-patrick-star-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Always the bridesmaid but never the bride, SpongeBob’s sleepy sidekick, Patrick Star, has often been overlooked in favour of his over-the-top neighbour – at least in the world of video games. That hasn’t stopped him from making a home in our hearts, though, so I was riding high when I learned the enigmatic starfish was finally being thrust into the limelight… but then the emotional rollercoaster dipped back down as I discovered SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Game is little more than a sea of uninspired minigames and repetitive activities that waste almost all of its obvious potential, outside of a boatload of cute references to the show.</p><p>Stepping into the flowery shorts of Patrick himself, you embark on a six-hour sandbox platforming expedition through a thoughtfully recreated Bikini Bottom. In addition to having a dedicated burp button, Patrick can pick up items with either hand and fall asleep on command, turning the invertebrate into a possessed bowling ball that you can send hurtling across the sea floor. Due to the underwater setting, gravity is kinder than in most physics-based puzzlers, meaning there’s added time to plot your jumps and fix mistakes when you’re off the ground. This forgiving, familiar control scheme is applied to a mixed bag of activities dotted around the map, like skydiving or smashing up crates in the local Rage Room. Succeeding in these tasks rewards you with precious Sand Dollars that will eventually afford Patrick a slot to compete against his porous bestie in the prestigious Fry Cook Games. It’s an approachable setup buffeted by charming but eventually repetitious conversations with beloved characters like Mr. Krabs, Plankton and Sandy Cheeks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Game Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The surrounding cartoon world is a blend of solid and breakable structures and allowed me to engage my inner chaos merchant as I took out any aggression on glass panes and metal walls alike. It isn’t all down to Patrick’s spiny appendages, though, as you can also take advantage of equippable tools littered around the vibrant underwater wonderland which bolster his platforming abilities. Whether I was sailing across a valley with the help of a paraglider or taking out a false wall with a comically oversized hammer it was easy to get caught in a chaotic feedback loop, bounding around the suburbs and bothering the Bottom-ites. But while it all sounds very freeing on paper, it’s also paper-thin, and I soon saw the limits of this reasonably sized world. When you push the haphazard reactivity too far the mask starts to slip, with clipping issues and unusual NPC behavior that illuminates the frayed technical seams that eventually come apart and leave an otherwise good first impression in tatters. </p><p>Perhaps the saving grace here is that Bikini Bottom as a whole is such a joy to explore, for the short time the novelty lasts at least. It’s an interactive diorama, decorated with hallowed locations like Mrs Puff’s Boating School and Glove World, and it speaks to the power of SpongeBob SquarePants that I was so enchanted by the referential signage, food items, and flower clouds scattered across the sky. The nostalgia is compounded by Patrick’s unlockable outfits, too – while the promise of entering the Fry Cook Games didn’t prompt much passion, grinding for iconic outfits like The Elastic Waistband and Patrick’s ‘Sweet Victory’ suit certainly did. </p><p>That magic eventually runs out, though, and a broader shallowness rears its head. While this is felt across The Patrick Star Game as a whole, it’s most apparent in its inconsistent array of minigames, which range from well-meaning imitations of pre-existing ideas to thankless busywork. I most enjoyed the Chum Bucket, an Overcooked clone that had me scrambling to make gooey buckets of eyeballs and bones under a time limit for paying customers. Elsewhere, I found myself clearing out lounging locals from Squidward’s favourite sunbathing spot, which both felt on-point thematically and leveraged the wacky physics to great effect. In these moments, I was reminded of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/30/the-simpsons-game-review-4"><u>The Simpsons Game</u></a>'s hilarious and moreish slate of tasks, which similarly combined its show's unique humour with appropriately comical jobs.</p><p>Unfortunately, these moments of clarity were soon overshadowed by a glut of laboriousness. That includes seeking out endless golden gloves across a pint-sized amusement park or trawling the dump in search of an ever-increasing number of treasure chests. In the latter, I soon resolved to tear the place apart with an enormous magnet, but that approach only made my search more challenging as fished-up cars and other detritus got caught in the environment, trapping spoiled mattresses in a state of annoying eternal squeaking. Ultimately, I abandoned all hope and moved on, searching for alternate means of earning the Sand Dollars necessary to enter the Fry Cook Games. And, even when I did reach that coveted finale, I was met with more of the same clunky interactions I was already familiar with – it felt fitting that Patrick fell asleep during the closing ceremony.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Sarah's favourite physics games</h3></p></div><p>It’s a shame that The Patrick Star Game resorts to simplistic collect-and-clear tasks when there’s such a deep well of SpongeBob lore to pull from. There are shades of this in the Bikini Bottom University segment, where you take on Squidward in an art contest, but its on-rails, oversimplified nature makes it hard to feel too invested. It would have been nice to see a more cohesive story play out instead of dealing with so many disconnected and lacklustre cameos.</p><p>It’s small consolation, but at least when I did get bored of the repetitive minigames, I could switch gears and tackle a list of more specific Feats, earning Sand Dollars for serving up burnt Krabby Patties or completing my childhood dream: pulling a full-blown 360 on the neighbourhood swing set. The light-hearted requirements of these Feats provided focus when I was losing interest, and the collectable Mayo Jars placed throughout Bikini Bottom broke up the post-game monotony with some proper platforming challenges.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>SpongeBob SquarePants: The Patrick Star Game is obviously geared more towards kids than those of us who grew up loving SpongeBob, but so are things like Astro Bot and Super Mario Wonder, and those games are brilliant. By contrast, the lack of exciting puzzle solutions or meaningful challenges offered across this six-hour adventure is bad enough that it feels like an underestimation of that audience. Propped up by the iconic and playful world of Bikini Bottom, it makes a strong first impression that quickly wears thin. Its physics-heavy sandbox can briefly be a joy to explore if you’re a fan of the TV series, however the slew of monotonous minigames and host of on-loop conversations within it fail to fully capture that show's spirit. Without an engaging goal or overarching story to latch onto, the end result is a repetitive and uninventive adventure that does a disservice to Patrick’s protagonist potential.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>After a string of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil</a> remakes, the resurrection of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>, and even genre granddaddy <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/alone-in-the-dark">Alone in the Dark</a> stepping back into the spotlight earlier this year, it feels long overdue that seminal survival horror classic <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a> should emerge from the fog and be given a modern makeover. Enter Bloober Team, the psychological horror specialists best known for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/observer">Observer</a>, who’ve been given the task of taking the morbid masterpiece from the PlayStation 2 era and making the fetid flesh of its many demonic ghouls seem fresh. As a big fan of the original, I’m happy to report that this resulting Silent Hill 2 remake is an exceptionally grim and grimy horrorscape that’s consistently compelling to explore, packed with new puzzles and beefed-up boss encounters, and enhanced with modernised combat that made my return to the small town of Silent Hill a regularly violent thrill.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Silent Hill 2 (2024) Review Screens</h3></div></output><p>Given it was released more than two decades ago, there’s every chance you don’t have the foggiest idea what made the original Silent Hill 2 so impactful. Aside from its sinister small town setting that felt like stepping into the pages of a Stephen King novel, Silent Hill 2 stood apart from other survival horror stories of its era by putting just as much focus on the battle with personal demons as it did regular scraps with the snarling physical kind. Protagonist James Sunderland, who’s lured to a remote mining town by the promise of making contact with his deceased wife Mary, is not a battle hardened member of a zombie-killing special unit – he’s an ordinary man forced to confront some truly extraordinary things. The struggles with his own guilt and trauma both humanise him and add believable heft to the horrors that unfold around him. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Silent Hill 2’s festering environment is at once both off-putting and alluring, like a scab you can’t stop picking.</p></div><p>While the roles of James and the handful of other lost souls he meets along the way have been recast with voice actors of a noticeably higher standard in this remake, the campy dialogue they deliver remains mostly unchanged. This does preserve the off-kilter, David Lynchian feel of the original character interactions, but comes across as a little bit jarring at times given the vastly improved standards of storytelling we’ve seen in more recent horror landmarks. I was no less entertained by Silent Hill 2’s quirky characters this time around, even if I never became emotionally invested in their plights to the same extent I did with the supporting casts in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake II</a>. Regardless, I found the mystery surrounding the fate of Mary was still more than intriguing enough to drag me through the darkest depths of Silent Hill 2’s story.</p><h2>Hell Comes to Fogtown</h2><p>The difference in look and feel between this Silent Hill 2 remake and the 2001 original is night and day – or perhaps that should be night<em>mare</em> and day<em>dream</em> given the surreal nature of its small town’s continually altering state. The streets are blanketed by believably heavy fog and rich with detail, right down to the missing persons posters taped to telephone poles that flutter in the breeze. Dimly lit dwellings are overrun with discernable signs of decay, and drywall and cinder block splinter off in shards from startling shockwaves felt in hurried hallway chase scenes. Hordes of cockroaches startle and scatter in the beam of your flashlight as you make your way down each putrid path that winds you through an increasingly hellish otherworld. Silent Hill 2’s festering environment is at once both off-putting and alluring, like a scab you can’t stop picking.</p><p>The enemies too have been dressed up in far more disturbing and disgusting designs. The most common type, the Lying Figure, which appears to have its arms wrapped up in a straightjacket made of its own skin, seems slick with a decidedly icky sheen and more smoothly shifts from two-legged stagger to writhing prone along the ground in preparation for a surprise attack. There’s also the twitchy, Bubble Head Nurses introduced during the Brookhaven Hospital section (who now come in both pipe and knife-toting forms), and of course Pyramid Head, who’s sharply pointed skull once again brings a more literal meaning to the term apex predator. This lumbering death-dealer remains one of the most terrifying presences in the horror genre, only now he seems somehow even more sinister thanks to extra details like the realistic rust on his jagged head and the ghastly inky goop that coats his powerful frame.</p><p>Of course, that’s when you can actually see the enhanced enemies and environments around you, since Silent Hill 2 is also oppressively dark for significantly long periods at a time. James’ chest-mounted flashlight has a shorter throw than Mr. Burns, meaning it’s regularly the case that you can only see a few feet in front of his nose – testing your television’s black levels, tightening the unrelenting sense of claustrophobia, and leaving you vulnerable to ambushes from the creepy Mannequin enemies that stand eerily still in the corners of rooms like they’re floor lamps purchased from Hell’s Home Depot.</p><p>It’s during these moments, when your peripheral vision shrinks down to a pinhole, that Silent Hill 2’s incredibly unsettling audio design really comes to the fore. The signature radio static hisses that intensify around imminent dangers, the shrieks in the distance and whispers that are uncomfortably close, and the accompanying discordant drones maintain an ongoing and ominous sense of dread. Stalking through Silent Hill 2 left my nerves more shredded than a guitar solo played by a shirtless Hugh Jackman. </p><h2>Cloudy with a Chance of Street Brawls</h2><p>Thankfully when things get loud in Silent Hill 2, we’re much better equipped to fight back this time. Gone is the stiff, auto-targeted shooting and cumbersome pause menu-based weapon-swapping of the original, Silent Hill 2’s combat feels much more like what you’d expect from a survival horror adventure post-<a href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>. Enemies can be manually targeted from an over-the-shoulder viewpoint, weapons can be quickly shuffled between at the tap of a d-pad button, and James is also able to perform quick dodges to nimbly sidestep around lurching enemies or the streams of acidic bile they spew. Additionally, melee attacks can be used to smash through glass in order to gather health drinks and ammunition from cabinets or locked cars, and even to crash through weakened sections of walls to gain access to secret areas hidden amongst its expanded environments.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Stalking through Silent Hill 2 left my nerves more shredded than a guitar solo played by a shirtless Hugh Jackman.&nbsp;</p></div><p>That said, although Silent Hill 2 gives you far more control over each shot fired, it remains staunchly true to the original in terms of its noticeably limited arsenal of weapons – James is an underpowered everyman by design, after all. There are two types of melee weapons plus a handgun, shotgun, and rifle, and that’s your lot. There are no weapon upgrades or mods to expand the capabilities of your arsenal further, and ultimately I didn’t particularly favour one weapon over the other – I pretty much just switched to whichever gun I had the most ammo for at any one time. Actually that’s not entirely true – according to the story completion stats page, I did prefer one weapon more than most: the lead pipe. Partly since ammo was so scarce, but mainly because it just feels amazingly satisfying to relieve Silent Hill 2’s near-constant tension by clubbing a hellborn beast to the ground and continuing to pound their slimy skulls in until they’ve long since expired. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Silent Hill 2 Remake Vs Original Comparison</h3></div></output><p>Yet while Silent Hill 2 lags behind the likes of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> as far as the flexibility of its firepower goes, the developers – in collaboration with original Silent Hill 2 creature designer Masahiro Ito – have thrown a few new enemy types into the mix to keep the combat consistently engaging despite its relative mechanical simplicity. When I first entered the Toluca Prison section in the story’s second half only to find a freaky new breed of Mannequin that could scramble up and down walls and along the ceiling like a spider made of discarded doll parts, I couldn’t hit the new 180-degree turn button fast enough. However, once I’d composed myself, I set about trying to pick them off from afar with my rifle as they shuffled in and out of the shadows above, which gave Silent Hill 2’s combat a challenging new edge.</p><p>Where the overhauled combat really shines, however, is in the boss battles. Some fights, like the first encounter with the iconic Pyramid Head, play out largely the same way they did before – they just feel more muscular and menacing thanks to the immediacy of the over-the-shoulder viewpoint and the vastly more detailed visuals. However, other action sequences have been enhanced to far more comprehensive degrees. Without spoiling too much, there’s one particular late game fight in the original Silent Hill 2 that amounted to little more than an attritional head-to-head stand-off, but here it’s been reworked into an intense game of cat and mouse amidst the frigid air and dangling carcasses inside a meat locker – effectively transforming one of the story’s weakest boss fights into one of its very best.  </p><p>Similarly, many of the original game’s puzzles have been preserved here, whether it’s the eccentric, point-and-click adventure kind like using a specific tool in order to retrieve an item from an apartment suite garbage chute, or the more ingenious form like swiveling an ornate box on its axis in order to manipulate the towering, MC Escher-inspired room of impossible staircases inside a late-game labyrinth. Meanwhile, other brainteasers like the coin puzzle early on have been given additional steps to complete, which prevented their solutions from ever becoming too predictable as someone who played the original all those years ago. With the exception of some obligatory valve-turning here and there, puzzle types are largely unique and consistently stimulating, and there are plenty of them to solve. (Like combat, you can also vary the difficulty of puzzles via the in-game menu in order to best suit your tastes).</p><p>However, some of the simpler puzzles have been expanded upon a touch too much. Take one early obstacle in the original that effectively required you to solve a fairly straightforward riddle in order to wind a grandfather clock to a specific time. In this remake, I had to undergo a sequence of multi-part treasure hunts to gather up each of the three hands for the clock face – fending off enemy hordes and completing additional puzzles along the way – which ultimately meant that close to an hour of my playthrough was spent simply attempting to make the clock chime and unlock the way forward. This is just one example of a number of instances where the new Silent Hill 2 bogs down slightly in terms of story progression, and I have to admit that as I jumped through yet another elaborate series of hoops just trying to get my hands on the key to a locked door in the Wood Side Apartments, I did catch myself wishing the owner had simply left a spare under their welcome mat.  </p><h2>To Cut a Short Story Long</h2><p>It’s because of the expanded puzzles and combat sections, that the new Silent Hill 2 is considerably longer than the original despite the fact it seems to stick to all the same story beats. The main campaign of the 2001 Silent Hill 2 can be completed in around eight hours, but my playthrough of this 2024 remake hit the credits at just over 15. While it’s almost twice as long, I don’t really feel it’s doubly as good. This remake is genuinely excellent for large stretches at a time, particularly during the escalating stakes of its climactic final third, but there are definitely moments throughout the early parts of the journey that are lined with more padding than the walls of the Brookhaven Hospital psychiatric ward. </p><p>It also means that although Silent Hill 2 features eight different endings to unlock – two more than the original’s six – I can’t see myself investing the time for any repeat playthroughs because I’m slightly put-off by the protracted length. Although admittedly alternate endings aren’t the only incentive to return in Silent Hill 2’s New Game+ – there are also extra weapons to find, additional graphics modes with CRT scanlines and the like to try, plus numerous secrets and easter eggs to comb for in the town’s increased number of interiors – I don’t feel a huge pull to step face-first back into the fog anytime soon.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div><p>Even so, although it might not completely trump the original in the same way that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> remakes did, Silent Hill 2 is still an incredibly high quality reimagining that improves on its source material in more ways than not. I really like the way it uses distinct hues of light and distant audio cues to subtly steer you along the right path, allowing the HUD to stay free of any immersion-breaking objective markers. It’s great how James automatically marks his map with any puzzles or locked doors you find, vastly reducing the amount of aimless backtracking that occasionally plagued the original game. Developer Bloober Team has also really emptied its full bag of tricks as far as taking tense situations and bringing them to near-nervous breakdowns. The timer-based light switches in the Toluca Prison, for example, are an extremely effective device for creating panic – the intensifying countdown beeps echoed my own escalating heartrate as I hurried to complete my search of each cell before the whole block was plunged back into darkness. It’s fantastically fear-inducing stuff.  </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Motion Twin have experienced the highs and lows of game development. An early star of the social-media web-based gaming movement, when the market started to dissolve things were looking bleak until they settled on making a huge creative pivot to create something niche and something hardcore. The result was the runaway indie success, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/06/dead-cells-review/">Dead Cells</a>. Following that up is never going to be an easy task, but with Windblown they’ve retained many of the lessons learned along the way, and though they’ve created a new, undeniably cuter, roguelike IP, it’s still got plenty of that Dead Cells bite to take the unwary by surprise.</p>
<p><iframe title="Windblown First 15 minutes of Single Player" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-hBLnaZbEIk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Before you can do anything in Windblown, you have to choose a body. This is a purely aesthetic choice, so you won’t have to question too hard whether to be an Axolotl or a Pangolin, and once you’ve completed your first run you can swap into any of the other bodies. If you played the demo you also get access to a Guinea Pig, which is, presumably, the most correct choice.</p>


<p>You immediately awaken in the fantastical isometric land that Motion Twin has created, impossible islands hovering in the sky, while rivers drop off into nothingness. The characters boast bold, comic-book lines, but the world itself is more grounded. Well, as much as a bunch of floating islands can be grounded.</p>


<p>Dashing here is both traversal and evasion. You hit the button to transition from island to island, as well as to jump between different areas above and below, while you must utilise it in combat to get out of the way of the increasingly aggressive and swift enemies you encounter along the way.</p>
<p>You immediately feel the vein of Dead Cells running through Windblown, emphasising movement and timing as much as any of the myriad Souls games that are out there. It’s certainly fast, and leaping from island to island and in and out of combat feels gloriously smooth.</p>
<p>Windblown is a roguelike, so you make repeated runs into the Vortex, collecting Cogs and upgrading your abilities as you go. You can choose Gifts at various points, finding friendly memories – seemingly the remnants of fallen heroes – that are willing to bestow new skills upon you. They fall into different categories, but each will give you a new edge in combat, whether that’s ignoring the first hit in each Biome or randomly marking a nearby foe with automatic lightning damage. You can have three Gifts active at any one time, and there’s liable to be plenty of tinkering to find your ideal loadout.</p>

<p>You can also switch between different weapons, grabbing new and more powerful variants as you progress. Much like Gifts, each of these also boasts additional effects or skills, making them increasingly lethal in the right hands. While you start out with a Fish Knife – a standard sword by all accounts – you move onto more interesting options like Kunai and dual blades, and you can access two of these at any time. These can work synergistically too, so completing a combo with one lets you then immediately switch to the other with a special attack.</p>
<p>Alongside that, there’s Trinkets to be found which give you additional skills, with the first one I encountered giving you an explosive Goo blast that damages and slows enemies. Soon enough, you feel incredibly powerful, and during our hands-on Windblown really dispensed these with speed. I really enjoyed the different choices you were given too, and I’m definitely going to spend some time exploring them.</p>
<p>The only thing that didn’t quite fit right for me was the tone at the outset. The soundtrack in the opening area of Golem Gates is very mellow, with slow, drawn-out synthwave echoing across the floating islands. It’s an odd counterpoint to the kinetic combat, particularly at the beginning of the game, but as you advance the soundtrack really picks up, with funky beats feeling more at home with the speed that Windblown wants you to operate at.</p>

<p>When you die – which you definitely will – you’re transported back to the Ark, Windblown’s main hub, where Eperin will fill you in on how it is that you’re able to be brought back to life so succinctly. It’s from here that you can unlock new boons, making the start of each run that little bit easier, as well as joining up with other players.</p>
<p>One of Windblown’s key elements is the ability to play in co-op with up to three other players, and from the Ark you can create your own lobby, or hop into any of those that are available with space. We weren’t able to check this element out during our preview, but it feels like Windblown will be a lot of chaotic fun with a few friends, and I can see speedruns being particularly popular. I hope there’ll be a time-trial mode or racing events, as Windblown feels utterly perfect for that.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun with Windblown. Its fast combat, cute art style and swiftly expanding range of upgrades are certain to find their way into player’s hearts – you should definitely add this one to your wishlist.</p>

<p>Riot Games has just announced a postponement of ticket sales for the Worlds Final in London, England. In a post on social media, the team revealed that ‘significant bot activity’ is impacting the pre-sales of tickets for the League of Legends World Championship final, which is set to be held at the O2 Arena on November 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-nothing-is-sacred">Nothing is Sacred</h2>



<p>The League of Legends World Championship tournament is arguably the biggest esports event in the yearly calendar, pulling in tens of millions of viewers around the world. It holds the record for the most-viewed tournament in history, and it boasts a prize pool worth a staggering $2.25 million. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, that level of popularity means that scalpers are using bots to mass purchase tickets for the grand final event, due to take place at the O2 Arena in London on November 2. Following the disruption caused by bots, Riot Games has opted to postpone a round of pre-sales to resolve the issue:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After discovering significant bot activity impacting our pre-sales over the last 48 hours, we’ve taken the difficult but necessary decision to temporarily postpone the final round of ticket sales for the Worlds Final.</p>



<p>We’re working to resolve the issue and will update you as soon as we can. We’re also identifying tickets purchased by bots so we can get them back into the hands of actual fans.</p>



<p>Fans who have already purchased tickets for the Worlds Final legitimately are unaffected. However, if you believe your purchase has been impacted, please contact AXS customer service so they can assist in troubleshooting your issue.</p>



<p>Thanks fo your patience as work through this — our goal is to ensure a fair and smooth ticketing process for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With each successive year, the League of Legends World Championship becomes more ambitious. This year’s event is proving to be no different, and there is less than a month until the trophy is lifted by one of the best League teams on Earth.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-increasing-salaries/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The last couple of years have been pretty tough on the gaming industry, so good news pieces like this are always appreciated. Per a recent <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20241004_wageincrease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>, it has been revealed that FromSoftware, the developer behind games like Elden Ring, Bloodborne, and Sekiro, is boosting basic salaries for enrolled employees by approximately 11.8%.</p>



<p>Not only that but the firm is also gracing new graduates entering the business with higher monthly salaries, offering an increase from 260,000 yen to 300,000 yen ($1,776 to $2,049).</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-rewarding-work-environment">‘A Rewarding Work Environment’</h2>



<p>In the wake of so many studio closures and layoffs, it’s nice to see that FromSoftware is flourishing, recognising the need to reward workers and foster a positive working environment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At FromSoftware, we strive to make games that convey emotion, create value, and inspire joy. To this end, we are working towards stable income and a rewarding work environment where our employees can apply themselves to development. The increase in base and starting salaries is one implementation of this policy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was a few months back that FromSoft’s president, Hidetaka Miyazaki, spoke strongly about the waves of redundancies that have been slowly chipping away at the industry for almost two years:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Speaking to myself and this company, I want to say that this is not something I would wish on the staff at FromSoftware in a million years … While we can’t say 100%—we can’t say with complete certainty what the future’s going to hold for From and Kadokawa—at least as long as this company is my responsibility, that’s something I would not let happen.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier this year, FromSoftware released Shadow of the Erdtree, the first major expansion for Elden Ring, and it became an overnight sensation. It brought hundreds of thousands of players back to the game, stormed up sales and streaming charts, and reestablished why Elden Ring is considered one of the greatest games ever made.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Entering Toluca Prison is one of the more unsettling and strange moments of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2</a>, and that disturbing vibe is amplified early on when you find yourself trapped in a room filled with bugs, with a keypad locking the door and barring your exit.</p><p dir="ltr">The only way to escape this room is by punching in the right code on the door's keypad, but finding the code can be difficult--especially as the place periodically fills with bugs you'll need to smash if you want to keep them from attacking you. The room represents an excellent moment in Silent Hill 2 that can make you panic as you search for clues to open the keypad, but if you're struggling to get yourself out of that room, like we did, we're here to help.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's how you solve the puzzle of the bug-room keypad, including the solution if you don't want to find it yourself. As always, if you <em>do</em> want to find it yourself, now's the time to stop reading.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What Is The Door Code For The Bug Room Keypad In Toluca Prison?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4378076-bugroomkeypad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378076" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4378076-bugroomkeypad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378076"></a><figcaption>The blood on the keypad is a clue, but maybe not in the way you expect.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4378076-bugroomkeypad.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In other, similar rooms to the bug room, like when you need the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/silent-hill-2-remake-apartment-safe-code-in-the-blackout-room/2900-5824/" data-ref-id="2900-5824">apartment 206 safe code</a> in the Wood Side Apartments, the clues to opening the door have been hidden on the walls--and that might encourage you to whip your flashlight around desperately, looking for information. Unfortunately, there's nothing to find, but the clues you need are still there.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of looking at the walls, when you've cleared out the deadly bugs, check the keypad itself. You'll see that you need a three-digit code to get out. The other pertinent detail here is that the keypad is covered in blood. Usually, the blood stains might suggest which keys you need to press.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, for this puzzle, the situation is exactly opposite. Only three keys on the pad <em>aren't</em> covered in blood, and that's your clue. You'll also see these three digits light up when the room's lights flicker every few seconds.</p><p dir="ltr">The three keys that aren't covered in blood are 2, 3, and 9, giving you all the info you need to find the code. Unfortunately, there aren't any more clues--you just have to start punching in combinations. There are only six possible combinations if you use all three numbers.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want the answer, though, <strong>the code is 923</strong>. Type it in and the door will pop open, allowing you to continue your exploration of Brookhaven.</p><p>There are many more puzzles and confusing sections in the Silent Hill 2 remake.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-is-the-best-game-weve-made-in-a-lot-of-ways-says-bethesda-design-director/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been just a few days since Bethesda <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-releases-in-september/">released</a> the first Starfield expansion, Shattered Space, on PC and Xbox Series S|X. Meanwhile, Design Director Emil Pagliarulo <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/it-might-not-be-everyones-cup-of-tea-but-what-is-as-starfield-shattered-space-launches-bethesda-reflects-on-the-importance-of-players-speaking-their-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke to Gamesradar</a> about the studio's sci-fi IP and its place among the Bethesda portfolio.</p>
<p><em>I think, in a lot of ways, Starfield is the hardest thing Bethesda has ever done. We pushed ourselves to make something totally different. To just jam into an Xbox the biggest, richest space simulation RPG anyone could imagine. That we pulled it off makes Starfield something of a technical marvel. It's also, in a lot of ways, the best game we've ever made. But for us, most importantly, Starfield has its own unique personality and now sits right next to Fallout and Elder Scrolls.</em></p>
<p><em>It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but what is? We created a new IP from the ground up and an experience that is absolutely unique on consoles. And I'm not saying Starfield is better or worse than any other game – just different in what we offer. It's that weird Bethesda blend of immersion, action, and RPG… but also different to Bethesda's other RPGs. Starfield is developing its own unique fanbase – it's big, and it's growing. Bethesda used to feel like the studio of Elder Scrolls. Then, it was the studio you'd associate with Elder Scrolls and Fallout. Now it's Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Starfield. Bethesda Game Studios' big three.</em></p>
<p>Pagliarulo has worked on all major titles made by Bethesda Game Studios over the past twenty-plus years: The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Fallout 3, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76. As such, he is uniquely qualified to look back at the studio's previous work, although of course fans may well disagree. Starfield featured a different brand of exploration compared to what players were used to in The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, although the Shattered Space expansion is supposed to have returned to the studio's trademark style.</p>
<p>In any case, Pagliarulo also joked that the one thing Bethesda learned from making Starfield is that its fans 'really, really, really want The Elder Scrolls 6'. It should not come as a surprise, given that Skyrim was a massive hit and the best-selling game made by the studio to date. It's already been thirteen years since its release, and will be at least sixteen before The Elder Scrolls 6 launches, although production <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-officially-in-early-development-but-you-wont-hear-any-more-about-it-for-some-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> in late 2023. Shattered Space probably isn't going to be the only Starfield expansion, though, thus requiring Bethesda to split its focus somewhat.</p>

					<p>Let's all be honest: Silent Hill 2 (the original) is one of, if not the best, horror game ever made. Indeed, it's arguably one of the best games ever made, point blank. With an outstanding story, compelling enough characters, and strong visuals (for the time), but most of all, a horror game that dripped in the atmosphere and sucked you in better than even the most adept of prostitutes.</p>
<p>To say that a remake of this, one of the very few games that has genuinely put me on edge, interested me would be an understatement. Naturally, I was, even if I was worried about it being done by Konami and Bloober Team. Konami is Konami, and Bloober Team has been struggling to recreate Silent Hill in every game, not understanding that Walking Simulators aren't great and that the story from the Character's trauma only works with a good character.</p>
<p>Still, they didn't write this story; they're working with a series and game that started it. Could they get it wrong?</p>

<p>So, let's make something clear: Bloober Team has made Silent Hill 2 their own. This isn't a one-to-one remake of the original, though it remains the town we remember—or have <a href="https://www.game-cities.com/virtual-cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read about in tourist guides</a> telling us the best places to visit; that or if you've ever visited the <a href="http://www.visitsilenthill.com/index2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill Tourism Board</a>, ready to make the trip of a lifetime. They have expanded everything while making the town and the game their own. The town is also larger, and you can now go into far more buildings, even ones not core to the story, with new areas added to the game, giving even more of a feel of exploration.</p>
<p>Exploration was always a key part of the first, despite its limited amount of "side" elements, simply due to the time it was released. Here, you can break into shops, enter several buildings once locked off, find more notes and lore about the town's inhabitants, and sometimes extra resources. However, I won't say it will always be to your benefit. I once went exploring and found three health potions and maybe six handgun bullets - I used two health potions and maybe all six of the bullets to get myself back out. Granted, the lovely notes about death, despair, and trying to escape the town were good reads.</p>
<p>You'll also find more little puzzles, for lack of a better word. Very early on, you'll find a mini-market; the front door is locked, but the side door has a keypad. There are spoilers here, but it's nothing major - You can also find a corpse with a note on it. This person tried numbers 0000 to 4014 before having to run away to safety; flip the paper over, they went back and tried 4014 to 4439. Of course, that leaves 4440 to 9999 left, and you're free to try them all; the game wants you to - you'll find the person was very close.</p>
<p>I want to say that wasn't in the original, but it has been a while since I last played it. I may be wrong. Still, things like this, an added apartment building, a music store, bars, and more, add to the feeling that Silent Hill 2 is a town that has seen better days. Much like Jaywick, the coast isn't enough to make this a visitor's hotspot, <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2024-06-04/farages-party-on-the-pier-launch-proves-a-surprise-to-seaside-attraction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not when horrors brought from the worst minds roam the streets</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Silent-Hill-2-Review-03-Notes-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Now, I should clarify something before I continue. Silent Hill 2 (the original) is in my top ten "best games ever" list and at the top of my best horror games ever list. I also have a lot of nostalgia for it, and I've already started this review by saying what I was concerned about coming in. So let's talk more about the town, and let's talk about what else stood Silent Hill 2 apart, and being honest, stands this apart: Atmosphere.</p>
<p>The Silent Hill 2 HD Collection, released twelve years ago, failed due to its lack of atmosphere, which came from the draw-distance being pushed right back and killing the fog. It could have been the case here, but it isn't. Another worry about modern games is that the polish almost entirely kills the jankiness that sets older horror games apart, too; I'm going to say something I didn't think I would have said before playing this: Bloober Team have succeeded admirably.</p>
<p>The fog is impressive; it feels like you're <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884328/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Jane, also in Maine</a>. More appropriately, it feels like Silent Hill, and it's very successful in continuously maintaining a foreboding atmosphere. You still have the radio to alert you when enemies are nearby, but even this isn't the tool it once was - again, memory may be failing - but here you have little bugs that keep your radio going, helping to set you on edge further. You're looking for something to attack you, but it's a creeper.</p>
<p>Then you have the Otherworld. Adding to what is already an ominous world is just that bit extra. Here, everything is decaying, monsters are a bit more dangerous, and dear god, do I find myself on edge here. It's no word of a lie when I say that moving from the Otherworld into regular old Silent Hill gave me genuine relief; I felt safer. I was safer, but I still wasn't - but when a game that already has you thinking, "What's next?" has you sigh of relief that the evil world has gone to sleep for a while, you know it's doing something right.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Silent-Hill-2-Review-04-Triangle-Man-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I've mentioned that Silent Hill 2's enemies get more challenging in the Otherworld, and that is the case, so let's touch upon combat itself now - gameplay and movement in general, too. This takes the free-camera over-the-shoulder third-person that seems mandatory in horror games now, and I would honestly argue it's for the better. While the fixed camera perspectives can work to add a sense of being watched (oddly, by you), a sort of detached feeling, the atmosphere is kept with the current camera, but you have more freedom to see and feel the world around you. It's also highly responsive, and while it doesn't have the jank in movement, you still don't feel like a super soldier.</p>
<p>No, running is still a strong option when you find yourself in potential combat. Indeed, running is the option more often than not; the alternative will leave you wasting valuable resources you can hardly spare. Now, I will say that it is easier than the original thanks to the responsive controls, the handy dodge feature, and a few more resources thanks to the larger world. This is particularly true, as mentioned, in the Otherworld. Enemies not only seem to deal more damage and are more aggressive, but they also have extra attacks or at least extra effects, meaning how you tackle them has to change. It all makes combat a bit more tactical.</p>
<p>There's also a feeling of weight to it. When swinging a melee weapon, from a board to a steel pipe, it feels like you're swinging into a mass of flesh. As mentioned, you don't feel like a super soldier. Enemies take a good number of swings to take down, and I may be wrong, but James feels like he slows down during multiple attacks, and I've found myself getting hit when I've overreached. Shooting, as well, will take a few bullets to take an enemy down, and your accuracy isn't perfect, even within that reticle; plus, you're going to have some human error when enemies are closing in.</p>
<p>However, I must admit two small things stand out as not great; sometimes, you will be grappled by an enemy and have to mash X to get away. Now, it's far from an unusual mechanic, and you could argue that mashing a button in a horror game because you're being that is somewhat fitting, but it just doesn't feel like "Silent Hill". The other, which is small, is that the game cheats - we've all seen it where what would be enemies are laid on the floor, seemingly dead. Some are, and others pop up. Now, I've played more than enough games, and I give some of them a swing to see if they'll jump up in disgust that I would do such a thing rather than ambush me. They don't jump up but come to life when I open a door. No, they were dead; the door is not a door of resurrection.</p>
<p>What this is to say is that the combat in Silent Hill 2 is genuinely great. This is particularly so when you come to the bosses, who offer a good level of challenge and are very much in keeping with the game's theme. I will admit that my playthrough (I've only played through once so far, due to time constraints) has been on both normal combat and normal puzzle, so there's a solid chance that on hard, you'll find yourself pressed. On normal, I felt reasonably challenged, but never at a complete absence of resources due to using them all because a nurse gave me a painful priapism.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Silent-Hill-2-Review-05-Fanservice-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Let's talk sexy now. Suppose you have ever had the misfortune of visiting the internet. In that case, you already know the outrage over the nurses not having double D's like Debbie in Dallas and that Maria isn't as sexualised. Those who care about the creator's vision will also know that the current designs of a more appropriately chested nurse monster and a more subtle Maria are faithful to Masahiro Ito's original ideas. I'm going to say right now, aesthetically - not just in the sense of the fog mentioned above - Silent Hill 2 is fantastic.</p>
<p>James, Maria, Eddie, Pyramid Head, the Mannequin. Everything looks fantastic. Of course, modern technology helps, but it's more than that: the designs work in the world we're presented with, and the game isn't afraid to give you that little tease of what is to come or even what once was. A few easter eggs or bits of foreshadowing made me smile. The environment, the buildings you enter, and everything else feel like a town that was lived in and has gone to hell.</p>
<p>It all loops us back to the start, where I can do nothing but praise the atmosphere, which is helped by the immersion this brings. Even something as simple as when walking down the street, you can see some ammo or a health potion through a car window; smash that car window, and you can reach in to get the goodies. Other features include animations like James pulling out the map and a pen to mark a point of interest as you encounter it. They aren't huge features, but all the small things make it believable.</p>
<p>Even something as small as blood appearing on James' jacket when he's damaged really helps. Plus, it circles back around to the combat and the exploration to find more resources, such as healing items. Having a red haze, akin to shooters, to show your damage is standard, but it can be removed. For immersion, I would.</p>

<p>Add an excellent soundtrack, which accentuates every part of the game, and you have something special. Which, I must admit, is what I think this remake of Silent Hill 2 is. Much like the Resident Evil remakes, this has brought a legend of the Survival Horror genre into the modern age. Most importantly, it's done it while managing not to sacrifice what made the original great.</p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 will take roughly double the length of time to complete than the original, though there is an achievement to complete the game in less than ten hours. That's your speedrun objective. My one completed playthrough took over twenty hours because I am an explorer, and I backtracked a little because now and then, the next step isn't clear. In addition, and this is all I'm allowed to tell you, under punishment of exile to Silent Hill, additional endings have been added to the game, giving even more replay value.</p>
<p>So, shall I succinctly finish this? Silent Hill 2 is scary, atmospheric, polished, and fun (or as fun as a game like this can be). It is great, the best game by the Bloober Team, and proof that, somewhere in the organisation, someone in Konami knows what needs to be done, and they must be nurtured.</p>

<p>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-shattered-space-review.1000329/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>After the fast-travel extravaganza that was Starfield’s base campaign, I very much approve of the way its Shattered Space DLC course-corrects to make the new Va’ruun homeworld location feel much more like Bethesda’s previous open worlds. This planet is host to a substantial chunk of new quest content revolving around a long-winded but not uninteresting story about a futuristic theocracy that dangerously mingles science and religion despite their obvious conflict. That said, this first expansion is not terribly ambitious, either. It doesn’t introduce any significant new features that refresh anything you’ll do once you hop in your ship and leave this planet in a way similar to, say, the Dragonborn expansion did for Skyrim. Not every expansion can be so bold, of course, but those that aren’t miss an opportunity to leave a lasting, revitalizing mark on a replay of a big RPG like this, and limit themselves to a flash in the pan.</p><p>After dusting off my save, my level 46 Starborn passed through the Unity, grabbed Sarah from the Constellation Lodge, ran through the Mantis mission to score a ship, did a couple of temples, and then dove into the DLC – which <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/starfield-how-to-start-the-shattered-space-expansion">turned out to be easy to find</a> because it shows up the next time you go artifact hunting. The ominously spooky space station you begin on makes some good use of zero-G combat by adding glowing blue walls that, if you’re propelled backwards into them by gunfire, both deal damage and disorientingly teleport you, so you’ve got to be aware of what’s behind you when you open fire. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That’s where we’re introduced to the Phantom menace: these new enemies aren’t ghosts, but their spooky blue energy field and glowing eyes sure makes them look the part (and easy to spot from a distance) until it dissipates when you kill them, which is a notably cool effect. They can be both novel and annoying to fight: Not only are they often high level and thus pretty bullet spongey, they can teleport at will to both reposition when you’ve drawn a bead on them and also land right behind you with a big honkin’ knife. Listening for the whoosh sound effect of one popping into and out of existence can be your only warning before your health bar takes a big hit (especially a little later on when you might turn around and see the local equivalent of a Terrormorph tapping on your shoulder).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That’s where we’re introduced to the Phantom menace.</p></div><p>The floaty part doesn’t overstay its welcome, and when you get your boots back on the ground it’s not long before you’re whisked to the Va’ruun homeworld, which was kept conspicuously mysterious in Starfield’s campaign at launch. I did have to laugh when the notoriously reclusive and xenophobic group immediately invited me to not only walk freely among them, but fully convert to their religion. That’s very much a Bethesda thing, where everybody lets you sign up and no faction affiliations are mutually exclusive, but after playing the main campaign it was a little silly to find them so welcoming, even given the extraordinary circumstances presented.</p><p>You would not mistake their city, Dazra, for any of the others in Starfield. For one thing, the purple-tinged architecture is completely different and much more alien looking, even though the Va’ruun themselves are still human under all their face ink, and they only <em>talk</em> like they’re vampires on What We Do in the Shadows. (Completing the main quest lets you use their buildings in your own settlements.) Also, half of the city was destroyed in a catastrophic accident that left a weird and twisted crater so massive you can only really get a sense of it by looking at the map (they have maps now!), and the inhabitants are still recovering from what sounds like a Thanos snap-like loss of life. It’s a compelling setting, though I will say that the surviving half of Dazra looks a little too clean and orderly to really sell this as a disaster zone, even though it’s all anybody’s talking about.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>None of this lore will be on the test, and it’s no match for a good blaster at your side.</p></div><p>Getting to know the Va’ruun and the factions within its weird space theocracy obviously means listening to a high dose of religious lore involving a large serpent. It’s all written and delivered up to Bethesda’s standards, but it can be a lot when you’re staying immersed in it for this long. Don’t worry, though – none of this will be on the test, and in the long run it’s no match for a good blaster at your side. </p><p>Your quest to bring the three factions together to solve the ongoing crisis takes place entirely in Dazra’s surrounding region, which is notably different from the other main faction quest cities. Rather than sending you to your ship to zip off to errands on other planets, once you reach the Va’ruun homeworld you’re never required to travel anywhere else – not even flying to another landing zone on the same planet – to complete every single quest you can find there. The only time I left in the 12 hours it took to beat the main story and every major sidequest I came across was when I hopped in my Razorleaf to go shopping in the Settled Systems for healing items, which are hard to come by on this planet without sleeping for days at a time waiting for the local doctor to restock. (Ironically, if you took the Serpent’s Embrace trait that says you grew up practicing the Va’ruun religion, your character will suffer a stat penalty for not doing grav jumps frequently enough.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We see multiple meaningful locations on the same chunk of extraterrestrial real estate.</p></div><p>Instead, you either drive the recently patched-in rover car to each quest location around the Dazra or just hoof it the old-fashioned way, which I found refreshing. Most of the main Starfield quests felt detached and disjointed because of all the planet-hopping and fast-traveling to new locations, but here we get a more traditional Bethesda sense of place and continuity. We see multiple meaningful locations existing on the same near-seamless chunk of extraterrestrial real estate instead of one important thing and a bunch of procedurally generated filler. I also like how the crater is filled with gravity distortion bubbles, which I actually wish were used more often to really distinguish this planet from others and let you float to otherwise unreachable areas.</p><p>On the other hand, this down-to-earth approach makes Shattered Space extremely focused in the way it expands on Starfield, to the point where there is zero use of interstellar travel or space combat. As far as I can tell there’s absolutely nothing added for spacefarers other than now you have a way to legitimately acquire Va’ruun ships instead of stealing them from Zealots who attack you in space. That’s fine, as an expansion doesn’t always have to meaningfully expand every aspect of a game – but I was surprised that there wasn’t at least a token feature thrown in for space jockeys in an expansion with “space” in the title.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s nothing wrong with a celebrated band playing the hits.</p></div><p>Sure, the majority of these quests feel like Starfield-flavored rewrites of things I’ve done before in Fallout or Elder Scrolls games, but there’s nothing wrong with a celebrated band playing the hits. Track down the fugitive and decide whether to kill him or help him fake his death? Check. Root out the traitor diverting emergency supplies to the Zealots and decide whether to turn them in or take a bribe? Check. Rescue the hostages and decide whether to double-cross someone? Check. </p><p>As far as loot goes, there are a handful of new weapons to get your hands on, and although they’re mostly just the Va’ruun’s take on weapon types we already have, there’s nothing to dislike about more variety, both in their bulky visual design and their splashy energy effects. There are also some <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/starfield-shattered-space-how-to-use-vortex-shards">craftable grenades</a> you can make out of pieces of defeated Phantoms. Again, though, it’s a little disappointing that they’re unlikely to change much about the way you’ll play when you leave this planet.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Dan's favorite planet-hopping space games</h3></p></div><p>Since the mainstream Va’ruun themselves turn out to be generally alright folks, just as Andreja promised, you don’t spend much time shooting at them. Instead, there are a fair number of Zealots (including a very beefy new armored melee type) and the occasional generic spacers to fight in order to mix things up from tangling with Phantoms. I usually play on hard difficulty because normal is a cakewalk, and nearly everything was very manageable in Shattered Space. I say “nearly” because I did end up turning it back down to normal for the final battle – but that was mostly so I didn’t have to buy every health pack in the Settled Systems before attempting it again, because not taking damage in that firefight is quite tricky.</p><p>Finally, I have to give Shattered Space a little credit for giving me a good reason to return to Starfield and get a feel for how it works with all of the improvements Bethesda’s made in the past year. The maps and the car really do make a substantial difference in inconveniences I had to overcome to enjoy the main campaign, and even though the inventory is still bad and the temples remain maddeningly repetitive (and with a Bethesda game, it should go without saying there are still plenty of bugs, new and old) those improvements have gone a long way toward making this a game I’m glad I took the time to revisit.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
