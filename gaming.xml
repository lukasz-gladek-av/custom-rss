Even without those juggernauts, games like Monster Hunter Wilds and Assassin's Creed Shadows have already set the tone for what should be another great year for new games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through the first quarter of the year, 18 games have earned a spot on this list, which compiles every game and expansion released in 2025 that received a review score of 8 or higher from IGN. These are IGN's best video games of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This list will be updated as new releases receive qualifying review scores.</em></p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Reviewed Games 2025</h3><p>Here's our running list of the best games we reviewed in 2025. Everything scored an 8 (Great) or higher is included. Sorted from newest to oldest.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Review Score: 8 (“Great”)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>These games leave us with something outstanding to remember them by, usually novel gameplay ideas for single-player or multiplayer, clever characters and writing, noteworthy graphics and sound, or some combination thereof. If we have major complaints, there are more than enough excellent qualities to cancel them out.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> takes a flashing blade to the series’ established norms, trimming them to a more precise form in lieu of chopping them down outright. Combat is aggressive and requires more intentional parrying and skill management than in the past, and exploring the gorgeous provinces of Sengoku-period Japan is encouraged thanks to the revamped map that deemphasizes collecting icons and checking off lists. Naoe and Yasuke are well-realized and memorable protagonists, even though most of the story they drive follows pretty predictable paths. Both have unique playstyles that bolster each other’s weaknesses, but they are ultimately imbalanced by the fact that you can make use of the stealth and exploration skills of the master shinobi far more than the superhuman strength of the samurai. This isn’t the Assassin’s Creed that will change the minds of folks that never connected with the series before, but for those of us with lots of hours logged in the Animus, the sum of Shadows’ parts provide a refreshing realignment of the series that you should not skip. <em>– Jarrett Green</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Atomfall</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/atomfall-review">Atomfall</a> is a gripping survival-action adventure that takes some of the best elements of Fallout and Elden Ring, and synthesises them into its own fresh mutation. It presents a picturesque chunk of English countryside littered with alluring structures to pique and reward your curiosity, eccentric locals to meet, and absorbing mysteries to unravel, and uses classic iconography from British sci-fi and horror to consistently unsettling effect. In spite of some enemy behaviours that are occasionally less stable than a reactor in meltdown, Atomfall is a compelling, post-apocalyptic survival story that satisfyingly bends to your choices and discoveries no matter which direction you take. <em>– Tristan Ogilvie</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-review">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a> does not stray too far from what made the first one a cult hit, but it doesn’t need to. It tells a rich and poignant story about the complex nature of control on one’s self when that self is a machine that can be rebooted and hacked, finding and enriching community in the face of overwhelming odds, and expressing personhood both to oneself and to others. It’s visual novel-like presentation is heavy on reading and dice rolling, so its not exactly pulse-pounding, but the retooled character classes and stats, new crew missions, and stress mechanics provide just enough feedback and create a sense of precarity throughout that it stays engaging. <em>– Jarrett Green</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> Somehow, Donkey Kong Country Returns returned (again), but Nintendo’s third full release of this 2010 Wii platformer is almost as fresh and fun today as it was 15 years ago. DK’s satisfying, weighty movement paves the way for a challenging, momentum-based platformer that demands more skill and precision than the average Nintendo game. But it stays fun rather than frustrating thanks to incredibly impressive level design that explores every clever idea to the fullest and a ton of hidden collectibles worth tracking down. As a remaster specifically, it’s no more than a passable update, with graphics that can only really be described as “good enough” and some outdated elements that could have used more modern touches, like a lack of checkpoints during boss fights and a few obnoxious sections full of one-hit kill obstacles. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> is still a competent update and easily the best way to play one of the greatest 2D platformers Nintendo has released this century. <em>– Logan Plant</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> Propelled by a breezy and often completely bananas treasure-hunting tale, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> is a delightful spin-off that seamlessly shifts between street thuggery and skulduggery. Majima’s Sea Dog stance is one of the most fun and flexible fighting styles I’ve enjoyed in the series to date – at least in its classic, combo-based form – and I welcomed the challenge of carefully balancing my crew lineup in order to survive the many turbulent naval battles. While its overworld maps feel a little padded out with recycled island settings, Honolulu itself is jammed with unpredictable substories and overhauled activities that meant every moment of shore leave was full of surprises. Absolutely heaving with buried treasures and varied pleasures, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a consistently captivating voyage that kept my timbers shivering whether on land or at sea. <em>– Tristan Ogilvie</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> continues to smooth off the traditionally rough edges of the series in smart ways, reducing as much friction as possible that could get in the way of you grabbing any of its exceptionally fun weapons and planting them firmly in a monster’s hide. But in that quest to make Monster Hunter more approachable, Wilds has carved a little too close to the bone in some places, trimming its challenge back so much that I barely needed to dig into its in-depth equipment system at all this time to become an apex predator. Its more flexible combat is some of the most fun I’ve had with the series, but like the blustering lighting storms of its gorgeous desert, it'll burns brightly but briefly until Capcom unleashes some real endgame beasts to challenge us. <em>– Tom Marks</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-review">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> is neither Ninja Gaiden 2 nor Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, but instead a secret third thing that mixes both versions together to create something that is wholly unique and by far the most beautiful version of this excellent action game yet. While I have a hard time calling it the definitive release because I prefer the original’s “more dudes who are more aggressive but die faster” approach, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is a definite improvement over the Sigma 2 release, fixes several long-standing issues, and unlike the original, isn’t trapped on the Xbox 360. It isn't the version I was hoping for (get on it, modders), but it is still an incredible game and I'm happy it exists. If this really is it for Ninja Gaiden 2, it will at least go out on a high note. This trip through time reminded me that while you can't go home again, and nothing will ever truly be like it was, that doesn't mean something can't still be beautiful. Ninja Gaiden 2 is remarkable, even with its flaws, and it's good to finally have it back in Black. <em>– Will Borger</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">PGA Tour 2K25</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> With substantial changes to how it looks and plays, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pga-tour-2k25-review">PGA Tour 2K25</a> feels like a different game from its predecessor. The new swing mechanics, paired with the significantly improved graphics, makes for a much more realistic ambiance, even with a lethargic performance by the announcing team. The highly customizable MyCareer campaign mode shines as one of the most enjoyable parts even though it has a tacked-on personality system, occasional unnecessary connectivity issues, and of course microtransactions. PGA Tour 2K25 is still a few strokes behind EA Sports PGA Tour as the best golfing simulator around, but if it continues to improve like this with each new iteration, we may see it close that gap relatively soon. <em>– Andrew McMahon</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rift of the NecroDancer</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> I could wear out my keyboard slapping arrow keys to the beat and jamming in my seat to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rift-of-the-necrodancer-review">Rift of the NecroDancer</a>’s excellent soundtrack, fervently chasing down a perfect run of a song for hours. Whether I was fighting stuffy puppet masters, rhythmically ridding the world of monsters, or just waddling around in a silly mole costume, it provides many excellent flavors of arcade-style rhythm action. Even though this “Greatest Hits” anthology isn’t as focused or Earth-shattering as Brace Yourself Games’ genre-bending debut album, it still continually surprised and delighted me by providing clever twists on time-tested mechanics. <em>– Charlie Wacholz</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tokyo Xtreme Racer (Early Access)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tokyo-xtreme-racer-early-access-review">Tokyo Xtreme Racer</a> is an infectiously addictive time capsule of a racing game that needs little more than a bit of menu refinement and some major aggression injected into its sound to really soup it up and prep it for even more classic Japanese cars to race in and against. In fact, it’s already well worth its early access asking price. It’s narrow in scope, but its highway battle hook makes it hard to put down, and its total lack of modern baggage like microtransactions and tacked-on multiplayer is outright refreshing. <em>– Luke Reilly</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">WWE 2K25</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> A couple of microtransaction-fueled missteps aside, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-review">WWE 2K25</a> is really the best wrestling game since… WWE 2K24, which was also pretty great. It looks fantastic, still feels good, and there’s a lot of it, including small but welcome updates like intergender matches or bigger updates like the new MyRise and Showcase modes. It’s an upscale wrestling buffet, if you will: It’s pretty scrumptious, there's a wide selection of dishes on the table, and you could spend an awful lot of time in the squared circle if you’re not careful. Speaking of, I need to get back to it. I have some more Showcase things to unlock, Universe is calling my name, and… well, you get the idea. <em>– Will Borger</em></p><h2 data-cy="title2">Review Score: 9 (“Amazing”)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We enthusiastically recommend that you add these games to your to-play list. If we call a game Amazing, that means something about it seriously impressed us, whether it’s an inspired new idea or an exceptional take on an old one. We expect to look back at it as one of the highlights of its time and genre.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> If <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-review">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> is meant to be a new beginning, it’s one that gets off to a masterful start. It doesn’t just have the largest amount of enemies the series has thrown on screen at once, it also deepens its combat, improves its storytelling without getting in the way of the action, and provides a healthy amount of replayability and postgame content – all while looking better than ever. Your amnesiac hero is a bit too much of a blank slate at times, but the impressive ensemble cast made this story sing as I grew to care about the characters around him, big and small. Origins is both a great entry point for newcomers and a triumphant return for veterans like me who felt the last few entries had become stale or missed the mark. It feels like the series I once loved is finally back. <em>– Jada Griffin</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> In many ways, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> feels like it’s picked up and run with the reactive first-person RPG torch that Bethesda left lying in the mud years ago in pursuit of a broader audience. And it has excellent melee combat, which The Elder Scrolls never came close to even at its peak. Sometimes it's not sure if it wants to be a cinematic tale about a specific guy going on a specific adventure or a truly dynamic open-world sandbox packed with interesting and varied side quests, and that can lead to a few immersion-shattering conflicts. But most of the time, leaning into one doesn't get in the way of the other, and you’re free to go on any of its many optional adventures along the way to a thought-provoking and rousing finale for the main plot. I was delighted to get lost in its world, and it will be a long time before I forget its exceptional story. <em>– Leana Hafer</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">MLB The Show 25</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> MLB The Show remains one of the best sports series around. The new upgrade system  and the amateur portion of your player’s journey have reinvigorated Road To The Show, while the shift away from Sets and Seasons has righted Diamond Dynasty’s biggest wrong. While it’s a bit of a bummer that the Storylines feature isn’t living up to its full potential, it remains a worthwhile and important inclusion that has reach beyond the game of baseball. All the small touches, such as updated infielder reactions and new quick time events like the swim move, have the on-field action in a great place, too. It’s not always easy for an annual franchise to justify the move to a new entry, but in the case of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-review">MLB The Show 25</a>, it does more than enough to make me glad it has arrived. <em>– Justin Koreis</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Split Fiction</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> An expertly crafted and absorbing co-op adventure that pinballs from one genre extreme to another, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction</a> is a rollercoaster of gameplay ideas and styles that are usually discarded as quickly as they’re introduced. This keeps it fabulously fresh for its full, 14-hour duration. With no idea sticking around long enough to get stale before making way for the next, it’s a victory of imagination and restraint in equal measure. Hazelight may have been rewriting the co-op rule book for a decade now, but Split Fiction is a new chapter that you (and a partner) cannot miss. <em>– Luke Reilly</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Two Point Museum</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/two-point-museum-review">Two Point Museum</a> is a rewarding, deep, challenging, and highly entertaining tycoon game that demonstrates Two Point Studios has really hit its groove with this third iteration of the idea. The variety of different exhibits to unlock and level up, the thrill of discovering new expedition maps, and the array of clever and easy-to-use management tools make designing and running a museum joyful and consistently rewarding. I've sunk more than 40 hours into it already and I could easily see doubling that without running out of stuff to do. Call the curator. They're really going to want to take a look at this. <em>– Leana Hafer</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Wanderstop</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> Every inch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wanderstop-review">Wanderstop</a> pushes the conventions you’d expect of similarly wholesome games. Its vibrant colors, quirky characters, and enchanting music are used to tell a compelling story that forces you to grapple with both its lead character's insecurities as well as your own. It’s a powerful adventure not just about burn out, but about how deeply painful it is to free ourselves from coping mechanisms that may have previously kept us secure. At the same time, Wanderstop’s simple but satisfying tea brewing experimentation serves as a safe and entertaining space to do that deep digging. There aren’t many games like Wanderstop out there currently, but for all our sakes, I hope there will be soon. <em>– Shailyn Cotten</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>From our review:</strong> Xenoblade Chronicles X was already one of the Wii U’s best games, and this Definitive Edition has escaped the destruction of its old home like the White Whale and settled down nicely on Switch. The quality-of-life improvements here are enough to justify another trip to Mira alone for veteran players, and it’s the perfect opportunity for newcomers to explore its beautiful landscapes for themselves. Its combat systems are deep and engaging, and the massive open world never got old to run, jump, or fly across. Its main story may not quite live up to the standards of the series, but a likable cast of characters and plenty of compelling side missions mean <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> is still an adventure worth writing back home about. <em>– George Yang</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jordan covers games, shows, and movies as a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nightdive Studios, a company known for efforts in updating and preserving outdated video games, has revealed that it would like to start remastering games from the PS3 and Xbox 360 era.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-stand-ready-nightdive-says-it-wants-to-start-remastering-xbox-360-and-ps3-era-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, studio head Stephen Kick and director of business development Larry Kuperman said that they want to look at games that were only released on PS3 and Xbox 360 for potential remasters. When taking into consideration which games that could be remastered, Kuperman said that there are many factors that come into play.</p><p>These include things like having access to the game's source code and original assets, as well as examining what consoles the game currently lives on. Games that are exclusive to one console, for example, might be more in need of a refresh. This is what makes tackling PS3 and Xbox 360 era titles such an exciting prospect.</p><p>Kick brought up Free Radical Design and Ubisoft's 2008 PS3 exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/haze-review/1900-6191308/" data-ref-id="1900-6191308">Haze</a>. He explained that Nightdive would approach the developers about remastering their games and ask them what they'd do differently if they had the chance and a larger budget.</p><p>Additionally, bringing over older games to new hardware clears up issues like stuttering frame rates and long load times that occurred on their original platforms. In addition to giving players easier access to older games, bringing over old titles to new hardware clears up issues like stuttering frame rates and long load times that occurred on their original platforms. Despite this, however, there has been some hesitancy around remastering PS3 games, as they can also prove difficult due to its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remember-when-ps3-almost-lost-the-console-race/1100-6479595/" data-ref-id="1100-6479595">unique system architecture</a>. However, Nightdive says that it's up for the challenge.</p><p>"If we get to that, or I should say, when, we get to the PS3 era games, it will be a challenge that we have to face," Kick explained. "But I think that we’ve had enough experience to where we can do a serviceable job on a PS3 remaster."</p><p>In other Nightdive Studios news, Kuperman recently said that an update regarding the development of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-hope-for-system-shock-3-isnt-lost-yet/1100-6530444/" data-ref-id="1100-6530444">System Shock 3</a> could come sometime within the next year.</p>

            <p>
Members of the ZeniMax Workers United union - which is made up of more than 300 quality assurance workers across ZeniMax Studios - has "overwhelmingly" voted to authorise union leadership to call for a strike if no resolution is reached following two years of unsuccessful contract negotiations with Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
ZeniMax Workers United, which is part of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-recognises-300-person-zenimax-testers-union">first union ever to be voluntarily recognised by Microsoft in 2023</a>. At the time, members - who've worked on the likes of Fallout, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, and Doom - said they'd push to end sudden periods of crunch, unfair pay, and a lack of growth opportunities within the company.
</p>
<p>
But two years on, ZeniMax Workers United says it's still to successfully negotiate a first contract. According to the union, its bargaining committee has so far failed to reach an agreement with Microsoft over "better wages, workplace improvements, and key concerns, including a lack of remote work options and the company's replacement of in-house quality assurance work with outsourced labour without notifying the union."
</p>
<p>
Last December <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hundreds-of-zenimax-workers-strike-over-microsoft-outsourcing-remote-work-policies">saw union members in Maryland and Texas stage a one-day walkout</a> amid concerns around Microsoft's outsourcing and its return-to-office policies, and the CWA additionally filed an unfair labour practice charge against Microsoft for unilaterally outsourcing work. However, that action could potentially escalate now more than 94 percent of ZeniMax Workers United members have voted to authorise union leadership to call for a strike if contract negotiations fail to reach a resolution.
</p>
<p>
"Paying your employees a liveable wage as a multi-trillion dollar company is the least they could be doing," union member and associate QA tester Aubrey Litchfield said in an <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft">statement companying today's news</a>. "However when addressed at the bargaining table, Microsoft acts as though we're asking for too much. Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time. Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We've released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?".
</p>
<p>
"Underpayment and costly [return-to-office] initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause," union member and senior QA tester Zachary Armstrong added, "because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment... If Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they're unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labour provides to our games, we'll be showing them just how valuable our labour is."
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640423/zenimax-union-cwa-strike-authorization-vote">statement provided to The Verge</a> in response to today's union announcement, Microsoft spokesperson Delaney Simmons insisted the company was "deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams' contributions." Simmons  also claimed "substantial progress" had been made over the course of the negotiations, and that "tentative agreements [had been reached] on a majority of the topics at the table".
</p>
<p>
"We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair," Simmons continued. "If accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company's hybrid model of three days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations."
</p>
<p>
ZeniMax Workers United is just one of an increasing number of video game unions successfully established in the last few years, with workers at the likes of Activision, Blizzard, and Sega also now represented by unions. Additionally, last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/communications-workers-of-america-announces-industry-wide-united-videogame-workers-union">saw the CWA announce the industry-wide United Videogame Workers</a> - a direct-join union open to all freelance or full-time video game industry workers in the US or Canada.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-ambient-magic-fantasy-tolkein-medieval<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At three in the morning on Sunday night, there was a partial solar eclipse in Aries, and then a day later, Neptune entered Aries for the first time in 150 years. As the stars enter Aries, a sign of decisive action, I am preparing myself to take greater charge of my own destiny. That Sunday night, before these transits started, I found myself in the back room of a bar in Ridgewood, wearing elf ears and bobbing my head to the sounds of a synthesized glockenspiel.</p><p>Dungeon synth is a small but enthusiastic micro genre of ambient synth music that I stumbled onto through a quirk of the YouTube algorithm. I had been listening to a cover of “Birds of a Feather” by Billie Eillish re-imagined as a song by a medieval bard when the next video, a dungeon synth song, transported me even further into fantasy. I described it to my friend who attended this show with me as sounding like medieval chamber music filtered through an aged 90s VHS tape. It is often video game adjacent—the headliner was a band called Quest Master—but just as often the music references the stories of King Arthur, witchcraft, and especially the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. All the musical acts that performed on Sunday night did so with a sense of ritual: no stage banter, no introductions, just poring over their synthesizers, surrounded by fog and electric candles, and then disappearing into the dead of night.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Source: Gita Jackson</figcaption></figure><p>Most of the acts had some level of props or visual component to their set. <a href="https://steamingwoodlands.bandcamp.com/album/the-melancholic-eons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steaming Woodlands</a> appeared on a sparse stage, with electric candelabras on the table next to his synthesizers. <a href="https://malfet.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Malfet</a> wore a hooded cloak and walked onto the stage jangling bells tied to a rope, and later rang a singing bowl; he played his entire set in front of a video collage combining images of forest nature with images of witches and Arthurian myth. I distinctly remember watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_of_Shalott_(painting)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">J.M. Waterhouse’s painting <em>The Lady of Shalott</em></a><em> </em>emerge from a recording of a fairy ring as I let the music envelop me.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://fief.bandcamp.com/album/moonbeams-in-the-vestibule-b-w-portcullis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fief</a>, wearing chainmail over his shoulders and aviator sunglasses, played in a corner of the venue, creating a tavern-like atmosphere. As his synthesized glockenspiel broke out into a jaunty tune, the whole venue stomped in rhythm to the beat. <a href="https://questmaster.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quest Master</a> was loud, each new beat flowing into the next like a stream threatening to carry me away, the bass reverberated throughout my body, a video playing behind him that soared through waterfalls and mountains as I succumbed to a kind of trance.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Malfet - Northeast Dungeon Siege MMXXI" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fV2K8DEEzyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Just like the <a href="https://www.chani.com/blogs/your-guide-to-neptune-in-aries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transit of Neptune from Pisces into Aries</a>, this night felt transformative for me. TV Eye, the venue where these groups all played, is a small venue in Ridgewood, Queens that was absolutely packed to the brim with people just as enthusiastic about listening to medieval bangers as I was. Many of them were also in costume. I met a fan dressed in a chainmail hood, with a sword strapped to his back and a dead orc’s head made of plastic hanging from a rope on his belt. As the night went on, more and more people wearing chainmail and flower crowns joined the crowd. I was wearing elf ears for the very first time, and as I walked out of the bathroom a fellow patron complimented them. I hadn’t been to a show this intimate and packed since before 2020, when going to a small concert at a bar became a life-threatening activity.</p><p><a href="https://dungeon-synth.neocities.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dungeon synth isn’t a new genre</a>—it’s an offshoot from black metal with some of the earliest recordings dating back to the 90s—but it has grown significantly in the past few years. At the same time as the show in Ridgewood, there was a small dungeon synth festival occurring in Massachusetts called <a href="https://northeastdungeonsiege.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Northeast Dungeon Siege</a>. The two headlining groups, Fief and Quest Master, had played a set at that festival earlier that day. This summer there will be another <a href="https://texasdungeonsynth.com/pages/texas-dungeon-siege" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dungeon synth festival in Texas</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>My friend Ryan, who attended the show wearing a newly purchased cloak, told me that last year he had seen Quest Master and only one person dressed up. While those of us dressed as <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> party members were in the minority, there was a sense in the venue this year that yes, this was an acceptable place to bring out your Renaissance Faire wardrobe. I described it as “LARPing, but for people who fuck,” which was mostly a joke. But there did appear to be a spirit of magic and renewal in the room with us as the bands played. Ryan, just before the lights dimmed and Fief began playing, also called the genre “black metal, but for people who believe in magic.”</p><figure><figcaption>Source: Gita Jackson</figcaption></figure><p>The juxtaposition of synthesizers and bardic melodies suggest <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/whose-fantasy-is-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not a return to an imaginary past</a>, but a new age of myth and magic. It’s the same feeling I get when I see the way that <em>Elden Ring</em> reframes Celtic mythology through the lens of a Japanese role playing game. Unlike the way that fascists reclaim the story of King Arthur and pre-Christian mysticism, dungeon synth does not—cannot—pretend that this is a pure place of tradition that we are coming back to. This is a newer form of witchcraft, one that makes room for the ways that technology can give us new forms of connection and understanding. One of the people I met on Sunday shared my story of stumbling across dungeon synth music through the YouTube algorithm. It also turned out that he’d responded to a post on Reddit about <a href="https://theticketing.co/e/dungeonsynth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an upcoming dungeon synth show in a converted church</a> that a friend of a friend is putting on.</p><p>Supposedly, the transit of the planet Neptune into Aries from Pisces will feel like waking from a collective dream. The last time this happened, America broke out into the Civil War, a conflict that has not truly been resolved. Dungeon synth is a genre that exploded under the dreaminess of Neptune in Pisces—unsurprisingly, a lot of people decided to fiddle around with synthesizers during the global COVID-19 pandemic. But Aries brings these dreams into reality, takes them from the ephemeral space of the internet and into the flesh. Wearing my elf ears and my cardigan adorned with mushrooms, I let this music transport me into a new era—one not marked by my fear of the past but by my eagerness for the future.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-awards-deck-nine-laid-off-developers-life-is-strange-double-exposure"><h3>Deck Nine Takes Back GDC Award From Laid-Off Devs After Failing To Send Anyone To Accept It</h3></a><p>"I keep thinking about all of the opportunities that were denied to us because of our exclusion"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-next-major-change-could-drastically-alter-how-bosses-work.1151517/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-next-major-change-bosses/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov fans are neck-deep in the Labyrinth, an all-new map added as a surprise during the latest in-game event. It has been dubbed one of the best things Battlestate Games has ever done, and despite it being an insane challenge, it has pleased a vast portion of the player base.</p>



<p>Following the successful rollout of the Labyrinth event, the next major Escape from Tarkov change could be something very different and <strong>seriously </strong>drastic. It doesn’t <strong>seem like </strong>it could be an April Fool’s joke, either.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bold-changes">Bold Changes</h2>



<p>On the Tarkov community forum, user ‘my89user’ made a suggestion a week ago about <a href="https://tarkov.community/posts/2407/boss-spawn-rotation-and-hot-loot-rotation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">how bosses and loot could work</a>. They proposed a rotating schedule that would see certain maps adopt a 100% boss spawn rate for a few days before rotating to the next map, and so on.</p>



<p>They also proposed that ‘hot loot’ map rotations could be introduced as well. Each week, a designated map would have a 50% increased loot pool for high-value items.</p>



<p>By doing this, the hope is that certain maps become targets for players more focused on PvP and high XP runs, while other maps would quiet down and offer a lower chance of running into bosses and geared players.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, the ‘Lead of Game Design’ accepted the suggestion as ‘Planned’ and said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Good idea, I think we will do it after the ‘Labyrinth’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The suggestion had secured 441 votes before it was accepted by the team at Battlestate Games, and the feedback was mostly positive.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is in a tentative place right now. It’s no big secret that the game still has an issue with cheaters, but the Labyrinth event has been such a rampant success that players have overlooked that for the time being.</p>



<p>In a couple of months, we’ll likely be shaping up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/">next <strong>wipe</strong> in Tarkov</a>. That doesn’t affect me, though, as I’m a PvE main… Yes, <em>I know</em>.</p>



<p>Do you think this change would be a win in Escape from Tarkov? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, the CEO of the developer behind Helldivers 2 sat down to talk about the last year of success, growth, and the struggles that the game went through to hit lofty peaks. Arrowhead had a tumultuous year in 2024, and from a stint of review bombing to being nominated for prestigious awards, it was nothing short of an intense twelve months.</p>



<p>It was revealed by Shams Jorjani, the CEO of Arrowhead, that an influx of ‘unintended’ players from so many different communities left the team scratching their heads over how to respond.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-different-voices-screaming">‘Different Voices Screaming’</h2>



<p>During a chat with The Game Business’ Christropher Dring, Shams Jorjani walked through the last year at Arrowhead. He stepped in to secure the CEO role less than a year ago, picking up the position when things were looking awry for Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>He explained that it was thanks to a constant stream of meaningful updates that the paltry user score of 19% was able to flip entirely to 94% in a matter of weeks. Eventually, Helldivers 2 became one of the most popular and awarded games of 2024.</p>



<p>One interesting tidbit came when Jorjani was talking about the audience that gravitated towards Helldivers 2 and how diverse it was. I can’t say for sure where he got his numbers from, but he explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We did not make Helldivers for <strong>six million Call of Duty players</strong>. We absolutely didn’t. But six million Call of Duty players bought our game. And they are interested in different things compared to, say, the audience that comes from Escape From Tarkov or Arma, which were some of our more influential games.</p>



<p>The summer of pain, or whatever we want to call it, was painful in part because it was hard for us to reconcile how to stay true to the studio fundamentals, while dealing with the business realities of having <strong>so many different voices screaming at us</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Helldivers 2 turned out to be a strong success for Arrowhead, even if it took one heck of a journey to get there. In January, it was confirmed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dev-next-game-concept/">concept for the next game</a> for the studio was being fleshed out, but nobody knows what that’ll look like.</p>

		<p>Nintendo is breaking out the Nintendo Treehouse Live for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 3rd and 4th April, bringing gameplay deep dives to the masses following the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct stream taking place tomorrow, on 2nd April.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Treehouse Live broadcasts will start at 3PM UK time – 7AM PT / 10AM ET / 4PM CEST – and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica/streams">watch both of them on YouTube</a>. It’s not clear how long they will run for through the day, but as they will be running in tandem with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">live hands on events taking place in New York and Paris</a>, we can expect them to run for several hours with numerous different segments, expanding greatly on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/tomorrows-nintendo-switch-2-direct-will-be-around-60-minutes-long-watch-it-here/">the 60-minute runtime confirmed for tomorrow’s main reveal stream</a>.</p>



<p>Both Treehouse Live broadcasts will feature hands-on gameplay of games for Nintendo Switch 2, and it’s quite likely that they will also be used to explore some of the unique features that Nintendo is introducing for the Switch 2 hardware – specifically, there’s the long-rumoured mouse functionality for the Joy-Con, and a mysterious C button on the right Joy-Con.</p>
<p>Of course, we already know one game that will be featured here, as one of the most exciting things from the January <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Nintendo Switch 2 hardware reveal</a> was the tease of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/mario-kart-9-teased-during-switch-2-reveal/">Mario Kart 9</a>. We might also see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-a-new-gameplay-trailer/">Metroid Prime 4</a> reemerge after its latest trailer from last week’s Nintendo Direct, if it’s to be a cross-gen release.</p>

<p>Beyond that, Nintendo has managed to keep a lid on many of the games and surprises that await in tomorrow’s show. Obviously, stay tuned for all the announcements coming down the large green pipe tomorrow afternoon, and keep eyes peeled for all the live hands on impressions to emerge from those public shows in New York and Paris. We’re pretty princess peachy keen to see how big a step up the Switch 2 is!</p>

<p><strong>Implausible:</strong> Long-suffering <strong>Earthbound</strong> fans have been hoping for a new game in the series (or even an official localization of <a href="https://mother3.fobby.net/">the Japan-exclusive <em>Mother 3</em></a>) for literal decades now. Personally, though, I'm hoping for a surprise revisit to the <strong>Punch-Out</strong> series, following on its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/05/classically-trained-ars-reviews-punch-out-for-the-wii/">similar surprise return on the Wii</a> in 2009.</p>

<p><strong>Likely:</strong> While a 720p screen was pretty nice in a 2017 gaming handheld, <strong>a full 1080p display</strong> is much more standard in today's high-end gaming portables. We expect Nintendo will follow this trend for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons">what looks to be a nearly 8-inch screen</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Possible:</strong> While <strong>a brighter OLED screen</strong> would be nice as a standard feature on the Switch 2, we expect Nintendo will follow <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/">the precedent of the Switch generation</a> and offer this as a pricier upgrade at some point in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Implausible:</strong> The Switch 2 would be the perfect time for Nintendo to revisit the <strong>glasses-free stereoscopic 3D</strong> that we all thought was such a revelation on the 3DS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/06/hands-on-with-the-nintendo-3ds-it-works-and-works-well/">all those years ago</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Likely:</strong> The mysterious new button labeled "C" on the Switch 2's right Joy-Con could serve as a handy way to <strong>"connect" to other players</strong>, perhaps through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/missing-nintendos-miiverse-network-check-out-this-17tb-online-archive/">a new Miiverse-style social network</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Possible:</strong> <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-switch-1-controller-second-screen-rumor/">Recent rumors</a> suggest the C button could be used to <strong>connect to a second Switch console</strong> (or the TV-connected dock) for a true dual-screen experience. That would be especially fun and useful for Wii U/DS emulation and remasters.</p>
<p><strong>Implausible:</strong> The C stands for <em>Chibi-Robo!</em> and launches a system-level mini-game focused on the miniature robot.</p>

<p><strong>Possible:</strong> Some sort of <strong>system-level achievement tracking</strong> would bring Nintendo's new console in line with a feature that the competition from Sony and Microsoft has had for decades now.</p>
<p><strong>Implausible:</strong> After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/sorry-the-switch-isnt-getting-wii-style-virtual-console-downloads/">killing it off for the Switch generation</a>, we'd love it if Nintendo <strong>brought back the Virtual Console</strong> as a way to buy permanent downloadable copies of emulated classics that will carry over across generations. Failing that, how about <strong>a revival of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/why-you-should-take-your-3ds-along-for-a-streetpass-halloween/">the 3DS's StreetPass passive social network</a></strong> for Switch 2 gamers on the go?</p>

<p>Williams' success with APX led him to create several games for Synapse Software, including the beloved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alley_Cat_(video_game)"><em>Alley Cat</em></a> and the incomprehensible fantasy masterpiece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necromancer_(video_game)"><em>Necromancer</em></a>, before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2008/05/amiga-history-part-7/">moving to the Amiga,</a> where he created the experimental <em>Mind Walker</em> and his ambitious "cultural simulation" <em>Knights of the Crystallion</em>.</p>
<p><em>Necromancer</em>, Williams' later creation for the Atari 800, plays like a fever dream—you control a druid fighting off spiders while growing magic trees and battling an undead wizard. It makes absolutely no sense by conventional standards, but it's brilliant in its otherworldliness.</p>
<p>"The first games that I did were very hard to explain to people and they just kind of bought it on faith," Williams said in a <a href="https://vgpavilion.com/mags/1989/02/yaam/yaam-interview-bill-williams/">1989 interview</a> with YAAM (Yet Another Amiga Magazine), suggesting this unconventional approach started early. That willingness to create deeply personal, almost surreal experiences defined Williams' work throughout his career.</p>

<p>After a brief stint making licensed games (like <em>Bart's Nightmare</em>) for the Super Nintendo at Sculptured Software, he left the industry entirely to pursue his calling as a pastor, attending seminary in Chicago with his wife Martha, before declining health forced him to move to Rockport, Texas. Perhaps reflecting on the choices that led him down this path, Williams had <a href="https://vgpavilion.com/mags/1989/02/yaam/yaam-interview-bill-williams/">noted</a> years earlier in that 1989 interview, "Sometimes in this industry we tend to forget that life is a lot more interesting than computers."</p>
<p>Bill Williams died on May 28, 1998, one day before his 38th birthday. He died young, but he outlived his doctors' prediction that he wouldn't reach age 13, and created cultural works that stand the test of time. Like Sam the Salmon, Williams pushed forward relentlessly—in his case, creating powerful digital art that was uniquely his own.</p>
<p>In our current era of photorealistic graphics and cinematic game experiences, <em>Salmon Run</em>'s blocky pixels might seem quaint. But its core themes—persistence, natural beauty, and finding purpose against long odds—remain as relevant as ever. We all face bears in life—whether they come from natural adversity or from those who might seek to do us harm. The beauty of Williams' game is in showing us that, despite their menacing presence, there's still a reward waiting upstream for those willing to keep swimming.</p>
<p><em>If you want to try</em> Salmon Run<em>, you can potentially <a href="https://archive.org/details/a8b_Salmon_Run_1982_APX_US_a2_k_file">play it in your browser</a> through an emulated Atari 800, hosted on The Internet Archive. Press F1 to start the game.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-voice-actor-strike-genshin-impact-destiny-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been eight months since video game voice actors and performers represented by SAG-AFTRA went on strike. While they’ve picked up some big wins – over 170 games signed to interim agreements that honor the terms SAG-AFTRA has brought to the bargaining table – major video game companies refuse to budge on the issue of AI. The reverberations are becoming harder to ignore: In March alone, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/diabolical-genshin-impacts-english-cast-gives-new-vo-the-cold-shoulder-after-he-frames-replacing-a-striking-actor-as-an-opportunity-to-carry-the-flame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one striking <em>Genshin Impact</em> actor</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/538170/zenless-zoice-zero-voice" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> actors</a> were replaced. Characters in other games like<em> Destiny 2</em> have <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/519589/sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-ai-protections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gone silent</a>. This costly stalemate is the reason why SAG-AFTRA has taken the risky step of <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/IMA%20Comparison%20Chart.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishing portions of proposed contracts</a> that usually remain under wraps.</p><p>In March, SAG-AFTRA posted a comparison chart of AI-related proposals to its website and social media, contrasting specific language between the union and employers and explaining why they feel employers’ offer remains insufficient. </p><p>"[Game companies] want to use all past performances and any performance they can source from outside the contract without any of the protections being bargained at all,” SAG-AFTRA national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland and interactive media negotiating chair Sarah Elmaleh wrote in <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/member-message-video-game-strike-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a strike update</a> that ran alongside the contract comparison. “[Performers] could be told nothing about your replica being used, offered nothing in the way of payment, and you could do nothing about it. They want to be able to make your replica continue to work, as you, during a future strike, whether you like it or not. And once you’ve given your specific consent for how your replica can be used, they refuse to tell you what they actually did with it."</p><p>A representative for the companies bargaining with SAG-AFTRA disputed these claims to Aftermath.</p><p>“We have proposed a deal that includes wage increases of over 15% for SAG-AFTRA represented performers in video games, as well as enhanced health and safety protections, industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor’s performance in other games,” the representative said. “We have made meaningful progress and are eager to return to the bargaining table to reach a deal.”&nbsp;</p><p>A SAG-AFTRA representative acknowledged that companies presented an updated proposal last week, but declined to comment further as “we are evaluating the recent response.”</p><p>Zeke Alton, a video game voice actor and SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee member, told Aftermath during an interview at GDC that publishing specific terms from proposed contracts was risky, but union members felt they had no other choice after functionally being stonewalled by a group of companies that includes Activision Blizzard, Disney Character Voices, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, and WB Games.</p><p>"We set bargaining rules before we sit down in every different genre that we bargain," Alton said. "One thing we use as a standard is a press blackout, and what that means is that we don't try to litigate things outside the room. … Now we're taking more and more progressive steps to help the industry at large understand that we are not being unreasonable. If you look at the ink on the paper, we have been more than reasonable. What it points out is, those companies are not right now. And so the fans, the actors, the performers, the stunts, the general public all need to look at these companies and ask 'Why is this not OK with you select few when it's OK for everyone else? Why are you holding up this industry and costing everybody money and time?'”</p><p>While some actors – like the aforementioned Hoyoverse regulars – have taken to striking in solidarity even though the option existed to continue lending their voices to characters, others are itching to get back to work. This has resulted in frustration with companies and, in some cases, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/diabolical-genshin-impacts-english-cast-gives-new-vo-the-cold-shoulder-after-he-frames-replacing-a-striking-actor-as-an-opportunity-to-carry-the-flame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also with other voice actors</a> in situations that resemble scabbing but skirt just outside the technical definition. Elmaleh is not discouraged by these developments, however. She sees them as a sign that striking actors and performers have real leverage – and that companies can’t hold out forever.</p><p>"I feel very dearly the pain of the month-by-month, day-by-day impact that has on membership, but I always expected our leverage and our pressure to start to hit after a few months,” Elmaleh told Aftermath. “Games are not like other mediums; when you stop recording actors on a film set, you are not producing films. [On games] you can shuffle [elements] of a production around, but I think all that shuffling is wearing out. I think now is exactly when our pressure is starting to really kick in. I know this timeline is difficult, frustrating, and confusing, but I think this is the reality of the space that we're in, and I'm optimistic."</p><p>Alton added that he feels emboldened when he sees non-union actors set down their mics and pick up picket signs.</p><p>“[<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>] is a non-union game,” Alton said. "And what it makes me think is that the community of performers now understands what's at risk. This is not a union fight; it's an actors' fight. ... When we see non-union properties coming out without voice in them because they're not able to cast, because the actors are standing up and going 'No, I need my rights,' that gives me optimism. Because as time goes on, the fans don't want a bad product, and that incentivizes the business to make the right business decision.”</p><p>Recent events like <a href="https://aftermath.site/playstation-ai-aloy-horizon-talk-character" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony's bizarre internal test</a> of an AI-powered version of <em>Horizon </em>main character Aloy have provided voice actors with even more motivation to keep pushing for better protections.</p><p>"We've been told in the bargaining room 'Oh, we're not doing that,'" said Alton in reference to AI Aloy. "But sometimes [companies] are so brazen, it's amazing. Like, yeah, you are doing it. There you are doing it. We're not telling you you can't. We're telling you that the right of publicity of actors, citizens in general, is important, and so it's not going to break your company to get the actors' OK to do that -- get their consent, compensate them fairly, and be transparent."</p><p>While it might be cold comfort to voice actors who are struggling to find work or are having to take on odd jobs as the strike rages on, the interim agreement – as well as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-issues-new-agreements-to-permit-members-to-work-with-students-and-game-jams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new exception for student games and game jams</a> – has ensured that a not-insignificant number of doors remain open. In a bitterly comedic twist, Alton was even able to work on a game licensed out to another studio by WB, a company whose games division refuses to agree to SAG-AFTRA’s terms.</p><p>"I am the Green Lantern in <em>DC: Dark Legion</em>, which is a Warner Bros licensed property that is on the interim agreement," he said. "I'm really proud to have been on that game and worked on that game for a long time. Again, it's evidence that anyone can sign this. It's completely reasonable. What we don't understand is why, on the other side of the table, all we're hearing is 'No,' and we're not hearing why. We want to have that conversation so we can get to 'Yes.'"</p><p>Elmaleh, too, is eager to get back in the voice acting booth.</p><p>"I love my job! I would love to get back to doing that,” she said. “All we're trying to do is get a fair enough contract made for 160,000 members to feel safe enough to let them explore this technology and figure out how we should progress."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-ambient-magic-fantasy-tolkein-medieval"><h3>I Found A New Age Of Magic At A Dungeon Synth Show In Queens</h3></a><p>Dungeon synth isn't a return to an imagined past, but a vibrant vision of the future.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-awards-deck-nine-laid-off-developers-life-is-strange-double-exposure"><h3>Deck Nine Takes Back GDC Award From Laid-Off Devs After Failing To Send Anyone To Accept It</h3></a><p>"I keep thinking about all of the opportunities that were denied to us because of our exclusion"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Add-on accessories like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Elite Series 2 Controller</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Headphones-Console/dp/B0DH689JGY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Xbox Wireless Headset</a> can help you get the most out of your new gaming console, while others, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Seagate</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44XVWCH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Western Digital’s</a> expansion cards, can help ensure you have ample storage space to stow all of your favorite games.</p><p>Below, we’ve listed some of the best accessories available for the Series X and Series S, many of which often go on sale at most major retailers.</p><div><p id="PiDUH5"><h2>Controllers</h2></p></div><div><p id="9Qjrmb"><h3>Xbox Wireless Controller</h3></p></div><p>The last-gen Xbox wireless controller from the Xbox One generation is compatible with the Series X / S consoles. However, the older controller lacks a few features only found in the newer, better version. For instance, the revised controller (which comes with every new Series X and Series S) has a dedicated button for saving and sharing clips and screenshots, a USB-C port for wired use or charging <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=TheVergeXboxAccessory110921&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fbatteries-chargers%2Fplay-and-charge-kit" rel="sponsored">Microsoft’s play-and-charge rechargeable battery</a>, and an improved D-pad.</p><p>In addition to working with the latest Xbox consoles, Microsoft’s base-model Xbox controller also features Bluetooth support, so you can connect it to modern Android phones, Apple devices, a Steam Deck (or any competing handheld gaming PC), or a PC. If your PC doesn’t have Bluetooth, you can just plug in via USB.</p><p>The Xbox Wireless controller retails between $59.99 and $64.99, depending on the color, but we often see it on sale for as low as $40. And, for those who want something really unique, you can order a custom model through the <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-us/configure/xbox-wireless-controller">Xbox Design Lab</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->44</span></p><div><p>The official Xbox Wireless Controller has a dedicated share button for saving clips and screenshots and sharing them online, Bluetooth support, and a USB-C port for charging up Microsoft’s play-and-charge rechargeable battery.</p></div></div><div><p id="yXdu1y"><h3>Xbox Elite Series 2 controllers</h3></p></div><p>If you want the ability to customize your controller to better suit your play style, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Xbox Elite Series 2 controller</a> might be a better fit.</p><p>Although it’s twice as expensive as the aforementioned Xbox Wireless Controller, we consider the customizable Elite Series 2 to be the best premium Xbox controller you can buy. Its thumbsticks have adjustable tension (although they aren’t drift-free Hall effect sticks, sadly), it has back paddles that support custom button mapping, and it features hair-trigger locks that enable shorter, clickier throws of the triggers. Just like the basic Xbox Wireless Controller, the Elite Series 2 offers both USB-C and Bluetooth connectivity, along with excellent battery life that should provide roughly 40 hours of playtime on a single charge. Although the Elite Series 2 has an MSRP of $179.99, it’s somewhat normal to see it dip to as low as $139.99.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->150</span></p><div><p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 is easily one of our favorite controllers at <em>The Verge</em>. It’s an improvement on the already excellent Elite controller, with deep customization, optional rear paddle buttons, a swappable D-pad, and analog sticks that allow you to tailor its layout to suit your play style.</p></div></div><p>Then there’s the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23340603/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-core-white-controller-release-date-price">cheaper version</a> that comes packaged with fewer accouterments (no hard case, no extra sticks, and no back paddles). The Core version is the same controller in two-tone white, red, or blue — but again, without the accessories — and has a list price of $129.99. Thankfully, it’s common to find it for around $100, and you can always buy the accessories later <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fcomplete-component-pack" rel="sponsored">via Microsoft for $59.99</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->96</span></p><div><p>The Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 – Core is functionally identical to the more expensive Elite Series 2 but doesn’t come with the extra D-pad, back paddles, thumbsticks, or charging case.</p></div></div><div><p id="7e5i5Y"><h3>PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller</h3></p></div><p>If you’d rather spend less and don’t mind using a wired controller, the PowerA Enhanced is a great budget-friendly pick. It lacks wireless connectivity, but it works just the same as official controllers on Xbox Series X / S consoles and PC. The low-frills controller comes in several colors as well as some licensed designs, and is available for as low as $27 in some instances.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->27</span></p><div><p>The PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller includes a 10-foot USB cable, and is supported by Xbox consoles and PC.</p></div></div><div><p id="8bitdo-ultimate-wired-controller"><h3>8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller</h3></p></div><p>Another option that typically goes for around <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSP5BB7Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$30</a> is 8BitDo’s newer Ultimate Wired Controller.

What sets it apart from other affordable options, as well as both of Microsoft’s wireless controllers, is its Hall effect joysticks and triggers.

However, it’s worth pointing out that any external USB drive will be significantly slower to load than what the Series X’s and Series S’s respective SSDs will tolerate. As such, you can only play Xbox One and earlier generation games directly from it. If you want to play a Series X game, you’ll need to move it over to the console’s internal SSD.</p><div><p id="9Kx3Bu"><h3>An expansion card</h3></p></div><p>Of course, you can (and probably should) buy faster storage solutions, which will allow you to play Series X / S games without transferring games around. That said, the storage expansion cards that are currently available will cost you significantly more than a traditional drive. Seagate and Western Digital are, so far, the only companies that make proprietary, memory card-like SSDs that can be inserted into the rear of either Microsoft console.</p><p>The SSDs are available in multiple configurations, including 1TB and 2TB sizes (there are 512GB configurations, but they aren’t worth the money). At their standard retail price, these expansion cards are far pricier than their M.2 SSD counterparts for the PlayStation 5, but they’re the only option for Xbox owners who want additional console storage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deadpool-secret-lair-brings-merc-with-mouth-to-magic-gathering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has made a special April Fools' Day Secret Lair announcement for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. A certain red-suited, wisecracking <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Marvel</a> character is coming to the popular card game. Not Spider-Man or The Avengers; it's a Deadpool Secret Lair.</p>

<h2>The Deadpool Secret Lair Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/product/1151231/secret-lair-x-marvel-s-deadpool" rel="nofollow">store page</a> listing, the Deadpool Secret Lair will include five cards featuring the merc with a mouth. The description is written from the perspective of Deadpool, complete with crass self-awareness.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deadpool-secret-lair-card-artwork.jpg?itok=OFn9eZXw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deadpool-secret-lair-card-artwork.jpg?itok=WclidR4r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Four of the five cards in the Deadpool Secret Lair are reprints. These reprints feature Deadpool-themed artwork by Justine Cruz, Slawomir Maniak, Miguel Mercado, Kevin Sidharta and Tomasz Zarucki. The reprinted cards are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Deadly Rollick</em></li>
	<li><em>Saw in Half</em></li>
	<li><em>Blasphemous Act</em></li>
	<li><em>Vandalblast</em></li>
</ul><p>Presentation-wise, the cards are a solid representation of Deadpool's anarchic sense of humor. <em>Blasphemous Act</em> shows him sitting on the moon, wielding the Infinity Gauntlet. <em>Deadly Rollick</em> portrays him riding on a unicorn with a rainbow in the background. Mechanically, <em>Saw in Half</em> is taken from the Unfinity set, which is, by design, silly and irreverent, which fits the character perfectly.</p>

<p>But the fifth and final card in the Deadpool Secret Lair is a mechanically unique legendary creature: Deadpool, Trading Card. It is, as the name suggests. Deadpool is a Black/Red creature with 5/3. On its own, not a bad card, until you read the text, "when Deadpool enters, you may exchange his text box and another creature's."</p>

<p>This is potent enough on its own. Deadpool can steal an enemy creature's abilities through their rules text. But that's not all that is in Deadpool's text. You also lose life at the start of each turn, which is a devious combination.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Deadpool Secret Lair drop will be coming to certain retail stores. Like all prior Secret Lairs, you can order both foil (MSRP $39.99) and non-foil (MSRP $29.99) bundles online. In addition, all WPN retail stores will have non-foil bundles available on April 25. This is the first time a Secret Lair drop has been available at retail.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/zenimax-union-vote-authorizes-strike-against-microsoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ZeniMax Workers United, a union representing over 300 quality assurance workers in both Maryland and Texas, have voted to authorize a strike against the company. </p>



<p>In an announcement on Tuesday, it was revealed that nearly 95% of votes were in favor of authorization.</p>



<div><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A Microsoft spokesperson has provided the following statement to Insider Gaming regarding the strike authorization vote: </p><p><em><strong>“Our quality assurance team is an integral part of our business and is key to our ability to deliver games our players will love. We respect the team’s right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable&nbsp;resolution that acknowledges the teams’&nbsp;contributions. </strong></em></p><p>“<em><strong>There&nbsp;has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table.&nbsp;We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair — if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid&nbsp;model&nbsp;of 3 days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations.”&nbsp;</strong></em></p></div>



<p>According to the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> announcing the authorization, members of the union say that the decision comes as negotiations between Microsoft, ZeniMax, and the union fail to make any meaningful progress into its second year. Specifically, return to office mandates along with “underpayment” are causing friction between the groups.</p>



<p>“Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment,” ZeniMax Workers United-CWA Local 6215 Member and Senior QA Tester Zachary Armstrong said via release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“None of us wishes it had come to this, but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is.”</p>



<p>Union member and Associate QA Tester Aubrey Litchfield added: “Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time. Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We’ve released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?”</p>



<p>It’s important to note that the union isn’t officially going on strike. What the authorization vote means is that should negotiations continue to move forward without progress, the union can call a strike without another vote.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft and ZeniMax for comment on the negotiations. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>



<p>What do you make of the ZeniMax union voting to authorize a strike against Microsoft? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/"><em>Satisfactory</em></a> starts out as a game you play, then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/satisfactory-hits-1-0-removing-your-last-excuse-to-avoid-falling-in-deep">becomes a way you think</a>. The only way I have been able to keep the ridiculous factory simulation from eating an even-more-unhealthy amount of my time was the game's keyboard-and-mouse dependency. But the work, it has found me—on my couch, on a trip, wherever one might game, really.</p>
<p>In a 1.1 release on <em>Satisfactory</em>'s Experimental branch, there are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/526870/view/520835140699555676">lots of new things</a>, but the biggest new thing is a controller scheme. Xbox and DualSense are officially supported, though anyone playing on Steam can likely tweak their way to something that works on other pads. With this, the game becomes far more playable for those playing on a couch, on a portable gaming PC like the Steam Deck, or over household or remote streaming. It also paves the way for the game's console release, which is currently slated for sometime in 2025.</p>

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p><em>Satisfactory</em> seems like an unlikely candidate for controller support, let alone consoles. It's a game where you do a lot of three-dimensional thinking, putting machines and conveyer belts and power lines in just the right places, either because you need to or it just feels proper. How would it feel to select, rotate, place, and connect everything using a controller? Have I just forgotten that <em>Minecraft, </em>and first-person games as a whole, probably seemed similarly desk-bound at one time? I grabbed an Xbox Wireless controller, strapped on my biofuel-powered jetpack, and gave a reduced number of inputs a shot.</p>


<p>The biggest hurdle to get past, for me, is not jumping in place when I wanted to do something, though it's not unique to this game. In most games that have some kind of building or planning through a controller, the bottom-right button ("A" on Xbox, "X" on PlayStation DualSense) is often the do/interact/confirm button. In Satisfactory, and some other games where I switch between keyboard/mouse and controller, A/X is jump. Satisfactory wants you to primarily use the triggers and bumpers to select, build, and dismantle things, which feels okay when you've got the hang of things. But even after an hour or so, I still found my pioneer unexpectedly jumping, as if he needed to get the zoomies out before placing a storage container.</p>

                <p>After two years of contract negotiations with parent company Microsoft, ZeniMax Workers United members have voted in overwhelming favor to authorize a strike. The union announced the news earlier today via a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a> shared by Communications Workers of America, writing, "We’re not afraid to use our union power to ensure that we can keep making great games. All of us want to be working. We hope that Microsoft will allow us to do so with dignity and fairness to all by securing a first contract with our union.”</p><p>First reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640423/zenimax-union-cwa-strike-authorization-vote" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, the news comes after more than two years of contract negotiations between ZeniMax Workers United and Microsoft. Since the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qa-workers-at-zenimax-studios-have-become-the-gaming-industrys-largest-union/1100-6510268/" data-ref-id="1100-6510268">union's formation back in 2023</a>, members have been actively pushing Microsoft for better wages, workplace improvements, and to address "key concerns, including a lack of remote work options and the company’s replacement of in-house quality-assurance work with outsourced labor without notifying the union." Last November, members of the union <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/zenimax-video-game-workers-walk-job-maryland-and-texas" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">walked off the job</a> in a one-day strike, to "call out the company for lack of progress at the bargaining table." Though the most recent vote does not mean union workers have officially gone on strike, it gives the organization permission to call for one, should contract negotiations further break down.</p><p>"Despite being one of the world's largest corporations, we've had to continuously fight for what should be bare minimum. Paying your employees a livable wage as a multi-trillion dollar company is the least they could be doing; however when addressed at the bargaining table, Microsoft acts as though we're asking for too much," ZeniMax Workers United member and associate QA tester Aubrey Litchfield wrote in the press release. "Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time. Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We've released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?"</p><p>Consisting of more than 300 quality-assurance workers across Bethesda and ZeniMax studios, ZeniMax Workers United is one of Microsoft's largest unions. Its members are known for their work across several prominent Microsoft series, including The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Doom. With Doom: The Dark Ages scheduled to release in just over a month, a strike could have significant consequences for Microsoft.</p><p>Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA members who work in the video games industry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">continue to strike</a> following growing concerns about AI. As of right now, it's still not clear when the strike (which went into effect July 26, 2024) might end. As it stands, any developer looking to employ SAG-AFTRA talent to perform must sign either the new Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement, the Interim Interactive Media Agreement, or the Interim Interactive Localization Agreement before moving forward with production, all of which offer "critical AI protection."</p><p><em>Update: Following this article's publication, a representative from Microsoft reached out to GameSpot to provide the following statement:</em></p><p><em>"Our quality assurance team is an integral part of our business and is key to our ability to deliver games our players will love. We respect the team's right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams' contributions. There has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table. We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair--if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid model of 3 days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations."</em></p>

            <p>
With March now rapidly vanishing in the rear view mirror as we continue our race along highway 2025, Humble Choice has announced its April line-up, which this time brings a spot of classic tomb raiding, some seafaring terror, and even Xenomorph-flavoured tactics action.
</p>
<p>
April's offerings are available to claim and keep right now - provided you've a Humble Choice subscription, that is - and the current selection lingers around until Tuesday, 6th May. But before it's all change, here's what you can download:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered</li>
<li>Dredge</li>
<li>Alien: Dark Descent</li>
<li>1000XResist</li>
<li>Nova Lands</li>
<li>Diplomacy is Not an Option</li>
<li>Distant Worlds 2</li>
<li>Nomad Survival</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Tomb Raider I-III Remastered | Official Launch Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q_vH_0gpVlk?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered | Official Launch Trailer</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q_vH_0gpVlk?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q_vH_0gpVlk?autoplay=1" title="Tomb Raider I-III Remastered | Official Launch Trailer">
</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Here's Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered in action.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_vH_0gpVlk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
So there you go! Tomb Raider 1-3 are obviously bona fide platform classics, and last year's remaster is a lovely way to experience them, while developer Black Salt Games' Dredge - a strange blend of fishing and unnerving cosmic horror - is also a bit of a treat if you're so inclined.
</p>
<p>
Alien: Dark Descent also has its fans, taking the iconic movie franchise and turning it into a surprisingly suspenseful top-down, real-time tactics game - and as for 1000XResist, Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/1000xresist-review">called it</a> an "intense and intimate narrative adventure" when it released last year.
</p>
<p>
Moving further down the list, there's real-time 4X space strategy in Distant Worlds 2, furious medieval fantasy defense in Diplomacy is Not an Option, and a bit of cheery factory automation in Nova Lands. And finally for April, there's Nomad Survival, an "auto-attacking, wave clearing, time-based Roguelite" - which is to say it's basically <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> in a different bow.
</p>
<p>
As ever, five percent of each Humble Choice subscription is donated to charity, with this month's proceeds going to One Tree Planted - a non-profit focused on global reforestation. And for the sake of transparency, here's the usual note Humble is, like Eurogamer, owned by IGN.
</p>
<p>
If April's Humble Choice offerings appeal, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/membership">you'll find additional details over here</a>.

			<p>At GDC 2025, 10 Chambers Collective invited Wccftech to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818140/Den_of_Wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Den of Wolves</a> for the first time. After their debut title, the co-op horror-themed first-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gtfo-cooperate-or-die-trying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTFO</a>, this is a return to the Swedish developers' true love: heists. Before 10 Chambers was founded, they worked at OVERKILL/Starbreeze to make the first two Payday games.</p>
<p>You can read our Den of Wolves preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-back-on-that-heist-biz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. After the hands-on session, we were also able to interview writer and composer Simon Viklund to really dive into this new sci-fi setting they've created for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves Pre-Alpha Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGYfx7vKpRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How do you feel that the reception's been so far?</strong></p>
<p>I'm a pretty pessimistic guy, but I think we're proud of the build. Obviously, otherwise, we wouldn't show it. We know what works in it and what works less well, and we're working on that. We know stealth may be a bit unclear right now, the feedback and stuff, but I feel that this demo, when it was put together, was very focused on combat and gunplay, which I think works well in it. The hit feedback, the sounds and the animations, everything is pretty tight.</p>
<p>We know how to do that stuff. We've been working on shooters for so long. But there are issues. We know it's unpolished in some parts, and some parts are obviously completely missing. I mean, there are animations missing.</p>
<p><strong>Can you describe your vision for how the game's flow will look, whether in the first early access iteration or when it's fully released?</strong></p>
<p>For early access, we will have one storyline. And for the full release, we will have multiple. We can't say how many at this point. There will be some things not present in early access. It will only be developed in English, with no localization at that point. We'll also use the early access phase to find out where people are enjoying the game and maybe focus on those territories in terms of whether there's voice localization. There are other aspects also that we're gonna hold off&nbsp;until later.</p>
<p>But for the most part, the important thing is the storyline, the ability to play different prep missions, choose which one to take on and avoid or reject others and play a heist at the end and see your choices throughout the prep mission phase sort of manifested, your choices having consequences.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The important thing is the storyline, the ability to play different prep missions, choose which one to take on and avoid or reject others and play a heist at the end and see your choices throughout the prep mission phase sort of manifested, your choices having consequences.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Can you talk about how dynamic these prep missions may be? Are there different mission types or rewards?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, every prep mission essentially has some sort of a MacGuffin that you're looking for. That's a plot device, really, which will unlock an approach in the heist at the end. You're looking at the heist, essentially. You need to get into the vault. It's a cliché, but let's take that. It's like, we can place an explosive on the weakest part of the wall around the vault, but then we need to play the prep mission where we acquire the explosives and we need to play another prep mission where we acquire the blueprints for the building to find out which wall is actually the weakest one. It's a nice climax to the storyline where you're playing this mission that you've been prepping for a long time and you've invested time and it matters more when you play it.</p>
<p>But then there might be other ways to get into the vault. Maybe you could drill, so you're like, let's find out what vault door they have and then you go into whatever company provided the vault door and find out what its weak points are. Maybe you could find out when the changing of the guard is happening, and then you play different prep missions to unlock the way. That doesn't entail playing all the premises, obviously, which in turn creates replayability because you can play the same storyline again and try a different approach.</p>
<p>The geometry of a heist would be the same every time. It's not a complex mission. The complexity, I would say, comes from your ability to play in several different ways, but it will be the same layout every time, whereas prep missions are more like, we're breaking into this bad warehouse or this laboratory or whatever. Those missions would not be narratively different. There's no different ways to do it. They might have a different layout every time you play them, as we randomize their layouts every time you replay the storyline. It's not procedurally generated, but it's us creating and curating a set of versions of that same map, which are then chosen at random by the game.</p>
<p>They're pretty straightforward in terms of what you do in them, and they're snack-sized in duration, but you have to keep on your toes because of the different layouts. With Den of Wolves, we're trying to really create a game where it's a lot of fun playing the same storyline several times because of player agency.</p>
<p><strong>When you finish all of your prep missions, you get everything ready for the main heist. If you either complete the main heist or if you fail, does that progression you've made through the prep missions stay, or do you have to start from scratch?</strong></p>
<p>When you have invested that much time into finding the different intel and the gear that you need in order to beat the heist, you get to try the heist several times. If it turns out that it's too difficult, you can go back to certain prep missions that might unlock things that aid you. You can maybe bribe someone or threaten some guards to look the other way. If you put more effort into more prep missions, that might alleviate a little bit of the pressure on the heist, so that's a way for you to offset the difficulty a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>With this being such a multiplayer-focused title, with these prep missions in Den of Wolves, when you're playing with a group of friends when you're going into the heist, is it based on the host progression, or is it a combination of the team for what they've done for their prep missions?</strong></p>
<p>Let's say I start a heist or initiate a storyline. I do it with the two of you, so we're three together. We&nbsp;agree on the rules that we need to be all three of us in order to make progress in this instance of the storyline. We play one evening and make some progress. The next evening, Robin can't join, but you and I can't play because we set those rules. Still, we can play either another storyline or start a new instance of that same storyline where we make progress&nbsp;and it's a little bit different.</p>
<p>But the next time all three of us are online, that version of the storyline, that instance where we play together, becomes available again. We can also start a storyline and say anyone can make progress in the storyline, regardless of who's online, or only I can make progress in the storyline, and whenever you guys are online, you can join in. You set the rules for yourselves, and then you can have essentially an infinite number of instances of the same storyline, just with different progress within them and stuff.</p>
<p>You can't collect stuff like resources in one instance of the storyline and bring it over to another version. However, if we're playing together in one storyline and you can't play one evening, I can still play in the same storyline without making progress. There are certain prep missions that are just collecting assets or resources, like consumables and stuff. Or I can be a gun for hire for other people playing their storyline, so I'm joining other people's games as a gun for hire and just protecting them and being sort of a bodyguard, not even completing objectives, just joining mid-game as a random player. That might reward me with stuff that we can use in our storyline.</p>

The next evening, Robin can't join, but you and I can't play because we set those rules. Still, we can play either another storyline or start a new instance of that same storyline where we make progress&nbsp;and it's a little bit different.'</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>When you say joining midgame, is this like dropping into a mission, or is this joining a party when they're still in their prep phase in the hideout?</strong></p>
<p>No, you can join in the middle of an actual first person shooter mission. When you start an instance of a storyline, you can say other people can join my game and they get to play with me just as if they were heisteri, really. But you can also say other people can join, but I don't wanna be robbed of the experience and the joy of completing the objectives. In that case, if my mission is to complete the heist, other people can't do that. They can't even interact with the vault door, or whatever it might be, so they're only allowed to protect me.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of incentives are there for Den of Wolves players to take the role of a gun for hire?</strong></p>
<p>They would get progress towards the next drop, just like you would when completing the heist. They'd be rewarded with gun parts or consumables like explosives and stuff like that that you can use in other missions.</p>
<p><strong>Would you consider that to be more like a progression track or a reputation level system? Progression track meaning like a battle pass.</strong></p>
<p>I would say it's like filling out your golf bag with new gear and widening your arsenal with new stuff that you can use. They could be difficulty offset type of things, almost like a card that you would play in a card game. It could be something like calling in a favor from another criminal gang where they can attack another facility that is owned by the same company and that will thin out the security in this heist.</p>
<p>But it could also be something that allows you to find out about another extra vault that is available in this heist that you wouldn't otherwise know about or even be able to access unless you had this drop. Then you can go for that extra vault if you're greedy, but it's also a higher risk because it's more dangerous to stay on the map and try to get the stuff in that vault.</p>
<p>Players who want to play at an easier difficulty level will have to look for these things that help them when they think the game is hard, and people who want more of a challenge have the ability to play permutations of maps that ramp&nbsp;up the difficulty but also give them more reward for that.</p>
<p><strong>The system you're explaining sounds like a modifier system where players use cards before going into the heist to modify the enemy density or increase the rewards, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that's a good way of putting it, but we're roleplaying it as some sort of favor or something from a rival team.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the player expression and customization in Den of Wolves?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that's a big part of it. It's something we like to explore and give the players the ability to do, but it's not necessarily something that exists as we're going into early access, but yes, we want the players to be able to customize the character and choose the voice and the face and the clothing and weapon customization.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'There also has to be a point to playing longer heists as well, because what happened in Payday 2 was that players only played the same small bank over and over because it was the one that had the shortest loop and you got drops more easily. In Den of Wolves, we are trying to create a system that will reward you regardless of the duration of the heist that you're playing in relation to the investment in time and effort.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>That actually leads me to my next question, which is about weapon customization in Den of Wolves.</strong></p>
<p>It's something that might not exist as we go into early access, but it might be added during early access. What I think it's important to point out is that you're not, like, stealing $1.5 million and now you have $1.5 million to spend on weapons, because then a pistol would have to cost a million dollars.</p>
<p>It's more like we roleplay it as you collecting money and then fencing those things off to some other criminal gang. After they got enough of that resource, whatever it might be, it's a currency of sorts (like the bags that you collect, the more bags you get, the more of that stuff you have to sell). Every once in a while, you level up or get to a point where you get a drop and a reward. It's not like we played this mission where we stole a shipment of weapons and now we have all these SMGs or AKs or whatever. You wouldn't be able to do that. There needs to be some conversion of your time spent in the game, a conversion between that and the reward that feels like it matters.</p>
<p>There also has to be a point to playing longer heists as well because what happened in Payday 2 was that players only played the same small bank over and over because it was the one that had the shortest loop and you got drops more easily. In Den of Wolves, we are trying to create a system that will reward you regardless of the duration of the heist that you're playing in relation to the investment in time and effort.</p>
<p><strong>Would customized gear drops be something that's permanently part of your arsenal, or would you only get to use them one time?</strong></p>
<p>No, that would be permanent.</p>
<p><strong>In the smaller prep mission, we saw a bit of GTFO's inspiration in the smaller discrete rooms that you would enter, clear out the encounter there, and then scan and go into the next room. So, I was curious how much of GTFO's DNA is present in Den of Wolves.</strong></p>
<p>Well, there's a little bit of your DNA in each one of your children, I guess. I mean, we did the PC version of Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter and that had co-op. We've been working on and refining the co-op formula for a long time. Every new game is not so much inspired by our previous games, but more like a refinement, and maybe look at whether we are leaning into a certain direction with this thing?</p>
<p>Obviously, with GTFO, that was horror and hardcore difficulty. For this game, it's not that. I think it's somewhere between Payday 2 and GTFO, maybe closer to Payday 2, but still, it's not an entry-level first person shooter, but it is something that's less hardcore.</p>
<p>The sci-fi component, we feel, unlocks a lot of creativity. We're creating a world. It's not an existing IP; we can make the rules ourselves. We don't have to follow the lure or the backstory of some existing franchise, TV show, or movie, which is a huge creative freedom. It allows us a lot of liberty.</p>
<p>We can interject the gameplay with a change of pace and a change of environment, and the fact that you're in these huge megastructures where people live their entire lives within the same building. These are enormous places: you can live your entire life there and be born in the hospital in that building with its own grocery stores, schools, residential areas, slums at the bottom, and penthouses at the top.</p>
<p>That allows us to create really interesting levels where you're moving between different places and they're all segmented and they can be run by different private security firms and stuff and they're not necessarily communicating with one another.</p>
<p>Then we can have that thing that we had in GTFO, which we think was a huge step forward from Payday, where it's like stealth, stealth, stealth, and as soon as you get discovered, it's just action, and you can never go back to stealth again unless you restart. In GTFO you could sort of regain control and go back to stealth again, exactly the way you described, and that'll be possible in Den of Wolves as well. Losing it and then regaining it and coming back to that several times in the same mission is really nice.</p>
<p><strong>I've been sitting on this for a while, but I loved talking with you about music&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-qa-10-chambers-goes-back-to-heist-roots-with-a-sci-fi-espionage-flavor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when we did our first interview</a>. I was curious about what sort of lessons or new ideas you've come up with for the dynamic soundtrack to Den of Wolves.</strong></p>
<p>On a technical level, it's somewhere between GTFO and Payday. Payday's music system is deceptively simple, rudimentary even. GTFO's music system is overly complex. I went on a rabbit hole with that game where it's like I'm making these short loops and they're all pieced together and layered in at one time by the game and the game can react to whatever is happening. The music changes and there are infinite combinations between the drum loops that are chosen randomly with a bass line that's chosen randomly and whatnot.</p>
<p>But it was not a lot of fun making the music because I only made these short snippets that then are arranged and put together by the game engine at runtime, so I never got to write really long songs. This is how the combat music works in GTFO, not so much the atmospheric music, but the combat music.</p>
<p>So I wanted to find a way to make the creation of music more stimulating and inspiring and fun again, so the music system needed to be less complex than GTFO. It goes for everyone involved in game development; I think you need to enjoy the journey as well. You can't just look at the end product and say, if it gets nice reviews, you're happy. You want to enjoy your life while you're making the game as well, and I need to enjoy making the music.</p>
<p>So yeah, the music needs to be larger chunks, like one minute, one minute and a half, two minutes, that I can make a song that has a little bit of changes going on through it. On a technical level, it's finding that balance between simplicity and complexity. On more of a creative level, in terms of the genre, I'm super happy to get back to making music for a power fantasy in Den of Wolves. It was fun making core music for GTFO, but it's not really my wheelhouse. Now I feel I can really utilize what I consider my primary skill within music, which is making music with a lot of attitude that gets the adrenaline pumping,</p>
<p>So, the music is electronic&nbsp;and saturated and distorted and dirty. A lot of it is inspired by hip-hop and trap. Trap music has a lower tempo, so it becomes not as stressful, obviously. It's slower moving and heavier in a way with these bass sounds and whatnot. It has a lot of street vibe and attitude to it, but I think it's really cool. What's nice about that slower tempo is that when you go double tempo, it's a natural transition into a more stressful track, so it's easy to go from 75 BPM to twice that tempo (150 BPM) and get a completely different vibe in the music.</p>
<p>When you're fighting the enemies and things are going well, there's one type of music, but when you're escaping and time is running out, the same track shifts into something else seamlessly. I think I find I've found a style of music that I think is really malleable and I can do at a great level.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any new artists or composers that you're collaborating with for the Den of Wolves soundtrack?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Jamie Christopherson, who I think might be most famous for making the music to Metal Gear Rising Revengeance. He's helping out.</p>
<p><strong>I think we talked about that in the first interview. I didn't know if there were any other announcements you could share.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, no, unfortunately not. I'm looking for rappers or vocalists who can contribute because when you come to the success screen, there's rap. The track from the escape as you were running out seamlessly goes to a rap song, and that felt like a good tone to strike with a lot of attitude as you sort of celebrate on the results screen. But I can't really announce at this point exactly who&nbsp;it will be.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to have a call to action or recruitment to try and find rappers to contribute?</strong></p>
<p>No, I haven't thought about that. I've looked at the avenues or the channels that I have at my disposal at this point, but that might be something that we use during the access when there's more of a community surrounding the game. It would be cool to find uh talents within the community.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We set the stage for interesting scenarios within this science fiction world with all the corporations and the concept of breaking into people's minds and everything. It's just a juicy concept that I think is going to excite people.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>After this whole preview cycle, when do you anticipate the next time that players can kind of get the next info drop for Den of Wolves?</strong></p>
<p>We will be dropping a lot of beats actually this year. We'll be showing more and more, but the next one big like this, it's hard to say. Hopefully, for the beginning of next year we could have a whole storyline or at least more of it so you understand how the prep missions give consequences for the main heist.</p>
<p><strong>Any other parting thoughts you want to leave our readers with for Dead of Wolves?</strong></p>
<p>We'd like to think that we know first person shooter co op games pretty well. We have a pedigree with Payday: The Heist and PD2 and GTFO and even Ghost Recon 20 years ago. Anyone who's a fan of that sort of game, and especially if they're into heists, should check it out; we'd like to think it's going to be pretty awesome. We set the stage for interesting scenarios within this science fiction world with all the corporations and the concept of breaking into people's minds and everything. It's just a juicy concept that I think is going to excite people.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>Game developers&nbsp;<span>who are part of the ZeniMax Workers United-CWA union working at&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-runs-pro-union-ad-alongside-the-cwa-to-push-activision-blizzard-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's</a> subsidiary ZeniMax Media overwhelmingly voted in favor of giving their leaders permission to call a strike</span>&nbsp;after failing to reach a deal for the union's first contract after two years of negotiations.</p>
<p>The Communications Workers of America (CWA), who helped the ZeniMax employees form their union, announced the news in a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft">press release</a> on Tuesday, saying that members of ZeniMax Workers United-CWA voted <strong>94% in favor</strong> of authorizing strike permissions. Which, to be clear, just means that the leaders negotiating the deal with Microsoft now have the ability to call a strike. It doesn't exactly mean that a strike will happen.</p>
<p>"<em>We’re not afraid to use our union power to ensure that we can keep making great games</em>," said Skylar Hinnat, a quality assurance tester and member of ZeniMax Workers United-CWA.</p>
<p>Hinnat continued, "<em>All of us want to be working. We hope that Microsoft will allow us to do so with dignity and fairness to all by securing a first contract with our union."</em></p>
<p>Some of the key issues the ZWU-CWA is bargaining over are expanding remote work options, better pay, workplace improvements, and mandating that Microsoft inform the union of any intentions it may have to outsource quality assurance work to a third party.</p>
<p>Specifically on issues like return to office mandates, senior quality assurance tester and ZWU-CWA member Zachary Armstrong said, "<em>Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>None of us wishes it had come to</em> <em>this,</em>" he added, "<em>but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is.</em>"</p>
<p>When the ZWU-CWA was formed at the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/quality-assurance-workers-microsofts-zenimax-studios-establish-companys-first-union">top of 2023</a>, it was the first union to come from a game studio under Microsoft, and it was also immediately one of the largest unions in the video game industry in the US.</p>
<p>As part of its campaign to push its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King through, Microsoft signed a <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">labor neutrality agreement with the CWA</a> to demonstrate that it would not prevent its employees from unionizing. Now that Microsoft has what it wants, it has seemingly yet to make good on any of the promises it made regarding its position towards unions and labor organizations.</p>
<p>"<em>Despite being one of the world’s largest corporations, we’ve had to continuously fight for what should be bare minimum. Paying your employees a livable wage as a multi-trillion dollar company is the least they could be doing; however when addressed at the bargaining table, Microsoft acts as though we’re asking for too much,</em>" said quality assurance tester Aubrey Litchfield.</p>
<p>"<em>Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time. Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We’ve released multiple titles while working fully remote. When will enough be enough?"</em></p>
