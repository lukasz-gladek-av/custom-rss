            <p>
Sony has responded to former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> and Marathon reboot director Christopher Barrett's $200m USD wrongful dismissal lawsuit, detailing Barrett's alleged 'disturbing communications' with female subordinates - including "sexually charged games of 'Truth or Dare'".
</p>
<p>
Barrett's departure from Bungie was first reported last March, amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">word of a leadership shakeup</a> at the studio. However, it was later claimed Barrett was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-reportedly-ousted-following-inappropriate-behaviour">fired from his role following an internal investigation</a> into accusation of inappropriate behaviour filed by "at least eight" female employees. Things took further turn in December, when Barrett <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-marathon-reboot-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-for-200m-claiming-wrongful-dismissal">filed a lawsuit against Bungie and Sony</a>, claiming the companies had "deliberately destroyed [his] reputation by falsely, and publicly, insinuating...he had engaged in sexual misconduct."
</p>
<p>
Barrett's list of accusations was long, but core to his argument was the claim his firing was a "premeditated scheme" concocted so Bungie and Sony could avoid paying him "nearly $50m... owed under his employment agreement". He additionally claimed he "did not do anything remotely resembling gross misconduct or 'Cause' as defined in the Retention Agreements... and there could not have been any credible allegation he did because [he] had a spotless twenty-five year track record at Bungie."
</p>
<p>
And now (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-bungie-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-response">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>), Sony has <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/830250465/Christopher-Barrett-v-Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-LLC-and-Bungie-Inc-2024-1285-No-97653544-97653546-Del-Ch-Feb-12-2025-1">filed its first substantive response</a>, denying Barret's claims and detailing the events allegedly leading to his dismissal. "Multiple female, subordinate employees individually reported to Human Resources that Barrett engaged in inappropriate behaviour and disturbing written and verbal communications," it wrote, "which made them uncomfortable and fearful of retaliation if they failed to engage or reported Barrett."
</p>
<p>
"The investigation revealed that Barrett's misconduct with each employee was consistent: he targeted a lower-level, female employee he wasn't working with directly, initially engaged in friendly conversation, and progressively pushed boundaries with the employee by making subtle references to her physical appearance or expressing his interest romantically.
</p>
<p>
"Barrett attempted to create an unprofessional level of intimacy with his victims," Sony continued in its court submission. "He requested to follow personal Instagram accounts and would express anger to the women if they failed to respond to his messages. He would bring up inappropriate topics like their body, their relationships, his marriage, or his desire to date them. He would demand that they participate in sexually charged games of 'Truth or Dare' and 'Ask Me Anything'. He texted them at all hours of the day and night. He offered to buy them gifts. He often referenced his wealth and his ability to advance their careers."
</p>
<p>
Sony's filing also includes several examples of Barrett's alleged misconduct, including an incident where it's claimed he FaceTimed one female employee late at night while drunk despite requests to "recognise 'boundaries'", eventually moving to his bedroom and telling her, "I can't believe I am lying in bed while talking to [VICTIM 1]".
</p>
<p>
Barrett also allegedly contacted a second employee via Instagram direct message, telling her, "You are the holy grail. I hope you find a person worthy of your attention." After the employee responded saying she had a boyfriend who treated her very well, Barrett is said to have told her, "He better[.] Cuz I would hit on you if he wasn't." It's claimed he later made further contact, writing, "You want to be worshipped, I think? Why are you against that actually happening?".
</p>
<p>
Other incidents detailed in Sony's filing includes a "virtual game of 'Truth or Dare' initiated by Barrett", and a Microsoft Teams exchange in which he allegedly asked a female member of staff, "Are you still in PJs? [Is] it like a button down top and bottoms? Sweat pants? Lulu lemons?".
</p>
<p>
Sony adds, "Barrett’s predatory behaviour caused victims to seek guidance from other Bungie employees on how to manage Barrett’s constant boundary-pushing given that he was a long-standing, senior member of the company. Multiple victims reported to Human Resources during the investigation that they were afraid for their jobs during these encounters."
</p>
<p>
In response, Barrett's lawyers told Game File, "Sony continues to disingenuously cherry pick text messages and alleged conversations and make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. It is telling that Sony does not include the full text messages as exhibits, or the full content of these conversations, and nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause.
</p>
<p>
"Christopher is confident that when all the evidence is presented, it will be clear that Sony engaged in a scheme to strip him of his role and the equity awards he earned for his 25 years of loyal service to the company."
</p>
<p>
As well as denying inappropriate behaviour during his time at Bungie, Barrett's original filing argued his former employers' actions had "irreparably harmed [him] financially, physically, and emotionally". As such, he is seeking $200m in damages - including $46K (plus interest) owed under his employment terms - and is requesting to be reinstated as game director on Marathon.

An old magazine with a single screenshot of a cancelled project is video game preservation. A dusty Sega Mega Drive sitting in storage alongside a copy of <em>Sonic 2</em> and <em>Jungle Strike</em> is video game preservation. A dodgy arcade cabinet with 1000 classic arcade games on it, all of them running their original code via emulation, is video game preservation.</p><p>A Frankenstein's monster of AI-generated slop, guessing and filling in holes to try to run a game without its "original engine", is <em>not </em>games preservation, and I'm frankly astonished to see such an important figure in the video games industry go on record saying it is.</p><p>But it simply wouldn't be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c15vxDHJ2lU&amp;t=16s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an AI hype exercise</a> if it wasn't built entirely on speculative horseshit and the vaguest of assertions, all in the service of trying to find <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/xbox-muse-generative-ai-developers-say-nobody-will-want-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">someone, <em>anyone </em>out there</a> beyond investors and tech company executives who will think any of this is worth what it's costing, both in dollar terms and its environmental impact.</p><p>If you're reading this and are interested in supporting actual video game preservation, <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please donate to the Video Game History Foundation</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-twitch-stream-big-book"><h3>Contrary To Popular Belief, Streaming On Twitch Is Work</h3></a><p>"Streaming is more enjoyable in some ways, but work is work no matter what the job is that you’re doing"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-sad-trombone"><h3>How’s That AI Future Looking?</h3></a><p>The Humane AI pin died on the way back to its home planet</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony’s lawyers say that these messages show a “pattern of misconduct.” The document was filed last week, according to <em>Game File. </em></p><p>In one message  Barrett asks a female Bungie employee, “Are you still in PJs?” and “[I]s it like a button down top and bottoms? Sweatpants? Lulu lemons?”</p><p>In another message, Barrett called a woman the “Holy Grail” and added:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I’m not hitting on you. I hope it doesn’t feel like that. I’m married. But I can be honest. You are the .000001 and better be treated like that forever.</p></blockquote><p>The woman replied that her boyfriend treats her “very well” and the former Bungie director replied: “He better cuz I would hit on you if he wasn’t.”</p><p>A different woman working at Bungie claims Barrett called her while drunk late at night and spent hours with her on FaceTime, despite the female employee asking him to respect her boundaries. At one point he allegedly took his phone into his bedroom and said, “I can’t believe I am lying in bed talking to [VICTIM 1].” She abruptly hung up. </p><p>Barrett’s lawyer sent this statement over to <em>Game File: </em></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Sony continues to disingenuously cherry pick text messages and alleged conversations and make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. It is telling that Sony does not include the full text messages as exhibits, or the full content of these conversations, and nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause.</p></blockquote><p>“Christopher is confident that when all the evidence is presented, it will be clear that Sony engaged in a scheme to strip him of his role and the equity awards he earned for his 25 years of loyal service to the company,” said Barrett’s lawyer. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-and-pc-single-player-action-game-lost-soul-aside-the-big-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After roughly a decade in development, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lost-soul-aside">Lost Soul Aside</a> is finally scheduled for a launch. Originally the passion project of solo developer Yang Bing, Lost Soul Aside has grown to become a major Sony-published title under the company's 'China Hero Project,' with Bing now the founder and CEO of Shanghai-based studio Ultizero Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a release date of May 30 on PlayStation 5 and PC closing in, IGN had the opportunity to sit down with Yang Bing to discuss the long road to launch. So many years of development went into this single-player action game, escalating from a solo creator's vision to a trailer reveal at Sony's State of Play. Through it all the hype has grown, with some calling Lost Soul Aside an exciting mix of Final Fantasy characters and Devil May Cry combat — even from the moment Yang Bing's initial reveal video went viral in 2016.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the help of a translator, IGN asked Yang Bing about the early origins of Lost Soul Aside, its inspirations, what challenges the team has faced over the years, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's been almost nine years since the first glimpse of Lost Soul Aside, on </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5El-yYNUwU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>your YouTube channel</strong></u></a><strong>. How did you get started on this project, and how old were you at the time?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So I remember our first promotional video was released in 2016. I was born in 1990, so when the video was released, I was about 26 years old, so that was actually when the project started. I remember [Lost Soul Aside] probably started around, at the end of 2014, the beginning of 2015.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/lsa-1739990523109.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Expect massive set-piece battles in Lost Soul Aside. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What were the original inspirations behind Lost Soul Aside? Has that ever shifted over the course of development?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So personally, I have loved playing games since I was young. And of course, back at that time, I had some personal favorite genres. Later on, [my] passion towards games wasn't changed, didn't change a lot. So I wanted to develop something that I really like. And then the tools and game engines were relatively mature. So that was the beginning of [Lost Soul Aside].</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The overall style and then, the inspiration, has not changed that much. From the beginning, the beginning of 2016 until now, about like nine years or 10 years, it continues to feature a blend of fantasy elements with some realistic visuals, characterized by this real-life aesthetic. So this style has not changed. The combat style has also consistently leaned towards high speed and flashy action. So this is something that we have been sticking to for all these years. During this development process, we, of course, continued to see some new and excellent works, which maybe we got some influence through, [on] our thought along the way. So from the beginning, this personal trailer gradually evolved into a more mature and well-run version, I should say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How did the Sony collaboration come around? Can you describe what that first meeting was like, and how the partnership has been since?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> Well, actually, back to 2016, I had some contact [with a] PlayStation colleague. That was, for me, a turning point, which I think is quite remarkable. So when I released this promotional video, I got a message from a colleague at PlayStation, who said that they wanted to discuss the project in detail and explore a potential collaboration. Back at that time, I was still in South Korea, and I felt really grateful for this opportunity. At the end of 2016, I went back to China and then immediately, I went to PlayStation, Sony in Shanghai, visited them, and met with them in person. And so from that time, we kind of started our collaboration. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent years, the collaboration has been continuously deepening. Initially, it started with the Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-investing-further-in-chinese-development-program-genshin-impact"><u>China Hero Project</u></a>. And then, later on, we kind of joined this collaboration with Sony, and then Sony officially announced that it's going to be published by PlayStation.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What would you say makes Lost Soul Aside stand out from other games in its genre?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So the play will be very smooth, because we think that when the players play, they will likely be impressed by the overall operability of the game, including the combat experience and the interaction with the environment. It will be very smooth. And in order to achieve this kind of smooth feeling, we actually try our best, utmost, to ensure that the player's input receives immediate feedback. For example, all the weapons can be switched seamlessly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the combat for this kind of skill combination can be combined seamlessly as well. All the skills can be canceled as well. We have spent a significant amount of time ensuring that everything flows as smoothly as possible. So, this is something that I think will impress players the most. And then, furthermore, the intent, our intention, is to shape the two main characters, the combination, Kaser and Arena. So we can provide players with the option like turning Arena into a weapon and other elements, to help Kaser fight in battle. [He] can provide some help during his journey. So I think that all these elements combining together can become a very outstanding and recognizable aspect for our game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Where did the concept for Arena, the transforming dragon companion Kazer has, come from?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So that kind of idea and thought actually started at a very, very, very early stage, even before this project started back to 2016. So, I remember I watched some YouTube video... there's a special effects creator who makes a segment featuring a crystal that can [transform] into various weapons, a shade, and many other things. Combined with my idea, I always thought about this idea, about a dragon [that] can transform, all kinds of shapes. Even before this game project has started, I had the idea about something like this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than this dragon, I was thinking that the protagonist has a companion, which at that time is somewhat similar to a dragon-like creature that can transform into a weapon, [to help] the character, assisting in the battle. So I always had this kind of idea from the beginning, I had the idea to incorporate [it] into this project. This idea that the protagonist has a dragon partner that can become a weapon, this idea actually, I had it since 2014.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/lsa-again-1739990287639.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">In Lost Soul Aside you play Kaser, who has help from a transforming dragon. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What ideas and themes does Lost Soul Aside center on, that you want players to take away from this game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So, the core theme primarily just revolves around Kaser, the protagonist, and his companion Arena, and they embark on various adventures together. And of course, during that process they face numerous challenges, including traps and a variety of formidable enemies. So the focus is on Kaser, who starts off as an ordinary individual, an ordinary person. And then after he meets Arena, and then later, they continuously establish some kind of relationship with other characters. So in this adventure, we want the players to experience the growth of the characters, transforming from ordinary people, or him from an ordinary person at the beginning, to a hero who can save the world by the end. Of course, saving the world was not his initial intention, but players can gradually and consciously embrace the idea of saving the world and defeating villains throughout the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What's been the biggest challenge you've faced, working on this one game for so long?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So, well, it started from the idea, [my] personal idea, and then it's a promotion video, it's a conceptual idea. And then we have to accumulate experience and to enhance the development experience during all this process and all these years. So, I think this is very essential, for developing this kind of skill and type of project, this is one thing. And then the other challenge for me, I should say this because for me, I started from my personal ideas. I work. I used to work just by myself. And later on, I continuously [accumulated] knowledge on how to collaborate with other members as a team, with the help of Sony PlayStation, and now because we have established a team. So it requires everyone to come together to make the idea happen. So for me, this is constantly a learning process, and I need to overcome this challenge to make the project a successful one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You're planning to launch day one for both PC and PS5? What was the reasoning behind targeting both for the launch, over just PlayStation?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So, launch for PC as well. I think it's a very new experience for players and it would be quite intriguing for them, I think. So this is the final stage, and the final decision was made during the communication process between me and Sony. So I feel that everyone cooperated in a very good manner and harmoniously throughout all the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>After working on Lost Soul Aside for so long, are you excited for whatever comes next for yourself and Ultizero Games?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> Well, so at this stage, and then both my team, and myself, and the PlayStation team, we're continuously communicating with each other about the follow-up plans. I'm sorry, I cannot provide a very clear answer at this moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>But you're excited to get Lost Soul Aside out there?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> Yes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lost Soul Aside launches on PS5 and PC on May 30, 2025.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Across from the boots, you can find another cave, which can be opened using fire, and the chest can be accessed after using Yatzli's disillusion spell, but this loot is unrelated to the treasure map.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4446716-avowed2025-02-1913-31-19large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4446716" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4446716-avowed2025-02-1913-31-19large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4446716"></a><figcaption>Loot the Wavebinder Boots to complete the quest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4446716-avowed2025-02-1913-31-19large.jpeg"></figure><p>The Wavefinder Boots offer two passive bonuses.

            <p>
Almost two years after the acclaimed first season of HBO's live-action The Last of Us adaptation drew to a close, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-we-know-about-the-last-of-us-season-2">long-awaited second season</a> finally has a release date - with episode one set to air in the US on Sunday, 13th April.
</p>
<p>
Season two of The Last of Us picks up some five years after the events of season one, and will at least partially cover <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s second game. Showrunner Craig Mazin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">previously confirmed</a> the team would need more than one season to cover The Last of Us Part 2's narrative.
</p>
<p>
"The story that we're telling is much bigger than the story of season one," Mazin explained at the time. "There's just a lot more going on, it's a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster to be honest with you."

<p>
Season two of The Last of Us is set to span seven episodes - including one that's "quite big" in length - and will usher in a new cast of characters alongside returning favourites. Joel and Ellie are inevitably back (once again played by	Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey) and will this time be joined by the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-series-casts-beef-actor-young-mazino-as-jesse">Young Mazino as Jesse</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">legendary Catherine O'Hara in an undisclosed guest role</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us' second season - part two of an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbo-expects-the-last-of-us-to-run-for-four-seasons">expected four-season run</a> - airs on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hbo-max">HBO Max</a> in the US beginning 13th April. There's no word on international airdates just yet, but Sky Atlantic's ongoing partnership with HBO suggests it'll continue to be the series' home in the UK - possibly again airing simultaneously with the US for those that like to remain unsullied by social media.
</p>
<p>
Season one of The Last of Us was a smash hit for HBO, garnering significant critical acclaim and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-averaging-32m-viewers-per-episode-in-us-most-watched-hbo-max-show-in-europe">averaging over 32m viewers</a> an episode in the US. And with eight Emmy nominations under its belt - including an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">outstanding guest actor gong for Nick Offerman</a> in the role of Bill - expectations are invariably high for season two.

            <title><![CDATA[Contrary To Popular Belief, Streaming On Twitch Is Work]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-twitch-stream-big-book</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/contrary-to-popular-belief-streaming-on-twitch-is-work.1113882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-twitch-stream-big-book<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the uninitiated, Twitch is a hotbed of potential misconceptions. Conversely, if you’re deep in it, Twitch is exceedingly fertile soil for <em>different </em>misconceptions. There’s a lot to misconcept, is what I’m saying, whether we’re talking regular people who think streamers are all millionaires with the world’s cushiest job or megafans who harbor <a href="https://aftermath.site/stream-big-book-excerpt-twitch-dream-face-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the parasocial delusion</a> that they know their favorite streamer better than anybody else on Earth. This sounds like a job for <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/you-are-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You Are Error</a>, Aftermath’s podcast about gaming’s greatest misconceptions.</p><p>Just a heads up that this episode is a little different. As those of you who follow me probably know – because I will not shut up about it – I wrote a book! It’s called <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Stream Big: The Triumphs And Turmoils Of Twitch And The Stars Behind The Screen</em></a>, and it’s out now! You can find it online and wherever books are sold.</p><p>Each chapter is about a different streamer as a lens through which to view Twitch and the way platforms shape people and vice versa. Some of the featured creators, like Amouranth, Dream, and Hasan Piker, are big – household names in certain corners of the internet. Others are smaller and more susceptible to stumbling as the ground beneath them shifts, often as a result of platforms’ money-hungry whims. There are rises and falls, stories of unlikely success as well as uglier topics like abuse, harassment, grooming, stalking, and swatting. It’s a lot, but I’m very proud of how it turned out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Stream Big</em> was partially born of a desire to clear up misconceptions surrounding Twitch, livestreaming, and content creators, so a discussion of the book seemed like a natural fit for this show. Then I realized it was also a golden opportunity for one of my favorite things, <em>inter-Aftermath brand synergy</em>, which prompted a eureka moment: I could bring on other members of the staff to ask me questions about a subject I’ve spent the past more-than-half-a-decade investigating.&nbsp;</p><p>I decided on Riley and Luke, neither of whom consider themselves all that well-versed in Twitch or the world of content creation, because I figured they’d be best-equipped to present their own misconceptions in an honest and curious way. Also, Luke is a self-proclaimed Twitch hater, and haters always ask the best questions.</p><p>So if you’ve always wondered what the deal is with Twitch and the creators on it – why and how they’ve managed to amass so much influence within the world of video games, especially as the more traditional press fades into an, at best, secondary role – this is the episode for you. Also, fair warning, this conversation’s a little less structured than usual, but hopefully you’ll still enjoy it. I know I did.&nbsp;</p><p>You can listen to the show on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7w7V296dt8HCoDryWiofI4?si=f79446b5647c44bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/you-are-error/id1782231480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, please consider leaving a review so that thousands of people can form a parasocial relationship with You Are Error, and I can tell all of them to cut it out.</p><p>Here are excerpts from our conversation, deftly edited to make a coherent point much more quickly than we did during the actual conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> A thing that I was very intentional about with this book was doing all of the main interviews in person. Generally, I sought to conduct them in that person’s home, to actually go behind the scenes of their lives. Because a thing about Twitch that I think a lot of people believe – and hey, we’re back to misconceptions, the topic of this show – is that as a result of watching somebody on camera for eight or even just a few hours per day, they feel like they know everything about that person and, as an extension of that, everything about their career. What could they possibly be missing?</p><p>I wanted to reveal all of the other stuff that goes into somebody being a professional Twitch streamer, making enough money to have a family and a house and all of that stuff. And so I was like “It’s gotta be in person. I’ve gotta see this world with my own two eyes to be able to reveal the things that are actually happening here that don’t make it onto the broadcast.” Because if I was only talking to streamers on the phone, why not just write some articles? If I was gonna make a book out of this, it needed to go an extra step.</p><p>And it was really useful. For example, the chapter I wrote about Cohh Carnage is very much centered on his home. His ambition is to keep streaming for his whole life – for this to always be his job. And so he bought a house that has an elevator in it, specifically because he’s like “Yeah, when I’m 75, and I need to get downstairs, I can’t take the stairs. So I’ll take this elevator and show up like I do every day.” He was showing me all these parts of his house, too. He has a generator so that if the power goes out while he’s streaming, he won’t miss a beat. He and his family are in kind of an isolated area, so he had all these things installed to make sure his internet is of the highest possible quality. He’s all in on streaming, which makes sense; he’s been doing this for more than a decade already.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> That dovetails into a misconception I had because I’m old: I think I still think about it as like “You’re gonna be a Twitch streamer, and you’re gonna make millions of dollars, and that’s your job.” But I think your book points out that everybody doesn’t become a millionaire, and that’s not the end for a lot of people. What is “You can make millions playing video games” for 2025?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> First off, there is this conception for a lot of people that Twitch streamers hit it big and get rich, when the reality is that well under one percent of streamers on Twitch even make minimum wage from streaming. Under 0.1% [as of 2021]. If you look at the top 10,000 streamers in terms of the money they’re making, you drop out of minimum wage before you hit the end of the list. So those are the people making a proper living on Twitch. That’s not many people out of the millions who stream.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>One of the main things that I wanted to express in this book and clear up as a misconception is that streaming is work. It is absolutely work. It is absolutely skilled labor. To maintain an audience – especially a big audience – just by being present and being yourself and talking for many hours per day, often with only chat to play off of, most people can’t do that. 99.9 percent of people can’t do that.&nbsp;</p><p>Even sometimes when we’re doing the Aftermath Hours stream, I’ll wonder how successful streamers keep their chats moving consistently on a daily basis. Because ours will just stop, and that’ll be it. When a chat loses momentum, it’s just kinda over. The fact that there are people who can, through sheer magnetism and ability to understand how this organism works, command that, it’s crazy to me. And it takes a lot of energy. There’s a reason why it’s the main thing these people do. They stream all day, manage their business by night, and they don’t have tremendously active lives outside of that.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s been this ongoing debate about whether or not streaming is a real job. Any time a streamer brings up this notion that they’re working, people are like “Yeah, but you’re not working in the service industry. You’re not doing construction. So you have no right to complain, and actually you should shut up forever.” </p><p>And it’s like, yeah, streaming is more enjoyable in some ways, but work is work no matter what the job is that you’re doing. And something I wanted the book to convey is that this is how capitalism is structured and how it seeks to divide us. We’re all in thrall to some larger force, and there are a lot of times where no matter what we’re doing, even if it seems appealing from the outside looking in, we’re not having a great time. We’re being pressured into overworking or burning out. And if we don’t, the whole thing falls apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-sad-trombone"><h3>How’s That AI Future Looking?</h3></a><p>The Humane AI pin died on the way back to its home planet</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riverbank-rpg-brings-cozy-animal-whimsy-to-gaming-tables<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kobold Press has announced a new TTRPG. The tabletop studio, known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 5e supplements and their original fantasy RPG <em>Tales of the Valiant</em>, is launching a campaign for <em>Riverbank</em> RPG, a more cozy experience with talking animals and whimsy.</p>

<h2>The <em>Riverbank</em> RPG Announcement</h2>

<p>In a report <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/kobold-press-announces-cosy-rpg-riverbank.711779/" rel="nofollow">by EN World</a>, the <em>Riverbank</em> RPG involves you playing as a member of a society of anthropomorphic animals. Their concerns aren't life and death but of cake and teatime by the slow part of the river. It is a cottagecore experience that is less <em>Redwall</em> and more <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riverbank-rpg-dressed-animals.jpg?itok=uh08AAtu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riverbank-rpg-dressed-animals.jpg?itok=IyvI3u_S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It is a cozy experience where roleplaying and decisions impact the narrative. Players can weave farcical fables or dramatic tales of elegant animals on curious quests, navigate polite Animal society, and weather the unique dynamics of life. Challenges or tensions may include attending tea parties, dancing at fancy balls, and dodging difficult relatives.</p>

<p>Since the focus is more on social navigation than swords and magic, the <em>Riverbank</em> RPG will utilize an original TTRPG system. Three to five players use D4s, D6s, and D12s to resolve decisions. In addition, they must manage their characters' Animality and Poetry sides. If you fall too far one particular side, disaster may soon follow.</p>

<p>The <em>Riverbank</em> RPG was created and written by the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author Kij Johnson, the same creative mind behind <em>Ponies</em> and<em> The Fox Woman</em>. In addition, the RPG features the work of British Fantasy Award and World Fantasy Award-winning artist Kathleen Jennings.</p>

<p>Given Kobold Press' clear stances <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kobold-press-ceo-says-no-to-generative-ai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">against generative AI</a>, their support of these acclaimed creatives showcases their dedication to artistic projects created with human hands.</p>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/67b1a3f2-6637-4c01-a5d3-bd3f22b78591/landing" rel="nofollow">Backerkit page</a>, the <em>Riverbank</em> RPG crowdfunding campaign will go live on March 31. At the time of writing, there are no further details regarding pledge levels, add-ons, or additional books or supplements.</p>

It’s not like Ellie, Joel, and Abby need much of an update for modern audiences. But while the slightly enhanced graphics — which include native 4K support and improved frame rates — are nice, they’re not really the reason to play <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>. Instead, it’s all of the <em>other</em> stuff that turns this into an excellent special edition of the game.</p><p>Some of the additions are relatively small. There’s a guitar mode where you can, well, play guitar as much as you want. Using the PlayStation controller’s touchpad to swipe guitar strings was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21318499/the-last-of-us-part-2-guitar-learn-how-to-play">one of the highlights of the original release</a>, and it’s nice to be able to mess around with it freely. I’m sure we’ll see some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6_TtIqnOsY">very cool videos</a> of people rocking out soon. You can also unlock outfits to wear while playing the main game, which is silly but fun. I’m 10 hours deep into a New Game Plus run, and Ellie has been wearing a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"><em>Death Stranding</em></a> T-shirt the entire time (even though that game couldn’t exist in <em>TLOU</em>’s timeline).</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjE2MDE2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616016/the-last-of-us-season-2-date-hbo">The Last of Us season 2 finally has a premiere date</a></h2></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTM4NzM=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24255066/the-last-of-us-tlou-season-two-teaser-trailer">The Last of Us’ new season 2 trailer puts Joel and Ellie through the wringer</a></h2><div><p>Warner Bros.

And as a result, the show’s second season will be a few episodes shorter than the first.</p><p>“The story material that we got from <em>Part II</em> of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin explained. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.” (Season 1 clocked in at nine episodes, for comparison.)</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/5/24172396/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-count-hbo">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Mr. Wright goes to (the) Washington (Liberation Front).</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>A first look at The Last of Us season 2.</p><p>We may have to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23991040/the-last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-house-of-dragon-euphoria-streaming">wait until next year</a> to return to the post-apocalyptic show, but HBO has released these images to hold us over.

Joel walks on top of the broken watch gifted to him by his daughter Sarah at the beginning of the outbreak, Ellie stands on the guitar Joel will likely give her in the first episode of season two, and Abby is shown on top of a Firefly pendant.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-co-director-chris-wilson-leaves-grinding-gear-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to recent document filings, Path of Exile Co-Director Chris Wilson has quietly left Grinding Gear Games, the studio that was co-founded in 2006 and has recently released Path of Exile 2 in Early Access. This information is public in the <a href="https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/1887410/37860802/entityFilingRequirement?backurl=%2Fcompanies%2Fapp%2Fui%2Fpages%2Fcompanies%2F1887410%2Fdocuments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Zealand Companies Office</a>, where it says that Wilson "ceased" his role as Managing Director on January 21, 2025. Despite his quiet exit, it hasn't been officially announced by Grinding Gear Games.</p>
<p>While the company has not publicly announced his departure, there have been questions from Path of Exile players about his whereabouts, as they have noticed that he has been absent in <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/search/results/chris/search-within/threads-posts/forums/54/time/past-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the forums</a> and asked where he had gone. Players feel that Path of Exile 1 is on a downward trend without him being around and feel that the developers are failing those who still play the original with their <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-really-sorry-for-how-this-went-down-work-on-path-of-exile-1-326-on-hold-until-path-of-exile-2-020-has-shipped-dev-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent announcements</a> regarding updates to the predecessor of Path of Exile 2.</p>
<p>Chris Wilson was a huge part of the team, as he co-directed the first game alongside Mark Roberts. However, he did not join the co-directing of Path of Exile 2. His focus remained on the first game, and he remained a public figure regarding the development, updates, and marketing of Path of Exile. Whenever there were issues in the original game, such as streamers getting access to expansions before the rest of the players, he would dive in and give a statement as necessary.</p>
<p>Path of Exile was first released in 2013, and Wilson spoke about the plans for the ARPG to be "played forever" at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmuy9fyNUjY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2019</a>, and the decisions that went into crafting the game to be accessible and enjoyable for the long term.</p>
<p>Since then, Grinding Gear Games has been hard at work on Path of Exile 2, which entered Early Access in December 2024 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Thus far, the game has been highly successful, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/">game breaking records on Steam</a> alongside games like Marvel Rivals. Since its release, the game has received a multitude of updates and fixes to ensure that the game is well on its way to the full release that is planned for May.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 was originally meant to be a new storyline that could be played separately from Path of Exile, but it then expanded so much that it turned into its own game, which seems to have worked out for Grinding Gear Games thus far.</p>
<p>Whether the announcement of Chris Wilson's departure will be made public by Grinding Gear Games or the man himself remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/615768/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-drop-physx-support-32-bit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Remember PhysX, the GPU-accelerated technology that let games realistically simulate destructible cloth, shattering glass, moving liquids, smoke, fog, and other particle effects? It only ever got deployed in a few dozen games — but with 32-bit PhysX turned on, those games reportedly now run faster on<em> Nvidia’s last-gen cards</em> than they do on a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5090</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">5080</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/615075/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-review-test-benchmark">5070 Ti</a> or beyond.</p><p>That’s because Nvidia has quietly removed support for PhysX in its latest graphics chips, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fgame-ready-drivers%2F13%2F557200%2Fgeforce-grd-57242-feedback-thread-released-21325%2F3501715%2F" rel="sponsored">the company confirmed this week</a>, after buyers noticed PhysX games like <em>Borderlands 2</em> were mysteriously taxing their CPU instead of their GPU and either chugging or failing to work. Nvidia points to <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5615/">a support page from January</a> where it did say that the RTX 50 series would not support 32-bit CUDA applications, but that page doesn’t explicitly mention PhysX, and the company’s other PhysX support pages are several years old.</p><p>Again, we’re talking about mere dozens of games here, all over a decade old, but a good number of them were marketed by Nvidia as showcase PC games thanks to their physics simulations — and a handful of those were at least cult hits.</p><p>I fondly remember PhysX cloth effects in <em>Mirror’s Edge </em>(above) and the <em>Batman: Arkham </em>games. The best <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> also used it (<em>Black Flag</em>, the pirate one, don’t @ me) and so did <em>Metro 2033 </em>and <em>Metro: Last Light</em>.</p><p>And as you can see in the video just above, PhysX just doesn’t run terribly well without a GPU’s assistance, tanking performance when its effects are most vividly felt on screen.</p><p>Over on the ResetEra forums, RandomlyRandom67 is maintaining<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rtx-50-series-gpus-have-dropped-support-for-32-bit-physx-many-older-pc-games-are-impacted-mirrors-edge-borderlands-etc.1111698/"> an updated list of 32-bit PhysX games and how they perform on a CPU</a> instead of a GPU — users are reporting that <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>, <em>Batman</em>: <em>Arkham Asylum </em>and <em>Batman</em>: <em>Arkham City</em>, and <em>Cryostasis</em> all have significantly lower lows.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1irs8xk/comment/mdauwh3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">One Redditor claims</a> that when they forced PhysX on in <em>Borderlands 2, </em>they “got drops to below 60 FPS by just standing and shooting a shock gun at a wall,” despite having a system with today’s top PC components (an RTX 5090 and an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D). They claim their RTX 4090 never dipped below 120fps in the same game.</p><p>I won’t terribly miss PhysX, because modern games have plenty of other ways to do physics built into their various engines, but Nvidia could probably have communicated this better. It’s also just the latest evidence that its RTX 50-series cards aren’t the upgrades we’d hoped. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/615075/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-review-test-benchmark">My colleague Tom reviewed the new RTX 5070 Ti today</a>, and found it’s largely a cheaper RTX 4080, except maybe not cheaper because you probably won’t be able to find one anywhere near its $750 sticker price.</p><p>Nvidia’s older cards don’t seem to be losing value as a result of this year’s upgrades, either: the street price of an RTX 4080 has actually jumped over the past month, from an average eBay selling price of around $1,000 in January to over $1,200 now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>After the story events unravel in Dawnshore, you'll make your way to the Emerald Stair map in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>. The ambassador has heard that the Dreamscourge has started to take over the region and he wants you to investigate what's going on in the main city of Fior mes Iverno. You're able to travel to Emerald Stair through a gate and arrive to a map that's fully covered with fog, exactly how Dawnshore was when you firs started the game.</p><p>While it's exciting to uncover a new map, it can also be a little overwhelming, as you're not sure where to go. Fortunately, we took the time to completely uncover Emerald Stair's map so you know everything it has to offer in Avowed.</p><h2>Full Emerald Stair Map in Avowed</h2><p>Compared to Dawnshore, Emerald Stair is a much more open map that's not as full of buildings and dedicated roads to follow. While there are still roads and plenty of locations to visit, you'll find more room to roam in the animancer paradise. Emerald Stair has a total of six large regions, including Fior mes Iverno, and they are as follows:</p><ul><li>Fior mes Iverno</li><li>Maxim's Claim</li><li>Rolling Crags</li><li>The Wildwoods</li><li>The Delemgan Glade</li><li>Grim Wetlands</li></ul><p>You'll find a majority of the map's distinct regions in the bottom half of the map, but there are still sights to see in the northern parts of the map as well. Below, you can see full images of the Emerald Stair fully uncovered in Avowed:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446341-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.23.79.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446341" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446341-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.23.79.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446341"></a><figcaption>Northern Emerald Stair map in Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446341-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.23.79.png"></figure><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446342-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.15.92.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446342" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446342-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.15.92.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446342"></a><figcaption>Southern Emerald Stair map in Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446342-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.15.92.png"></figure><p>As you can see, Fior mes Iverno as a whole is covered. When you enter the hub city, you can bring up a dedicated map showcasing its unique shops and areas. Then, when you exit the city, you'll see the normal Emerald Stair map again.</p><h2>Emerald Stair Key Points of Interest</h2><p>While Emerald Stair isn't quite as large as Dawnshore, it still has plenty to offer. As always, there are treasure maps to find and follow as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-all-totem-of-defiance-pieces-and-locations-in-emerald-stair/1100-6529471/" data-ref-id="1100-6529471">Totem of Defiance</a> pieces to gather. There's also a total of 15 fast travel beacons and nine Party Camps, so you have no shortage of ways to get around the map.</p><p>You can see a full accounting of other major points of interest in Emerald Stair below:</p><p><strong>Strangled Adra</strong></p><ul><li>Directly to the north of Tama's Cabin and to the northeast The Delemgan Glade. You have to climb a small cliff to reach the Adra, which is sitting at the top of the cliff.</li></ul><p><strong>The Voice</strong></p><ul><li>The Voice's Memory is located right near the Ranger Outpost area just to the south of The Wildwoods. It's also near a fast travel beacon and not too difficult to reach.</li></ul><p><strong>Pargrun Cache</strong></p><ul><li>The Emerald Stair Pargrun Cache is located to the west of The Wildwoods and south of The Delemgan Glade. It's tucked away near the western edge of the map in the middle of a forest.</li></ul><p><strong>Treasure Maps</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-earthy-aegis-treasure-map-location/1100-6529528/" data-ref-id="1100-6529528">Earthy Aegis</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-practical-pockets-treasure-map-location/1100-6529529/" data-ref-id="1100-6529529">Practical Pockets</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-painters-regret-treasure-map-location/1100-6529527/" data-ref-id="1100-6529527">Painter's Regret</a></li></ul><p><strong>Mapping the Living Lands Cartographer </strong></p><ul><li>Near the Naku Tedek Grounds in the south part of Emerald Stair (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-emerald-stair-cartographer-location-for-mapping-the-living-lands/1100-6529445/" data-ref-id="1100-6529445">exact location in a separate guide</a>)</li></ul><p>And that wraps up all the major points of interest in Emerald Stair.

                <p>Dawnshore is the first official map you can visit in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>. It's the home to Paradis, where you, as the official Aedryan envoy, need to meet with the ambassador to discuss the growing concern of the Dreamscourge. Of course, Dawnshore is home to much more than Paradis, and the fairly large map can be explored in its entirety as soon as you get off the boat at Claviger's Landing. While we recommend you complete some main story missions first, you'll eventually want to explore the majority of Dawnshore to see everything that Avowed has to offer in its opening hours.</p><p>We went through the trouble of uncovering all the necessary fog on the Dawnshore map so you know exactly where everything is located. Below, you can see the map completely uncovered along with some key points of interest.</p><h2>Full Dawnshore Map in Avowed</h2><p>If you think Paradis is big when you arrive in the city, you haven't seen anything yet. The map of Dawnshore is a gorgeous place full of secret caves, dangerously high vistas, and several different regions. In total, there are seven major regions including Paradis, and they are:</p><ul><li>Paradis</li><li>Ondra's Reach</li><li>Ivona's Threshold</li><li>Fractured Shore</li><li>Southern Embrace</li><li>Overgrown Frontier</li><li>The Rise</li></ul><p>To see everything Dawnshore has to offer, you want to visit all seven of these regions, where you'll find smaller areas that can be explored. Here are full images of the entire uncovered Dawnshore map:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446329-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.51.44.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446329" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446329-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.51.44.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446329"></a><figcaption>Northern Dawnshore map in Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446329-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.51.44.png"></figure><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446327-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.42.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446327-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.42.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446327"></a><figcaption>Southern Dawnshore map in Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446327-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.42.16.png"></figure><p>The only covered part of the map is Paradis Hightown, which can't be uncovered on the map. Instead, you can visit that location directly and view a dedicated map that showcases all of its different areas.</p><h2>Dawnshore Key Points of Interest</h2><p>Dawnshore certainly has plenty to see and do, including going on a few different treasure map hunts and finding all the pieces to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-all-totem-of-rightful-rulership-locations-in-dawnshore/1100-6529446/" data-ref-id="1100-6529446">Totem of Rightful Rulership</a>.</p><p>In total, there are 11 fast travel beacons and four Party Camps in Dawnshore, giving you plenty of ways to get around the map quicker. If you want to find all the fast travel beacons, follow the red lines that become visible on the map as you uncover more fog. Those red lines represent the main road, and fast travel beacons mostly spawn along those lines.</p><p>Below, we'll list off some points of interest in Dawnshore and where you can find them so you can visit them quickly as you play:</p><p><strong>Strangled Adra</strong></p><ul><li>Right behind the Emerald Stair Gatehouse on the far eastern side of Dawnshore</li></ul><p><strong>The Voice</strong></p><ul><li>On the edge of the Watcher's Mirror location, which is northeast of Paradis and facing the far eastern river</li></ul><p><strong>Pargrun Cache</strong></p><ul><li>For sweet rewards, head to the top of Dawnshore right above the Pilgrim's Path and Godless Ruins. There you'll find the Pargrun Cache, which requires some work to get into but has a chest full of unique rewards. Every map in Avowed has a Pargrun Cache.</li></ul><p><strong>Treasure Maps</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-intimidating-feline-codpiece-treasure-map-location/1100-6529375/" data-ref-id="1100-6529375">Intimidating Feline Codpiece</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-captain-henquas-spoils-treasure-map-location/1100-6529374/" data-ref-id="1100-6529374">Captain Henqua's Spoils</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-woedicas-inheritance-treasure-map-location/1100-6529372/" data-ref-id="1100-6529372">Woedica's Inheritance</a></li></ul><p><strong>Mapping the Living Lands Cartographer </strong></p><ul><li>Near the Usher's Hand area to the east of Paradis (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-dawnshore-cartographer-location-for-mapping-the-living-lands/1100-6529403/" data-ref-id="1100-6529403">exact location in a separate guide</a>)</li></ul><p>That just about does it for all the main points of interest on the Dawnshore map in Avowed.
