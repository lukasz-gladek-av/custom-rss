			<p>Crimson Desert developer and publisher Pearl Abyss has debuted a new 13-minute gameplay video showcasing a snippet of what Gamescom 2025 attendees will get a chance to play in the coming week.</p>



<p>The action-adventure game was delayed just days prior to this new gameplay drop, pushing the game into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">first quarter of Pearl Abyss' FY2026</a>. It's the game's second major delay, as it was initially meant to arrive <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-rumored-to-launch-early-next-year-following-gamescom-demo/">sometime earlier this year</a> after a demo showcase at <a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/">Gamescom 2024</a>, and then when that didn't happen, it was supposed to release sometime in fall 2025.</p>



<p>Now, of course, we'll have to wait a little longer to get our hands on it unless you'll be at Gamescom 2025, where you'll get to play the sections featured in this video and a bit more.</p>



<p>This gameplay showcase features a look at a few moments of narrative and exploration, but the highlight of the video is the extended look at combat, including a boss fight towards the back-half of the video.</p>



<p>At this point in the game's story, Crimson Desert's protagonist, Greymane Kliff, and his companions are ambushed, narrowly surviving the attack before Kliff has to take on the boss you'll see in the video, Cassius Morten.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Crimson Desert was first revealed all the way back in 2019, and with its release now set for sometime next year, it'll potentially be seven years from its reveal to its release. </p>



<p>At least it appears to be worth the wait, if the final gameplay experience is as polished as these gameplay videos make it seem. Hopefully, we'll have a proper release date to look forward to soon.</p>

              <p>Super-realistic revenge shooter <em>Better Than Dead</em> has just been announced, along with an intensely violent trailer. The brutal game, in which you play as a Chinese woman who has escaped from slavery and is now exacting revenge on the photo-realistic streets of Hong Kong, is all depicted as if from bodycam footage. And—wow—even the trailer is tough viewing. It looks amazing and terrifyingly real, and I suspect this could become gaming’s next big controversy.</p> <p>With each new graphical generation over the last 30 years, the FPS genre transformed from the cartoonish arcade styles of&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> to the ultra-realistic visceral depictions of, well, <em>Doom</em>. Along the way, as fidelity improved, the FPS always courted controversy, with mainstream attention grabbed on the advent of games like 1999’s <em>Kingpin: Life of Crime</em>, 2000’s&nbsp;<em>Soldier of Fortune</em>, and any number of&nbsp;<em>Call</em>s<em> of Duty</em>. However, the genre has been so damned impressive-looking for so long now, it feels like the corners have rubbed down on the reactions. Attempts at moral panics have more recently focused on subject matter over looks, as we’ve all become inured to hyper-realistically shooting the kneecaps off our enemies. But I wonder whether&nbsp;<em>Better Than Dead</em> might trigger a new wave of concern.</p> <p>As a games critic who’s been around for the entire evolution of the genre, I think I’m pretty acclimatized to the whole shebang, and have read enough well-researched studies over the years to know that there’s never been a proven significant link between video-game violence and real-world violence. Which is my needlessly pompous way of saying: I love a good violent game! Gib me up any time. So it really took me back when I had such a visceral reaction to the trailer for <em>Better Than Dead</em>. It’s not because of the gun violence, or the blood splatters, or even that the protagonist’s targets are often running in fear (although it was that a bit); it’s that it’s all depicted as the most extraordinarily realistic bodycam footage.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Better Than Dead - MicroProse Publishing Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YqXZ1gPmU2E?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Real-world violence is something I go out of my way to avoid seeing, and when bodycam footage is released of police brutality and unlawful killings, I’ll desperately try to avoid seeing it. Like most people, I’m very able to separate fantasy and reality, and can enjoy blowing the brains out of perfectly rendered aliens at the same time as being horrified by seeing a living human in pain. But when video game brutality is depicted in such a specific format, complete with the curving of the fish-eye lens and those grainy textures typical of low-grade video recordings, that line for me is incredibly blurred.</p> <p>As a result, the footage of&nbsp;<em>Better Than Dead</em> incessantly swam down the uncanny valley, at times looking completely photo-realistic, and others clearly being video game graphics. What disturbed me more than anything else was not the blood from gunshots—that was cartoonish if anything—but the <em>walls</em>. I know that sounds silly, but there’s something about how utterly lifelike they were, the way the surface textures speckled with artifacts just like when you see real bodycam footage. They become the most incredibly convincing aspect of the trailer, selling the perspective such that everything else feels so much more real.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617987"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617987">© Ubisoft / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <p>The slightly silly perspective from which FPS games have always been viewed gives off the feeling that you’re a head with a gun jutting out just below your chin. Yes, some let you look down and see your feet, but it’s always felt far more like you’re playing a floating camera than a person. But a bodycam—that makes sense of the whole format. That <em>is</em> a floating camera, and suddenly the genre is given a pragmatic reality that I’ve found incredibly jarring.</p>

 <p>Then, added to this view, is the fisheye lens and faux-low-grade footage. It’s really interesting how incredibly effective this is every time the game shows something set outside, and how bizarrely crap it appears when indoors. That’s largely due to how awful the textures are in the office interior where a weird amount of the footage is set—those drink bottles and monitors look like something from the early 2000s, so jarringly different from the moments when it cuts to exterior action and then, good god, it looks like real life. The pixelating of faces, however, works both indoors and out, because oh my goodness that’s chilling. It all adds to the sense of this being genuine footage, recovered and edited.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617986"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617986">© MicroProse / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course, were this idea being used for a game about, I dunno, saving people from danger, it would offer that same down-to-earth naturalism, but perhaps not be quite so disturbing.&nbsp;<em>Better Than Dead</em> is a game about a young woman who has escaped from cruel slavery exacting her murderous revenge on every single person involved—and from the footage, presumably everyone else nearby as well. According to the press release announcing the game, “In <em>Better Than Dead</em>, you’re not just surviving—you’re retaliating. Once held captive and humiliated on film by those who broke her, the protagonist now turns the camera on them. One by one, they’ll fall. Every mission is a ruthless, high-stakes raid through the underbelly of Hong Kong. No remorse. No hesitation. Only vengeance.”</p>

 <p>The game cites “gritty Hong Kong action cinema of the ’80s and ’90s” as its inspiration, although it’s hard not to think of Park Chan-wook’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vengeance_Trilogy">Vengeance Trilogy</a> when it comes to people released from unfair captivity and seeking brutal revenge on their captors. And those films didn’t exactly land without their share of controversy.</p> <p>Now, there’s a decent chance the game will be no good. This is being published by one-time PC gaming powerhouse MicroProse, the biggest surprise there being that MicroProse is still a thing. (In fact, I looked it up and it seems to be back in the hands of at least one of the original early-’80s founders.) Even more strange is that behind <em>Better Than Dead</em> is a solo developer who has previously only released a super-cute vertical FPS called (somehow)&nbsp;<em>Forza Polpo!</em>, and a demo for a chibi cartoon-like non-violent platformer called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2600000/Mountain_Boy/"><em>Mountain Boy</em></a>. This is, er, something of a shift.</p> <p>But of course, it’s not whether a game’s good or not that riles the pearl-clutching press who love to pretend to be horrified that games are training your kids for their next high school shooting. And yes, when this is eventually released (there’s no date yet), it could come and go with no one noticing—these things often do. But what remains so interesting to me, as an inoculated player of violent games for 40 years, is how it made me sit back in shock. I can’t think of a trailer that’s done that in years, perhaps even not since <em>Soldier of Fortune</em>‘s deeply unpleasant depictions of violence 25 years ago seemed to shock the whole games industry into backing off and focusing on excitement instead of brutality for a good few years after.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 developers have already made changes to the Rush mode, which was introduced during the second Open Beta weekend. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s Open Beta weekend 2 is now live, and it has instantly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-huge-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought in a vast number of players</a>. Many players must be looking forward to the weekend, as they will have two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new modes and a new map</a> to try out. However, one of the modes released this weekend, Rush, has already received a fix from BF6 developers. </p>







<p>The latest post from Battlefield Comms on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956355268972867585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) states that new balancing changes have been made to Breakthrough and Rush. The defender respawn timers in both Breakthrough and Rush have been fixed to 12 seconds; previously, they were set within the 6-12 second range. Also, in Breakthrough, fewer players are needed to capture an objective. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Balance Changes to Breakthrough and Rush</p><p>We’ve just made some balancing changes: In Breakthrough, it now takes fewer players on an objective to speed up capture. Also, defender respawn timers in both Breakthrough and Rush are now fixed at 12 seconds instead of the previous 6-12…</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956355268972867585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>A couple of hours ago, the Battlefield Comms account posted another update for Battlefield 6’s Rush mode. The Rush mode’s MCOM timer was reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to improve the balance between attacking and defending players. The developers will continue to monitor the game mode and make further balancing adjustments as needed. </p>

<p>Since open beta weekend 2 began, several players have raised concerns about Battlefield 6’s Rush Mode. Popular Battlefield content creator, Westie, has been voicing their opinions about BF6’s Rush mode on <a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1955978800648319332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. According to them, there are massive balancing problems across each map, and there is no space between MCOM locations. Players on the r/Battlefield subreddit also have issues with the game mode being locked to 12v12 games. </p>



<p>The new timer changes do help, but players are asking for more balancing improvements for BF6’s Rush mode, including adding “<a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1956262080064921803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sufficient space</a>“, among other things. However, players should keep in mind that Battlefield 6 is still in beta, and the beta was intended to identify problems like these, which could be addressed before the full launch. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield and Call of Duty ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-and-call-of-duty-complement-each-other-says-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complement each other</a>‘, according to BF6 developers. Additionally, many Battlefield 6 players have experienced issues with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-dlss-dlaa-not-working-issue-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLSS and DLAA</a>.

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Pearl Abyss [36 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/pearl-abyss">Pearl Abyss</a> has released a 13-minute gameplay demonstration video for <em><a title="Games > Crimson Desert [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a></em> ahead of Gamescom 2025, showcasing a first look at what attendees can expect to play on the show floor from August 20 to 24 in Cologne, Germany. The same demo will also be playable at PAX West 2025 from August 29 to September 1 in Seattle, Washington. <span id="more-984607"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Before this point in the story, the protagonist—the Greymane Kliff—and his fellow Greymane members are caught in an ambush orchestrated by their enemies, the Drunken Black Bears. After a fierce battle, Kliff and his comrades are separated and scattered. Kliff embarks on a search for his companions, and during his journey in the continent of Pywel, Kliff hears news that the Greymane Oongka—one of his most trusted companions–is in the region of Calphade.</p><p>Kliff arrives in Calphade only to find out that his efforts to reach Oongka is complicated by the rupture of a violent rebellion instigated by Cassius Morten—a subordinate of Marquis Stefan Lanford, lord of Calphade and an ally to the Greymanes—who has joined forces with the Black Bears to overthrow Lanford. Calphade is on the brink of defeat.</p><p>Kliff joins the battle, defeats both the rebellion and Black Bear forces, and is able to shift the advantage back to Calphade’s forces. On the battlefield, Kliff reunites with Oongka, who has been fighting off the rebels on the side of Lanford, and defeats Cassius Morten, ending the revolt in Calphade.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Large-Scale Warfare Setting</strong> – The video immerses viewers in epic-scale warfare, with countless NPCs battling in real time across every corner of the battlefield. As the Calphadean army and rebel forces clash with fierce intensity, artillery flies overhead and dynamic, high-tension combat unfolds on all sides. The shouts of soldiers, the clashing of swords, and the smoke and flames enveloping the field all come together to evoke the feeling of a real war zone.</li><li><strong>Missions</strong> – Kliff undertakes a variety of battlefield missions, from firing cannons to destroying enemy watchtowers and aiding allies in trouble.</li><li><strong>Traversal Methods</strong> – Kliff can call and ride his horse to increase mobility and use the “Crow’s Wing” ability to glide across the air in the most efficient route. His skill “Axiom Force” also allows him to not only travel with more maneuverability but to execute strategic mane uvers in combat.</li><li><strong>Combat</strong><ul><li>As Kliff advances through missions and the questline, he faces a wide range of combat scenarios, each offering multiple strategies that allow players to adapt and showcase their own combat style. Kliff can strategically use not only his wide array of offensive abilities but also execute well-timed dodges and blocks to gain advantages, and switch between multiple weapons.</li><li>Kliff’s “Axiom Bracelet” enhances attacks with elements of fire, lightning, and ice, with each attribute resulting in different effects on the enemies. For example, arrows with fire enhancement explode on impact, while an ice-enhanced sword attack can freeze enemies, where they then can be shattered with a follow up blow.</li><li>Kliff also uses “Artillery Whistling Arrows”—an arrow that calls in allied forces to take fire on a designated location. Beyond simply defeating enemies, it can also be used strategically to take down enemy structure, such as watchtowers.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Boss Fights</strong><ul><li>Midway through the questline, Kliff face off against a formidable Black Bear opponent, a massive foe whose sheer size and strength set it apart from regular soldiers. Due to his size, grappling skills are ineffective, and he unleashes a range of devastating attacks, including powerful axe swings and moves that launch players into the air.</li><li>The war concludes in a boss battle against Cassius Morton, a formidable boss who wields a mace and shield with deadly precision. While evading his relentless strikes, Cassius can be defeated in multiple ways, including ordinary attacks.</li><li>Players can also choose a special tactic to bring Cassius down. Steadily dealing damage will push him into a staggered stage, where then Kliff can use a special skill to lift the pillars that have broken around him as a result of their battle and wield it as a weapon, delivering massive damage.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Graphics</strong> – The continent of Pywel that can be seen in the video provides another source of enjoyment. The explorable continent, which is rendered with high-quality graphics, and vividly experience various natural phenomena such as natural lighting and weather that changes over time. Behind the battlefield, magnificent natural environments and terrains, such as rock cliffs and mountain ranges unfold in the background, witnessing the realistic graphics implemented through Pearl Abyss’ proprietary “BlackSpace Engine.”</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Crimson Desert</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,117 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,691 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,918 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/CRIMSON_DESERT/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> in Q1 2026.</p><p>Watch the footage below.</p><h2><span>Gamescom 2025 Gameplay</span></h2><p><iframe title="Crimson Desert - 13 Minutes of Gamescom 2025 Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mKollpGYGrI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/crimson-desert-13-minutes-of-gamescom-2025-gameplay]]></content:encoded>

More details on it will be shared at a later date.</p><p>This will likely be similar to the Free Ride mode found in Mafia: Definitive Edition, which gave players more activities to pursue within that game's open-world structure. Mafia: The Old Country does offer a free-roam mode that can be accessed via the Chapter Replay menu, but when compared to the bustling levels of the main story campaign, the world does feel empty in comparison. It is worth checking out if you're a completionist, as you can hunt down collectibles and fully upgrade Enzo's arsenal along the way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mafia: The Old Country Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Hangar 13 shared a few more details on the game, as it says that in its first week, more than 600 million shots have been fired, 185 enemies have been taken down, 17 million bandages have been used to patch Enzo up, and players have "earned" a total of 10 billion Dinari from their sessions. And they say that (video game) crime doesn't pay.</p><p>One of the big new games for August, Mafia: The Old Country has received fairly positive reviews. Critics have highlighted its gorgeous recreation of Italy and excellent performances, while also noting that its gameplay systems can feel archaic at times.</p><p>"Mafia: The Old Country is at its best when things slow down, letting you take in all the sights and sounds of Sicily. Like previous Mafia games, it nails the look and feel of its real-world counterpart by investing heavily in the details. Unfortunately, generic gameplay and dated mission design hold Mafia: The Old Country back, making it feel like a relic of the early 2010s," Jake Dekker wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mafia-the-old-country-review-look-but-dont-touch/1900-6418393/">GameSpot's review</a>.</p>

                <p>Although handhelds are getting more powerful chips, they still lag behind the hardware that can be found in desktop and laptop PCs. However, one modder has created their own handheld system based on high-end laptop hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">Billibilli creator Qingchen DIY (via <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/modder-builds-12-5-inch-4k-gaming-handheld-powered-by-nvidia-rtx-4090-laptop-gpu" rel="nofollow ">Videocardz</a>) has a built a portable device that has a huge 12.5-inch 4K IPS display panel. In their video, the custom handheld is shown to be running on Windows 11, while the system settings shows that it contains an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 laptop GPU as well as an Intel Core i9-149000HX CPU. It also contains 64GB of DDR5-5600 memory and 2TB of storage.</p><p dir="ltr"><span>It appears that this was a laptop that has been converted into a gaming handheld, with a light green shell containing the usual thumbsticks and face buttons, as well as a number of ports and a cooling vent at the top.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Qingchen DIY also demonstrates the system running Horizon Forbidden West, God of War, and Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K, with the temperature staying at 72ºC, although it is also relying on an external power source to maintain high performance.</p><p dir="ltr">Compared to other handhelds available commercially, the largest handheld is the Acer Nitro Blaze, which has an 10.95-inch display. Most handheld chipsets also use GPUs from AMD, except for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, both of which use custom versions of Nvidia's Tegra mobile chipsets.</p><p dir="ltr">Although the Switch 2's hardware lags behind PC handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally X, Nvidia boss Jensen Huang previously said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-ceo-claims-the-switch-2-redefines-portable-gaming-graphics/1100-6532023/">the Switch 2 has redefined portable gaming graphics</a>.</p>

It's a notable first that organizers say will comprise the most diverse lineup in Gamescom history.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To accommodate burgeoning exhibitor interest, Gamescom 2025 is expanding its footprint to a record 233,000 square meters. Record registration numbers mean it's a smart move, with last year's event attracting 335,000 visitors.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Opening Night Live, the digital and in-person show that kicks off the event with a deluge of video game announcements, has also been moved to Hall 1 for the first time. The switch means 5,000 people will be able to attend in-person—although the showcase will also be streamed online for a global audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Felix Falk, managing director of game—the German games industry association that owns the Gamescom brand and co-organizes the event with Koelnmesse—described interest in the show as "immense," but why has Gamescom flourished in the years following the pandemic when another major industry event that went by the name of E3 fell into ruin?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-18-arkane-union-brands-microsoft-an-accomplice-to-genocide-krafton-hits-back-at-unknown-worlds-founders-and-is-collective-action-the-answer-to-miscrediting-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Patch Notes #18: Arkane union brands Microsoft an 'accomplice' to genocide, Krafton hits back at Unknown Worlds founders, and is collective action the answer to miscrediting?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer earlier this week, Falk suggested Gamescom weathered that storm and emerged stronger because organizers understood the importance of establishing a digital footprint even before COVID-19 left the world in stasis.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Opening Night Live was part of that push to attract a global audience via the power of streaming, and Falk explained that almost 50 million people watched last year's Geoff Keighly-fronted opening salvo. That's a lot of eyes on the Gamescom brand.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Falk said the pivot to a hybrid digital-meets-physical event that included online communities meant Gamescom was in "good shape" before the pandemic. But what about post-COVID? In a world where major publishers are by no means guaranteed to attend in-person events—largely because the likes of Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft have all taken to saving their biggest announcements for their own digital directs—where is the value in meeting face-to-face?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Gamescom organizer says face-to-face events close the 'emotional distance' between &nbsp;developers and consumers">Gamescom organizer says face-to-face events close the 'emotional distance' between &nbsp;developers and consumers</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For both exhibitors and consumers, Falk suggested there is an "emotional" aspect to attending events in-person that is tough to replicate digitally."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/godforge-dev-fateless-raises-14m-through-community-driven-investments" target="_self" data-discover="true">Godforge dev Fateless raises $14M through community driven investments</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Being on-site is a totally different experience and much deeper and much more worthy for the companies and the games, compared to the digital format," he said. "You can see that if you head to the indie area, which is the biggest indie area we've ever had, and there you'll normally find the developer stood next to the game. You can talk to them—and they love the feedback. Of course, you could do a survey online and get feedback that way, but it's different from talking to each other."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In short, he explained that in-person events close the "emotional distance" between developers and players to create experiences that simply cannot be replicated online.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Falk described digital events as "fast" and "dynamic" by contrast, which makes them a unique proposition in their own right. So, by cultivating an online presence and letting people engage with the show virtually, Falk claimed Gamescom managed to become a "platform for the whole industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[The hybrid setup] means you do find target groups and communities you normally don't reach," he added. "You also reach media or stakeholders who wouldn't normally come to your specific showcase, because you're a part of the biggest show worldwide for gaming."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making digital inroads also allows Gamescom to expand without stretching the in-person event to a breaking point. Discussing what long-term success means for the showcase, Falk explained he doesn't believe Gamescom will live or die based on "one KPI of scale."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/valve-indicates-paypal-has-dropped-support-for-steam-over-content-concerns" target="_self" data-discover="true">Valve says PayPal support is no longer available in some regions due to content concerns</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In fact, he said organizers have been intentionally limiting attendance in Cologne to preserve the atmosphere of the show.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We don't want the atmosphere to be worse because we squeeze in too many people," he continued. "We could squeeze more in—which we don't—because the quality of the experience is important for the fans."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, there is room for measured growth. Falk noted the record number of exhibitors was possible because there is still room to expand the show floor, but reiterated that "more" isn't the overarching plan.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have more exhibitors than ever before, which is great because we still have space to grow, but [success] is more about variety and diversity of content," he added. "It is not our aim to grow, grow, grow—because that doesn't make sense. It's more about the quality and most importantly the digital reach, which we have seen over the last few years is exponentially growing."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamescom is also expanding into other regions such as Latin America and Asia, but we'll have more on that particular topic next week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s been over a month since Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate launched and you may be wondering where our review is. The simple answer is we did not get a review code, and judging by Metacritic, no one else did either – there are just 12 reviews for the PS5 version, most for lesser known sites, and eight reviews on PC. Normally, this would not matter as I am a huge Destiny 2 fan, and so obviously I would buy the new expansion even if Bungie did not provide code for review… except that I didn’t.</p>
<p>When Bungie started flinging around terms like Metroidvania I immediately got worried, that does not sound like Destiny 2 at all. I <em>have</em> played the first mission from The Edge of Fate (and you can too, everyone gets it for free ) and I was less than impressed, so I decided that, for the first time in almost twelve years, I would skip a Destiny 2 expansion.</p>
<p>However, we do have some die-hard fans in the TSA Destiny 2 clan, so I asked them for their thoughts on The Edge of Fate and the state of the game,</p>


<hr>
<p><strong>TC: </strong><em>Bungie’s storytelling has improved considerably over the years, it had a bit of a wobble post The Final Shape but I think things had picked up by Heresy. So, what did you make of the new story?</em></p>
<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Normally, I’d finish the DLC within a few days, but it’s been over a month now and I’ve still not completed it. I enjoyed what I have seen of the story so far, the budget seems a bit higher seeing as there are more cinematic cutscenes, and the use of the holograms displayed via your Ghost ‘on comms’ to diverge information and mission beats is quite cool, seems a direct progression of the hologram npc/chat mechanic that came in with the HELM. I’m unsure about how ‘contrived’ some of the story beats are written and how some of the characters directly link together in the past, even though we’ve known them for a decade and there hasn’t been a hint of that before, even with the copious amounts of lore and backstory the game drops.</p>

<p><strong>Jack:</strong> I agree with the needless ties to new backstories. I enjoyed the new elements and characters of the story – finally, a bit of freshness rather than the same old characters.</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> I quite liked playing through the story at the time, particularly the flashback cutscene, but to be honest, I remember very little about it now it’s done, or the relevance of the new fella.</p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> The campaign itself I found a little complicated to follow. It felt a little disjointed and I was not sure if I was supposed to be doing side missions in order to make it make more sense.</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> I agree with Lee about the side missions – it wasn’t clear why they were there, if they had to be done in a specific order and if they related in any way to the main story.</p>

<p><strong>TC: </strong><em>Rather than give you a new Super, The Edge of Fate gave Guardians powers that only worked on Kepler, the new location. Guardians could change in a ball of electricity and roll about, and also manipulate Dark Matter to rearrange objects and create new pathways.&nbsp; I found the ball to be horrendous to play and control and the exact opposite of what Destiny 2 is meant to be. I want to be a death-dealing tank that throws flaming axes, not a sparkling marble that hides in drainpipes. What did everyone else think?</em></p>
<p><strong>Jack :</strong> All of the puzzle mechanics were utterly stupid, unnecessary, and not fun.</p>
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Agreed. It is if someone suggested Metroidvania and instead of doing actually good gear gating and back tracking, they just played a Metroid game, saw you became a ball, and went with that.</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> The ball mechanic was pointless and not really very enjoyable, but easy enough to get used to. But it did just feel like something they decided to chuck in just to have something different.</p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> In typical Bungie fashion they drip fed the Dark Matter feature to us a bit at a time. It was rubbish until the feature was complete, then it became more fun to blitz around doing different mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong> It has a steep learning curve, I think once things came together it was much more enjoyable, especially the last mission where you had access to all of the Dark Matter abilities. I enjoyed that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: </strong><em>Kepler has one group activity, The Sieve, which occurs every 1hr 44 minutes, much less frequently than Public Events in other locations. What do you think of The Sieve?</em></p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> Only played it once. Meh, it’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Played it because I had to, to get the gun. Nothing about it made me want to&nbsp;play&nbsp;it&nbsp;again.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> I second this.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew:</strong> Wait, it has a group activity? I thought it was just barren!</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> It has a baffling timed lockout system à la mobile games, which would be annoying if it was any good – but it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> It’s alright, although absurd it’s on such a sucky cooldown. It would make far more sense if it was one of the activities we should be grinding for power, based solely on the fact of it being new..</p>

<p><strong>TC: </strong><em>Did anyone else feel a bit miffed that Bungie reset everyone’s progress levels, effectively wiping over ten years of progress?</em></p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> No, not at all. A welcome refresh, with the ease of levelling up better&nbsp;than&nbsp;before&nbsp;too</p>
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Yeah, essentially just cutting a few zeroes off the level seeing as almost everyone was at 2020, since they gave out 2020 gear for free during Return of the Nine.</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> I was more upset about the reset of Guardian ranks – doesn’t mean much or affect the gameplay, but having just defeated the Witness after playing for 10+ years, only to be reset to the same rank as a newbie just felt cheap</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> Yeah same, I liked that it matters more now, but resetting rather than keeping it at your highest level from previous season was whack.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong> Not effectively communicating that the rank of your rewards (Tier 5 Weapons etc.) was directly affected by your Guardian rank was a bit annoying.</p>
<p><strong>TC: </strong><em>As Adam mentioned it, how are you finding the new weapon system and Armour 3.0?</em></p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Really great. Quick and easy, and the fact that Master stuff is matchmade helps lots with that too.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong> I don’t like that some of my best picks for slots are effectively vetoed if I want to play avant-garde or get maximum benefit for systems. The “selected weapons” and “selected armour” for the season unnecessarily limits buildcrafting. It took ages to get some Exotics in previous expansions and now using them is effectively a damage penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> Love the Tier system, great way to improve loot and soft sunset old gear. The enforcement of using new gear sucks though, I’d rather just incentivise the new stuff by making it strong or having good artefact synergies, rather than just banning old stuff in some playlists.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew:&nbsp;</strong> I’m still just playing with my old stuff; nothing they’ve introduced that’s dropped for me feels better so far. I had to massively change my load out to make the guns work with a different type of subclass and playstyle that I liked, so it didn’t synergise well with what I already enjoyed and had built to rely on over a long period of time. Some of the guns I probably would have used if I could craft them to get a roll I wanted that worked with my build, but I’ve played a reasonable amount and had terrible RNG so I stopped caring and went back to using my favourites.</p>

<p><strong>TC: </strong><em>What should Bungie do to bring back lapsed players like myself?</em></p>
<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Meaningful choices in every piece of content, make the whole game matter as opposed to just the new DLC. Why launch half baked mechanics that barely play competently whilst also making everything else not work/count anymore, and funnelling you into playing their half baked ideas to progress?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong> “Half baked” is a good point to make. This expansion feels like it’s half baked.</p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> I definitely kinda want to play D2 right now, but also at the same time, what do I play? And what’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Where’s a global pandemic and enforced lockdown when you need it?</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong><em> And finally, what would you score The Edge of Fate out of ten, and why?</em></p>
<p><strong>Lee:&nbsp;</strong> The Edge of Fate brings some much needed freshness to what was a rather stale set of systems, but it is missing some of what you’d expect from a yearly expansion. The campaign was really good with links to historical events while also setting up the future, but that does very much feel like a set up, a block to build on. A solid mystery with plenty to look forward to.</p>
<p>6/10</p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Pros: Good story, great new character in Lodi, armour changes should be positive in the long run, custom difficulties for Portal activities allow more variety even when repeating the same things.</p>
<p>Cons: Kepler is a reasonably unexciting destination, with bland environments, reused textures and lack of Lost Sectors and public events. Mythic difficulty in Kepler is just straight up infuriating.</p>
<p>Also the portal is also somewhat bland in its presentation, but nothing some UI changes can’t improve. Better backwards compatibility with the armour changes would be appreciated.</p>
<p>6/10</p>
<p><strong>Steve:</strong> It has a good campaign and new systems have promise but need refinement. Some small improvements will go a long way such as adding Dungeon and Raid stuff to Portal.</p>
<p>7/10</p>
<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Needs more time in the oven to be playable. It ruined more of the game than it improved.</p>
<p>4/10</p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> Solid campaign, not enough new stuff. All the resetting and changes are attainable without the expansion.</p>
<p>4/10</p>
<p><strong>Adam:&nbsp;</strong> I really enjoyed the campaign – it’s still Destiny. The Portal is underutilised and I feel boredom creeping in much faster doing the same six activities on solo ops – we know there are so many things in the game now, and the file size is bigger than it’s ever been, so the DCV&nbsp; (Destiny Content Vault) thing doesn’t really hold water. I like the weapons and armour changes for the most part, but I am frustrated by the arbitrary limitations placed on player choice, much the same way I was with the introduction of champions way back when… but it’s just more of the same. I am enjoying the post campaign stuff on Kepler, which is actually more fun now that the story beats have subsided. It’s a step down after the glory of The Final Shape but I’m still enjoying it and continuing to play it, despite my gripes.</p>
<p>7/10</p>
<p><strong>TC:</strong> <em>Thank you everyone!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>So there we go, I make that an average score of 5.6, which is distinctly, well, average. Destiny 2 is not dead in the water yet, and it’s a game that has been through many ups and downs and could return to glory with the right content. <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid_08_07_2025">Bungie have already stated</a> that they are going to change a lot of things and update 9.1.0, and while this does not have a release date, it will include “new activities and rewards in both The Edge of Fate and the Core Game.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Destiny 2: Renegades | Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/brUCTPKn6KM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I am also intrigued by the Star Wars ‘inspired’ expansion, Renegades, which will launch this Christmas, but Bungie are going to have to pull something really special out of the bag to bring back players. Perhaps even more than ever, as the days of leaning on Star Wars for an instant win, as <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ubisofts-slump-continues-star-wars-174911115.html">proven by Ubisoft’s Star Wars Outlaws</a>, are in the past.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>We now know when <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-trailer-xbox-ps5-1851784008"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> is coming out, how much it will cost, and that it’s not coming to Switch 2 at launch, at least if a new report from Dealabs writer billbil-kun is to believed, and they usually are. The apparent leaks raise questions about why the latest <em>Call of Duty</em> is still coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but not Nintendo’s newest hardware which is more capable than both of those platforms.</p> <p>According <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383">to billbil-kun</a>, Microsoft will be revealing the launch info for <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-final-campaign-mission-will-reportedly-be-a-big-multiplayer-battle-2000617873"><em>Black Ops 7</em> at Gamescom next week</a>. That includes European pricing of €80, its standard cost overseas, suggesting it will also remain at $70 in the U.S. despite warnings earlier in the year that Microsoft would be raising the prices of some of its fall releases. The company retreated from that with<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-xbox-80-price-tag-sgf-rpg-mario-kart-1851784014">The Outer Worlds 2</a></em> earlier this summer, and now it appears <em>Black Ops 7</em> won’t be crossing the $80 Rubicon either.</p> <p>The release date for <em>Black Ops 7</em> is apparently November 14, the latest an entry in the annualized multiplayer shooter franchise has ever appeared (this <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1945861417485099010">corroborates a similar leak from July</a>). But billbil-kun writes that none of the release information currently mentions Switch 2, making it seem unlikely the game will arrive on the handheld hybrid this year despite a 10-year agreement between Microsoft and Nintendo to bring <em>Call of Duty</em> to the platform.</p>

 <p>While Activision confirmed both sides are still committed to making that happen <a href="https://kotaku.com/will-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-come-to-switch-2-1851784023">with plans to reveal more information in the future</a>, it seems like <em>Call of Duty</em> is skipping Nintendo’s consoles again for the 12th year in a row, and two years into Microsoft’s completed acquisition of the publisher. One possible reason for the delay is that Nintendo has been just as stingy with sharing Switch 2 dev kits with Microsoft as with anyone else.</p> <p>While Activision executives met with Nintendo to discuss the specs for the Switch 2 in December of 2022, it’s possible the company was among those third-party development partners who missed out on pre-release access to the new hardware to begin porting games over to it. That shortage, potentially fueled by Nintendo’s paranoia about leaks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-console-power-playstation-4-xbox-one-1850850348">has reportedly led to</a> lots of developers playing catch up with the Switch 2’s release. Even the makers of <em>Black Ops 7</em>, it seems.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> for PlayStation 5 edges closer and closer to its October release date, but if you are finding the wait hard to take then this short but sweet gameplay trailer might ease your suffering.</p>
<p>While this gameplay snippet is only a mere glimpse at just 30 seconds, it does show off the combat you'll be treated to in the full game. As the lead character Atsu dispatches foes on a bridge, you'll see how she can utilise sand to startle and disable foes, and also send enemies to their deaths by pushing them off the edge of high platforms.</p>

<p>Key to this gameplay clip is the Yari spear, one of the many weapons you'll be able to use in the game. As well as being lethal in its own right, the Yari spear can also be used as a way for Atsu to propel herself forwards into enemies.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei from Sucker Punch is set to release exclusively on PlayStation 5 on October 2. The game follows the 2020 PS4 game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, which went on to release on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A couple of years ago, Neo Berlin 2087 was announced for PC and PS5 showing us a mix of detective thriller and some gunfights. Now, a new trailer has been released and it seems to show how many different games have been used as an influence. There seems to be a mix of Deus Ex, Call of Duty, various zombie games, and maybe a hint of Vanquish due to the character’s armour. Chuck in some other influences, like the Morpheus like character lifted from the Matrix too and you have Neo Berlin 2087.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neo Berlin 2087 - Gamescom 2025 Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i8B89MssneU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for Neo Berlin 2087 says,&nbsp;<em>“The game is set in Berlin, in the year 2087. Technological advancements and cyberization have divided society into a two class system, where the rich are ruling over the city while the poor are fighting for survival inside the slums and in the deadly wasteland outside the city walls. In a story about justice, friendship, love, guilt and betrayal, we combine the best elements of science fiction in a way that has never been experienced before.”</em></p>
<p>As you can see from the gameplay, the RPG switches constantly between first person perspective and third person perspective, which suggests players will be able to choose which view to use. There is a copious amount of bullet time gunfights, some sneaking in a dark tunnel, zombie like creatures chasing the main character, a crime scene to investigate, and some uncanny valley style facial animations on the characters. Elysium Studio was originally aiming to release Neo Berlin 2087 in 2024, but there is now currently no release date.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hardspace-shipbreaker-blackbird-acquires-ip</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blackbird Interactive has announced that it has acquired the full rights to the&nbsp;<em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker&nbsp;</em>IP from original publisher Focus Entertainment, and that "multiple" projects related to the property are currently in development.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1161580/view/836099892906557718" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the game's Steam page, Blackbird Interactive now "fully owns and controls" the IP, and it's "going to become a core part" of the studio's business strategy in the future. If you've been hoping for followups to the game, this seems like pretty great news for you.</p>

<p>In fact, Blackbird says that "multiple&nbsp;<em>Hardspace&nbsp;</em>projects are already in development", and that while the studio isn't ready to share specifics for those projects yet, Blackbird is focused on making sure the next <i>Hardspace&nbsp;</i>games "expand on the original game in all the right ways".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hardspace-shipbreaker-blackbird-buys-ip-explosion.jpg?itok=1bgGp4s_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hardspace-shipbreaker-blackbird-buys-ip-explosion.jpg?itok=13JVh8Vo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker&nbsp;</em>now falls entirely under the purview of developer Blackbird Interactive.</figcaption></figure><p>In order to reflect Blackbird's ownership of the&nbsp;<em>Hardspace&nbsp;</em>IP,&nbsp;<em>Shipbreaker&nbsp;</em>will be getting a small update, mainly including things like "updated splash screens, logos, and privacy policies". If you spot an update for your game, now you know what it is.</p>

<p>Blackbird is quick to reassure players that this won't mean anything in terms of access for&nbsp;<em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker</em>; you'll still be able to play it if you own it on Steam or anywhere else.</p>

<p>If you want your say on how future&nbsp;<em>Hardspace&nbsp;</em>projects should go, as well as the chance to potentially playtest new games as and when those tests become available, Blackbird recommends you sign up for something it's calling the <a href="https://blackbirdinteractive.com/lynxpioneerprogram/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LYNX Pioneer Program</a>.</p>

<p>The program will offer "exclusive playtests" of new <i>Hardspace&nbsp;</i>games, as well as "behind-the-scenes development updates" and "opportunities to help shape Blackbird Interactive's next generation of games".</p>




<p>According to Blackbird, the split with Focus Interactive isn't acrimonious. The studio thanks Focus for its "partnership and willingness" to work alongside Blackbird in order to transfer IP ownership smoothly.</p>

The smugglers have coin to trade for certain treasures--but some of it is risky cargo to haul across the high seas.</p><p>To start your dealings with the League, you'll first have to find them, tracking down one of the well-hidden and booby-trapped Smugglers' Hideouts scattered across the map. While the League has interest in more standard treasures including fine art and fine rum, their main focus is on explosive Black Powder Barrels--a risky cargo to be carrying on your ship.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Reuq0Pgi5k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Reuq0Pgi5k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Once players have tracked down a Hideout, they'll be able to pick up Smugglers' Route Runs, delivering often-dangerous cargo from one point to another. Smugglers' Runs can also be picked up from a message in a bottle bearing the Smugglers' mark.</p><p>The League also has some valuable cargo unaccounted for, with Smugglers' Shipwrecks offering plentiful opportunities for enterprising pirates to plunder. Find missing cargo on the sea floor, washed up on beaches, or reclaim it from Skeleton Ships and return it to the League for a big reward.</p><p>This is just Act 1 of the new season, with more content including heists set to unlock as Act 2 and 3 follow throughout September and October.</p><p>The new season also includes a variety of new cosmetics available at the Pirate Emporium, with more able to be unlocked from the Plunder Pass. For the first time, players will be able to play with extra characters, with the new Pirate Profiles system allowing you to start from scratch with a new pirate--without wiping your current progress.</p>

      </div>
<p>The Fell Council is also getting a rework--one member of the Council will be designated as Council Speaker each time you fight them, gaining enhanced abilities along with the title promotion. Players will also have the option of ignoring the Fell Council altogether and opting into a brand-new boss fight with Vizjerei Warlord Bartuc--formerly the Warlord of Blood, now the Warlord of Chaos. Players will have to spend Aether to fight Bartuc, but the punishing boss fight promises increased rewards if the party successfully defeats him.</p><p>While most of the Infernal Hordes rework provides more challenging fights for experienced players, Blizzard is also introducing a stripped-down, earlier-game version called Fleeting Hordes. The mode will be available in pre-Torment tiers, and will consist of four waves before facing off against two members of the Fell Council.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4550212-chaosmonsters.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4550212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4550212-chaosmonsters.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4550212"></a><figcaption>Chaos Monsters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4550212-chaosmonsters.jpeg"></figure><p><span>A new unique armor type called Chaos Armor is also being introduced in the next PTR, allowing players to harness the power of Chaos for themselves. Chaos Armor provides a more powerful version of existing unique items, but true to its name, Chaos items will only drop for an item slot other than the one the original item was intended for--unique boots may drop as gloves, for example, or an amulet as chest armor. The item shakeup will enable new builds, allowing players to combine affixes in ways that weren't previously possible.</span></p><p>All Diablo 4 players on PC can opt into the PTR through the Battle.net app--including Game Pass players, who can access the Battle.net client through the Xbox App. The Season 10 PTR will be open from August 19 to August 26.</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24224180/the-2-4-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list</a> of new content and patch notes for the 2.4.0 PTR below:</p><h2>Infernal Hordes Reborn</h2><p>The Infernal Hordes are hotter than ever; we’re dialing up the intensity on this incendiary mode.</p><p>Infernal Hordes refined</p><ul><li>We’ve done a significant re-work of Infernal Offerings revealed between each Wave. Our goal is to try to make all offerings feel valid as choices for you as you start to stack them to focus on your run.</li><li>We’re doing this by balancing existing offerings, changing the effects of some offerings, and adjusting base Monster populations.</li><li>At the start of the Infernal Hordes, you’ll now start with an Infernal Offering to immediately stoke the embers and breathe some fire into your run.</li></ul><h4>The Fell Council</h4><p>The Fell Council has had some promotions. When fighting them, one of their members will now be the designated Council Speaker, and gain enhanced abilities.</p><h4>Chaos Monsters</h4><p>Hell has unearthed a new monster family from deep its horrid maw. Born of smoke and brimstone, these Chaos Monsters provide a powerful shrine-like buff when killed.</p><h4>Chaos Waves</h4><p>Hellfire brews the dastardliest maladies. Within the Infernal Hordes, you’ll occasionally be offered the choice of a Chaos Wave within the Infernal Hordes from your Infernal Offerings. You can expect an amount of Chaos Waves offered relative to the Infernal Compass Tier each time you enter the Infernal Hordes.</p><p>Chaos Waves completely alter the upcoming wave, imbuing havoc and intense challenge. These waves will have significantly increased difficulty, but reward far more Aether should you be able to survive.</p><p>Chaos Waves will have many different combinations to discover and master. Dodge deadly projectiles from Chaos Rifts, slay a rampaging Hellwyrm, or hunt down erratic Aether Goblins.

                <p>Fans of old-school dungeon crawlers should get ready, because Black Lantern Collective and WildArts Games have set a release date for the new psychological horror game Caput Mortum. This slow-burn horror adventure will officially launch on Steam on August 27.</p><p>This game drops players into an abandoned alchemist's tower from the 16th century and forces them to find a way out while confronting "stomach-turning secrets" and "death-defying horrors" that have been locked away for ages. Forbidden knowledge will also be discovered, assuming the players' characters live long enough to use it. The monsters in this game won't show any mercy, but there may be options beyond battling the creators or sneaking past them. However, healing items will be limited, so combat may not be the preferred path. You can check out a new Caput Mortum trailer below.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Caput Mortum - Official Release Date Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"Caput Mortum was inspired by my first time playing [From Software's] King's Field 4 and the anxiety that comes with getting familiar with a game’s control scheme in a hostile environment," said WildArts Games art director Gabriel B. Dufour. "I also took inspiration from Amnesia: The Dark Descent when thinking about the monster encounters and puzzles. I hope fans of these classic games find something familiar to love in Caput Mortum, but that doesn't mean there won’t be surprises."</p><p>There are three different control options for Caput Mortum on PC. Keyboard-only and keyboard with a mouse are available for veteran players. However, the recommended option from Black Lantern Collective and WildArts Games is to go with a controller to recreate the feeling of a classic dungeon-crawler. That option was modeled after the controls used in the original King's Field from 1994.</p><p>Caput Mortum's demo is currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3555980/Caput_Mortum/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> ahead of the game's launch on August 27.</p>

                <p>As you browse Steam, adding various titles to your wishlist in the hopes they get a deep discount during the next big sale, you might soon notice that the pages for these games have a different look to them. Valve has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532106189043925406">announced a new update</a> in the Steam client beta that changes how game pages look, with two major changes, the first being that store pages will be a lot wider.</p><p dir="ltr">The whole game page is wider in general, but the carousel containing trailers and screenshots will be a good bit wider too, allowing for some bigger images and videos. Because the whole page will be wider, Valve notes that there's more room to describe a game's features, so alongside the visual change you might start to notice some pages having more information than you're used to.</p><p dir="ltr">Arguably the biggest change with this Steam store page refresh is the ability to upload video files in the page's description section. A lot of game pages currently use animated GIFs to give an in-motion look at specific features or sections to better illustrate what the included text might not be able to. The problem with GIFs is that they aren't always the best quality, so allowing for videos will potentially mean clearer looks at specific parts of the games that might not work for a trailer. As long as there are no major hiccups, it's possible we'll see these changes rolled out for everyone in a few weeks time.</p><p dir="ltr">This comes as part of broader changes to Steam's storefront. Last month, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/500579345320904590" rel="nofollow ">Valve released a beta version of the Steam home page</a>, making categories and tags personalized to you, a refresh of the browse tab, and additions to the search panel that shows recent popular searches, recently viewed games, and more. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Some brand new gameplay footage for Ghost of Yotei showing Atsu using the yari, which is a spear, to take on a group of enemies on top of a bridge. This footage seems to come at a later point in the game, as the enemy soldiers are questioning Yari if she is her, which means her legend is already starting to spread through the land.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - Yari Gameplay | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/98KGbwncmwk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see from the trailer, the yari gives Atsu a decent advantage from range allowing her to attack enemies without them getting close. The yari can also be used to close the gap too, with footage showing Atsu using the yari to launch a kick at an enemy allowing her to close the gap and strike them down. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is not a direct sequel to Jin Sakai’s story, but is instead jumping forward in time by a couple hundred years and to a new location. The game takes us from Tsushima to Set the Ezo region (modern day Hokkaido) around Mount Yôtei and in the year 1603.</p>
<p>Atsu’s story is a tale of revenge. A gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six killed Atsu’s family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree. But she’s not dead, and instead spent the last sixteen years learning to fight, kill and hunt. Now she’s returning to her home to track down The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito one by one and seek vengeance.</p>

<p>Ghost of Yotei is due to be released on October 2nd for PS5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> isn’t a perfect game by any means, but that didn't stop it from syphoning all of my free time when it launched back in 2022. This was the first time in a while where I truly felt the desire to “catch 'em all”. While Arceus still borrowed a lot from the mainline games, it did enough to make the world of Pokémon feel fresh and alive in ways the franchise previously hadn’t for many players, including myself.</p>
<p>Legends: Arceus isn’t an open-world game, though the zones it offered still did a solid job of making me feel immersed in the environment. Not only would you find Pokémon walking around all over the place, you could sneak up on them and toss a ball without the need for a battle. This could backfire as a Pokémon might be alerted to your presence and lay the smackdown on you. Yeah, you - the trainer. There was a sense of danger and mystery that really couldn’t be found in any previous Pokémon games.</p>
<p>Now, even with all of my love for Legends: Arceus, I’ve been quite nervous to go hands-on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. This whole city vibe hasn’t really won me over with the gameplay footage we’ve been shown so far, and while I enjoyed Mega Evolutions when they were introduced in Digimo- I mean, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">Pokémon X &amp; Y</a> back in 2013, they're not something I have any gripping nostalgia for either, so I wasn’t fussed either way to see their return. I rather enjoyed the turn-based battling of old that was used in Arceus, too, so was I going to like Legends: Z-A's real-time combat?</p>
<figure><a title="Pokemon Legends ZA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/321ce94c420ac/pokemon-legends-za.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>What do you think is running through Totodile's head? — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Kindly, Nintendo and Pokémon gave us behind closed doors access to Pokémon Legends: Z-A on Switch 2 at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/psa-2025-pokemon-world-championships-kicks-off-this-week-heres-what-you-can-expect">this year's Pokémon Worlds event</a>, and even though our brief 20-minute demo didn’t show their entire hand, I was able to get a better grasp on this new combat system and I truly think this might be the most fast paced and exciting Pocket Monsters game we’ve seen yet. Now please, Nintendo, let me play more of it soon.</p>
<p>The demo was broken up into two sections. The first part let me loose in a back alley Battle Zone, which tasked me with taking down as many trainers as I could lock eyes with. I hate confrontation, though, so I was thrilled to learn I could surprise and sneak-attack these trainers instead by moving cautiously and targeting their active Pokémon standing by their side. This first strike gives you a little advantage at the start of a battle and this also makes for a nice evolution of the stealth mechanics we saw in Arceus.</p>
<p>It’s this section where I got my first taste of the new combat. You have full control of your trainer during battle, can sprint and dodge at the press of a button, use items (more on that later), and by holding 'ZL' you’ll pull up a list of moves your active Pokémon can use. Each move can be used one after another and have their own cooldown meters.</p>

<p>While you can’t take full control of your own Pokémon’s movement, they will follow you around the battlefield, and dodging and timing your attacks just right will either save or cost your 'mon's HP. You have to make a lot of decisions on the fly as some attacks have longer animations and wind-ups than others, so spamming each attack once it's ready to be used again might not always be the right decision.</p>
<p>The second portion of my demo had me make chase with a Zygarde in doggo form. This section was a little too scripted and stilted for my liking, and it's here where I first noticed a little bit of pop-in in the background details. It's worth mentioning everything I played was buttery smooth otherwise at 60fps. But the design choice to set this game within a concrete jungle hasn't totally won me over yet. I loved the wide open vistas found in Arceus; watching the sun rise, seeing the color of the landscapes change was a delight. I'm worried I'll quickly grow bored of the damp, back street visuals over time, but I've not even scratched the surface of what Legends: Z-A has to offer to know if that's the case. Early on, though, it's nice to see that the game's textures and performance (at least on Switch 2) are a big step up from Legends: Arceus.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that Zygarde I was chasing after! Right, where was it now? I turned a corner and before I knew it, Zygarde had tackled me and dragged me up to the rooftops and picked a fight for me with a wild Absol that had the power to Mega Evolve. Look, we're all fans of <a href="https://i.redd.it/i-was-obsessed-with-this-guy-in-the-mid-late-2000s-v0-tgkaqog730sd1.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ee9cc1bec63cff7edc2f8076c62dd1675df7609">"2006" Davey Havok</a>, but that's an Absol, Zygarde --- thanks for that! This part must take place pretty early on in the game, as I only had a Chikorita on my team, but thankfully a neighbouring Lucario joined up with me and taught me how to activate Mega Evolution.</p>

<p>When facing off against a Mega Evolved Pokémon, you’ll have to pick up these Mega Power pellets by dealing damage. With enough Power, a tap of the right stick will transform your active Pokémon into something greater, faster, and all around more powerful, so it’s important to take advantage of this as often as you can.</p>
<p>Even though this Absol battle was framed as a seemingly easy tutorial for Mega Evolution, I got through by the skin of my teeth. Lucario sprinting around with me, I had to make snap decisions offensively while I avoided projectile blasts from Absol and scooped up all of the Mega Power I could. It all felt, well, for a lack of a better word, <em>epic</em>. Sure, maybe if I had used some of those potions I had tucked away in my satchel earlier in the fight, I wouldn’t have had to worry so much, but without them it honestly was a better, fairer fight, and I’m glad I didn’t need to rely on them. There’s also a cooldown timer on items that you have to contend with, so you can’t just douse your Pokémon with multiple potions at once. All of this added up could make for a really fun and engaging multiplayer, but that hasn't been confirmed yet.</p>
<p>While I’m still trying to temper my excitement and expectations for the overall city exploration, I’m relieved to report the combat, from what I've played, feels like just the thing the series needs to take it into the next generation. I’ll always have a longing for the turn-based battles that have been prevalent for the last nearly-30 years, but there’s no questioning the fact that this series has needed some reinvention and this new real-time battle system has certainly captured my attention. Pokémon Legends: ZA may not be for everyone, but I think the hardcore fans will be pleased.</p>
<p>Maybe next time we go hands-on with the game we'll get to see that new Dragonite Mega Evolution in action, too.<br></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Even if you’ve never played a <em>Pokémon</em> game before, you can probably figure out how the type chart works. Fire types are weak to water types, water is weak to grass, and grass is weak to fire. Type matchups are foundational to <em>Pokémon</em> battles, far before you get into the weeds of stats and strats. I’ve had the <em>Pokémon</em> type chart memorized for around 25 years.</p><p>That still didn’t stop me from making a rookie error in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. I panicked and sent out my Weedle against an NPC’s Pidgeotto, which it is very much weak to. It got one-shot, obviously.</p><p>It’s not that I <em>forgot</em> how type matchups worked. But the battle system in <em>Legends: Z-A</em> is very, very different from what I’m used to, at least with <em>Pokémon</em>. It’s the second entry in the <em>Legends</em> spinoff series, which began with 2022’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>, and while the <em>Legends</em> games are still RPGs like the main <em>Pokémon</em> games, they mechanically and structurally diverge a bit from the typical <em>Pokémon </em>formula. And <em>Z-A</em> takes it further than <em>Arceus</em> did: it’s the first <em>Pokémon </em>RPG to feature real-time battles instead of turn-based ones.</p><p>In the main series, you choose your actions turn by turn, taking time to think through the options — the right attack to use, whether to switch out for another pokémon, what the opponent might be planning — before locking something in and seeing how it plays out. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, on the other hand, you’re facing your opponent more directly. There’s no waiting for both opponents to lock in their actions for the turn; you just pick your pokémon’s move using one of the face buttons, and the move goes out.</p><p>It’s a big departure from nearly 30 years of <em>Pokémon </em>games<em>.</em> I’m used to thinking about <em>Pokémon</em> like a chess match, slowly and several steps ahead; in <em>Z-A</em>, I had to think about the same type matchups and stats and everything else, but quickly and on my feet. It took me some time to adjust.</p><p>The demo, which I played ahead of the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California, was split into two parts lasting around 10 minutes each, both seemingly early in the game and heavily focused on the new battle system. In the first part, I tried my hand at the Z-A Royale, which had me battling NPC trainers around Lumiose City at night. In the second, I battled a Rogue Mega Absol, which felt like the <em>Pokémon</em> version of a classic 3D <em>Zelda </em>boss. In the second part of the demo, I started to get the hang of this style of battling, and what was at first a little overwhelming quickly became an alluring kind of challenge: rewiring the <em>Pokémon</em> part of my brain.</p><p>The first big change I had to contend with: since battle in <em>Z-A </em>is in real time, moves are on cooldown timers. You can’t just spam the one super-effective move you have over and over; you have to figure out what else you can do while you wait to use that attack again. Even against very low-level opponents, I found myself relying on status moves like Growl, which lowers the opposing pokémon’s attack stat, as a buffer while my other moves were on cooldown. This had the added bonus of allowing my pokémon to take more hits, buying me some time both for the cooldown and to think.</p><p>Using status moves like this isn’t unusual when playing the core <em>Pokémon </em>games at a high level, but it is <em>very </em>unusual against a run-of-the-mill Bellsprout early in the game. I didn’t have enough time in the demo to really play around with it, but I can see myself carefully selecting each pokémon’s moves to account for the cooldown, like ensuring I have Protect on more of my pokémon to block incoming attacks. In other <em>Pokémon</em> games, I’d absolutely teach my pokémon Protect if I was building a competitive team, but I would almost never do it just to play the main story.</p><div><p><cite>Image: The Pokémon Company</cite></p></div><p>It’s not that battles in <em>Legends: Z-A </em>are unforgiving. (I did get smoked by the Pidgeotto, but in my defense, it was also at least 10 levels higher than the pokémon on my team.) But after years and years of approaching every mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game the same way, operating at least a little bit on autopilot and muscle memory in the early game, it’s kind of an exciting challenge to have to look at <em>Pokémon </em>differently.</p><p>The battle against Rogue Mega Absol — a wild, rampaging Absol that can Mega Evolve on its own — was similar to the NPC battles in that way, but far more hands-on. Unlike in battles against other trainers, wild pokémon can damage both your pokémon and your character, so you have to physically dodge and move around the arena while selecting your pokémon’s moves, keeping an eye on everyone’s health, and juggling cooldowns. (Using items like Potions is also on a cooldown.) Landing hits on the Rogue Mega causes it to drop orbs of “Mega Energy,” which you have to run and pick up in order to charge up a gauge to Mega Evolve your own pokémon and deal more damage.</p><p>It’s even more to balance, but I didn’t find it overwhelming, somehow. In this case, I had a Lucario at my disposal, and it had super-effective moves while also resisting Absol’s attacks, which helped. Lucario already knew Protect, too, so I got to take advantage of the strategy I had just developed in the Z-A Royale. And it’s also a familiar style of boss battle in games more generally, even if it’s different for <em>Pokémon</em>. It was more involved and felt more dangerous than the trainer battles, but I felt competent at it relatively quickly (especially compared to the Pidgeotto incident).</p><p>Maybe it’s just a typical learning curve, and I’ll very quickly develop an updated kind of autopilot for the easier parts of <em>Z-A</em>. But I really did like having to think actively about <em>Pokémon </em>in a way that I usually save for competitive play. I hope the game can sustain that for longer than a demo, and that I’ll get to build on the <em>Pokémon </em>knowledge I’ve been amassing for years, rather than just passively flexing it.</p><p><sub><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> will be released for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on October 16th.</sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjY1MTI2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Kallie Plagge</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-wont-launch-on-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won’t be landing on Nintendo Switch 2 at launch, though that doesn’t mean the door is closed to the platform permanently, according to a new report.</p>



<p>Set to be officially revealed at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live, Black Ops 7 will launch in November, once again part of the Xbox Game Pass catalog, but Nintendo Switch 2 players will miss out initially.</p>



<p>Though the improved performance of the Switch 2 has opened the door for releases on the platform for the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws, Black Ops 7 won’t be joining them in November.</p>



<h2 id="h-unclear-whether-activision-plans-black-ops-7-on-switch-2-in-future">Unclear Whether Activision Plans Black Ops 7 on Switch 2 in Future</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No arrival yet. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a> confirms that Black Ops 7 will not arrive on Switch 2 when it launches in November, instead landing on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Crucially, though, the report says it’s “unclear whether Activision plans a future port” to Switch 2 in the future, so it’s not known yet whether the door has been closed entirely for Switch 2. Earlier this year, Activision told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-its-working-with-nintendo-to-get-call-of-duty-on-switch-but-will-black-ops-7-be-on-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> they were “committed to getting the franchise on Switch.”</p>



<p>Nintendo has not had a Call of Duty game on its platform since the release of Call of Duty: Ghosts on the Wii U in 2013, and, if that barren run is to come to an end with Black Ops 7, players will have to wait a while longer after the release date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition</a> is out now, and of course modders are already pushing it to its limits. But the way they’re doing it is a lot of fun — and is perhaps the closest we’ll get to seeing a Waaagh! visualized on-screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is Relic Entertainment’s much-loved real-time strategy game set in Games Workshop’s grim dark sci-fi universe. It launched in 2004 and proved to be an entry point into the Warhammer 40,000 universe for a generation of PC gamers, while also pleasing existing fans with its authentic representation of the setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, over 20 years later, Dawn of War returns in Definitive Edition form, and some of the modders who have spent years tinkering with the original are excitedly moving over to this new version to see what it's capable of.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of this early testing is being done by people involved with <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/unification-mod-dawn-of-war-soulstorm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dawn of War’s wonderful Unification Mod</a>, which lets users seamlessly combine almost all community-created races. Within hours of Definitive Edition’s release this week, modders started seeing how many Ork Boyz they could spawn in-game before it crashes, because, well... what else would Ork Boyz do?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One member of the Unification Discord, Gunnisson, led the charge by summoning Ork Boyz as soon as they got their hands on the Definitive Edition:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/dow1-1755253840929.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, a progress update at nearly 1,000 Boyz spawned:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/dow2-1755253930010.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Orks just like to gather in big groups. They're not sure why.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Over 3,000, and according to Gunnisson: "They're pathing through each other exceptionally well."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/dow3-1755253991979.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ork count kept on increasing, to the point where, after more than 10,000 Orks, Dawn of War hit single-digit frames per second and became unplayable. But it still ran! "I mean, 10,000+ models on screen, I call that a win for performance and stability," Gunnisson said.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/dow4-1755254170636.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Gunnisson was eventually able to make 47,504 Ork Boyz “before the game died.” It took over seven hours, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/809740820151664680/810173515197579375/1405787870962126953" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they said</a>, while publishing the screenshot below: "At the end it was still chugging along at 10 seconds-per-frame."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/image-1755252844682.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">That's a lot of Boyz. Image credit: Gunnisson / Discord.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Performance is fantastic," Gunnisson added. "It took a lot of corpses to start impacting." Then: "I'm hyped to try some big matches."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a herculean effort, and for Warhammer 40,000 fans is about as close as we’ll get to a good old Waaagh! For the uninitiated, this is the name given to the wonderful moment when enough Orks gain enough collective momentum to launch devastating system-wide invasions. The Orks don’t really understand what’s going on or why it’s going on — they’re just happy they’re in a massive scrap — but for anyone on the receiving end, it’s bad news indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3556750/discussions/1/591779517900522091/?snr=1_5_9_" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> to mark the release of the Definitive Edition, Relic thanked modders for helping to test the game ahead of launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to say a huge thank you to our community modders who we have been working with for many months,” Relic said. “They've put in a lot of work both in helping us to support legacy mods, and in readying their own mods for the Definitive Edition.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s exciting to imagine what modders will be able to do with the Definitive Edition in the coming years as they get to grips with the game. As Gunnisson suggested, massive battles involving tens of thousands of units may now be possible, if the game can stand up to it. Perhaps then we'll get truly lore accurate body counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>The PC release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> has proven exceptionally popular, with developer Shift Up revealing impressive sales earlier this week in its latest financial report. But it's not only a huge win for the studio and publisher Sony, it's also exemplary of a booming games industry in South Korea seeking global expansion.</p>
<p>As announced by Shift Up, the PC version of Stellar Blade sold a million copies in its first three days on Steam, and now boasts over 3m sales on PC and console combined. Further, its peak concurrent player count on Steam sits at almost 200k - as per Shift Up's latest financial report, that's 2-5x higher than Sony's other flagship triple-A games (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, God of War, Spider-Man, to name three), making it the best-ever PC performance for a PS-exclusive IP launch. These are single-player games only, not including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">multiplayer and multi-platform success of Helldivers 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Following the PS5 success of Stellar Blade as a triple-A IP, Shift Up leveraged its unique strengths in optimisation, user experience, content enhancements, and market specific marketing to continue its success in the PC market - becoming a developer with proven hits across mobile, PC, and console," wrote the studio in its report. And that success is set to continue throughout the rest of the year.</p>

<p>The popularity of Stellar Blade parallels an explosion of Korean culture in general. K-pop bands are global phenomenons; K-dramas and reality shows are all over Netflix; Korean films are winning Oscars; and Sony Pictures Animation's KPop Demon Hunters film is <em>the </em>thing that's dominating everything right now. And it's happening in games, too.</p><p>Just this week alone there's been plenty of news about Korean games. On top of those Stellar Blade sales, there was the announcement of Woochi the Wayfarer from publisher Nexon, a single-player triple-A action game based on Korean mythology that's set for release on PC and consoles. With its basis in Korean culture, it could follow the sort of nationalistic success <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> received in China.</p>

<p>Then, along with those Stellar Blade figures, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inzoi-is-releasing-on-ps5-in-the-first-half-of-2026-xbox-version-is-being-considered">Krafton's Sims-like Inzoi heading to PS5</a>, as well as the delay of Pearl Abyss' open-world adventure Crimson Desert that will now be released early next year "due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voice-overs, console certification, and other launch preparations", according to the company's latest financial report (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026">Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>This all follows the likes of Soulslike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-difficulty-options">Lies of P celebrating the release of its DLC</a> earlier this summer; Nexon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-director-finally-ends-indie-debate-after-controversial-the-game-awards-2023-nomination">debating what indie means with its popular Dave the Diver</a> game, publishing its own single-player Soulslike in The First Berserker: Khazan, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-first-descendant-developer-responds-to-claims-its-icons-are-too-similar-to-those-in-destiny-2">courting plagiarism concerns with its Destiny-esque shooter The First Descendent</a>; and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">Krafton acquiring Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a> to boost its action game output, while more recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-defends-itself-amidst-subnautica-2-fiasco-says-milestone-process-is-being-rigorously-managed">defending itself amid a Subnautica 2 lawsuit fiasco</a>.</p><p>In short, the Korean games industry appears to be thriving. Of course, the country has long had a history with games, but it's previously focused predominantly on mobile games and online games, not to mention its exceptional esports scene. Now, though, we're seeing a shift towards PC and console gaming, and single-player games too. Pearl Abyss following its MMORPG Black Desert with the single-player Crimson Desert is just one example.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> director Choi Ji-won told Eurogamer back at the Game Developer Conference the studio's "primary focus from the concept of this game was to deliver a high quality, premium action game that is single-player," though he admitted he'd be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-remain-single-player-despite-refreshing-elden-ring-nightreign-says-director">open to a Nightreign-esque multiplayer game in future</a>.</p>
<p>"In the future, instead of pegging us into a certain genre, we want the fans to look at us and actually know what sort of unique components that we deliver that they look forward to," he added. "So they see our next work as a sort of projection of our trust and characters that we are building moving forward."</p>
<p>Speaking on the wider industry, Choi Ji-won said: "There are many talented and remarkable developers in Korea, and we are grateful for the opportunity that in, especially the action game [genre], our game perhaps provided a little more motivation to the already talented developers in Korea to craft their own experience in the genre."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Why is it that action games in particular are proving popular? "I think action in general is very intuitive, it's primal," Choi Ji-won suggested. "It's pretty natural that the action genre is big and there are many games actually in it. Also East Asia has a long tradition of action related materials, so because of that I think it comes very naturally."</p><p>Now, the Korean industry is looking to go global. Speaking to Game Informer (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/korean-devs-report-a-burst-of-interest-in-single-player-console-and-pc-games">Game Developer</a>), Round8 Studio CEO Jason Park said there are a "fixed number of people" playing single-player games on console and PC in South Korea, a number that "won't change". That's why Lies of P was made with a global market in mind.</p>
<p>Shift Up CEO Kim Hyung-tae said only five percent of Stellar Blade's PS5 sales came from Korea, and console share isn't growing - that's why the PC release was so important. He added that mobile games are designed around monetisation so appeal to an older demographic. "That's continued for the past 20 years, and players have become older, so it's harder to acquire new and younger users," he said.</p>
<p>Niko Partners Director of Research &amp; Insights Daniel Ahmad echoed these comments to Eurogamer. "The Korean video game market remained flat in 2024 with narrowed growth prospects," he said. "This has led Korean video game companies, who have typically excelled at developing live service MMORPGs at home, to explore new geographies, genres and business models including premium single player games for the global market."</p>
<p>What's more, Ahmad explained, the Korean government has doubled its investment from 2024 into domestic console game development, now allocated 15.5 billion won. "The success of titles such as Stellar Blade and Lies of P show this strategy is delivering results for Shift Up and Neowiz, respectively," he said.</p><p>"While the goal is primarily growth outside of Korea, the industry is also looking to fill gaps at home with titles in genres that can challenge the dominance of long standing MMO, MOBA and shooter games in the country. Korean video game companies have also stepped up investment efforts in global studios and developing markets, with the aim of building a publishing portfolio with global appeal."</p>
<p>Growth in Korea mirrors a similar surge in China, where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">success of Black Myth: Wukong has paved the way for other action-RPGs</a>, from Phantom Blade Zero, to Lost Soul Aside, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and Tides of Annihilation. Developers here have similarly moved from mobile to PC and console development, seeking global appeal. Phantom Blade Zero director "Soulframe" Liang described this shift to Eurogamer as akin to the "golden age of PlayStation 1 and 2".</p>
<p>Shift Up will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">follow up the success of Stellar Blade with a sequel</a>, set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-better-story-than-stellar-blade">address issues with the lack of story in the first game</a>. Its next original game, currently known as Project Spirit, is in development for a release some time from 2027 onwards. Whether it can match Stellar Blade's success with increased competition from other Korean developers remains to be seen.</p>

		<p>Annapurna Interactive has announced that it’s charming looking co-op title LEGO Voyagers will be released on September 15th, and it will be available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch. To mark the release date announcement, Annpurna Interactive has released a brand new trailer to show part of red brick’s and blue brick’s journey.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® VOYAGERS | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1J4Zq-A6FAw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>LEGO Voyagers follows red brick and blue brick as they embark on an adventure to rescue an abandoned spaceship. Along the way the two brick friends will need to build various structures to help them get across the world, and beat the challenges that will meet them on the path. To encourage people to play together, LEGO Voyagers will have a Friend Pass. That means as long as one person owns the game, they can invite others to play with them without them needing to own LEGO Voyagers too.</p>

            <p>EA have made a tweak to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta's rush, and are keeping tabs on the situation in case it needs more balancing changes. This comes as some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> folks and Battlefield vets have voiced their displeasure with the version of the mode that's debuted in this second weekend of beta action.</p>
<p>The biggest moans are related to size. Namely the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/">amount of players on each side</a> in these revamped rush battles and the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/after-adding-yet-another-tiny-map-battlefield-6-players-are-rightfully-clowning-on-its-definition-of-all-out-warfare/">relatively small maps</a> they're being contested on. As you might imagine, those two elements being a bit titchier in scale than previous Battlefields has also had knock on effects for other aspects of the mode.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We've just made a change to Rush: the MCOM timer is now reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to better the balance between attacking and defending players," the Battlefield Comms account bugled out across the socials this morning. "We’ll continue to monitor and are ready and able to make further balance adjustments." As of writing, no more tweaks have yet been forthcoming.</p>
<p>For those who don't speak field battler, M-COMs are the military communications stations that serve as rush's objectives, with the key being to blow them up or stop the other team from doing so, depending on whether you're attacking or defending. The timer's the amount of tick-tocking it takes any bombs you plant on these stations to go kaboom.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>MCOM Timer Changes to Rush</p><p>We've just made a change to Rush: the MCOM timer is now reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to better the balance between attacking and defending players.</p><p>We’ll continue to monitor and are ready and able to make further balance adjustments.</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956257348684583143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>We'll see how much difference that makes, but the two aspects of the beta's rush matches <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mpv4d9/what_is_this_garbage_called_rush/">drawing the most ire</a> from players who aren't merrily shooting away are the 12 vs 12 squad size limit and the smaller maps, which can't be easily fixed on the fly. The result's an experience that's not quite as expansive and vehicle-friendly in its chaos. At least in terms of the maps, Battlefield 6's devs have moved to reassure folks that larger ones do exist, with lead producer David Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954994293934055475">tweeting</a> that folks complaining about the frenetic speed of beta matches will see that "tempo scales accordingly".</p>
<p>This is just a beta, so there's plenty of time for further changes to be made if EA reckon the unhappy voices represent a majority. Insert joke here about them probably being best of not rushing to judgement.</p>

<p>The biggest weekend in the Pokémon calendar is here with the World Championships 2025 taking place in Anaheim, which of course means a closing ceremony that could bring plenty of news. Here are all the details.</p>



<p>Pokémon is set for a big year in the next 12 months with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> edging ever closer and 2026 marking the franchise’s 30th anniversary, which is expected to include the long-awaited release of Generation 10. Could we see some news and hints in Anaheim?</p>



<p>Whatever Pokémon has up its sleeves to showcase at the closing ceremony, you don’t want to miss it, so here’s everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-pokemon-world-championships-2025-closing-ceremony">When is the Pokémon World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony?</h2>

<p><strong>The Pokémon</strong> <strong>World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony takes place on Sunday, August 17. As the name implies, it brings the event in Anaheim to a close.</strong></p>



<p>Action in Anaheim for the Pokémon World Championships 2025 begins on Friday, marking the start of three days of action from the TCG, VGC, and everything else in between.</p>



<p>The closing ceremony in previous events has featured news about upcoming titles and releases, so it should not be missed by fans.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-is-the-pokemon-world-championships-2025-closing-ceremony">What Time is the Pokémon World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony?</h2>



<p><strong>The Pokémon</strong> <strong>World Championships Closing Ceremony begins at 7:00 pm PDT, meaning a late night for anyone on the east coast of the United States or elsewhere in the world.</strong></p>



<p>It is expected to begin bang on schedule, though it could be delayed if any of the finals earlier in the day run longer than planned. </p>



<p>Here’s an easier way to see the start times for the closing ceremony in your timezone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">19:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">21:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">22:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">03:00 (Aug. 18)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">12:00 (Aug. 18)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-the-pokemon-world-championships-2025-closing-ceremony">How to Watch The Pokémon World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony</h2>



<p><strong>The Closing Ceremony at the Pokémon</strong> <strong>World Championships 2025 will be broadcast live online through multiple platforms, including directly on the Pokémon</strong> <strong>website, on Twitch, and on YouTube.</strong></p>



<p>In our experience, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> is the best place to watch as the streams are slightly ahead of other platforms, so tune in here if you don’t want to see any spoilers. All the big announcements will also be shared on social media.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-the-pokemon-world-championships-2025-closing-ceremony">What to Expect From The Pokémon World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony</h2>



<p><strong>Previous announcements at the Pokémon World Championships Closing Ceremony</strong> <strong>have included details for upcoming releases across games and the physical TCG, as well as news on future World Championship events.</strong></p>



<p>The Closing Ceremony almost always announces the location of the following World Championships, though there will be no such reveal for 2026 as we already know the World Championships are heading to San Francisco next year. That announcement was made in Honolulu last year.</p>



<p>We could see more reveals for the Pokémon TCG, with last year revealing the return of Trainer’s Pokémon to the game, but all eyes will be cast towards Pokémon Legends: Z-A news. After the reveal of Mega Dragonite in the recent Pokémon Presents showcase, could we get another reveal?</p>



<p>The Closing Ceremony could also bring news of upcoming updates to existing live-service titles like Pokémon TCG Pocket, Pokémon Cafe Remix, and Pokémon EX Masters. Crucially, we could see more details of Pokémon Champions, which is set to be the formula used for future VGC events.</p>



<p>Pokémon does like to keep surprises up its sleeve, however, so it’s difficult to predict exactly what will be shown off.</p>
