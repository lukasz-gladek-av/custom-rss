            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-star-wars-and-counterintuitive-historical-accuracy.878145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/total-war-star-wars/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>When <em>Dualshockers </em>reported that Creative Assembly is developing a <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-works-at-creative-assembly/?ref=remapradio.com"><u><em>Star Wars </em>version of their <em>Total War </em>series</u></a>, the most common reaction I saw was one of skepticism. At first glance, <em>Star Wars</em> does not seem to lend itself to the combat of massed armies and close, linear formations that has been <em>Total War’s</em> bread-and-butter since its inception.</p><p>At a glance, <em>Star Wars </em>appears to be a setting where warfare is analogous to World War 2 combat: soldiers carry automatic or semi-automatic blasters, walkers function like tanks, starfighters are basically WW2 airplanes and a lot of them are carried aboard capital ships that act like aircraft carriers. By contrast, the <em>Total War </em>series has always handled pre-gunpowder armies best, and its forays into the 18th and 19th centuries have been uneven. (Why that is the case is a topic for another day.)</p><figure><figcaption><span>That's just a catapult! </span><i><em>Total War </em></i><span>can handle a catapult. Which is more than can be said for the Droid Army.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The more <em>Star Wars </em>battles we have gotten to see, however, the less they fit that “World War 2 in Space” paradigm. Throughout the <em>Clone Wars </em>cartoon, ground combat between the Separatist Droid Army and the Grand Army of the Republic is defined by massed formations exchanging laser fire at close range. Is this in large part dictated by the limitations of the cartoon’s animation capabilities? Almost certainly, but it is also following the template Lucas established in <em>Phantom Menance </em>and <em>Attack of the Clones</em>, where the former is basically a battle of Roman legionary armies, and the latter is a point-blank melee as masses of droids try and shatter walls of clones and Jedi defenders. </p><!--members-only--><p>Hoth, likewise, doesn’t much resemble a World War 2 battle so much as a World War 1 battle or perhaps something even earlier. The AT-AT walkers are more capable than World War 1’s first tanks, but they share similar drawbacks: they are devastatingly effective at shattering an enemy line but also slow and unmaneuverable. (Their performance gets even less impressive if you read Danger Room’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/02/battle-of-hoth/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>analysis of Rebel defensive tactics on Hoth</u></a>, or this piece <a href="https://cimsec.org/re-fighting-the-battle-of-hoth-an-engineers-perspective/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>re-imagining how the Rebels could have deployed the same resources</u></a> to keep the Imperials at bay, which is coincidentally a good primer on how armies evolved tactics to mitigate the threat of armored breakthroughs.) The biggest ground battle we get in the original trilogy is an assault on a besieged fortress, frankly the kind that happened a lot more <em>before </em>the World Wars than after.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Ralph McQuarrie's concept painting for the Hoth Battle, displayed at Disney World</span></figcaption></figure><p>If there is any one battle that looks different from what Total War is usually about, it’s the Umbara campaign in <em>The Clone Wars. </em> Perhaps the most impressive depiction of battle in the entire series, the landings on Umbara resembled a combination of the paratroopers going into Normandy and helicopter-led US air assault tactics in Vietnam.&nbsp;</p><p>The Umbarans rely heavily on area-denial weapons, plus disruptive long range firepower that inflicted major losses on the Clone Army before they can get into small-arms range of Umbaran forces.  When the clones finally get into range of those forces, the Umbarans are piloting advanced vehicles with no support.  Effectively, it's a mechanized monster fight—and we've seen lots of monster fights in the <em>Total War: Warhammer </em>series. </p><p>(Plus, the Republic’s tactics were hindered in this battle by the fact that the Jedi in command was a turncoat. Did our glimpse of the Umbaran campaign look so different from other battles because it was truly a different tactical paradigm, or was it just that the commanding general was intentionally inflicting attrition on his forces?)</p><figure><figcaption><span>Diagram of a shipboard mass driver cannon in </span><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/672347/star-wars-battles-that-changed-the-galaxy-by-cole-horton-jason-fry-amy-ratcliffe-chris-kempshall/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><span>Battles That Changed the Galaxy</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>What of space? That’s a little harder to make guesses about. Naval warfare is something the <em>Total War </em>series has struggled with over the years, but if it could be said to have worked at all it was with games like <em>Empire </em>and <em>Fall of the Samurai</em>, where you’re basically dealing with the 18th and 19th century naval tactics—<em>Master and Commander </em>type stuff. </p><p>The thing is, that’s basically what we see in the largest naval battle in the <em>Star Wars </em>films. Lando Calrissian’s solution to the ambush at Endor is to have Ackbar bring his capital ships into point-blank range with the Imperial Star Destroyers surrounding the Second Death Star, while he and his strike craft fly cover until they can attack the Death Star itself. Unlike in real-world history, the development of strike aircraft didn’t render the battleship obsolete, and so most naval battles appear to be decided by the presence of capital ships fighting well inside visual range of one another using actual cannons with heavy artillery shells like warships used from the 16th through the 20th centuries. The biggest naval battles we see in the prequel trilogy follow similar logic, and the glimpses we get of the Imperial Navy on the fringes of the Empire in <em>Andor </em>and <em>Rebels</em> indicate that the fleet is predominated by small patrol craft and light carriers, and that the almost-invulnerable Imperial Star Destroyer is as scarce as a sight as a Ship of the Line on the far frontiers of 18th century empires.</p><figure><figcaption><span>A naval battle diagram for the Battle of Endor of the kind that is very familiar to anyone who appreciates the age of fighting sail.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The final thing I would note is that Jedi, Sith, Force Witches, and even the types of special units that emerge from within the conventional armies of <em>Star Wars</em>—like the coldly competent Tactical Droids, elite combat commanders like Rex and his badass buddy Fives—are basically hero units and both <em>Total War: Warhammer </em>and <em>Three Kingdoms </em>showed that Creative Assembly is capable of putting special units like that into game system without making it fall apart. Personally, I think the way it approached hero units in <em>Three Kingdoms </em>is a bit more in keeping with <em>Star Wars</em> (there’s only one Anakin Skywalker just like there’s only one Lu Bu) but you can see it working a few different ways.</p><p>So it isn’t hard to imagine Creative Assembly depicting battles that feel authentically <em>Star Wars</em>. The films have never been particularly interested in convincing military tactics as much as they have privileged packing a frame with scenes of awesome combat. The <em>Total War </em>series has always been similar: its battles look like movies or military paintings more than actual combat as related by participants, where war is always harder to perceive and understand in the confusion of battle. You can very easily imagine a lot of typical <em>Total War </em>battles unfolding with the types of armies we see throughout <em>Star Wars </em>films and television.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Like this has never happened to you in a Total War game.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The more doubtful thing, at this stage in Creative Assembly’s life as a studio, is whether it can make a game that feels authentic and interesting with the wildly varied source material of <em>Star Wars</em>. The studio’s model has increasingly shifted to DLC—to the point that a lot of folks have come to believe <em>Total War </em>can only work if a setting can support dozens of factions—and it isn’t hard to imagine a Star Wars game that feels like a thinly reskinned Total War game of the type we’ve seen countless times before, with variation coming via fanciful DLC packs that start to resemble the goofy <em>Star Wars </em>action figures and playsets of the past. I think if this comes to fruition we have every chance of seeing a surprisingly good <em>Star Wars </em>game at launch… and then two years later playing an increasingly poorly-balanced and buggy version of the same game as we try out the new Hutts of Hoth Expansion and await <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/blog/message-from-total-war-leadership-dec-2023/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the inevitable blog post</u></a> titled “An Apology and a Roadmap for the Hutts of Hoth”.</p><p><em>P.S. Because some folks are going to miss the link in the caption: the stills throughout this piece are from </em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/672347/star-wars-battles-that-changed-the-galaxy-by-cole-horton-jason-fry-amy-ratcliffe-chris-kempshall/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>Star Wars Battles That Changed the Galaxy</em></a><em>, which is quite a lot of fun as a work of fictional military history, in the form of </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Battles-World-War-I/dp/B000KT4W7I?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>exactly the kind of history book</em></a><em> that set me on course to be whatever the hell I am today.</em></p>

Smash Bros.-style brawler launches proper on May 28 after it was brought offline following what is now called the open beta period.</p><p>In a <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Player First Games said returning players who log in by June 11 get the Season 1 premium battle pass for free. This means they also get playable character Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th for free.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/jason-1920-1080-1536x864-1716374436634.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Player First Games revealed a first look at the battle pass interface, which gives off strong Fortnite vibes. “We’ve increased the number of high-value items in both the free and premium tiers by adding more ringouts, character variants, taunts, and currency,” Player First Games said.</p><p>You can now earn the premium currency (Gleamium) through both tiers, which can be used to buy various in-game items, whether it’s for new characters or saving to use towards the next season’s premium battle pass.</p><p>Jason Voorhees is part of the premium battle pass, as are more variants, ringouts, taunts, and currency. The premium battle pass also lets you earn enough Gleamium to get the next premium battle pass, Player First Games confirmed. Jason Voorhees will also be available via character tokens or in-game currency when the pass is over.</p><p>At launch, the Season 1 battle pass will last for eight weeks, and the final tier of the pass will be repeatable, so you can keep playing and earning rewards even if you reach the end of it early.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/image-63-1536x842-1716374462561.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Returning players who already have existing character tokens in their inventory can still use them to unlock characters, but MultiVersus will not offer new character tokens from launch. Neither will it offer new battle pass tokens, but if you already have some you can still use them to unlock the premium battle pass tier.</p><p>Player First Games has introduced new replacement currencies “to focus more on specific reward types.” Fighter currency can be earned in-game and used to obtain fighters. “Keep in mind, Fighter currency is different from character tokens, and it cannot be exchanged for character tokens,” Player First Games warned. Players can also try out new characters through the weekly free character rotation, which will work the same way as it did during the open beta.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, there is a separate Perk currency you can use to get perks. And there’s a Prestige currency that “rewards players for all of the items and cosmetics they collect for their favorite fighters.” Each cosmetic item you get awards its own Prestige currency value based on type and rarity. Eventually, you’ll use your Prestige currency to unlock Prestige cosmetics, which represent the rarest cosmetics in the game, Player First Games explained. These items can only be unlocked using Prestige currency. </p><p>“When we launch, all returning players will receive an allotment of Prestige currency based on the number of cosmetics they acquired during the open beta as a reward for all previous purchases and unlocks,” the developer added.</p><p>That’s four separate virtual currencies for the free-to-play brawler. It’s all a bit confusing, so hopefully the below image adds some clarity:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/mvs-currency-redux-5-1536x864-1716374479417.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The Gold currency previously available is no more. Player First Games said it will dish out commemorative cosmetics that correlate to a player’s Gold earned during the open beta. These are exclusive items that can’t be earned any other way.</p><p>And finally, Player First Games will reset all perks from the open beta. As mentioned, perks are now unlocked using the Perk currency, attainable through playing the game, and all players will receive an allotment that correlates to the number of perks unlocked from the open beta. Player and account mastery tracks will be set to level one at launch. “Mastery tracks are a great way to give you both short-term and long-term goals when starting out, and ultimately, we want to give all players the chance to earn lots of items,” Player First Games said.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-jason-voorhees-from-friday-the-13th-and-agent-smith-from-the-matrix">Warner Bros. revealed two new playable characters for MultiVersus</a>: the aforementioned Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th and Agent Smith from The Matrix. Jason Voorhees and Agent Smith join the MultiVersus roster alongside DC Super-Villain The Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill) as part of Season 1: Puns &amp; Villainy. Jason Voorhees is available at launch, while Agent Smith will release later in the season.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Yet here we are, over a month later, and there’s reportedly three people who are somehow still connected to the Nintendo Network, and it only recently used to be four.</p> <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true">This is according to <a href="https://x.com/GaffsNotLaffs/status/1792952060884791574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter user Gaffs</a>, who runs a Nintendo Network After Hours Discord and has been documenting the aftermath of the servers being shutdown. One of the players, Lcd101, we already reported on last month as they’ve been sharing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/one-dedicated-splatoon-wii-u-player-is-still-online-even-with-matchmaking-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">daily updates on what <em>Splatoon 1</em> looks like</a> now that its online features don’t work. The other two are Fishguy6564 in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mario-kart-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart 7</a></em> and SlitherySheep in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-super-mario-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Mario Maker</a></em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="799" data-injectable="true">A fourth player, <a href="https://x.com/xc_omoroid/status/1792893304184660119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">xc_omoroid on Twitter</a>, used to part of this exclusive crowd, having stayed connected to the servers for RPG <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-xenoblade-chronicles-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a></em>. Although it’s primarily a single-player game, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> did boast online functionality, allowing players to share their custom characters so others could use them in their party. Thankfully, the game is still functional even without the servers, but xc_omoroid decided to see how long they could stay online following the shutdown.</p>
 <p data-characters="557" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">They were finally booted from the game on May 21, which they consider a “miracle” since <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>‘s netcode apparently wasn’t very good; they even describe it as the worst of any Wii U game. In <a href="https://x.com/xc_omoroid/status/1792896287068848518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a follow-up post</a>, they said they also managed to beat all the online exclusive content, assuring they’ll forever have a truly complete save file. Honestly, this reminds me how I never got round to playing <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> myself and, even though the servers are gone, I’m half tempted to dig out my old copy.</p>
 <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">I have to imagine the remaining three players won’t stay connected to their respective games for much longer. Then again, I would’ve thought that one week after the servers shut down and yet they’ve lasted for over a month. At this rate, they could make it well into June. Whatever the case, they will be booted eventually, and then it will truly be an end of an era.</p>

            <p>Sony has shared a new job vacancy for a Mobile Platform Architect at PlayStation Global.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5078757004">listing</a>, which was spotted by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/98435/sony-developing-playstation-mobile-platform/index.html">TweakTown</a>, shows the company is looking for an engineer to design a PlayStation platform which will focus on "developing, publishing, and operating free-to-play mobile games".</p>
<p>Among the responsibilities, the successful candidate will be expected to assist the platform's engineering team with "technical leadership and guidance", contribute to the mobile platform's roadmap, establish "pipelines and processes to facilitate the delivery of high-quality software" and track" technical innovations, changes, and trends affecting mobile game development".</p>

<p>"An individual in this role will spearhead the design and implementation of this platform; work in partnership with internal teams to connect mobile games to PlayStation services; and ensure that all mobile games meet PlayStation's quality standards," the listing states.</p>
<p>Sony has previously dabbled with the mobile gaming market, publishing the likes of the PlayStation app, the PS Remote Play app, endless-runner <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/run-sackboy-run-review">Run Sackboy! Run!</a> (pictured below), top-down puzzle game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-free-to-play-uncharted-mobile-app-unlocks-exclusive-uncharted-4-multiplayer-rewards">Uncharted: Fortune Hunter</a> (above), and AR app God of War: Mimir's Vision.</p>
<p>However, these forays have never met the heights of other mobile releases, such as Genshin Impact and Pokémon Go. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-fortune-hunter-is-shutting-down">Uncharted: Fortune Hunter was shut down by developer Naughty Dog</a>. While it never specified why it was retiring its mobile spinoff, low player numbers were likely a factor.</p>
<p>
However, it appears the company is still set on reversing its fortunes in the future, with mobile undoubtedly being an important part of the market to crack. </p>

            <p>
Deadlock, the unannounced but previously-leaked hero shooter from Half-Life maker Valve, has been spotted again in a fresh leak. And, this time, we can now see gameplay footage of Deadlock in action.
</p>
<p>
Leaked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/images-leak-of-valves-next-game-and-its-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter">details of Deadlock sprung onto the internet last week</a> via images posted to social media and a report from longterm Valve reporter Tyler McVicker, which claimed that Deadlock was currently in closed testing. 
</p>
<p>
It's from this ongoing test that gameplay footage has now also leaked - showing off Deadlock's training mode, more hero characters, and the existence of BioShock Infinite-style skyrails you can hook onto and ride around on.

<p>
Even Deadlock's setting looks rather BioShock Infinite-like, with period advertising for brands of cigarettes and wide open town squares. 
</p>
<p>
The leaked footage shows off a number of training modes in which the player can acclimitise to the game's controls, test character movement and abilities, and then learn Deadlock's lane system. 
</p>
<p>
Heroes shown include the imp-like winged Ivy, who can slow and stun enemies while buffing allies, dapper fire demon Infernus who can deal fire damage over time, sneaky robot Haze and gothic sniper Vindicta. Several heroes are labelled as "great for new players!", presumably to get newbies started.

</span></p><p>You can watch the leaked footage via the embed above, for now - though Valve has already begun removing links to it.</p>
<p>
Previous reporting suggested Deadlock was Valve's next "major" project, and that it has been in development in one form or other since 2018. There's no word yet on when it'll be formally revealed.
</p>
<p>Deadlock isn't the only game due soon with a BioShock Infinite vibe.  Wasteland 3 developer InXile's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inxiles-clockwork-revolution-is-a-time-bending-rpg-which-owes-a-lot-to-bioshock-infinite">Clockwork Revolution appears so visually similar</a> that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-infinite-trailer-producer-highlights-similarities-with-clockwork-revolution">publisher Microsoft had to issue a statement</a> clarifying "any similarities are unintentional".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/watch-a-tank-attack-a-medieval-army-in-the-latest-kingmakers-trailer.878118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kingmakers-trailer-wreak-havoc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Kingmakers is shaping up very nicely, if the latest trailer is anything to go by. In the ‘Wreak Havoc’ trailer, Kingmakers’ destructive capabilities are laid out for all to see, with viewers witnessing a hulking tank smashing effortlessly through medieval buildings from the 13th century. There are shots of a dirtbike-riding soldier blasting through a crowd indiscriminately with an AK-47, and the same character wielding a shotgun and taking down horseback warriors.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kingmakers-is-wild">Kingmakers is Wild</h2>



<p>In our recent interview <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingmakers-interview-ultimate-medieval/">with the developers behind Kingmakers</a>, we learnt that this ambitious title has been dubbed ‘the ultimate medieval fantasy game’. It’s a mix of third-person action and RTS elements, with players assuming control of a character sent back in time to alter history by topping ancient rulers in their stalwart castles.</p>



<p>The latest trailer revealed a little more about how players will accomplish those goals. Mostly, they’ll be wielding modern weaponry and slaying out against waves of medieval soldiers desperately trying to survive with swords, shields, bows, and spears. This new trailer perfectly showcased the most destructive elements of Kingmakers, showing how players can fully collapse a building with a well-placed shot from a grenade launcher, or by driving a main battle tank clean through the side of the thing.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Despite featuring elements that border on the bizarre, Kingmakers is a legitimate title that takes itself seriously, and it has been in development for several years. It doesn’t have a release date, but it’s fast becoming one of the most wanted games on Steam.</p>

            <p>
MultiVersus beta players will be given a free premium battle pass for the fighting game's first season.
</p>
<p>
Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">open beta was shut down until the game's full launch</a>, with no refunds given to players, although progress and content will carry over.

</p>
<p>
Now, in a <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes">new blog post</a>, developer Player First Games has revealed returning players from the beta will receive access to the season one premium battle pass for free - provided they log in to MultiVersus by 11th June.
</p>

</figure>
<p>

In addition, any returning players will receive a special edition Snow Suit Finn character variant, a special edition Rising Stars ringout, and a special edition Banana Guard announcer pack.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of Banana Guard, players who complete the game's new tutorial - a seven-day reward calendar - will receive the character for free. Completing all seven days will add the Lady Banana Guard variant.
</p>
<p>
So what's included in the premium battle pass? The big draw is playable character <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-adds-the-matrixs-agent-smith-jason-voorhees">Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th, revealed earlier this week</a>.

</p>
<p>
Player First Games has increased the number of high-value items in both the free and premium tiers. Premium currency - Gleamium - is available in both tiers, with the premium tier including enough currency to get the next battle pass. Each season of the battle pass will last eight weeks and the final tier will be repeatable for those who reach it early and wish to keep earning rewards.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Warner Bros</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's unknown how much the premium battle pass will cost, though as above it's free for returning players.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the blog post details the four different currencies and how to acquire them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Perk currency - used to unlock in-game perks, gained through gameplay and the battle pass</li>
<li>Fighter currency - used to unlock characters, gained through gameplay and the battle pass</li>
<li>Prestige currency - used to unlock exclusive cosmetics, gained by acquiring cosmetics</li>
<li>Gleamium - used to unlock cosmetics, emotes, battle passes and more, gained in events, the battle pass, or direct purchase</li>
</ul>

<p>
Currencies from the beta no longer included here will still be usable. Gold will be swapped for commemorative cosmetics.

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
MultiVersus launches on 28th May across PC (Steam and Epic), PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, with cross-platform and cross-progression play.
</p>
<p>
"Characterful fighters, a good skill ceiling, and a co-op emphasis with real depth makes Warner Bros. MultiVersus a very pleasant surprise," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-review-more-than-just-another-super-smash-bros-clone">Eurogamer MultiVersus open beta review from last year</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-hearts-4-may-launch-on-nintendo-switch-2-has-online-features-looks-different-than-reveal-trailer.878103/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alongside the previous entries in the series, Kingdom Hearts 4 may release on Nintendo Switch 2, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking on X/Twitter, reliable insider Midori discussed the fourth entry in the series, revealing that it may be <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792956511435526341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released on the next Nintendo hardware</a> alongside its predecessors. As only<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-switch-outrageous-prices/"> cloud versions</a> have been released on the original Switch, it would definitely be great to have native ports of the entire series on the upcoming console.</p>
<p>Midori also revealed other <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792956382884278387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1792956382884278387%7Ctwgr%5E27bffc5c203bb2be18bde81cc84daa2b4a49e58f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinalweapon.net%2F2024%2F05%2F21%2Fkingdom-hearts-iv-reportedly-has-online-features-might-come-to-switch-2%2F">interesting tidbits</a> about Kingdom Hearts 4. Apparently, the game, codenamed Quattro (four in Italian), looks very different from the reveal trailer and will have some small online features. More outside IP collaborations are also being planned for the series in the future.</p>
<p>While Midori has proven to be extremely reliable in the past, especially regarding SEGA and Atlus leaks, we have to take what has been revealed on Kingdom Hearts 4 with a grain of salt. With Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth now out, the fourth entry in the series is Square Enix's next major release, so hopefully, we won't have to wait long to see more of it.</p>
<p>The latest main entry in the series is Kingdom Hearts III, now available on PC and consoles. You can learn more about it in Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-hearts-iii-the-end-has-come/">review</a>.</p>

<p>The First Descendant was revealed in 2022, and by today, prospective fans are still waiting for a confirmed release date. It’s expected to drop in 2024, and Nexon is hard at work polishing the highly anticipated title ahead of the impending launch. Recently, Nexon released a deep dive into the game’s story, revealing the key concepts of the setting, outlining some of the game’s lore, and explaining what makes The First Descendant so unique.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-becoming-the-first-descendant">Becoming The First Descendant</h2>



<p>The First Descendant is being pieced together by a South Korean studio, and it has been in development for a few years. It’s poised to be an epic, Unreal Engine 5-driven game that incorporates elements of the looter-shooter genre and traditional RPG titles. In the latest video uploaded to showcase the game, Nexon’s representatives outlined the core concept of The First Descendant:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Humanity has embraced the destiny left by their predecessors, the ‘Ancestors’, and have become the Descendants. The Vulgus (an alien race) started a war to fulfill the will of their predecessors, the survival of their species. The mission of the Colossi (large beings) cannot be revealed, but they consider it a curse.</p>



<p>The First Descendant’s universe begins with the clash of those who inherited the fate of their predecessors. Whether this tragic fate can be severed in this generation, or will be passed on to the next generation, all depends on the Descendant, who will become the player’s avatar.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a lofty and ambitious concept that has the makings of a fantastic story, but from what we’ve seen so far in terms of gameplay isn’t turning heads too dramatically. In some ways, it looks like a typical third-person shooter that’s even reminiscent of titles like Gears of War at times. In The First Descendant, players will control ‘the ultimate and most powerful tactical force of humanity,’ using a series of unique abilities to overcome some immense enemies, and various play styles and approaches to missions are encouraged.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>One gripe that prospective fans have with The First Descendant is that it’s an ‘always online’ game, despite there being solo gameplay elements present in the title. It’s an adventure that can be played cooperatively, but playing solo won’t switch off those always online requirements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/leaker-claims-fortnite-could-get-major-kingdom-hearts-crossover/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=leaker-claims-fortnite-could-get-major-kingdom-hearts-crossover<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="161" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s not just Steam that <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is coming to, as according to prominent leaker MbKKssTBhz5, a special crossover is also set to arrive in <em>Fortnite</em>. </p> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">When discussing the news that the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-games-make-steam-debut-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series will launch on Steam</a> on June 13, MbKKssTBhz5 revealed that they believe a new platform isn’t the only place we’ll see <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> this year, suggesting that not only could it come to Nintendo hardware, but to other games too, specifically mentioning that <em>Fortnite</em> was “part of this initiative.”</p> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, they don’t have any more information about what it could include or when it could happen, but my mind immediately goes to a Sora character skin, and a Keyblade harvesting tool. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I heard Fortnite was part of this initiative. But I didn’t have any other information on collaboration or date for the collaboration.</p>— みどり (@MbKKssTBhz5) <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792975164684063118?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true">Of course, the idea of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> arriving in <em>Fortnite</em> makes a ton of sense. <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is all about Disney characters, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-persistent-universe-connected-to-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney now owns a $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games</a>. What better way to maximize your revenue than to create a crossover with a property you already control, rather than working with an outside identity on licensing agreements or revenue shares?</p>
 <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">As for when this crossover could happen, it would make a lot of sense to do it around the release of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> on Steam, but that is just three weeks away, and we would usually see more concrete rumors about a potential crossover by now if that were to be the case. </p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">The other suggestion is that it could be around the release of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-date-characters-and-everything-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts IV</a></em>, but with it not scheduled to launch until 2025, that seems like a long time to wait. We may get new trailers this year though, which may be a better time to drop some themed cosmetics in <em>Fortnite</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">Remember though, this is a leak and is definitely not confirmed, so make sure to take it with a hefty pinch of salt. In the meantime, we still have a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnites-new-fallout-content-is-more-salt-in-the-wound-for-fallout-76-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fallout</em> crossover</a> event to enjoy in <em>Fortnite</em>, so there are plenty of opportunities to spend your V-Bucks in the future. </p>

Smash Bros. fighters have an almost equal chance of winning a match, creator Masahiro Sakurai has said.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/masahiro-sakurai-launches-new-youtube-channel-on-game-development">Sakurai's YouTube series is still going strong</a>, with his latest video discussing balance in fighting games - something the Smash Bros. games have seen their fair share of controversy around.
</p>
<p>
The video includes win rate data from across the globe, revealing the highest win rate is 51.43 percent and the lowest win rate is 47.18 percent. It means all 87 characters sit within this win/loss ratio, hovering around an equal 50 percent chance of winning.

<p>
Sakurai doesn't reveal which characters are at the top and bottom of this scale - this remains top secret - but, in his words, "any fighter has a shot at winning".
</p>
<p>
As he explains in the video, creating fighters is a balance between uniqueness and competitive balance. Should all characters be too similarly balanced, the game would be boring. "Average and mediocre are the same thing," says Sakurai. Equally, too much uniqueness means "you'll naturally end up with mixed reception".
</p>
<p>
"If you balance purely based on fighter strength, their abilities quickly start to level out," says Sakurai. "Hence, I advise our team to keep fighters unique by amplifying shortcomings to offset advantages."

<p>
Smash Bros. has certainly been accused of imbalance in the past. GameCube title Melee included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meta-knight-return-confirmed-for-super-smash-bros-wii-u-and-3ds">Kirby character Meta Knight</a>, who was deemed too powerful and banned from professional tournaments.

</p>
<p>
Similarly, when sassy witch Bayonetta was introduced in Super Smash Bros. on Wii U and 3DS, many found her to be overpowered.
</p>
<p>
Still, Sakurai notes the internet can be "an echo chamber of sorts" that perpetuates opinion. "If people want to prove their point, they're best off settling it in an actual match," he says.
</p>
<p>
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the latest game in the series, released on Switch back in 2018. It's the third highest-selling game on the system, behind Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

            <p>XDefiant, Ubisoft's free-to-play Call of Duty-like arena shooter, launched yesterday. However, the game has already faced its share of issues, with matchmaking being shot (pun not intended) leaving many unable to access it at all.</p>
<p>As users reported being met with an <a href="https://x.com/WHOH/status/1792971353534148865">"Unable to Find Match"</a> alert, Ubisoft acknowledged players were struggling to join a game, stating: "Please bear with us while we look into servers and matchmaking!"</p>
<p>Things got so bad, developer Mark Rubin - who previously worked on the Call of Duty series prior to his role as XDefiant's executive producer - shared a post on social media last night, showing a hamster clinging on desperately to an out of control wheel. "Matchmaking servers go boom!" he wrote.</p>

</figure>
<p>Rubin additionally assured his followers that the team was "working on it", and the <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1793044381076685170">most recent update over on the XDefiant account</a> is that Ubisoft is "seeing progress on the matchmaking servers".</p>
<p>"We will continue to monitor the situation and keep you updated," it said.</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>XDefiant has walked quite an uneven path to launch. The game was initially revealed as Tom Clancy's XDefiant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-ghost-recon-and-the-division-merge-in-ubis-6v6-free-to-play-fps-xdefiant">back in 2021</a>, but Ubisoft later announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-drops-tom-clancys-name-from-xdefiant">dropping the prefix</a> following criticism from Tom Clancy fans. Essentially, the Tom Clancy fanbase felt the XDefiant announcement strayed too far from the franchise's serious military themes and formula.</p>
<p>With the Tom Clancy name dropped, XDefiant went on to have a number of tests, but not always very successfully. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-may-extend-xdefiant-closed-beta-over-horrible-server-experience">one beta was described as having a "horrible" server experience</a> by Rubin himself.</p>
<p>XDefiant then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-delayed-due-to-console-certification-issues">missed a planned launch</a> last year due to console certification issues. It subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delays-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-again">received another delay</a> in October, this time because of "inconsistencies in the game experience".</p>

            <p>We just got a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date">Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> story trailer yesterday. As is their druthers, FromSoft have at once made the events it depicts feel of earth-shattering importance while providing basically no concrete information. A lot of people will be putting out gargantuan theory posts right now, rambling on about Miquella, the Crucible, the Golden Order blah blah. This is all a distraction. Anyone with eyes can tell you that the primary movers and shakers of this final chapter in the Lands Between are a secret faction of hitherto secret spear people. You're likely confused, and that's understandable.

<p>The first ill omen portenting toward the encroaching spear-mageddon that threatens to consume <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>’s world is cleverly disguised as just ‘a bunch of blokes with spears’. If you look closely, you’ll notice single bloke with an axe. This is what tipped me off, you see. If everyone had spears, I wouldn’t be so suspicious, but this this single axe feels like a such a fat carp hastily painted red and herring-shaped. It’s meant to convince us the spear people aren’t taking over, but I know better.</p>
<p>After a close-up shot of another soldier pulling his - you guessed it - spear from a corpse. We’re treated to this telling shot:</p>

</figure>
<p>It’s like they’re not even trying to hide it anymore! Look at the corpse! Also, look at how uniform the formation is. If you trace each spear point to its opposite point, you might begin to notice a sort of sigil-code taking shape. In spear-ish, this code translates to: Look at all these spears! Which is a sort of bullish rallying cry meant to reinforce notions of spear-iority. Truly fiendish. Here’s the next shot:</p>

<p>Yes, Messmer, the DLC’s new antagonist, I know, I know. But what’s that he’s got clutched in his hand? It’s spears all the way down! Spear-oboros! I’m honestly too overcome with revelations for words, so I will leave the shot-by-shot analysis here, partly to leave the remaining spears for you to discover, but mostly because this shitpost had run its course by the second paragraph. I hope this was of use to you intrepid lore hunters, but if it wasn’t, I’m keen to highlight that my headline has the words ‘Elden Ring’ and ‘rated’ in the title, which I assume is how my writing will be judged from here on out.</p>

			<p>Next month's planned Xbox Showcase will be interesting for fans of the Xbox 360-era JRPGs, it's been claimed.</p>
<p>That's what Xbox Era co-founder @Shpeshal_Nick shared on X/Twitter some hours ago. "If what I’ve heard is true, fans of Xbox 360-era JRPGs will have something to look forward to at the showcase", the insider <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1793113945018105857" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X. No additional details have been shared, but Xbox boss Phil Spencer has openly been talking about bringing more games to Xbox from Japanese developers. JRPGs that spring to mind include Mistwalker's excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-odyssey-available-xbox-one-bc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-dragon-available-xbox-one-bc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Dragon</a>, Eternal Sonata, Enchanted Arms, but also the Last Remnant, and several others. Back in January of this year, the insider was <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-january-31st/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right on the money</a> regarding the PlayStation State of Play broadcast.</p>
<p>The upcoming Xbox showcase has yet to be detailed, but Microsoft has confirmed that it will be showing off several upcoming first-party titles. Recent rumors suggest <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-will-be-shown-next-month-recent-rumors-might-have-been-outdated-says-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot will be present during the event</a>.&nbsp; "Like our double-feature last year with Starfield Direct, immediately following the Showcase we’ll be airing a special deep-dive into the next installment of a beloved franchise", Microsoft announced last month. "We can’t say much, so for now we’ll call it the Xbox Games Showcase followed by&nbsp;<mark>[REDACTED]</mark>&nbsp;Direct."</p>
<p>"This will also be our first Showcase featuring games from our portfolio of studios across Activision, Blizzard, Bethesda and Xbox Game Studios, in addition to titles from our third-party partners."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/events/xbox-games-showcase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> will air on June 9 at 10 am PT. The showcase will be followed by a special "Direct" broadcast.</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about the Xbox showcase.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-season-1s-battle-pass-and-playable-jason-are-free-for-returning-players/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=multiversus-season-1s-battle-pass-and-playable-jason-are-free-for-returning-players<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="384" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>MultiVersus</em> is doing a lot to win over not just new fans, but all the old players from the game’s open beta. Multiple new characters, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/jason-voorhees-and-agent-smith-are-joining-the-joker-in-multiversus-first-proper-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as Jason Voorhees and Agent Smith</a>, have been confirmed for its first proper season, alongside a PvE mode, and now developer Player First Games has revealed how returning players can claim a bunch of free content, including the battle pass.</p> <p data-characters="669" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">Like similar free-to-play games, <em>MultiVersus</em> has two kinds of battle passes: a free one for all players and a premium pass you need to pay for that offers additional rewards. According to <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official website</a>, if you played the original beta, you’ll automatically unlock the premium battle pass, which means you’ll also get access to the game’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-fans-are-split-on-jasons-ridiculously-chunky-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incredibly chunky Jason</a>. It sounds like a good deal to me, especially since Player First Games is promising it has bumped up the number of high value rewards in both battle passes. However, you will need to log into <em>MultiVersus</em> by June 11, two weeks after its May 28 launch, to take advantage of the offer.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Player First Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="837" data-injectable="true">Player First Games is also offering returning players a few other special pieces of content—a Snow Suit Finn variant, a Rising Stars ringout, and a Banana Guard announcer pack—and these ones aren’t under any time limit; you’ll get them whenever you log in for the first time. In addition, there’ll be a seven-day reward calendar for any players who beat the tutorial, with the final unlock being a playable Banana Guard from <em>Adventure Time</em>. I’ll let you decide whether that’s a worthwhile reward or not.</p>
 <p data-characters="649" data-current-count="649" data-injectable="true">Speaking of rewards, Player First Games has decided to give its in-game economy something of an overhaul. There are still too many types of currency in my opinion—four of them to be exact—but the premium currency, Gleamium, will now be included in both the free and premium battle passes. Originally, Gleamium had to be bought with real money, and a significant number of unlockables could only be purchased with Gleamium. During the beta, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/it-costs-255-to-unlock-everything-in-multiversus-that-cant-be-earned-by-playing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> deduced that it would cost roughly $250 / £200 to acquire everything the game had to offer at the time. Sure, <em>MultiVersus</em> is free-to-play so it needs to earn money somehow, but this just felt extreme.</p>
 <p data-characters="678" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="false">With Gleamium now obtainable through play, this should mean players won’t feel as pressured to spend more and more money on certain unlockables. Plus, completing the premium battle pass will ensure you have enough Gleamium to purchase the next season’s battle pass, so that’s already an improvement. However, we don’t know how much unlockables will cost or how much grinding will need to be done to acquire characters, costumes, and the like if you don’t want to spend money. <em>MultiVersus</em> seems to be doing everything right to rejuvenate interest, but a demanding grind and obnoxiously high prices for items could very easily push people away again.</p>

  <p id="uZrQA6"><strong>Chapter 5 Season 3</strong> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide"><em>Fortnite</em></a>, formally called <strong>Wrecked</strong>, appears to be focused on using huge vehicles to get around a desert wasteland.</p>
<p id="ssQdms">Hot on the w-heels of a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide/24097617/chapter-5-season-2-battle-pass-skins-list-c5s2">Greek methology-themed season</a>, <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 will also feature a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24159107/fallout-fortnite-epic-games-bethesda-softworks">Fallout crossover</a>.</p>
<p id="2JSekB">We’ll break down the expected <strong>release times</strong> for <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 (based on your time zone) and explain <strong>when Fortnite downtime is supposed to end</strong>. You’ll also get a summary of what to expect from the new <em>Fortnite</em> season.</p>
<hr id="JwdP9P">
<h2 id="7GPqID"><strong>What time does Fortnite downtime end and Chapter 5 Season 3 release in your time zone?</strong></h2>
<p id="CsgMrl"><em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 is set to launch on <strong>Friday, May 24</strong>, at the same time around the world. Based on the launch times of previous seasons, we can make a strong educated guess for when <em>Fortnite</em> will go down and come back up again.</p>
<p id="uG3CVn">Server downtime typically starts around 2 or 3 a.m. EDT and<strong> typically last about four hours, </strong>give or take. That means we can reasonably expect <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 to go live at the following times depending on your time zone:</p>
<ul>
<li id="hRirtL">
<strong>1 a.m. - 4 a.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="Prdg5A">
<strong>4 a.m. - 7 a.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="ifpyl6">
<strong>9 a.m. - 12 p.m. BST</strong> for the U.K.</li>
<li id="BZSPRs">
<strong>10 a.m. - 1 p.m. CEST</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="TI0AFn">

<hr id="Vt4bPg">
<h2 id="HwO1KL"><strong>What to expect in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3</strong></h2>
<p id="2Z0gDJ">So far, the known quantities for <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 3 are the name (“Wrecked”) and the much-ballyhooed Fallout collaboration, which will see you get your hands on some Power Armor. Whether this is an item or a skin is yet to be confirmed, but you can briefly see it in action in the following embedded post on X:</p>

<p id="S51BT1">Elsewhere, an official teaser trailer suggests a sandstorm will bring about an apocalyptic desert theme:</p>
<div id="JTlulA"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZEBEWByhvwk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="3G8mjH">Meanwhile, the <em>Fortnite</em> X account teased the possibility of a new bus, replete with video footage of a (real) monster truck jumping over a (real?) bus. This dovetails with what longtime <em>Fortnite</em> leaker ShiinaBR (who has a sturdy track record for this sort of thing) <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1791879277278847265">said on X</a>: that monster trucks are coming to <em>Fortnite</em> as of Chapter 5 Season 3.</p>

<p id="ALK5r8">Tying into all of the above, datamines from the <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1790029042264997986">HYPEX account on X</a> suggest “sand landmarks” or a dedicated desert biome, as well as a steam train makeover for the map’s snaking locomotive.</p>
<p id="5ra1Sb">There’s also the suggestion of collaborations with Metallica, Fall Guys, and Pirates of the Caribbean. That said, based on the game’s track record, take these tie-ins with a pinch of salt — and if they do appear, could be in non-battle royale modes, and / or will appear later in the season.</p>
<div id="9J7KrF">
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>SEASON 3 INFO &amp; LEAKS SO FAR  </p><p>• THEME &amp; DATE: Post-Apocalyptic / May 24th<br>• COLLABS: Metallica, Fall Guys, Pirates of the Caribbean &amp; More..<br>• UI UPDATES: Each item in the shop will have its own timer<br>• Lead-up Mini Event with a huge sandstorm &amp; lightning<br>• Sand Landmarks… <a href="https://t.co/r40pYAPMnV">pic.twitter.com/r40pYAPMnV</a></p></div>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1790029042264997986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="pKLwhX">There’s plenty to look forward to then. The other thing of note — and this is pure speculation on our part — is the season launches day-in-date with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa</em></a>, making it primed for a possible Mad Max crossover. There has been no indication of that so far (from developer Epic Games or otherwise) but we’d be surprised if that doesn’t appear at <em>some</em> point.</p>

			<p>It's been nearly three years since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-leak-lists-final-fantasy-vii-ix-remake-half-life-2-remastered-mgs2-hd-and-lots-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memorable GeForce NOW leak</a> confirmed the existence of a Final Fantasy IX Remake. While most of the games included in NVIDIA's list ended up being announced, some of them never were.</p>
<p>This includes the remake of the ninth mainline entry in Square Enix's Final Fantasy series. However, rumors have persisted despite the lack of any official announcement. In early June 2023, a leaker on ResetEra suggested Final Fantasy IX Remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-playstation-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would be a PlayStation exclusive</a> featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-traditional-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional gameplay</a> instead of the action combat used for the Final Fantasy VII Remake. That same leaker <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-ready-release-prettier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the game was almost ready to be released and would sport updated models and prettier graphics, although it was not a big-budget remake like Final Fantasy VII. Around two months ago, another leaker <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that he heard the same - it will be a faithful remake with a relatively modest budget.</p>
<p>Yesterday, leaked Midori joined the chorus, <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792748529418682523" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirming</a> that Final Fantasy IX Remake is indeed in development at Square Enix. However, the Final Fantasy X Remake is not, at least for now.</p>
<p>Midori first gained credit <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-games-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a SEGA leaker</a>, but recently also <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-botw-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> about Nintendo possibly making a new version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the upcoming Switch 2 console. This is the first time Midori provided a Square Enix leak.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Final Fantasy IX originally launched in 2000 for Sony's PlayStation 2 console. It returned the franchise to a medieval setting called Gaia, following the futuristic worlds seen in the previous installments. In the story, players follow a thief named Zidane Tribal, who kidnaps Princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII as part of a ploy by the neighboring nation of Lindblum. He joins Garnet and a growing cast of characters on a quest to bring down her mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria, who started the war.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy IX Remake could debut at the next PlayStation Showcase, which is expected to air sometime next week.</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>Amazon Games has opened its first studio in Europe, led by former Ubisoft managing director Cristian Pana.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Bucharest, the new studio will focus on supporting Amazon's growing portfolio of games and joins already established development teams in Orange County, Montreal, San Diego, and Seattle.</p>
<p>Studio head Cristian Pana has over two decades of experience at Ubisoft in multiple roles, having started out in QA in 2004 leading to various producer roles before becoming managing director of Ubisoft Bucharest from 2020 to 2024.</p>
<p>"I'm thrilled to join Amazon Games at a time when the team is actively building across an exciting roadmap," said Pana.</p>
<p>"I've built and led outstanding teams in the past and I know this area of Europe is a hot spot for some of the very best talent in gaming."</p>
<p>VP of Amazon Games Christoph Hartmann added: "Expanding our internal development teams into Europe was a natural next step for us as we tackle our brand portfolio.</p>
<p>"Bucharest is known as one of the top emerging European cities for game development and we look forward to tapping into the rich talent pool."</p>

			<p>INGAME STUDIOS announced that its 'organized crime shooter' Crime Boss: Rockay City will land <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933080/Crime_Boss_Rockay_City/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> on June 18 after around fifteen months of Epic Games Store exclusivity on PC.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new DLC called Cagnali’s Order will drop on all platforms (PC and consoles). The expansion pack includes four dystopian missions in which the Rockay City Police Department is joined by an evil mega-corporation's robotic police squad. Bursting with new enemies, a new boss, and playable characters, Cagnali’s Order forms the backbone of the expansion package (which also includes a reworked gaming system, levels, weapons packs, heists, and more).</p>
<p><iframe title="Cagnali's Order DLC Trailer - Crime Boss: Rockay City [ESRB]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ulivG1Db74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As I <a href="https://wccftech.com/crime-boss-rockay-city-feels-like-a-half-baked-rushed-heist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> when the game first launched in late March 2023, Crime Boss: Rockay City felt very rushed at the time. However, INGAME STUDIOS has since released many free updates that improved the game. Jarek Kolář, Head of Development at INGAME Studios, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We are so thankful to the growing community for sticking with Crime Boss as we work tirelessly to improve and build upon the game. Crime Boss: Rockay City coming to Steam is another huge leap forward for the game, and we welcome people to revisit Rockay with fresh eyes. We’re so excited for the future of Crime Boss.</em></p>
<p>There's also a special offer for Steam users: for a limited time, Cagnali's Order and the previous DLCs (Dragon’s Gold Cup, Heavy Hitters Weapon Pack, and Tactical Weapon Pack) will be available for free.</p>
<p>The developers have also promised to release more content throughout this year and the next. There's even a roadmap available <a href="https://visitrockaycity.com/roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>. Update 10, titled Baker's Angels, is said to add unique boss skins and more, while Update 11 (Legends) will introduce new characters, among other things. Update 12 (Nightmare) will add a Horde mode to Crime Boss: Rockay City. Lastly, Q1 2025 will see the release of a new multiplayer missions and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-shows-off-impressive-unreal-engine-5-black-hawk-down-campaign-teaser/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tencent's Team Jade (formerly known as TiMi Studio Group) has released a brief Summer Game Fest teaser for its upcoming tactical first-person shooter Delta Force: Hawk Ops. A special stream event is scheduled for June 7th at 14:00 PDT, and the game will be playable during Summer Game Fest Play Days from June 8th to June 10th.</p>
<p>The video teaser is focused on the game's 'Black Hawk Down' campaign mode, which is being developed with Unreal Engine 5. Weirdly enough, that won't be true for the other two modes available in Delta Force: Hawk Ops, which will presumably be made in Unreal Engine 4 instead.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Large-Scale PvP Mode - Havoc Warfare:</strong> Compete as part of a large team on massive maps, featuring authentic terrains and including military vehicles, tanks and helicopters in a grand war.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Extraction Mode - Hazard Operations:</strong> Squad up and take on other teams or AI-controlled mercenaries and royal guards in the Hazard Operations, the most tactical take on the popular extraction genre to date. Random events across massive maps will keep players engaged, as well as selecting challenging PvE-focused missions as part of the experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Delta Force: Hawk Ops - Black Hawk Down Campaign | Official Unreal Engine 5 Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgAZEssqNpU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Delta Force: Hawk Ops is scheduled to launch as a free-to-play game on PC, consoles, and mobile, the Black Hawk Down campaign mode will be only available on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>On PC, NVIDIA RTX owners <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-coming-to-project-mugen-delta-force-hawk-ops-out-now-in-fort-solis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can look forward to DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation support</a>.</p>

                <p>Just over three decades ago, Midway's NBA Jam was a monster hit in arcades that rivaled Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II. Arcades have largely fallen by the wayside since the days of NBA Jam's dominance. However, the spirit of the game is being revisited in NBA Superstars, a new arcade game from Raw Thrills and Play Mechanix that recreates the over-the-top style of NBA Jam. And to further connect the two games, NBA Jam announcer Tim Kitzrow is lending his voice to NBA Superstars as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4r22l5Zl90" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p4r22l5Zl90" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>All 30 NBA teams are represented in NBA Superstars, which features modern players including LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and more. One of the updated changes for this title is that NBA Superstars will feature three-on-three games as opposed to NBA Jam's two-on-two contests.</p><p>The arcade cabinet for NBA Superstars also represents a significant step up from the NBA Jam era. It features a 75-inch screen, marquee lights that simulate camera flashes, and team-specific color-coordinated RGB LEDs. Additionally, players will be able to create their own online accounts that can keep track of their records and statistics via QR codes that can be scanned by the game.</p><p>NBA Superstars will be released in arcades this summer. But if you'd rather bring the arcade action to your living room, Arcade1Up's NBA Jam home arcade cabinet features multiple versions of the classic basketball game.
