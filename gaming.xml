			<p>As a former PlanetSide 2 player and general MMO fan, I couldn't help but be intrigued <a href="https://wccftech.com/reaper-actual-is-an-open-world-persistent-shooter-from-the-makers-of-planetside-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the announcement of Reaper Actual two months ago</a>. Developer Distinct Possibility Studios has put a lot of the old gang back together, from former Sony Online Entertainment president John Smedley to Creative Director Matthew Higby and Senior Art Director Tramell Isaac.</p>



<p>Just like PlanetSide 2, Reaper Actual is an open-world MMOFPS set in a huge (four times as large as Warzone's Al Mazrah), seamless, and persistent map with potentially up to a thousand concurrent players. It will eventually feature combined arms warfare with ground, sea, and air vehicles. However, there are some key differences. PlanetSide 2 was based on the Realm vs Realm concept, asking players to side with one of three factions and conquer as much territory as possible. This new game shies away from that, putting players in the shoes of a mercenary who will work for any of several NPC factions in the game. That's another big difference: there were no NPCs whatsoever in PlanetSide 2, while they are a key component of Reaper Actual to make the world feel alive at all times. Additionally, the year being what it is, it also includes some extraction shooter elements.</p>



<p>I had the opportunity to check out a presentation of the game during Gamescom 2025. It was a Pre-Alpha and, therefore, unsurprisingly buggy—sometimes, the NPCs would lock up or get stuck. However, speaking to John Smedley and Matthew Higby, the potential to create a unique experience is definitely there. You can read our full chat about practically every facet of Reaper Actual below.</p>



<p>By the way, a paid Foundation Alpha will be available via Epic Games Store and the game's official website later this month, though the developers warn that only a limited number of copies will be sold at this stage to keep the playtesting pool relatively tight. Early next year, Reaper Actual will be released in early access on both Epic Games Store and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2995670/Reaper_Actual/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The biggest differentiator between our game and any shooter you've ever played (other than PlanetSide 2 if you played that one) is that it is set in a persistent world. Unlike other extraction shooters, we are not round-based, and we also have a full day/night cycle, complete with dynamic weather. This is a fully open world PvPvE game. The NPCs themselves are in these five different factions and fight each other all the time, so you may be running around the world and come upon a battle between them. When there's an event, it's typically two AI factions fighting, and there's missions available for players.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>John Smedley: </strong>When you log into the world for the first time, you're put into your first base. This is a bunker base. There are warehouse bases, and we're adding apartment bases. We're adding many different types, and they come in different shapes and sizes. For example, the bunker base is a simple one with no garage, so you can't have your vehicles here. But it's also very secure, because there's only one entrance and one exit, which makes it easy to defend. There's hard points in here where you can mount turrets and set up traps across. In Reaper Actual, your base comes with a vault of a specific size based on the base size. And it also comes with Reapers, who are basically tier one operators from the world's different intelligence agencies and military services, and they each come with different loadouts. That loadout is something that they default to, so even if you die, you still come back with a loadout that is different per Reaper. Then you have abilities; we're changing them to tools. Callsign Zero has an ammunition crate and an armor crate, for example, though I think he's gonna end up with just one of those fairly soon.</p>



<p>Back at your base, you can also buy and sell things with a different faction. There are different factions that, if you do missions for them, you'll gain faction reputation with them, opening up the purchase of cooler and cooler stuff. This is the north island of Morova. Morova itself is 16 km by 12 km and made up of these two Islands: the southern one and the northern one. For now, we're focused on the northern island, which is already huge—it's about 3 km by 2.</p>



<p>The biggest differentiator between our game and any shooter you've ever played (other than PlanetSide 2 if you played that one) is that it is set in a persistent world. Unlike other extraction shooters, we are not round-based, and we also have a full day/night cycle, complete with dynamic weather.</p>



<p>So, this is a fully open world PvPvE game. The NPCs themselves are in these five different factions and fight each other all the time, so you may be running around the world and come upon a battle between them. When there's an event, it's typically two AI factions fighting, and there's missions available for players.</p>



<p><strong>Is Reaper Actual currently in Alpha stage or Pre-Alpha?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Smedley:</strong> It's in Pre-Alpha right now. We'll be launching an Alpha soon, it's called Foundation Alpha, on September 22, where we are going to sell a very small amount of copies of the game to let up a small number of people in and actually play the game because we want players to come in and actually tell us if the game is fun, and teach us the things we don't know about our own game.</p>



<p><strong>Are you using Unreal Engine 5?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Smedley:</strong> We are using Unreal Engine 5.5 as of today. We'll be on Unreal 5.6 by the time we launch our Foundation Alpha and, by the time we launch the game in early access next year, probably up to about 5.8. We've done a really good job of optimizing the game. I'm regularly getting 120 frames per second. I'm pretty happy with what we're doing on that.</p>



<p>This is an example of an actual player base. You can have helipads, you can have garages, you can have fancy ones. The difference is, look at all the glass around here. More entrances mean more places to defend against people coming in. People can raid your base if you collect 'heat' in the game, very similar to GTA. As you go through the world and shoot people, you collect that heat, and if it gets too high without cooling off and not shooting players and NPCs for a while, the players can follow you back to your base and you end up in a battle with them. But the defender has the advantage because they can set up defenses. Also, the Reapers they've collected but not actually deployed can actually be set up to defend your base for you.</p>

But the defender has the advantage because they can set up defenses. Also, the Reapers they've collected but not actually deployed can actually be set up to defend your base for you.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>That's pretty cool. Are bases instanced?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Smedley:</strong> They are, but they have a real world location.</p>



<p><strong>Do the Reapers have different skills?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Smedley:</strong> They have different abilities in the form of tools that they have available to them, the ammunition crate being an example.</p>



<p><strong>Matthew Higby: </strong>The idea that we're going with right now is that they're all sort of itemized since it's an extraction game, so you get some by default in your toolkit, but you can replace them if you want to, so you can really sort of form exactly the type of Reaper that you want, but the Reapers themselves by default have a base toolkit.</p>



<p>You can think of it as itemizing in a MOBA. By default, this character does this. But if you throw these items on it, now I can do these additional things, and then you can unlock, you know, a more medic-oriented one or a more explosives-oriented one. You always have the free loadout, but again, if you want to have some variation or you want to do something special in your run, you can grab a different tool and overload those defaults.</p>



<p><strong>I'm guessing you also have vehicles right in the game, correct?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Smedley:</strong> Yep, we will eventually have ground, air, and sea vehicles. We currently have ground vehicles and helicopters in, but they're not functional. This is an island, so we're going to have sea vehicles as well.</p>



<p><strong>What are you targeting for when it comes to time-to-kill?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Smedley:</strong> More like Call of Duty DMZ or Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p><span><strong>Matthew Higby:&nbsp;</strong>One thing to keep in mind is that the purpose </span>of these PvE events like this is to attract players to this event so that players are running around. There's no players on the server with us now, so it's a little bit less exciting than it could be, but in general, this sort of event is going on and a firefight is happening. It's a little uncertain if there's players down there, or if it's just NPCs. So, you really have to stay on your toes and pay attention to what's happening around you when they're playing. </p>



<p>When we playtest, you definitely have that feel right now. The other thing is that the combat is meant to be sort of pocketed in and sporadic, so it moves players around. It's not supposed to be the whole airport that's filled. You'll notice it's mostly depopulated, and that's intentional so that we have tension and breathing space between all of these different pockets of activity. Maybe there could be 20 or 30 players that also get pulled over to the same area, so it's not intended to be just loaded with NPCs that you're going through like in The Division or something like that.</p>



<p><strong>Did you test how many players Reaper Actual can actually hold?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong>&nbsp;Right now, we're going to get up to 200 players, but we're going to get over a thousand hopefully by the time we're just a little bit after launch.</span> It's going to be a large game..</p>



<p><span><strong>Matthew Higby:</strong></span> The interesting thing about this is just the sense that there's a firefight happening nearby me, and you kind of have that sense going on while playing this game as opposed to something like Tarkov, where there's a little just sporadically once in a while. It's mostly very quiet. Here, pretty much always, as you're running around, you're going to hear gunfights in the distance to attract other players to it constantly.</p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> And that is our intent, to bring those together.  Now I'm taking you to a city called Alaria. You could drive there, fly there, take a boat there, take the metro train, or walk there if you want to. This world is huge. The scope that we're going for is absolutely stunningly massive. Some of the buildings you can scale up and some you can go into, but our goal is to make it so that this world feels big and has all kinds of different places and nooks and crannies to explore. And of course, good sniping positions. Are you familiar with the map Al Mazrah from Call of Duty: Warzone? This is about four times the size of the largest Warzone map. We also have MMO features like time of day. The moon actually waxes and wanes and goes in full sometimes and a dark night sometimes. Our goal is to make the world feel very alive to people. The AI factions are there to bring players together to fight. Normally, it's kind of boring demoing a PvP game when I'm not on the server with hundreds of other people, but this is very fun in our team playtests. It plays very differently when you have PvP, obviously.</p>



<p><span><strong>Matthew Higby:</strong></span> Then there is our mission system, which is designed for you to keep a persistently running world constantly populated with interesting activities. All of these places where John is running around can be areas where mission objectives spawn, like a laptop could be there with a key that you need to have a laptop to be able to get it, and that building is populated with NPCs, because that event has spawned. Again, it uses the mission system to draw players to that location. You could have one faction sending players to defend the laptop so it doesn't get hacked, and other players are being sent to attack the laptop so it does get hacked.</p>



<p>You can even have a laptop spawn on the top floor and a locker spawn on the bottom floor and there's different missions targeting both of those locations just to draw players to the same building. And we can kind of laser target that across the map, in a variety of different ways, making two events. So there's a hundred players at two different events or a hundred events where two players are being sent to each of a hundred different events, and various combinations in between.</p>



<p>All to keep players moving around and earning rewards without just hanging out in the same spot all the time. The missions are constantly changing based on the opportunities available in the game world. John was mentioning the daylight cycle. So many of these game features are really unique to our game, because not a lot of other games have a persistent world. We have to do a lot of stuff to support and make a persistent world work instead of just being a session-based experience where it's always the same thirty minutes, start to finish, every time.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Our mission system is designed to keep a persistently running world constantly populated with interesting activities.

Again, it uses the mission system to draw players to that location. You could have one faction sending players to defend the laptop so it doesn't get hacked, and other players are being sent to attack the laptop so it does get hacked.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Does NPC activity change based on the time of day?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>Matthew Higby:</strong></span> Yeah, and the Obsidian Syndicate faction, they're like John Wick-inspired assassins. They are more willing to use silenced weapons, night vision goggles, etc. When you're fighting them at nighttime, you know they have more of a threat to them, while other NPCs might just be really, really easy, and they go kind of bunker back to behind their sandbags at nighttime, instead of doing patrols. They have completely different behavioral routines based on time of day and weather. When it's pouring rain, the NPCs' awareness gets pulled in so that they can't really hear as much. Similarly, you can't hear somebody chasing you.</p>



<p>Eventually, if we add electrical storms, they'll interfere with electronics and all of that. It's all basically in service of trying to create a dynamic environment and within this persistent world, so nothing feels very static, and everything feels emergent.</p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> We have villages in between. This island is getting more populous every single day.</p>



<p><span><strong>Matthew Higby:</strong></span> And player bases, too, scattered all over the map. The APB system is also designed around this persistent world, because we don't have a thing that forces you out in the game world. But over the course of a session, depending on what activities you engage in, your heat builds up and that creates more resistance in the world against you. But it also unlocks different kinds of PvP missions, so you could assassinate a captain from one of the other factions and that faction could put a bounty mission on you. So other players could take that mission from the Obsidian Syndicate to come assassinate you, or if it gets far enough, they could even take one to go raid your base and destroy things in your base. You have to pay attention to it because you're generating heat. This rewards stealthy gameplay, being more strategic, not just running, gunning, and killing every single thing.</p>



<p><strong>Do you envision players being able to push their faction to be stronger than the others?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>Matthew Higby:</strong></span> Yeah, I mean, you don't really align directly with a faction, but you could decide, for this season or for the entire career, I'm only going to do missions for these guys, and certainly if you're helping them complete more of their objectives... The way I'm thinking about it right now is that basically each season, here's what this faction is up to this season, and here's what they want. They operate in a needs-based way and seasonally, what we could do is the most successful one last season could be getting additional rewards for the next season. So if you really engage and earn a lot of loyalty and reputation with that action, you would get some additional rewards for having helped the winning faction the most out of all the factions. But it would be up to you if you want to engage in that. We want you to be a mercenary, gun for hire, taking whatever mission for whomever at any given time.</p>



<p><strong>Given your background, are you going to add some clan-based systems to Reaper Actual?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>Matthew Higby:</strong></span> When I think about describing the game, there's three major efforts that we're making. We have this whole moment-to-moment gameplay, getting all the FPS gameplay and vehicles up to a level of quality that feels comparable with these other humongous, triple-A games. There's the whole management of the persistent world, including how NPCs spawn, how loot spawns, et cetera. Then we have the outer Morova layer, which consists of outfits (clans), player-to-player trade, crafting, economy, progression, and bases. And that's very MMO-inspired, with a crafting system that should feel more like something from an EVE game, when it comes to the depth and complexity of something. Even the outfit system will be a lot more in-depth than a regular clan system in a shooter. That's the MMO, long-engagement system layer of the game.</p>



<p>So, these three major design and development efforts are ongoing. The third one is the least apparent when we are doing a demo like this. Vehicles are halfway between moment-to-moment and the persistent world. I guess vehicles go through all of it because you have vehicles in your base, too. You can customize your base to be really awesome at repairing and modifying vehicles, but you would basically be choosing to specialize your base that way instead of specializing it as a medical facility, as a weapon crafting station, or a highly defensible vault. You could have up to five bases, so you can customize several of them in different ways, depending on exactly what you want to try to produce or optimize for as a player. For instance, you could get a warehouse base and put a Medivac on it, and that Medivac can kind of extract you and heal you.</p>

For instance, you could get a warehouse base and put a Medivac on it, and that Medivac can kind of extract you and heal you.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Will there be any clan bases at some point in Reaper Actual?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>Matthew Higby:</strong></span> Yes, outfit bases are definitely in the plan. We already have some very large mansion-style bases, even penthouse apartment-style bases, that would fit really well for clans. The plan is to have a permission system to decide which people can access the stations. And I guess also VoIP, which is expected nowadays.</p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> What's funny is that we also have Discord integration. Players can link their Discords, and if you run a Discord server, you can make that a channel where you can communicate directly. So, text chat is from Discord, and so is our VoIP. We're one of the earliest companies integrating that. By the way, we don't have the train system yet, but this will be one of the ways you can extract back to your base.</p>



<p><span><strong>Matthew Higby:</strong></span> The idea eventually is that this would be a real train that's moving around. We have all of these different solutions that we need to apply to the persistent world, to make it make sense, and having this kind of universal deploy and extract, it's a mechanism that everybody can have access to. If I want to extract with the helicopter, I actually have to customize my base and invest in a helicopter, but being able to deploy pretty much anywhere on the island using the metro station is something that people get by default.</p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> Some bases have garages, so the warehouse space comes with the garage. If you find a vehicle, you can stash it because vehicles are rare, and they're meant to be rare in our game. Eventually, you'll start seeing more and more, because in theory, everybody could get a vehicle in a base and a warehouse base. In practice, that won't actually happen.</p>



<p><strong>Is Reaper Actual going to go into early access eventually?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> Yes, early next year, we will launch the game into early access.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have an idea of how long it will stay in early access before 1.0?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> I don't. We're a small company. We raised 32 and a half million. You see the quality we're able to deliver, we're trying to compete with Call of Duty and these bigger games. We have 125 people on the team. Over time, we are adding more and more features, but what we want is to make our early access release fully featured, and then we're just going to keep adding to it like any good MMO would and make it much bigger over time. I think this game is gonna appeal the most to people who like extraction shooters, second to the MMO crowd, and I think there's a good overlap based on the data I've seen. A lot of people have played MMOs now, so we'll see how the target demographic ends up being.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>We've made it entirely optional. On Steam, though, we will have the Steam Community Market, which you may be familiar with, where you sell Counter-Strike stuff. We will activate that, and we treat Web3 very similarly to the Steam Community Market, where if players want to participate, they can; if they don't, just play Steam or Epic and not touch any of it. So the fact that it's optional gives us a game that anybody can feel good about playing if you're into the Web3 aspects, it lets you sell things directly to other players. But there's a key reason we're doing that. We're also using it to power the UGC (user-generated content) marketplace. We're going to let players make gun skins, Reaper skins, and let them do cool stuff like rent a server from us, and that's on Web2 as well. They can rent a server at launch, and after launch, we're going to have moddable servers so that if people wanted to make a Battle Royale game on our island, great, they could do it.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The early access version of Reaper Actual will be on both Epic Games Store and Steam, right?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> Yes, although our Foundation Alpha will only be on Epic. As you are probably aware, we have an entirely optional Web3 component. Our Foundation Alpha version will be on Epic and also on our own website. I want to make sure that I'm clear about this: there will be no way to cross stuff over from Steam to Web3 or vice versa, so there's no sneaky stuff going on. When we say it's optional, we mean it. We understand a lot of people don't like Web3 stuff. We get it.</p>



<p><strong>Yeah, that was going to be one of my questions. When some gamers just hear about Web3, they wiggle their noses since they dislike the concept. What's your explanation for adopting it?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> We've made it entirely optional. On Steam, though, we will have the Steam Community Market, which you may be familiar with, where you sell Counter-Strike stuff. We will activate that, and we treat Web3 very similarly to the Steam Community Market, where if players want to participate, they can; if they don't, just play Steam or Epic and not touch any of it. So the fact that it's optional gives us a game that anybody can feel good about playing. If you're into the Web3 aspects, it lets you sell things directly to other players.</p>



<p>But there's a key reason we're doing that. We're also using it to power the UGC (user-generated content) marketplace. We're going to let players make gun skins, Reaper skins, and let them do cool stuff like rent a server from us, and that's on Web2 as well. They can rent a server at launch, and after launch, we're going to have moddable servers so that if people wanted to make a Battle Royale game on our island, great, they could do it.</p>



<p><strong>Matthew Higby:</strong>&nbsp;I think the key thing, too, when we say that it's optional, it's that you can use the exact same functionality. It's not that this feature only exists over here. It's just if you want it to be Web3 activated, and you want to put things on blockchain, it's in that version. If you want to just trade things back and forth between the players, you can totally do that, too, in the Steam Community Market.</p>



<p><strong>I guess Web3 players will get to sell their stuff, right?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> Correct, but so Steam players can sell them on the Community Market if they want to.</p>



<p><strong>Aside from that, is there going to be an in-game market in Reaper Actual?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> Yes.<a href=""></a></p>



<p><strong>And is that a central auction house?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> Yeah. But the two versions don't cross. You cannot trade items between a Steam account and a Web3 account; that's completely blocked. They do play together, but there's no trading of items between the two versions. There's an in-game marketplace, but on Steam, you can also sell stuff on the Steam Community Market, which, let's not call it real money because it really isn't, but we're all aware of the fact that you can sell Counter-Strike 2 stuff, for instance, on gray market sites. There's nothing we can do about that, but we're focused on letting functionality work for people who want to sell stuff. If people want to sell their in-game stuff and then reuse that credit to buy other Steam games, they can. We all do that, at least most people I know do that. In the Epic version, there'll be none of that whatsoever. I think the way we're doing it, where we're not selling power in any way, kind of takes away the negative argument, but I realize some players are not convinced. They're making Web3 into a worse monster than it actually is to some people. They've seen so many bad Web3 games and scams that they think every game's like that. We're not doing anything like that. We're doing it very ethically.</p>



<p><strong>Matthew Higby:</strong> We've been obsessing about how we can have any of our NFT or crypto assets actually be utility-based as opposed to just being speculative value. That's one of the problems with many of these NFT games: people don't play for any reason except for the trade and making money off their NFT. We're like, how can we actually use this technology, which is actually interesting, to bring new utility value to players in the game?</p>



<p>An example of this is that warehouse base that you customize to be like a Medivac station. It could have taken hundreds of hours of progression to be able to level up the various crafting stations and other hard points in the base. If you want to, you can just package up that whole base as one piece, along with all the progression, all the components that you've got in it and sell it as an asset, using an NFT, and that's something kind of cool and neat that some progress that you've made, some customization that you've made, is unique to you and you can decide to transfer that whole thing between players. That's very different than just, I bought this because it's gonna be worth more money tomorrow. It's interesting because it contains a lot of value in terms of utility in what you do with the game.</p>

<p><strong>I guess people have been selling and buying MMO accounts for a long time.</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> I wish more people understood that. You're right, it's been there for as long as MMOs have existed. We've been there as long as MMOs have existed, with EverQuest. If people just look around them, you can sell Counter-Strike 2 knives, right now, for crypto, on a gray market site. It's been there for five years. We feel like we're doing it the right way. We're making them optional, but at some point, people have to make up their own minds. I respect people's opinions on this. I just happen to think that if they thought a little bit about it... Most people don't know that you can sell a Counter-Strike 2 knife; they're unaware of that fact. This stuff's been out there for a long time.</p>



<p><strong>Do you eventually plan to launch Reaper Actual on consoles?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> We do, but it's gonna take, you know, a year, maybe a year and a half before we're ready to get there and we have to have a good player rights. We're a small company, and the funding that we've raised is more than enough to launch the PC version, but not enough to build the console version just yet. So we're going to use the revenue, we're going to reinvest in the game, we're going to keep reinvesting to make this thing better for players.</p>



<p><strong>Would it be a big unified community with cross-play?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> Everything is crossplay these days. It's way more fun. One nice thing about our game is that, unlike traditional round-based games - are you aware of the term matchmaking liquidity? What it means is, you ever play a dead game, and it's hard to get a match? That's matchmaking liquidity. What's great about our game is that these are persistent servers and we keep them full. So, when you log in, there's still persistence everywhere, and all the things that you have are persistent. We don't worry about trying to matchmake people into these 40-minute matches, so if somebody kills you in the overworld and you go back to your base, you can go hunt that person down.</p>



<p>We've even got this insurance feature, these trackers. They're kind of like AirTags, and if you have a tag attached to some super gun that you've worked on for a while with a bunch of attachments on it, you can actually track down the person's base and get it back. We've got interesting features that tie into the persistence you just don't get elsewhere. If somebody kills you in Escape from Tarkov, you can't get them back unless you're lucky enough to be in another lobby with them. Here, just walk back outside, go back to where they were, and take your revenge.</p>

<p><strong>Since you mentioned that consoles are in the plan...</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> Down the line, I want it to be clear.</p>



<p><strong>Gotcha. But will there be gamepad support for the PC version at the early access launch?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> Absolutely. 40% of players play with game pads on PC. The support is technically in there, but it's not finished.</p>



<p><strong>Matthew Higby:</strong> We need to do a bunch of user interface updates to make it more gamepad-friendly.</p>



<p><strong>Is Reaper Actual adopting a free-to-play business model?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> It will be buy-to-play at first, but then we will go free-to-play when we do our 1.0 launch.</p>



<p><strong>Do you know the price yet?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> Well, for early access, we're going to have three levels of being able to get in: $30, $50, and $75. Why aren't we going free to play at lunch? I mentioned we're a small company. In order to build a better and better game, we need people and resources. This gives us the opportunity to get people to buy. We will notify people well in advance of when it's going free-to-play, so nobody feels like they got screwed, and they're also getting exclusive items. That's an important part of the way we're approaching our Foundation Alpha release on September 22. It's a really early version of the game. What we're trying to do there. We're only going to sell a limited number of copies because what we want is a playtest community that's a decent size that can play all The Time with us directly. They'll have unique access to us. We'll be on Discord with them. </p>



<p><strong>Do you think there might be some open public testing between this Foundation Alpha and the early access release?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>John Smedley:</strong></span> There will be periods where we'll open it up to everybody. We're going to be doing that slowly as we see how the game quality is and whether it's fun. Do we have bugs? Did we think something would work and it didn't? Before we go to the masses, that's why it's going to be very exclusive. </p>



<p><strong>Matthew Higby:</strong> While working on PlanetSide 2, we found out quickly that with these games, you can play test them all you want with the development team, and that helps a lot for things like, does the guns feel good, does the time to kill feel good. You can dial in a lot of that stuff, but how does the game feel when people are playing it for real over the course of several hours? In PlanetSide 2, we had no idea how to make bases work properly until Beta, when we actually had hundreds of people trying to jump over the walls of bases. They were doing things we would have never predicted. That is why we must get in touch with them early so we can start adjusting before we get completely invested in any of the solutions we've thought of.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/directive-8020-gamescom-hands-on-previews-a-new-page-in-the-anthology/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/until-dawn/">Until Dawn</a> back in 2015, Supermassive Games proved that horror games can work well even with a narrative focus lacking many of the mechanics fans have come to associate with the genre following the launch of the Resident Evil series. This narrative focus has continued to be predominant in every other horror game developed by the studio, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-quarry-supermassive-big-screen/">The Quarry</a>, the Dead by Daylight spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-casting-of-frank-stone-death-is-not-the-end/">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-dark-pictures-anthology/">The Dark Pictures Anthology</a> series, which has quickly become the studio's most popular franchise. In 2026, four years after the launch of The Devil in Me, the series is set to continue with Directive 8020, which will be, by all accounts, one of the most important entries in the franchise, as it will enrich the studio's typical narrative focus with new gameplay elements that edge closer to those a traditional survival horror game usually offers.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a> last month, I had the chance to try out the first 30 minutes or so of the full game, accompanying Carter and Simms across the colony ship Cassiopeia as they attempt to fix a hull breach. However, what begins as a regular routine fix quickly turns into a nightmare, as the two characters meet a dangerous shapeshifting alien from which they need to get away. With a beautifully haunting atmosphere at times reminiscent of the Alien franchise, navigating the dimly lit corridors of the spaceship was a spooky experience with a mounting tension that resolved, in my playthrough, with a terrible outcome: I couldn't prevent Carter from dying.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Directive 8020 will mark a new beginning for The Dark Pictures Anthology series.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the overview above may sound very familiar to any fan of The Dark Pictures Anthology, Directive 8020 feels quite different from previous entries in the series thanks to some new mechanics. The most important addition to the experience is Real Time Threats, which players must deal with in a limited time by staying hidden from any dangerous presence, using the appropriate tools when needed, and completing Quick Time Events. Making decisions will continue to play a big role in the experience, as what players decide will go on to influence the Destiny of any given character. Each character will have two, and which they will fall into depends on how the choices made during the game will shape up characters' traits, leading to different outcomes at certain points in the story. Experimenting with different outcomes with be easier than ever before with the Turning Points system, which will allow players to revisit decisions and delve depeer into the story without having to complete multiple playthroughs.</p>



<p>With a very different setting than usual, a high-profile cast for the main characters and more involving gameplay, Directive 8020 is set to mark a new beginning for The Dark Pictures Anthology, moving the franchise closer to survival horror without doing away with the narrative focus that's become the trademark for Supermassive Games. To see if this new approach will work as well as it did in the game's first few minutes, fans of the series will have to wait until<a href="https://wccftech.com/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed-2026/"> next year</a> when the game launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

                <p>There's no denying that the hype train for Hollow Knight: Silksong is unlike anything we've ever seen for an indie game. In the days leading up to its release, multiple other small studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/">delayed their games to stay out of Silksong's way</a>, something generally reserved to make space for the Grand Theft Autos of the gaming world. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/">sequel's release led to Steam and the Nintendo eShop crashing</a> (the lack of preorders played a role here, of course) and saw the metroidvania game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-had-a-massive-steam-player-count-over-its-first-weekend/1100-6534537/">top out at 587,000 concurrent players on Valve's platform alone</a>. The game also released on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and Switch 2, plus <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-on-xbox-game-pass/1100-6534209/">it's available on Game Pass</a>. With that in mind, the total player numbers for Silksong are huge, showcasing that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1kgtnrh/here_are_some_epic_wholesome_100_memes_that_only/" rel="nofollow ">the online memes</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-again-missing-from-nintendo-direct/1100-6533604/">anticipation for the game to show up at events </a>were true indicators of sales success.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this said, it's begun to feel unlikely that Silksong's launch will ever be matched by another indie game. But as Yoda said: There is another.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">One indie game that could take the entire gaming world by storm is Haunted Chocolatier, the follow-up to Stardew Valley. Sure, it's not a direct sequel to the perennially popular farming simulator (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2/1100-6531402/">that could be in the cards eventually</a>, though). However, Haunted Chocolatier shares a similar visual presentation and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/haunted-chocolatier-will-feature-a-world-larger-than-stardew-valley/1100-6532350/">will offer a larger world than Stardew Valley</a>, according to creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. The RPG will see people living in a haunted castle and making chocolate, which requires gathering ingredients. It's <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/faq/" rel="nofollow ">a "town game" like Stardew Valley, per Barone</a>, though Haunted Chocolatier will lean more into the action-RPG genre. Oh, and it may just be set in the same world as Stardew Valley.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-announces-new-game-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6497292/">Haunted Chocolatier was announced</a> in late 2021, so the wait has already been years long at this point--similar to Silksong. Barone has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-wants-to-focus-on-mystery-whimsy-in-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6531252/">the game will focus on mystery and whimsy</a>, adding to the allure for an audience that loves discovering secrets on their own and through online communities. But the most obvious reason Haunted Chocolatier will be a huge event when it launches is found simply by glancing at Stardew Valley's concurrent players <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/413150/charts/" rel="nofollow ">on SteamDB</a>. The farming simulator has averaged 100,000 players over the past month and, despite releasing back in 2016, peaked with <a href="http://google.com/url?q=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-hits-new-peak-concurrents-record-on-steam-thanks-to-update-1-6/1100-6521971/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1757103179812607&amp;usg=AOvVaw0LB0xGkkDRpDlhWgWBfUTo">over 235,000 people playing at the same time</a> just last year.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4563777-13_1247.png" data-ref-id="1300-4563777" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4563777-13_1247.png" data-ref-id="1300-4563777"></a><figcaption>A screenshot from ConcernedApe's Haunted Chocolatier</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4563777-13_1247.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">When comparing the two, it quickly becomes evident that Hollow Knight doesn't swim in the same waters for Steam concurrent players as Stardew Valley. Not only does Stardew Valley have a lot of players, it has a lot of <em>engaged </em>players--ones that keep coming back to the game and help it maintain its extreme popularity. It's possibly an unfair comparison, as the former is strictly solo while the latter has co-op multiplayer. But it's also possible that Stardew Valley simply has a bigger fanbase, which could catapult Haunted Chocolatier to even greater heights than what we just witnessed with Silksong.</p><p dir="ltr">There's one other point to consider as well: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-has-a-new-best-rated-game-of-all-time/1100-6533053/">Stardew Valley is the best-rated game of all time on Steam</a>.Sure, platform availability could minimize its full impact, but Haunted Chocolatier is still primed for a monstrous debut. And if it follows suit with Stardew Valley, it could very easily start on PC before eventually coming to almost every platform, including mobile devices. Oh, and as for industry impact, it's worth bringing up that Devolver Digital co-founder Nigel Lowrie has already <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-this-years-gta-6-and-whether-a-juggernaut-stomping-on-your-release-date-really-matters" rel="nofollow ">told IGN</a> that he monitors Haunted Chocolatier in case they need to alter release plans around it.</p><p dir="ltr">However, there's also an argument that the next Silksong can't be predicted. No one ever expected Hollow Knight to be a phenomenon--just check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/on-silksong-eve-this-decade-old-hollow-knight-reddit-post-is-incredible-in-hindsight/1100-6534463/">this decade-old Reddit post about the game</a> for confirmation. Additionally, some of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-20-most-popular-steam-games-of-all-time/2900-6301/#20">the most popular Steam games of all time</a> seemingly landed out of nowhere. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-massive-new-player-milestone-year-2-promised-to-be-even-better/1100-6529574/">Palworld has seen over 32 million players</a> since coming out in early 2024, a mind-boggling number. Were you aware that there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-massive-and-inexplicably-popular-banana-game-adds-new-skins/1100-6524446/">a game called Banana on Steam</a> that sees about 100,000 players daily? Sure, it being free-to-play certainly balloons those numbers, but not many people would expect a game about clicking on a piece of fruit to create that sort of long-term engagement. The chance to collect a rare banana and possibly sell it for actual money clearly has its attraction.</p><p dir="ltr">Another recent example of this phenomenon is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aptly-named-co-op-climbing-game-peak-continues-to-scale-past-higher-and-higher-all-time-peak-player-counts/1100-6533021/">Peak, a co-op climbing game</a> that sees players working together to ascend a mountain. Fascinatingly enough, it's the opposite of Haunted Chocolatier and Silksong from a developmental perspective. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-developers-of-peak-primarily-made-the-game-out-of-jealousy/1100-6532754/">Peak came together during a month-long game jam</a>, though co-developer Aggro Crab had previously pitched the concept.</p><p dir="ltr">The only thing that seems certain is that the indie space will continue to surprise us with unique experiences that might take years to land in our hands, or possibly appear <em>almost</em> magically out of thin air. Maybe Silksong is a unique moment, something that can't be replicated. Or maybe it's another landmark event that will be surpassed eventually, but not forgotten by those who experienced it.</p>

Last week, a Washington District Court judge <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26086297-nintendo-v-modded-hardware/">ordered Ryan Daley</a> to pay Nintendo $2 million and stop selling modded Switch consoles online, as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-wins-a-2-million-lawsuit-against-popular-switch-modding-webstore-174528989.html">reported earlier by <em>Engadget</em></a>.</p><p>In a copyright lawsuit filed last year, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/modded-hardware-defendant-denies-nintendos-copyright-claims-in-court-241006/">Nintendo accused</a> Daley of operating the website Modded Hardware, which sold modded Switch consoles, modchips used to hack into Switch devices, and Mig flash cartridges that allow people to play pirated copies of games.</p><p>Nintendo claimed Daley caused the company “significant and irreparable harm” — and the judge agreed. “The MIG Devices, Mod Chips, Hacked Consoles, and Circumvention Services allow members of the public to create, distribute, and play pirated Nintendo games on a massive scale,” the ruling states. Daley denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>Piracy lawsuits from Nintendo have become increasingly common, with the company winning its case <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/624618/nintendo-piracy-lawsuit-1fichier">against a file-sharing site</a> accused of hosting pirated games earlier this year. Nintendo’s legal actions have led to the shutdown of Switch emulators, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24098640/nintendo-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-switch-aftermath">including Yuzu</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github">Ryujinx</a>. The company has also made it clear that it may <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/665765/nintendo-privacy-policy-update-switch-2">brick Switch 2 consoles</a> if players try to mod the device.</p><p>Daley, who chose to fight Nintendo without a lawyer, is now banned from modding Switch consoles, as well as from using devices designed to circumvent the console’s security measures. The judge also ordered the seizure, impoundment, or destruction of all devices owned by Daley that may contain copyright-infringing material.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/774077/nintendo-switch-modder-ryan-daley-lawsuit#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/774077/nintendo-switch-modder-ryan-daley-lawsuit]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-split-screen-coop-switch-2-amon-skill-tree-2000618064"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is almost here. The next installment in Gearbox and 2K’s fan-favorite co-op looter shooter series is launching on September 12 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. (The Switch 2 port arrives next month.) Ahead of its launch, we’ve compiled a list of useful information about <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pax-west-rage-room-gearbox-2000621767"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> to help quickly answer your questions ahead of its release. Does it support cross-save? When will it be playable? Do I need to beat the other games? All that and more is answered below!</p> <h2><strong>When does <em>Borderlands 4</em> launch?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><em>Borderlands 4</em> launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 12. Sort of. It depends on where you live and what platform you are planning to play the looter shooter on. Here’s the full breakdown courtesy of <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/global-launch-times/">2K Games and Gearbox</a>.</p> <blockquote><p><em><strong>Xbox and PlayStation launch times</strong></em></p></blockquote> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>Wellington, New Zealand – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM NZST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Sydney, Australia – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM AEST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Tokyo, Japan – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM JST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Singapore – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM SGT</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>London, UK – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM BST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>New York, NY, USA – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM ET</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>San Francisco, CA, USA – Sept 11 at 9:00 PM PT</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>Meanwhile, on Steam and Epic’s PC store, you’ll be able to play earlier than on consoles. Here are those dates and times:</p> <blockquote><p><strong><em>Steam &amp; Epic Store launch times</em></strong></p></blockquote> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>Wellington, New Zealand – Sept 12 at 4:00 AM NZST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Sydney, Australia – Sept 12 at 2:00 AM AEST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Tokyo, Japan – Sept 12 at 1:00 AM JST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Singapore – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM SGT</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>London, UK – Sept 11 at 5:00 PM BST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>New York, NY, USA – Sept 11 at 12:00 PM ET</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>San Francisco, CA, USA – Sept 11 at 9:00 AM PT</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <h2><strong>Wait, isn’t this coming out on Switch 2?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Yes!<em> Borderlands 4</em> is coming to Switch 2, but not until next month. Gearbox and 2K are bringing the looter shooter to Nintendo’s new console on October 3.</p>

 <blockquote><p><em><strong>Switch 2 launch times</strong></em></p></blockquote> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>Wellington, New Zealand – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM NZST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Sydney, Australia – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM AEST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Tokyo, Japan – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM JST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Singapore – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM SGT</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>London, UK – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM BST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>New York, NY, USA – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM ET</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>San Francisco, CA, USA – Oct 2 at 9:00 PM PT</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <h2><strong>What versions of <em>Borderlands 4</em> are available to buy?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/buy/">The are three versions of <em>Borderlands 4</em> being sold by 2K</a>. The standard edition is $70 and comes with the game and…that’s it.</p> <p>Then there’s the Deluxe Edition, which costs $100 and comes with the Bounty Pack bundle and Firehawk’s Fury Weapon Skin bundle. (The Bounty Pack includes a few smaller narrative DLC missions that will be added post-launch via various updates.)</p> <p>Finally, the $130 Super Deluxe Edition comes with everything previously mentioned, and grants access to new upcoming expansions, two new Vault Hunters, and a new cosmetic bundle.</p>

 <p>Regardless of which version you buy, if you pre-order before <em>Borderlands 4</em> launches on your platform,<a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/global-launch-times/#:~:text=For%20a%20quick,Daedalus%20Assault%20Rifle"> you’ll <em>also</em> get a bonus “Gilded Glory” pack</a> that includes:</p> <ul> <li>1 Vault Hunter Head usable by all Vault Hunters</li> <li>1 Vault Hunter Skin usable by all Vault Hunters</li> <li>1 Weapon Skin</li> <li>1 ECHO-4 Drone Skin</li> <li>4 pieces of Legendary Gear:</li> <li>1 Lvl 1 Legendary Maliwan SMG</li> <li>1 Lvl 30 Legendary Ripper Grenade</li> <li>1 Lvl 30 Legendary Torgue Ordnance</li> <li>1 Max Lvl Legendary Daedalus Assault Rifle</li> </ul> <h2><strong>Does <em>Borderlands 4</em> support crossplay and cross-save?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Yes and no.<em> Borderlands 4</em> on all platforms will support crossplay at launch. So if you are on PC and your friend is on Xbox, you can play together easily, assuming you both have free Gearbox Shift accounts.</p> <p>Sadly, neither cross-save nor cross-progression will be available on day one. But, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/543366456574738739">Gearbox has confirmed in a Steam post</a> that it is looking to add the features later, letting players hop from one console to another and keep all their progress. Just don’t expect that on September 12.</p>

 <h2><strong>Is there a day-one patch?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Yes! Gearbox CEO and co-founder Randy Pitchford has confirmed that, like most big AAA video games these days, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1964424122861064640"><em>Borderlands 4</em> will have a day-one patch.</a> According to Pitchford, the update should help improve the game’s performance on PC, but did warn that <em>Borderlands 4</em> is a big open-world game that might not run well on older hardware even after the update.</p> <h2><strong>What are <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s recommended and minimum PC specs?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <div data-os="win"> <div> <p><strong>Minimum:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <ul> <li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li> <li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10 / Windows 11</li> <li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</li> <li><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</li> <li><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / Intel Arc A580</li> <li><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;100 GB available space</li> <li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong>&nbsp;Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system.

Meanwhile, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-will-run-mostly-30-fps/"><em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2 seems to be targeting 30FPS,</a> which isn’t surprising.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Target 60fps.</p> <p>Also, F’ balance. Make a sick build with some god drop loot and melt bosses.

But you don’t have to. <em>Borderlands 4 </em>is set on a new planet, featuring new characters, and is a more self-contained story than the last few games. Sure, super fans will pick up on clues to the larger universe and past titles, but don’t feel like you need to play everything before starting up <em>Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2><strong>Should I watch the movie?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-review-rotten-tomatoes-cast-release-1851616912">lol. Don’t do that. Come on now. Be kind to yourself.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a teenager I raided my older brother’s CD collection. When he found me out, I was terrified he’d be angry, but instead he handed me a stack of records. He noticed I was checking out Nine Inch Nails, and told me I could have his albums. As a moody teenager, I couldn’t have received a better gift—a musical refuge from the stress of school and my burgeoning issues with depression. Watching the recent remaster of the movie <em>Linda Linda Linda</em> this weekend brought me back to that experience of my teenage years, when music could really save your life.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="LINDA LINDA LINDA 4K Restoration | Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YIIkWjdiF0U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Linda Linda Linda</em> is about four Japanese girls putting a band together to play at their school’s festival. After deciding to cover a bunch of songs by the legendary Japanese punk band The Blue Hearts, they select their vocalist at random. It turns out Son, played by the wonderful Bae Doona in an early role, is a Korean exchange student who barely speaks Japanese. That’s just the most visible piece of drama going on within the band: Kyoko, the drummer, has a crush on her classmate and isn’t courageous enough to tell him; bass player Nozomi, part of the real life band Base Ball Bear, keeps falling asleep in school because of their late night practice sessions; Kei has been fighting with her friend Rinko and they both refuse to make up with each other.</p><p>None of these conflicts are the main thrust of the film, which is mostly concerned with whether or not the girls will be ready to perform in three days. The scenes flow along lazily, like the last couple days of school before summer as we get brief glimpses into the lives of the band members. The one thing that aligns this group of misfits is the music they’re making together—especially for Son, who doesn’t have any other friends. As they sing “Linda Linda” by The Blue Hearts over and over, the lyrics from the intro of the song take on new meaning: “like a rat, I want to be beautiful, because there’s a kind of beauty that can’t be photographed.”</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://gkids.com/films/linda-linda-linda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GKids</a></figcaption></figure><p>Watching this movie made me feel an intense but pleasant nostalgia, emphasized by the guitar-based score for the movie, composed by The Smashing Pumpkins’ James Iha. It brought me back to a time when the most important thing in my life was whether or not my friends were mad at me, and sneaking into my brother’s room to steal his CDs. Music, and the friendships I’ve made through music, is all of that version of my life that remains.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Linda Linda Linda</em> opens with students from the high school making a documentary about their festival. “Don’t let anyone tell you that when you grow up, you stop being kids,” one of the students says into the camera. “We’ve only got a little more time to be the real us.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-silksong-launch-gta-vi-elden-ring"><h3>All-Consuming Event Releases Like Silksong Are Growing Fewer And Further Between</h3></a><p>"Silksong and then GTA VI coming up are the two big launches that almost feel like the end of the big launch"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-7-civ-vii-layoffs-firaxis-2k-take-two"><h3>Seven Months After Civ VII’s Launch, Firaxis Workers Are Being Laid Off</h3></a><p>2K said the layoffs were part of an effort to increase "adaptability, collaboration, and creativity" at Firaxis, whatever that means</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/play-for-peace-bundle-palestine-aid-fundraiser"><h3>10 Months In The Making, Play For Peace Bundle Launches To Raise Money for Palestinian Aid</h3></a><p>‘It was important that our charity's proceeds directly went to Palestinian relief efforts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/oxo-rapid-brewer-coffee-espresso-soup-shots"><h3>The OXO Rapid Brewer Is Great For Coffee And Better For ‘Soup’</h3></a><p>The OXO Brew Rapid Brewer is a fantastic portable coffee brewer.

                <p>Nintendo's star heroine wasn't always named Princess Peach, and for many years prior to the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-64/" data-ref-id="5000-2007">Super Mario 64</a> went by a different name: Princess Toadstool. Now, fans know the reason why, and it wasn't because of any decision Nintendo made.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>, Nintendo veteran Leslie Swan, who over the course of her nearly three-decade career helped localize countless Nintendo classics, wrote for Nintendo Power magazine, and even voiced Princess Peach in Super Mario 64, spilled the beans on the unlikely origin of the Toadstool moniker. She said in Nintendo's early days, there wasn't a lot of communication between the development teams in Japan and those working on marketing in the US.</p><p dir="ltr">"So on Super Mario Bros. they [Nintendo] had outsourced the production of the manual to an ad agency," Swan said. "And the ad agency just kind of created names for things. And so they're the ones who came up with Princess Toadstool as the name for Peach."</p><p dir="ltr">After the ad agency's decision, the name stuck for the next decade. Swan said when localizing Super Mario 64 for North America alongside Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, Miyamoto was fond of the "Peach" name and wanted it included.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4563743-mario64princesspeachletter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4563743" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4563743-mario64princesspeachletter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4563743"></a><figcaption>Princess Peach's letter to Mario in Super Mario 64.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4563743-mario64princesspeachletter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Swan suggested combining the two names together for the US release. Peach could be Princess Toadstool's more "informal" name, Swan said. It's for that reason Peach's letter to Mario at the beginning of Super Mario 64 is signed Princess Toadstool, with "Peach" handwritten in pink.</p><p dir="ltr">The full interview includes tons more details about Swan's career and is well worth a read. Meanwhile, Princess Peach has come into her own in recent years, stepping out of Mario's shadow. Far from a damsel in distress, she proved to be a major force in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-bros-movie-was-the-most-profitable-film-of-2023/1100-6523224/" data-ref-id="1100-6523224">Super Mario. Bros movie</a> and even received her own game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/princess-peach-showtime/" data-ref-id="5000-591679">Princess Peach: Showtime</a>, in 2024, the first game to star her as the main protagonist since 2006's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-princess-peach/" data-ref-id="5000-22936">Super Princess Peach</a> for Nintendo DS.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Peach is making a name for herself, her relationship with Mario is more complicated than ever, with Nintendo recently going out of its way to remind fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-really-wants-you-to-know-mario-and-peach-are-just-good-friends/1100-6533462/" data-ref-id="1100-6533462">Mario and Princess Peach are just "good friends."</a></p>

		<p>Cosmoscouts and Indie.io have announced that the sci-fi FPS Moon Mystery is coming to consoles nearly a year after it released for PC. Publisher indie.io has stated that Moon Mystery will be available from September 18th on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with the game being priced at $19.99. It is available to pre-order on the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/moon-mystery/9pjlncrlb5md?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9RGF96TX3QgOR86Ssu2NQTh5sMunwkVmpezqfDQkN6WAjniHFgH3Jtml8MLlhgFyPf3aEYuzAL-j0zIsBXz7873fcr2w&amp;_hsmi=379566986&amp;utm_content=379566986&amp;utm_source=hs_email">Microsoft store now</a>, and available to wishlist on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10015507">PlayStation Store</a>.</p>

<p>In Moon Mystery you play as Sam, an astrobiologist who is alone on the Moon aside from AI assistant TOBY. Sam becomes stranded on the Moon after all contact with Earth is lost, prompting him to find out the cause of the issue. It soon turns out that Sam is not alone on the lunar surface, so needs to run, gun, explore, and use his head to solve puzzles to get out of this predicament. The Moon is not the only location that Sam will end up exploring, as he travels to alien planets and an orbital city.</p>
<p>We did not review Moon Mystery, but the game is currently sitting on mixed reviews on Steam, though recent user reviews are a bit more positive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-is-fine-but-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-is-one-1839230688"><em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em></a> was sneakily one of the best RPGs of 2016. Almost a decade later, its long-awaited successor is mounting another lowkey coup in a genre that’s only gotten more competitive in the years since. <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> plays like a very traditional turn-based role-playing game in all of my favorite ways while bringing multiple generational leaps’ worth of technical upgrades to a spin-off series whose last entries were built for PS Vita. It feels like the <em>Persona</em>-style glow-up many <em>Pokémon</em> fans have been waiting for.</p> <p>At PAX West last week I had the chance to play over 90 minutes of <em>Digimon Story: Time</em> <em>Stranger</em>, which comes to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 3, and the latest Bandai Namco-published creature fighter from veteran RPG maker Media Vision did not disappoint. Things already seemed good coming out of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677">Summer Game Fest demo</a> earlier this summer and a deeper dive only firmed up the sense that the game, first announced eight years ago, can meet the increasing expectations surrounding <em>Digimon Story</em>‘s return.</p> <p>The latest session let me play the start of the game before later shifting to a much more advanced segment over a dozen hours into the adventure. You play as a secret agent working for the ADAMAS organization investigating ominous anomalies in Tokyo that seem to be linked to social upheaval. The <em>Digimon Story</em> games have always had an emphasis on compelling conversations and background intrigue, which <em>Cyber Sleuth</em> took to the next level with a narrative that felt like more than just a means to an end of raising virtual pets.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624121" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624121"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624121">Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>What I played of <em>Time Stranger</em> continues that with English voice acting and more polished cinematic animations, coupled with an unusually stellar soundtrack. Are there extremely goofy moments too? Absolutely. I’ve already witnessed half a dozen snippets that I can’t wait to send to folks in the group chat who have not interacted with <em>Digimon</em> since it debuted in the West on Fox Kids back in 1999. Watching familiar RPG tropes reenacted by absurd-looking creatures that speak like humans is an acquired taste, but <em>Time Stranger</em> does an admirable job.</p> <p>Eerie anime vibes established, my early tutorial section eventually transitioned to a later stretch set in the Digimon world’s colorful seaside Abyss Area which felt oddly reminiscent of<em> Chrono Cross</em>‘ tropical archipelago. Here, <em>Time Stranger</em>‘s bread and butter took center stage: fighting, collecting, and growing your Digimon. There’s the combat triangle between Data, Virus, and Vaccine type Digimon, elemental weaknesses, and a swapping system that lets you use different Digimon on the fly if your current team doesn’t have the right build.</p>

 <p>Building meter during battle also lets you unleash an ultimate attack to deal extra damage or buff your team. It’s a nimble set of mechanics that helps turn-based battles shine, forcing you to think about what you’re doing and adapt on the fly without getting bogged down in too much minutiae. It’s definitely old-school but more satisfying than just mashing the same set of attacks over and over again. If things do start to get repetitive, a fast-forward button helps bypass the boring bits. Defeat a Digimon enough times and you get a 100 percent scan rate to create your own, or you can wait for a 200 percent scan rate to get an even stronger version of it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000624122" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624122"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624122">Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>Outside of combat, the main focus remains on Digivolving and De-Digivolving your pals. The first makes them more powerful while the second makes them weaker again in the short term to raise their long-term potential. Aiding this convoluted process is the DigiFarm system which lets you tweak the new personalities of your Digimon to change which stats grow the fastest. Certain personalities are also required to Digivolve or De-Digivolve specific Digimon along with player rank and relationship status. Consumable items and training sessions let you speed up this process too.</p>

 <p>There’s also an entire character skill tree full of perks that provide extra bonuses to your team depending on a Digimon’s specific relationship with you and their personality type, though I didn’t get to see how these systems feel over the long haul. Do they feel balanced? Do they get tedious? Is it too streamlined or too convoluted? But I certainly came away with the impression that <em>Time Stranger</em> has a great foundation to work with.</p> <p>Will it hold up over a 40-50 hour adventure? Is it well paced? Does the story end up going somewhere cool even if you’re not a dyed-in-the-wool <em>Digimon</em> sicko? Only the full, finished game can answer those questions. So far, however, the successor to <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em> continues to look like it’s making smart choices and pushing the series forward. It could easily be overshadowed next month by <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> but it doesn’t deserve to be. <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> should be on every RPG fan’s radar, whether they’ve been keeping up with the franchise or not.</p>

Blazkowicz in a third Wolfenstein game.</p><p>"We have always seen this as a [Wolfenstein] trilogy," said Torvenius during a Wolfenstein documentary by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noclip</a>. "So that journey for B.J., even during those first few weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for, at least, that character. What will happen in the second one, what will happen in the third one. So I think that's important to say, because--at least, I hope--that we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E189QG28rnE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While there's currently no word about a third Wolfenstein game, Amazon is reportedly developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-the-works-from-same-company-behind-fallout-show/1100-6533457/" data-ref-id="1100-6533457">a Wolfenstein TV series for Prime Video</a>. Kilter Films--one of the production companies behind Prime Video's Fallout series--is producing the show alongside Machine Games.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silksong%E2%80%99s-most-popular-mods-are-all-about-making-the-game-easier.1291866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></a>is out. Did you know that? You probably pieced that together. After seven years of waiting, Team Cherry’s long-awaited 2D action-platformer is here and kicking people’s asses. But on PC, thousands of players are using mods to help them overcome the challenging game.</p> <p><em>Silksong</em> released late last week on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC after nearly a decade of waiting. And first reactions to the sequel are almost entirely positive, with fans loving the small tweaks to the<em> Hollow Knight</em> formula and the larger size of its world. Plus, that $20 price tag is nice in an era when everything is more expensive than ever. And <em>Silksong</em>, like <em>Hollow Knight</em>, isn’t the easiest game in the world. Many players are even claiming that <em>Silksong</em> is harder than the OG. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031">This has led to a lot of discourse on the internet about how hard it is or isn’t, and about game difficulty in general</a>. But if you’re playing on PC, there’s a solution: Just mod <em>Silksong</em> and make it easier.</p> <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/hollowknightsilksong?modSort=popular">If we hop over to <em>Silksong’s</em> mods hub over at <em>NexusMods</em></a>, a popular PC modding site, you can see there are already 60+ mods available for the recently released platformer. And many of the most popular mods available for the game make it much easier to play. The most popular mods for <em>Silksong</em> include one that adds health meters to enemies, another one that stops enemies from doing double damage to the player, and one that shows the player’s position on the map at all times. All of these mods have over 15,000 downloads. An automapping mod has 9,000 downloads. Another free PC mod that increases how much damage players deal to enemies has over 7,000 downloads.</p>

 <p>In fact, the only mod more popular than all of these mods that make <em>Silksong</em> easier is the mod needed to run any of these other creations. That mod, “BepInEx 5 with Configuration Manager,” has over 28,000 downloads as of September 8. That’s a lot of downloads for a game that’s barely been out a week. Of course, not all the mods for <em>Silksong</em> are about making it easier. But those mods, like one that adds ultrawide support and a death counter, only have a few hundred downloads or fewer.</p> <p>It seems that the people coming to <em>NexusMods</em> for <em>Silksong</em> mods mostly have one goal in mind: Make the game less challenging. I expect reactions to this will vary a lot, but personally, I land on the side of “If folks want to make a game easier or harder with mods, and it doesn’t ruin it for other people, then whatever.” But I’ve been on the web long enough to know that ain’t a universal take.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-54-lost-clickwheel-ipod-games-have-now-been-preserved-for-posterity.1291860/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Last year, we reported on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/ipod-fans-evade-apples-drm-to-preserve-54-lost-clickwheel-era-games/">the efforts of classic iPod fans to preserve playable copies of the downloadable clickwheel games</a> that Apple sold for a brief period in the late '00s. The community was working to get around <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/728B5C4B-0A35-40BE-A2E7-E5464C68B80A.html">Apple's onerous FairPlay DRM</a> by having people who still owned original copies of those (now unavailable) games sync their accounts to a single iTunes installation <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject/tree/main">via a coordinated Virtual Machine</a>. That "master library" would then be able to provide playable copies of those games to any number of iPods in perpetuity.</p>
<p>At the time, the community was still searching for iPod owners with syncable copies of the last few titles needed for their library. With <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1nb9kvx/comment/nd2dozi/">today's addition of <em>Real Soccer 2009</em></a> to the project, though, all 54 official iPod clickwheel games are now available together in an easily accessible format for what is likely the first time.</p>
<h2>All at once, then slowly</h2>
<p>GitHub user Olsro, the originator of <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject/tree/main">the iPod Clickwheel Games Preservation Project</a>, tells Ars that he lucked into contact with three people who had large iPod game libraries in the first month or so after the project's launch last October. That includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thatnostalgicnerd">one YouTuber</a> who had purchased and maintained copies of 39 distinct games, even repurchasing some of the upgraded versions Apple sold separately for later iPod models.</p>
<p>Ars' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/ipod-fans-evade-apples-drm-to-preserve-54-lost-clickwheel-era-games/">story on the project</a> shook out a few more iPod owners with syncable iPod game libraries, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1giaocx/release_3_ipod_clickwheel_games_lode_runner_star/">subsequent</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1gk4imk/release_5_new_ipod_clickwheel_games_bubble_bash/">updates</a> in the following days left just a handful of titles unpreserved. But that's when the project stalled, Olsro said, with months wasted on false leads and technical issues that hampered the effort to get a complete library.</p>
<p>"I've put a lot of time into coaching people that [had problems] transferring the files and authorizing the account once with me on the [Virtual Machine]," Olsro told Ars. "But I kept motivation to continue coaching anyone else coming to me (by mail/Discord) and making regular posts to increase awareness until I could find finally someone that could, this time, go with me through all the steps of the preservation process," he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1nb9kvx/comment/nd2dozi">added on Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>Getting working access to the final unpreserved game, <em>Real Soccer 2009</em>, was "especially cursed," Olsro tells Ars. "Multiple [people] came to me during this summer and all attempts failed until a new one from yesterday," he said. "I even had a situation when someone had an iPod Nano 5G with a playable copy of <em>Real Soccer</em>, but the drive was appearing empty in the Windows Explorer. He tried recovery tools &amp; the iPod NAND just corrupted itself, asking for recovery..."</p>

                <p>Former Bethesda executive Pete Hines has opened up on some of the predictions people made about Bethesda games over the years, and why he stuck to his guns when others doubted him.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dbltap</a>, Hines said people questioned if The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind would even work as an Xbox exclusive, or if The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim could find success with its release date--November 11, 2011--being so close to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (November 8, 2011).</p><p>"'Oh, Skyrim can't survive going up against Call of Duty. Same window. Everybody's gonna play Call of Duty. Nobody's gonna buy your game,'" Hines recalls hearing.</p><p>For his part, Hines said he understands Call of Duty is a huge brand, but he believed Bethesda had a "better game" with Skyrim and wasn't afraid to spend marketing dollars on it.</p><p>"I will go up against those guys. I will spend [marketing money] against those guys. I will never spend anywhere near as much and I can still win," he recalled.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5031">Both games succeeded in 2011</a>, with Modern Warfare 3 finishing as the No. 1 best-selling game and Skyrim coming in second for the year in the US. Skyrim has gone on to sell more than 60 million copies, making it one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">best-selling games of all time</a>. A final sales number for Modern Warfare 3 is unknown, although Skyrim did benefit from numerous ports to other platforms over the years. </p><p>Another line Hines heard was that Bethesda should avoid releasing The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the spring (it launched in March 2006) because "nobody releases games in the spring." But in the end, Hines said, "We did just fine." The game is still enjoying success to this day, thanks to the 2025 remaster, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">2025's No. 2 best-selling game in the US.</a></p><p>Challenging preconceived notions and finding success was "what made it so fun," Hines said about his time at Bethesda. "I think we were better at it than anybody else in terms of what we were able to do, when you look at the awards we won, the players we brought in, and how we went about doing it right. I wanted to be a part of a company where if anybody peeks into a window to see how we're doing this, I feel okay about it," he said.</p><p>Hines left Bethesda after Microsoft acquired its parent company, ZeniMax. Hines is now retired, but he's continued to share his opinions, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bethesda-boss-pete-hines-has-strong-words-about-subscription-services-in-gaming/1100-6534511/" data-ref-id="1100-6534511">how he feels about Xbox Game Pass. </a></p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
