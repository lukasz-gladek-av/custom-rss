            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-review-more-princesses-more-problems<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's now been a little over a year since I played <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="449834bb-ce3a-4a84-8de1-5fb9557c6eb0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-review-im-prettiest-princess">Darrington Press' <em>Queen By Midnight</em></a>. Taking part in a deckbuilding battle royale where the victor walks away the titular Queen By Midnight this game showed off unique mechanics and a gorgeous cardboard craft clock that serves not only as an impressive setpiece but manages core game mechanics. Now with the standalone expansion, Queen By Midnight Quarter Past, four new Princesses join the fray.</p>



<p>Contained within the box of <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> you'll find complete instructions for how to play the game (including boxes that specify what's new in this edition), a flat clock for turn tracking, boards and tokens for each of the four Princesses, specific decks for each Princess, and a deck of Bazaar cards broken up into three time segments.</p>

Players each pick which of the Princesses they wish to play as, gathering up the relevant character board and deck. Then, the clock is laid out and set up with Bazaar cards. Once everyone is ready you roll the dice to see who goes first and begin playing your cards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While in the original game the clock was a massive structure that doubled as a dice tower that you would build and place on a spinning platform the clock included in Quarter Past is a flat clock. While less intricate it does promote the idea of Quarter Past functioning as a 'travel' version of the game, while the larger box can stay at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>A quick gameplay overview</h2>

<p>Working to develop their decks players will use cards to increase their Clout, the primary currency in the game, and purchase new cards. Cards can be purchased from a Princesses specific Vault, which will contain abilities unique to the Princess, or they can be purchased from the Bazaar which offers a more generic, but useful nonetheless, variety of abilities.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Each newly purchased card is sent to the Archive, this game's equivalent of a graveyard, when it will be shuffled back into their deck to then be used against other Princesses.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board.jpg?itok=64-l8yI3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board.jpg?itok=kMf9E-a6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is a constant balance of spending and regaining Clout, as your deck grows in size you'll quickly learn you can't just be spending Clout freely as your ability to regain it will return less and less frequently. Alternatively, leaving too much Clout on your board does leave it in a place where it can get stolen by another's card effects.</p>

<p>The deckbuilding alone is a lot of fun but after each player has completed a turn the clock will increment by one. At certain key times, like 5 o'clock or 8 O'Clock important events can happen such as the Bazaar cards being swapped out for a deck filled with more powerful abilities, or the hand size limit is increased.</p>

<p>The game ultimately ends after the clock reaches 12, or if only one competing Princess remains. This does a good job to keep a cap on the events of the game and to limit just how much power creep can occur.</p>

<h2>Drawing At The Start Slows The Game Down</h2>

<p>One of the largest issues that I've found with <em>Queen By Midnight</em> is that as long as you have clout you can be activating cards, in most scenarios, especially in the early game you'll be spending down your entire hand before the end of your turn.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-vault.jpg?itok=QXDKF-Bm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-vault.jpg?itok=KrnB9LHl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sitting at the table with nothing in your hand isn't anything I have an issue with, but not knowing what I'm going to draw next will mean I have no clue what any of my options are for next turn.</p>

<p>At the start of each player's turn momentum always slows. A fresh hand of cards are drawn, effects are read, Clout is increased, and the six purchasable cards may be reviewed.</p>

<p>This will mean that unless you're playing with a group that knows their Princesses' abilities inside and out that you are limited in how much time you can be strategizing, or you leave the table waiting on you for your move (while they too have no clue what they're going to do next).</p>

<h2>The new Princesses and their abilities</h2>

<p>As the name implies <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> sees four new Princesses joining. This expansion includes Azil With-A-Z, Elise LaKraken, Kahurere Skyfisher, and Qasima Al-Basar. Each comes with their own unique mechanics and playstyle that let you mix and match against other players for strange situations.</p>

<p>Azil With-A-Z is a reference to Alice in Wonderland, with the ability to Shrink and Grow. By changing her size she also alters one of her Classes between Brawler and Schemer. Her abilities are incredibly strong, but as you can only perform certain abilities when a certain class you can also end up being stuck unable to deal damage.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun playing with Azil, there's an important aspect of needing to plan your moves as far out as you can. If an ability would deal damage, but then cause you to shrink, what can you then do in that state? Do you have a way to grow again? It was very satisfying when everything fell into place.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-mechanic.jpg?itok=RsOFrZ3q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-mechanic.jpg?itok=kEjbZ7hI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Elise LeKraken is a Schemer/Caster character whose core mechanic is to banish her own cards. This would all be a power play to then unleash ultimate abilities near the end of the game to flip the game in her favour.</p>

<p>It was interesting that LeKraken worked almost as a sleeper character, but knowing her mechanics and targeting her early could also be an easy downfall depending on the number of players and how dedicated they were to knocking competition out of the game.</p>

<p>Kahurere Skyfisher is a Brawler/Schemer whose mechanic is in traps. She has a variety of cards that can be placed in other players Archives. When activated those cards might gain a benefit to the Princess, such as getting to draw a card, but it will also provide a boon to Skyfisher.</p>

<p>Whether it be ways to steal Clout or also be able to draw a card there's a lot of good that can be done for Skyfisher on another player's turn, not to mention the inclusion of a card like this is their deck might mean it takes them longer to draw a card they're actually interested in getting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks.jpg?itok=LXzowDwL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks.jpg?itok=hy1Clj8u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Strangely the card we saw the most from the Skyfisher was to be able to steal 4 Clout. This is a large amount of Clout to be able to freely obtain, but when early turns comprise of gaining a lot of Clout and then spending it down to zero we most often ended up in situations where there wasn't any Clout to steal effectively rendering that card useless.</p>

<p>If Elise LeKraken is a sleeper the opposite of that is Qasima Al-Basar, the Brawler/Caster. This character doesn't start extremely strong but with some smart purchases will not only be dealing consistent damage, but will also grant themselves permanent damage boosts. A hit of three or four damage might not be much early on, but when the pace doesn't even stop but she's now hitting with eight damage you're going to be in trouble very quickly.</p>

<p>While Skyfisher seemed to have a narrower range of effectiveness the engine that is driving each of these decks is wildly different and a lot of fun. Further fleshing out the availability from the previously released Princesses the idea of "there's a playstyle for any kind of deckbuilding player" is even more true than before.</p>

<p>I think one of the best compliments I can give for the game is that it feels like getting to play Magic The Gathering, without the need to build a deck and strategy from the ground up. That being said there's still a lot of building as you weigh up purchasing cards from the Vault and Bazaar.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock.jpg?itok=MCDxU0T3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock.jpg?itok=fj-TT5O7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Is <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past </em>Standalone or an Expansion?</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Everything included in the box allows you to play <em>Queen By Midnight</em> from start to finish with four players. As an expansion though all of the Princesses available in this box can be played with any of the six previously available Princesses.</p>

<p>While Skyfisher seemed to have issues when facing off against Azil, it might be that there's another Princess that she has a definite advantage against.</p>

<p>To add further to this being an expansion Errata Cards for the base game have also been included in this update. These cards should be swapped out with cards that appear in the base game to better balance the experience.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards.jpg?itok=1eMfS_EL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards.jpg?itok=ddiZcdNm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I genuinely enjoyed the original game when I played it so I was excited to hear that there would be an expansion. The triple versatility allowing it to add more characters for fans of the base game, be a smaller entry point for new players, and even serve as a way to send updated cards allows it to achieve it's goal perfectly.</p>

<p>Of the four new Princesses I'm a little iffy on Skyfisher, but had a blast seeing what the other three were able to accomplish.</p>

<p>If you were a fan of the original game then this expansion is a no brainer, and if you don't know the original but are looking for a fun and deep deckbuilder where the game naturally scales as time goes on then I'd highly recommend checking this out.</p>

<p>Redditor Dale Robinson <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1gine5k/i_solved_the_sh2_remake_photos_secret/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">created a lengthy post yesterday</a> detailing all the steps he took to solve the puzzle. I don't wish to spoil the steps just in case you want to discover it for yourself, but suffice it to say that you'll need a healthy dose of lateral thinking if you do.</p>

<p>Robinson's efforts were <a href="https://x.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1853189523745730675" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lauded on X (formerly Twitter)</a> by&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>director Mateusz Lenart, who said he "knew it wouldn't stay hidden for long" and congratulated Robinson for solving the brain-teaser, suggesting that the "timing couldn't be better". Again, that post contains puzzle spoilers, so click at your peril.</p>

<p>Just in case you're unaware, the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake is, believe it or not, a reimagined version of the original 2002 survival horror classic. While the original game was created by Konami, this one's been developed by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/medium">The Medium</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Layers of Fear&nbsp;</em>studio Bloober Team, with Konami serving as publisher.</p>

<p>The game hews fairly closely to the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>'s story, but it features a new over-the-shoulder camera perspective, as well as extra story elements and quality-of-life gameplay tweaks.</p>




<p>The game proved popular with both critics and fans, selling <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m">a million copies within its first three days</a> on sale, although that didn't stop <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-wikipedia-page-locked">Wikipedia trolls from trying to edit the game's page</a> to suggest it had received much lower scores than it actually did.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix-goes-all-in-on-generative-ai-for-gaming-appoints-dedicated-vp.1026825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has appointed a VP (vice president) of generative AI within its gaming division, indicating that the tech giant is serious about the controversial technology when it comes to video games.</p>

<p>The VP in question is none other than Mike Verdu, who confirmed the news <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via his LinkedIn page</a>. Verdu says his new role at Netflix is to drive "a 'once in a generation' inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI".</p>

<p>Previously, Verdu worked as Netflix's overall games VP, but that role will now be filled by Alain Tascan, who Verdu says is "already in the process of taking Netflix Games in exciting new directions".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-games-generative-ai-vp-tiles.jpg?itok=pPu8zuXh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-games-generative-ai-vp-tiles.jpg?itok=cjQSaYPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Netflix has appointed a VP to handle generative AI for its gaming division.</figcaption></figure><p>Verdu says that generative AI represents a return to "seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innvoation" in gaming, expressing excitement he says he hasn't felt "since the 90s".</p>

<p>He also exhorts readers to "pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media" about recent changes to Netflix Games, presumably referring to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report">reported closure</a> of Netflix's in-house AAA development studio, codenamed Team Blue.</p>

<p>According to Verdu, everything that's happened within Netflix Games in the last several months "was actually a planned transition", suggesting that the closure of Team Blue wasn't a kneejerk response but a carefully-considered decision.</p>

<p>The vision for generative AI at Netflix, according to Verdu, is one that "puts creative talent at the center", uses AI as "a catalyst and an accelerant", and enables big development teams to "move much faster".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-generative-ai.jpg?itok=hcGzR3dw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-generative-ai.jpg?itok=IiC-FpfN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other studios, like Ubisoft, are also leaning into generative AI.</figcaption></figure><p>The topic of generative AI is a controversial one in the gaming world (and, indeed, the rest of the world) right now.</p>

<p>Proponents like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons">Hasbro</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-considering-ai-translation">Nihon Falcom</a>, and <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ubisoft</a>&nbsp;tout the potential benefits of the technology and seem enthusiastic about the ways in which they believe it could change the gaming landscape, but there are certainly no shortage of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans">ambivalent</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kobold-press-ceo-says-no-to-generative-ai">skeptical voices</a> in the industry on this front.</p>

<p>In any case, we don't know exactly how Verdu and Netflix intend to use generative AI, so we'll likely have to wait until a major project from the company is announced in order to learn more. Stay tuned!</p>

This can help with performance on weaker CPUs and slower disks, and helps reduce stuttering on all CPU and disks, ChemBoy1 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also high on the most downloaded mods list is Nyctaginae’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonagetheveilguard/mods/12" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preset and sliders for their Rook</a> (Veilguard’s customizable main character), Ayse de Riva, a female mage and elf Antivan Crow (“Based on my OC of 15+ years, hope you like her!”).</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/da-again-1730725905246.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nyctaginae’s Ayse de Riva mod for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect more elaborate mods to release as modders get to grips with The Veilguard. We’ve seen the likes of Larian and CD Projekt release official mod tools for Baldur’s Gate 3 and The Witcher 3 respectively, which have unlocked an explosion in each game’s modding scene. Perhaps at some point down the line, BioWare will do the same for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that might be important in keeping the game alive, given BioWare has indicated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">it has no plans to release DLC for Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, with the developer now turning its attention to Mass Effect 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, fans are busy digging into BioWare's latest RPG after Dragon Age's release on Thursday, propelling it to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-beats-jedi-survivor-to-makes-it-eas-biggest-ever-single-player-game-on-steam"><u>new highs for an EA game on Steam</u></a>.

It’s rewarding to see our Steam “Recent Review” score rising, reflecting the positive impact of these ongoing improvements, and we’re committed to continuing this journey with your valuable input.</p><p>Highlights include:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Mob Density</strong> – Based on your feedback, we’ve fine-tuned certain mob encounters to create a smoother, more immersive combat experience by isolating instances to prevent mobs from stacking up. Returning players may find it worthwhile to start anew, as we’ve added a few fresh surprises along the way! (Original enemy distribution and density can still be accessed via NG+ modifiers.)</li><li><strong>Ranged Enemies</strong> – We’ve adjusted the perception of certain ranged units to correct instances that felt unfair or unrealistic.</li><li>Jumping – Platforming in Pilgrim’s Perch has been refined with improved indicators, making jumps clearer and navigation smoother.</li><li><strong>Player-Versus-Player Scaling</strong> – To elevate skill-based play in player-versus-player, we’ve rebalanced scaling mechanics, particularly where magic-infused weapons and spells are concerned. These tweaks apply exclusively to player-versus-player, so player-versus-environment players can continue with their current builds unaffected.</li><li><strong>Attack Displacement</strong> – Some weapon attacks have received slight adjustments to reduce displacement, providing a greater sense of control while preserving effectiveness and supporting your playstyle.</li></ul><p><strong><a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>d Tutorialisation, Onboarding, and Start-Up <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong></p><p>We’ve taken steps to further enrich the onboarding experience for new players in <em>Lords of the Fallen</em>, building on feedback from our veteran Lampbearers. We want every new player to feel empowered on their journey, and we understand that some early tutorials may have presented a steep learning curve. Here’s what’s new:</p><ul><li><strong>Improved Lighting in the Defiled Sepulchre</strong> – Enhanced lighting and visual adjustments make this initial tutorial area clearer and easier to navigate.</li><li><strong>Gradual Umbral Tutorialization</strong> – Core abilities like “soulflay” and “syphoning” now have dedicated tutorial spaces later in Redcopse, allowing new players to engage with each feature more gradually.</li><li><strong>Simplified First Jump Tutorial</strong> – We’ve refined the jump tutorial to be more accessible (hands up in the comments if you cleared it on the first attempt!).</li><li><strong>Lightreaper Boss Adjustment in NG0</strong> – To clarify the intentional design of this encounter, we’ve removed the Lightreaper boss fight from the tutorial area for NG0 players. Rest assured: the Lightreaper still lurks within Mournstead and will make a return as a surprise in NG+.</li></ul><p><strong>A More Immersive Umbral Realm for Explorers</strong></p><p>Umbral, the parallel realm intertwined with the living world of Axiom, is accessible at any point in the game, offering an expansive world of alternate pathways, hidden treasures, and secrets. We know how much you enjoy exploring Mournstead, and many of you have asked for a more exploration-friendly Umbral realm. Embracing this idea, we’ve made some tweaks to enhance its immersive vibe while preserving its mysterious, challenging nature.</p><p>While Umbral remains intentionally hostile, we’ve made adjustments to its sounds, visuals, and enemy spawn curve. Now, the threads (Umbral natives) are slower to detect your presence, allowing you some precious time to explore before the realm’s haunting intensifies. Eventually, the Scarlet Shadow will appear, forcing you to decide: escape or engage in an epic showdown.</p><p>These changes make Umbral better suited for exploration while preserving its eerie intensity and challenging atmosphere:</p><ul><li><strong>Dynamic Ambient Sound</strong> – Initial entry into Umbral is now accompanied by subtler soundscapes, building in intensity as you remain longer, reaching a crescendo before you must find an exit, or risk facing the <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">Crim</a>son Reaper.</li><li><strong>Adjusted Enemy Spawn Curve</strong> – Enemy appearances are now better paced to create a smoother, gradual build-up of tension.</li><li><strong>Increased Delay for Scarlet Shadow</strong> – You’ll now have more time to explore before the Scarlet Shadow emerges, enhancing the suspense.</li><li><strong>Reduced Vignette Effect</strong> – Based on player feedback, the vignette effect has been softened to improve visibility while exploring Umbral.</li><li><strong><a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>rer Umbral Eggs</strong> – We’ve added a special VFX to eggs set to spawn Umbral natives, as we noticed some players had difficulty distinguishing between active and inactive ones.</li></ul><p>These updates create a richer exploration experience within Umbral, preserving its dark allure and escalating tension for daring <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,849 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>rs.</p><p><strong>Performance Improvements</strong></p><p>We’ve implemented additional performance enhancements across several of the game’s more graphically demanding areas, optimizing the experience for players with lower-spec computers.</p><p><strong>New Challengers Incoming!</strong></p><p>With <em>Lords of the Fallen</em> now fully harnessing the power of the PlayStation 5 Pro (with an enhanced Performance Mode running at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second based on 1440p, and Quality Mode running at a native 4K resolution and 30 frames per second), prepare for a fresh wave of cross-players venturing into Mournstead! Be sure to welcome them—whether with a warm salute in cooperative play or the cold edge of your blade in player-versus-player.</p></blockquote><p><em>Lords of the Fallen</em> is available now for PlayStation 5, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,346 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,625 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1501750/The_Lords_of_the_Fallen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/lords-of-the-fallen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The early years of Assassin's Creed saw players explore both the past and the modern day through its protagonist Desmond Miles, and while recent games have focused less on the person inside the Animus, Ubisoft plans to address that in the future.</p><p>In a recent interview, Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté reflected on how recent games struggled to create a meaningful connection between the past and the future. In the context of Assassin's Creed, ancient history is recreated through the Animus, a virtual-reality machine that taps into a subject's DNA and allows them to experience the genetically inherited memories of an ancestor. At the center of this idea was Desmond Miles, who entered the Animus and became a narrative anchor point for the Assassin's Creed franchise.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Real History of Assassin's Creed | The Real Assassin's Order</p>
      </div>
<p>"Desmond's journey was at the heart of the modern-day conflict driving the search for powerful Isu artifacts--Pieces of Eden--that could change the course of history," Coté said to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. However, with his death at the end of Assassin's Creed 3, we faced a creative crossroads. "Ending Desmond's arc was a difficult decision, and afterward, the modern storyline struggled to find its footing."</p><p>To address this, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will lay the groundwork for the future of the series, as it'll be integrated inside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-infinity-everything-we-know-about-ubisoft-game-hub/1100-6503702/" data-ref-id="1100-6503702">Assassin's Creed Infinity</a>, a hub presented as an in-universe Animus that will host the ongoing modern-day narrative. Coté explained that this will allow the contemporary storyline to "enhance" rather than overshadow the historical journey, creating a "meaningful contrast between past and present" that will focus on how the past shapes the present and themes of freedom versus control.</p><p>"The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will lay the foundation for this narrative evolution that will grow in the years to come," Coté said.</p><p>Originally scheduled to launch in October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed to February 14, 2025</a>. Ubisoft said at the time that the delay was made to give the developers more time to polish the game, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-assassins-creed-shadows-early-access/1100-6527307/" data-ref-id="1100-6527307">Assassin's Creed Shadows' early access has also been canceled</a>.</p>

            <p>Developer Hexworks has shared details on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a>'s PS5 Pro update.</p>
<p>As with games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-enhanced-label-will-see-30fps-quality-mode-with-added-ray-tracing">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-hands-on-preview-is-it-worth-it">Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</a>, Lords of the Fallen will benefit from that 'Enhanced' label on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PS5 Pro's release this week</a>.</p>
<p>In Lords of the Fallen's case, this will see a 40 percent increase in pixel density. In addition, it will boast an enhanced Performance Mode, which means 1440p at 60fps (Upscaled to 4k). Quality Mode, meanwhile, will offer players 30fps at 4k.</p>

<p>As well as getting its game ready for the PS5 Pro, Hexworks has also released a patch for the base game. Patch 1.6 - as it is known - will include gameplay adjustments, steps to "further enrich the onboarding experience for new players" and a "more immersive" Umbral Realm, to name a few.</p>
<p>Hexworks specifically highlighted the below improvements, which arrive with Patch 1.6:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mob Density: </strong>Based on your feedback, we’ve fine-tuned certain mob encounters to create a  smoother, more immersive combat experience by isolating instances to prevent mobs from  stacking up. Returning players may find it worthwhile to start anew, as we’ve added a few  fresh surprises along the way! (Original enemy distribution and density can still be accessed  via NG+ modifiers.)</li>
<li><strong>Ranged Enemies: </strong>We’ve adjusted the perception of certain ranged units to correct  instances that felt unfair or unrealistic.</li>
<li><strong>Jumping: </strong>Platforming in Pilgrim's Perch has been refined with improved indicators, making  jumps clearer and navigation smoother.</li>
<li><strong>PvP Scaling:</strong> To elevate skill-based play in PvP, we’ve rebalanced scaling mechanics,  particularly where magic-infused weapons and spells are concerned. These tweaks apply  exclusively to PvP, so PvE players can continue with their current builds unaffected.</li>
<li><strong>Attack Displacement: </strong>Some weapon attacks have received slight adjustments to reduce  displacement, providing a greater sense of control while preserving effectiveness and  supporting your playstyle.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the team has said performance will be improved in some of Lords of the Fallen's more graphically challenging areas. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review">Eurogamer's Lords of the Fallen review</a> criticised the game for its poor performance, but the developer has been steadily offering improvements on this.</p><p>Today's patch will leave players feeling more "empowered" on their journey, Hexworks said. Full notes can be found via <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1501750/announcements">Steam</a>. Lords of the Fallen is now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1501750/Lords_of_the_Fallen/?utm_source=press+release&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=LOTFv1.6&amp;utm_id=Lords+of+the+Fallen+v1.6">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/lords-of-the-fallen">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/lords-of-the-fallen/9N3CJZ3HFHTF?utm_source=press+release&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=LOTF+v1.6&amp;utm_id=LOTF+v1.6">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lords-of-the-fallen/?utm_source=press+release&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=LOTF+v1.6&amp;utm_id=LOTF+v1.6">PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro</a> from this Thursday.</p>

<p>As for the further future, earlier this year, it was revealed that a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-sequel-now-in-full-development">follow-up to Lords of the Fallen is fully underway</a>. The sequel is said to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-sequel-set-for-2026">targeting a 2026 release</a>.</p></div>

Alien abductions are still taking place in Los Santos, and you're going want to be among the abductees if you'd like to get a cool weapon. But players are going to need to act fast, because these visitors from another world won't be hanging around forever.</p><p><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o3335k2ok38135/escape-alien-abduction-in-gta-online-this-halloween" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockstar Games</a> announced the alien abduction for this year's Halloween events, and it's going on through November 6. That means the skies are still strange, and players who make it out alive can earn The Shocker, a non-lethal alien weapon that acts like a stun baton. The hard part, however, might be getting captured in the first place.</p><p>The first thing that you need to know is that the aliens only come out at night from 10 PM to 4 AM in the game world, and given GTA Online's fast movement of time, this means that there's only a 12-minute window to find a UFO ship and get under it. Another complication is that your vehicles will fail if they get too close to the UFOs, so plan accordingly.</p><p>If you've successfully pulled off the abduction, the next step is escape. Players will find themselves locked in a room under Fort Zancudo. That's where The Shocker can be found, but players still have to get out with their lives in order to keep it. Opening the exit requires some close examinations of the clues in the chamber. Fortunately, The Gaming Gorilla has shared a video that breaks down how to get out of the room before a lethal gas makes this a one-way trip.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44cHCm6FM08" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/44cHCm6FM08" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you miss your opportunity to get abducted this year, it's likely that Rockstar will revisit the idea in time for Halloween 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/slitterhead-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Slitterhead immediately grabbed headlines when it was first announced, in part thanks to the pedigree of the team at Bokeh Games. Headed up by Keiichiro Toyama, a legit legend of Japanese gaming having created not only Silent Hill but also the Siren and Gravity Rush series, and with Silent Hill stalwart Akira Yamaoka alongside for composition, you jad a survival horror dream team scenario. Details have been relatively sparse over the years, so I started my time with the game with a mixture of excitement and uncertainty. What even is Slitterhead? After finishing the game I’m still left with that question.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slitterhead - Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4EENlMq23sE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first thing that stands out is the game’s presentation. Slitterhead looks fantastic at times and offers up a neon-drenched and grubby analogue for Hong Kong that gave me flashbacks to the underrated Sleeping Dogs. However, it’s clear that this isn’t a big budget AAA game, and there’s some noticeable shortcuts. The most obvious is the vast number of doppelgangers running around Kow Long, making it feel like there’s only a handful of different NPCs. It gives the game an uncanny feeling that actually sort of works. Cutscenes are of a much higher standard, which leads to the kind of jarring transitions back to gameplay that characterised the Xbox 360 era. The game is accompanied by an interesting and varied soundtrack, with some unsettling drone and jazzy moments that stand out but do not overshadow the game itself.</p>


<p>The storyline is obscure and confusing in a deliberate way that perhaps speaks to the title’s ambition, but is left behind by its execution. You play as a mysterious spirit – the Hyoki – stranded in the game world with no memories (so far so generic). To survive you have to possess the bodies of those around you, controlling them through their blood. Such control is limited, and you are fragile and cumbersome. As you work through the early parts of the game you move from body to body before finding a Rarity – a human who can fully bond with you and unleash their full potential – with eight different</p>
<p>By the end of the game you’ll find up to eight different Rarities with unique skill sets and personalities. You find your first Rarity bleeding out after being attacked by the titular Slitterheads – grotesque monstrosities that also possess human bodies but burst out of their heads in varied horrific forms.</p>


<p>As the narrative develops you may find yourself asking a lot of questions about what is happening and why – I certainly was – but Slitterhead is not a game that offers easy answers. Much of the backstory is hidden behind collectable memory fragments and it later develops into a time hopping mechanic that makes following events even more confusing. This aspect is fine as it really feeds into the unsettling nature of the world and I enjoyed trying to piece things together. The ending of the game, however, proves to be perhaps the most headscratching part of all, but I’ll leave that for you to ponder on, if you give the game a try.</p>
<p>Equally puzzling is how the game plays. Slitterhead is much more like a fusion of&nbsp;visual novel and mission based action combat game than the survival horror title many were anticipating. Each of the Rarities has unique weapons and skills based on their personality and powered by their own blood. The end result of this is actually a more traditional set of character archetypes, but one that feels more original given the striking presentation and setting.</p>
<p>The first of your Rarities, Julee, is a healer, whilst the second, Alex, is more of a DPS warrior type. Once you have multiple Rarities available, you can take two into each mission, a move that opens up a range of choices and strategies to customise to your preferences. As well as the Rarities, you can still possess regular citizens in combat and juggling between the characters and maintaining their blood levels can lead to enjoyably frantic fights, at least for a while.</p>

<p>Between the static text conversation parts (for which there is a very disappointing lack of voice acting for 90% of the game) and arena fight set pieces you’ll be ‘exploring’ the city. This exploration is incredibly limited though and you’ll find yourself frustrated by the invisible walls and boundaries. Given that each mission has hidden collectables to find it is very counter-intuitive that the world is so restrictive with your character often refusing to leave the main path. These collectables are also only revealed after you complete the mission, so you don’t know whether you have found everything until you go back to the mission select screen. These decisions are echoes of gaming mechanics that I had hoped were left in the past.</p>
<p>Most annoying of all is the fact that several of the game’s Rarities are hidden throughout the missions and progress is locked until you find them. As you don’t know this is the case until you finish a mission in most cases, and the levels themselves are often linear paths that don’t really facilitate backtracking, you’re forced to replay missions until you find the Rarity and then unlock more boring, obtuse conversation trees.</p>
<p>The end result is one of frustration rather than excitement and I often rushed through missions the first time in the knowledge that I’d have to replay them again anyway knowing what I was looking for. Replaying missions doesn’t reward you with skill points to upgrade your character, which are only awarded the first time you finish a level, so you can’t even use these replays to grind. Even the creature design falls flat once you realise that there are only a handful of grotesque types endlessly repeated. Once you’ve fought off a few hundred anthropomorphic penises you start to lose interest…</p>

<p>Keiichiro Toyama has been open about the challenges of developing this game through engine choice to the effects of the Covid pandemic and I’m sensitive to the difficulties facing new studios, even when made up of superstar figures, but Slitterhead is a difficult game to fully recommend in its current form. It feels too much like the spirit of a game forced to possess a range of different types whilst trying to find itself.</p>

			<p>A stunning Unreal Engine 5.4 demo that is available for download for free shows how the engine can deliver some impressive realistic visuals.</p>
<p>The Rome demo by <a href="https://www.scansfactory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scans Factory</a>, which can be downloaded by going&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q6AxF2kcqoWwoWztzQ3Jpg0bmL96R51J/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, is an incredible ultra-realistic recreation of the capital of Italy, complete with rain effects that allowed the team to create some impressive reflections with puddles. Despite not being an exact recreation of the city, having been to Rome over a dozen times, I can say that the demo does an excellent job depicting the city's unique vibe, possibly even enhancing it by removing the crowds and the confusion that often populate its streets. In case you cannot run the demo, you can check it out in action in the video below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams.</a></p>

<p>Since the launch of the very first version of the engine back in 2022, Unreal Engine 5 has made some impressive strides that have improved it considerably. However, it has not addressed some of the biggest concerns, such as the stuttering issues that plague the vast majority of the games powered by Epic's latest engine, although version 5.4 did bring<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-the-matrix-awakens-cpu-gpu-performance-improvements/"> significant CPU performance improvements.</a></p>
<p>While Unreal Engine 5.4 is the latest public version of the engine, version 5.5 is in the works and already available in preview. This version of the engine introduces MegaLights, which allows developers to have a massive number of movable dynamic lights with realistic area shadows and more. More information on this version of the engine can be found <a href="https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/unreal-engine-5-5-preview/2048423" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>

			<p>With only three days to go before the launch of the PS5 Pro console, Sony is understandably ramping up the marketing. Their most recent video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnyzLf7cddE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shows</a> Insomniac Games (in particular, the team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-purpose-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>) talking about what's most exciting about the new hardware. The highlighted feature is, once again, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.</p>
<p><em><strong>Marcus Smith (Creative Director):</strong> As a developer, Insomniac Games is always trying to do the biggest and the best and bring the deepest experiences to players. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Lindsay Thompson (Animation Lead):</strong> Knowing that gamers have to choose between the two modes of Performance or Fidelity is a little frustrating because we want our players to have the best experience possible.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Jahrain Jackson (Principal Engine Programmer):</strong> What excites me the most about the PS5 Pro is that you're basically getting both Performance and Fidelity in one package. There's no fear of missing out on something by choosing one or the other; it's really a game-changer. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Marcus Smit</em></strong><em><strong>h:</strong> Our players no longer have to choose and that means they're seeing the true vision of the game that we're trying to create. They're able to have a much more emotional experience as they explore our graphically intense worlds and at an extremely high fluid frame rate. </em><em>It really has opened up our ability to create worlds much truer to the vision that we had originally. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Jahrain Jackson:</strong> PSSR is really exciting because it's this game-changer for bringing our visual fidelity up to the next level.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Lindsay Thompson:</strong> There's so much that we put into this game, so many details and exciting little surprises. The player should be able to have the best experience while getting to see all of those things. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Jahrain Jackson:</strong> Being able to deliver all that we have to offer from that game is going to be phenomenal. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Lindsay Thompson:</strong> I think we have endless possibilities, and this new experience is going to be the best player experience possible.</em></p>
<p>Insomniac Games was not the first developer to single out PSSR as the main PS5 Pro advancement. We recently heard the same from <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-key-feature-could-be-pssr-says-dying-light-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Techland</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexon</a>, for example.</p>
<p>In other news, over the weekend, we got the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-specs-leak-unveils-2-extra-gb-of-ddr5-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full specs leak</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-teardown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first teardown video</a> ahead of the official launch scheduled for this Thursday.</p>

            <p>When nightmarish sci-fi extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">The Forever Winter</a> launched into early access in September it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winter-struggles-into-early-access-with-poor-performance-and-a-deadly-thirst-for-your-time">somewhat messy</a>. Bugs and maddening enemy spawns diminished the tension of being a fleshy human scavenger in a mech battlefield. But one feature annoyed some players much more - fresh water. See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement's inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you're not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you've collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they've answered in an interesting way. Water thieves! Now, on top of the usual downward trickle, burglars will come to steal your H2O as well.</p>
<p>It's not as bad as it sounds.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Far from making things more difficult, the water thieves are really a way to give players who run out of water one last chance to scrape back from the loot wipe. They'll show up in your headquarters when you have basically no water left, and if you can manage to kill them and defend your home you'll get some water from their corpses and stave off the hideous thirstwipe for the time being. Fail to kill the home invaders and you'll suffer the usual consequences. </p>

<p>The water thieves are just one addition in the game's recent October update, which is mainly a bunch of bug fixes, a new map, and a frightening new mech boss called "the Rat King". You can see <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/4455841997094125639?snr=1_5_9_">the full patch notes here</a> but it basically seems to be the biggest update to the game so far, featuring more quests, a means of "AI buddy control" and some "AI pathing and combat improvements." Hopefully that means the enemies won't act quite as unpredictably as I've previously witnessed. </p><p>Meanwhile, the water system tweaks are not over, the developers say, as it's still a source of both confusion and annoyance for some folks. There are those who hate the way it gnaws at you even when you're not playing, and there are those who think it's not a big deal at all, insisting it's easy to find sufficient water in the battlefield to stay stocked up for a long time. I just feel it's the least of the game's design difficulties. Maybe picking up items should be less fiddly first? Maybe enemy sightlines should be more reliably knowable? Maybe tanks shouldn't <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U-ktTg7ACeI">fly into orbit</a>? There are a lot of things that make the moment-to-moment antics in these captivating death zones feel janky. Taken altogether, I'd say that's a bigger issue than one dwindling resource. </p>
<p>If you want to get a feel for the game without buying it, there's also now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/4542536020217823369?snr=1_5_9_">a demo</a>, in which you can only play alongside other demo users. It only has one map to enlootify - the Ashen Mesa. It's one of the better battle zones of the game from what I've played. But you can also see what the player headquarters looks like. All my quibbles with the game's rough state aside, it has some very good-looking environments. It's worth playing the demo just to indulge in a bit of mech war tourism. If you find any water, let me know. I won't steal it. Promise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <em>Yakuza</em> games are as much studies of bizarre secondary characters and unlikely encounters as they are narrative-driven crime stories. And while side quests and random chats with NPCs in the street might create memorable game experiences, they hardly make for compelling television. Amazon made the smart choice of loosely adapting the first <em>Yakuza</em> game instead of committing to a full retelling, but the show’s strong potential gets lost in a muddle of confused storytelling and shallow character development.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196578" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="387" data-playlist="196578,194088,197298" data-current="196578"><div><p>Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22135.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Episode one is an odd introduction: A stylish segment you’d expect from a heist comedy kicks things off, with protagonist Kazuma Kiryu (Ryoma Takeuchi) and his friends Yumi (Yuumi Kawai), Akira Nishikiyama (Kento Kaku), and Nishikiyama’s sister Miho (Hinano Nakayama), staging a daring theft. They pull it off, with a few bumps along the way, and when they return to their home, the Sunflower Orphanage, it goes terribly wrong. It turns out the money belonged to the Dojima family, one of the most dangerous yakuza families in the region.<br></p><p>The story sets itself up as if it’s about these orphans and the struggles they face. The stolen money was supposed to help them get away from Sunflower and their harsh adopted father, Kazama, but the rest of the episode is a lengthy, rather shallow, series of events that sees the four kids join the yakuza. Apparently, the worst thing Kazama ever did at Sunflower was establish rules, and Kiryu, supposedly, did all this just so he could join the yakuza. Episode one doesn’t stop to explore why Kiryu wanted to join the yakuza or why the other kids wanted to leave Sunflower, and neither topic comes up again. It’s a bit of a mess, thanks in large part to Kiryu himself.<br></p><p>Kiryu’s characterization is one of the series’ more confusing diversions from RGG’s games, which show Kiryu’s personality by putting him in uncomfortable situations and challenging his worldview during encounters outside the main story. Amazon never gives its Kiryu a chance to develop, and he desperately needs it. His character is a rebellious youth who wants to fight, a dream that grew after he saw the former Dragon of Dojima—Kamurocho’s top-ranking prize fighter—only once, and that becomes his entire personality. Even putting aside the source material, that’s not the stuff from which interesting characters are made, and it makes his transformation in 2005 feel strained and unbelievable. Even though <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> is consciously trying to tell a story different from RGG’s, it expects the viewer’s familiarity with the <em>Yakuza</em> games to cover gaps in the show’s narrative. You don’t have to see Kiryu’s love for his adopted family, you just know it exists—except, if you’ve never played the first <em>Yakuza</em>, you really don’t.<br></p><p>Between shifts in perspective and time period, none of the subplots have enough time to feel fully realized. That problem isn’t helped by having an extended fight between Kiryu, Nishiki, and Goro Majima take up a good portion of the third episode and a subplot about property crime that spans two episodes and goes nowhere.<br></p><p>To be fair, the show is at times highly entertaining, and its fight choreography is superb. <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> might fumble <em>Yakuza</em>’s storytelling and thematic development, but it perfectly captures the chaotic energy, ludicrous scenarios, and ridiculous, over-the-top violence of its fights. There’s a gunfight in the middle of a beauty pageant, Majima gets bashed on the head repeatedly with a concrete block and walks away unfazed, and Kiryu throws away formal fighting rules and embraces underhanded tactics, pulling off brutal moves lifted almost directly from the <em>Yakuza</em> combat system’s signature Heat Moves. He grinds faces onto stone walls, lifts grown men above his shoulders before slamming them into the ground, and carelessly smacks a low-level grunt’s head into a fitting room mirror without even looking at him.<br></p><p>Given how infrequent these fights are, though, it’s hard not to wish Amazon put that effort into stronger character and plot development instead. Unlike RGG Studio’s games, <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> is determined to shy away from any kind of social injustice commentary or the possibility of corruption in high places, and its story feels sanitized as a result, despite its frequent bursts of shocking violence.<br></p><p>The closest it gets to making a point is in episode two, when Yumi and Miho start their jobs in a hostess club. There’s a particularly moving scene where Miho, holding her favorite stuffed animal, tells Yumi she wants to make enough money to see the world, then have a family and die as a grandmother. The next day, she— a child—drinks so much to make a client happy that she passes out. Their new “family” forces children and young women to perform for rich old men, all to earn money that has to go toward rent for a dilapidated apartment while dreams of a better life wither and die. That’s the most self-reflective the series’ first half is, though, and it never tries weaving these themes into its story as the <em>Yakuza</em> games do.<br></p><p>The burden of carrying the series’ first half forward falls onto its characters and their relationships, and <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> just isn’t built for that to work. The first episode spends too much time dragging out the drama of the Sunflower kids joining the Dojima family and not enough on building the emotional foundation its story requires. The relationships between Kiryu, Nishiki, Yumi, and Miho are almost non-existent, despite being at the center of the show’s narrative, robbing its biggest moments of the emotional weight they’re meant to have.<br></p><p>The series develops a slightly stronger sense of coherence starting with episode four, although it doesn’t quite shake the problems of its first half. It starts with a heist, like in episode one, but on a much bigger and more dangerous scale. Yumi’s sister Aiko (Misato Morita) and her work partner waylay a van transporting 10 billion yen for the Omi Alliance in a bid to start a war between yakuza clans. Why the largest, most efficient yakuza organization in the region is transporting that much money in a single van with a minuscule escort is anyone’s guess.<br></p><p>Near the end of episode four comes a moment that the entirety of Amazon’s reimagining of RGG’s game depends on. Miho collapses, her fragile kidneys finally unable to take any more abuse, and Nishiki is devastated. The importance of this moment makes it all the more surprising that, up to this point, we’ve seen Nishiki have no interaction with his sister. He and Miho never speak, and the only time they’re physically together is in flashbacks to when they first arrived at the Sunflower orphanage together.<br></p><p>Suddenly, <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> expects us to believe in this deep relationship between the two siblings, one so important to Nishiki that this trauma threatens to shred his sense of self. It’s to Kento Kaku’s credit that he sells these scenes so well despite having little to work with, but they feel hollow anyway.<br></p><p>The problem is all of this is a conspiracy. Dojima forces Kiryu into the boxing ring to rig the betting odds and profit when he eventually loses, and he uses Miho’s illness for leverage. Miho wouldn’t have survived the transplant surgery anyway, as prolonged dialysis had weakened her heart. Nishiki then learns his kidney was a match for Miho, but Dojima had instructed the doctor to say otherwise.<br></p><p>It’s a shockingly cruel scenario, undercut slightly by how little interaction we’ve seen between the family and the Sunflower kids until now. Yumi and Miho have the most reason to hate the yakuza and their exploitation, but Miho’s death is a catalyst that awakens in <em>Nishiki </em>the desire to bring the entire Tojo clan down. He brutally murders the fixer who lied about procuring a transplant for Miho and shoots the Dojima leader in an act of vengeance. Kiryu takes the blame and goes to jail, and Nishiki finds himself moving up the ranks in the family. Nishiki’s newfound loathing for the yakuza is understandable. However, the show expects you to believe it stems from months of abuse, with Miho’s death being the final act that pushes him over the edge, and it just doesn’t work.<br></p><p>That said, Amazon’s decision to recontextualize Nishiki’s personal downfall and professional rise to power takes the narrative in a much stronger direction than we see in the first <em>Yakuza</em> game. In the game, the Dojima family’s head attempts to assault Yumi. Nishiki kills him, and Kiryu takes the blame to save his best friend from going to jail. Yumi loses her memory, and when she regains it, begins a destructive relationship with a corrupt politician who vaguely reminds her of Kiryu before eventually dying to save Kiryu. Casually using sexual assault as a plot point is distasteful and misogynistic, to say the least, but then anchoring Yumi’s entire personality to her love for Kiryu does her yet another disservice by removing any sense of individuality. She’s not a person. She’s just an object and a love interest. <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> tosses that setup away entirely and refocuses the emotional tension on the bonds between the four, and then three, friends.<br></p><p>As a result, Nishiki’s motivations extend beyond frustration over Yumi loving Kiryu instead of him, which means he gets to be more than an angry incel, and it turns out everything bad that happens is, in fact, Kiryu’s fault, just as his friends said. His desire to join the yakuza forced Yumi, Nishiki, and Miho into a nightmare from which they could never escape. On paper, the character dynamics are much stronger and more interesting than in the original <em>Yakuza</em> game, which makes <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em>’s decision <em>not</em> to develop the relationships between characters even more baffling. The show could have used the time spent on the property subplot–which goes nowhere after episode three–to show the tension of the brotherhood and rivalry between Kiryu and Nishiki, to emphasize Kiryu’s selfishness a bit more, or even to give Nishiki’s inferiority complex more attention.<br></p><p>The series’ end is a particularly interesting point. After Nishiki, revealed as the Demon of Shinjuku, murders dozens of Tojo clan members, Kiryu confronts him in a battle worthy of the <em>Yakuza</em> games’ most over-the-top encounters, and the yakuza wage war on the streets of Kamurocho—after all of this masculine melodrama, Yumi is the one who brings the conflict to a close. It’s Yumi who hands over the Omi Alliance’s money, gets Aiko to safety after her sister sustains a grievous injury, and helps Kiryu after his fight with Nishiki. In the end, a woman’s determination, anger, love for her sister, respect for her dead friend, and exceptional aim with a handgun make the dream of a better world possible–not Kiryu’s fists and dreams of glory.<br></p><p>It’s just a shame that <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em> only decided to try developing this main idea at the end, which is a structural issue as much as a problem with writing. Six episodes at roughly 45-50 minutes a piece is just nowhere near enough space to develop six main characters and four distinct plots. When half of those episodes focus on throwaway subplots instead of character development, a disconnect between the show’s expectations and what you actually feel is inevitable. Still, the ending creates a potentially strong setup for a second season, which, if the final scene is anything to go by, is also inevitable. Perhaps like with the <em>Yakuza</em> games themselves, the second one will be better.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This feeling, according to one player who has analyzed frame data for Wilds and compared it to that of prior Monster Hunter games, has to do with hitstop — or, in this case, the lack of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hitstop in action games pauses an attack animation on hit for dramatic effect, usually to emphasize the weight of an attack landing. Accompanied by various visual and sound effects, hitstop helps to give attacks a sense of power, as opposed to waving around a virtual weapon that feels like it fails to connect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Increasing the number of frames (and thus time) devoted to a weapon’s hitstop is traditionally used to increase the feeling of its power, as it leaves the player character in this paused state. Monster Hunter has used this to great effect over the years with many of its oversized weapons, and it’s this comparison to Wilds that YouTuber Blue Stigma has made to suggest a significantly reduced hitstop in Wilds is making the combat feel different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you felt like the combat in the MHWilds beta felt ‘off,’ it's not just you!” Blue Stigma tweeted. “As this short comparison video shows, Capcom seems to have reduced hitstop on most (if not all) weapon types in Wilds, leading to some weapons 𝘧𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘨 worse than they did in prior games.”</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">If you felt like the combat in the MHWilds beta felt "off," it's not just you! As this short comparison video shows, Capcom seems to have reduced hitstop on most (if not all) weapon types in Wilds, leading to some weapons 𝘧𝘦𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘨 worse than they did in prior games. <a href="https://t.co/PRIbkdEFTP" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/PRIbkdEFTP</a></p>— Blue Stigma (@Axelayer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Axelayer/status/1853123320079663522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In the video we see this effect in action, with combat in Wilds perhaps less impactful than in other Monster Hunter games. “It's worth noting there are other factors to general combat potentially feeling worse in Wilds; stuff like SFX, attack FX, and screenshake all play a part in making attacks FEEL good,”  Blue Stigma continued. “Hitstop is just one part of the formula and I'm not sure why there's less of it in Wilds overall.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue of hitstop in Wilds was picked up on by players ahead of the release of this video, with various threads on Reddit questioning Capcom’s decision here. “The removal of hitstop on some attacks completely ruins the impact,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1gf7b9a/the_removal_of_hitstop_on_some_attacks_completely/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor Cyrisaurus said last week</a>. “I'm loving almost everything about the beta, but one thing I just cannot wrap my head around is why Capcom neutered the hitstop on almost all of the attacks in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the best feelings in World was sliding down a slope with the Great Sword and plunging it into a monster, where you would really feel the brutality of it piercing through them thanks to hitstop. In Wilds, it's completely gone, and when you do the sliding attack it feels like you didn't even hit the monster. If not for damage numbers, I would be left thinking my attack missed, it just feels... like nothing. Obviously this isn't the only attack that feels anemic now, but it was the most jarring to me</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Please Capcom, bring back the hitstop.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Monster Hunter Wilds’ release date set for February 28, there are now just shy of four months until launch. Whether the hitstop issue is something Capcom plans to address remains to be seen. It may not be something the developer can meaningfully tweak this close to launch without a significant rework of combat, but fans are calling for changes nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for"><u>most recent preview of Monster Hunter Wilds</u></a> back in August, we were pretty pleased with what we saw. We called it "a Monster Hunter that embraces the parts of Rise that made it so much more inviting, but also doesn’t shy away from the larger scale and spectacle that helped make World the more enduring entry."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

To activate the Recon bonus, you must equip three Recon perks, for example Ghost, Engineer, and Vigilance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the seeing enemies through walls bit of the Recon perk that has sparked much debate within the Call of Duty community, with some even calling it a wallhack. Black Ops 6’s competitive multiplayer is played out on mostly small, close quarters maps with frequent dying and respawning, and being able to see enemies through walls on respawn, however briefly, provides a significant advantage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This advantage is so significant that Recon's 3-perk bonus is seen as essential to remain competitive, which means perks from the Enforcer and Strategist categories are being left behind. And with the addition of the hugely popular Nuketown map last week the power of Recon was exacerbated. This is a tight map often filled with chaotic death, so having most players running around with Recon means it’s very difficult to stay alive for any significant amount of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the weekend, with dissatisfaction at Recon reaching a head, Faze content creator Swagg called on Treyarch to nerf Recon, and associate director Matt Scronce answered the call with the simple: “Incoming.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Treyarch</a> NERF RECON PLZ.</p>— FaZe Swagg ☢️ (@Swagg) <a href="https://twitter.com/Swagg/status/1853115330748624970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While we don’t have any details yet, Scronce’s message has already sparked a positive response from Black Ops 6 players who’ve blamed Recon for having a miserable experience with Multiplayer.

            <title><![CDATA[Slitterhead Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/slitterhead-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slitterhead-review.1026708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/slitterhead-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Given its interesting body-swapping system, gnarly blood-based weaponry, creepy Lovecraftian monsters, and the fact that it’s sprung forth from the mind behind the original Silent Hill, Slitterhead certainly sounds like an action-horror game that could be razor sharp. Unfortunately, while this time-looping murder mystery set in the neon lit streets of a fictionalized Hong Kong serves up a solid slash ‘em up combat system, its story has been hacked to the bone, its enemy variety is surprisingly sparse, and its uninspired mission objectives are repeated to a truly tiresome degree. As it turns out, Slitterhead isn’t just an adventure that’s frequently out-of-body, it’s also one that’s quickly out of ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a real shame too, since Slitterhead’s intriguing premise certainly got its hooks into me early. After the bodies of local citizens are discovered in the back alleys of the Kowlong slums with holes in their heads where their brains used to be, we’re cast in the role of a mysterious spiritual entity known only as the ‘Night Owl’, acting as a disembodied detective in an effort to uncover a murderous menace known as the slitterheads who can disguise themselves in human form. To do so, we’re free to hop in and out of almost every person within a small radius, temporarily taking control of human hosts in order to hunt for clues through back alleys and brothels, and providing us with some interesting ways to infiltrate otherwise off-limits locations by beaming straight into another body through an open window or the bars of a locked gate, for example. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Slitterhead Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These easily manipulated meat sacks are basic in appearance and wooden in their movement, which perhaps makes some sort of sense given that they’re basically just mind-controlled marionettes. Unlike the similar crowdsourcing system in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/watch-dogs-legion">Watch Dogs: Legion</a>, there are no discernible skills or traits that distinguish one controllable citizen from another – that is, with the exception of the small cast of unique playable characters known as ‘rarities’. As the investigation progresses, the Night Owl comes across certain victims that are near death. Once possessed, their mortal wounds transform into weapons as their mangled arms bleed into the form of Wolverine-like claws, spears, and literal plasma swords, making them vital vessels for taking on any slitterheads you expose along the way. The growing party of rarities can be separated into pairs to accompany you into each mission, and Slitterhead’s story loops several times around the same three-day sequence, pulling you back to revisit events in its timeline in an effort to unmask the perpetrators behind certain crimes and potentially prevent them from ever happening.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>These easily manipulated meat sacks are basic in appearance and wooden in their movement, which perhaps makes some sort of sense given that they’re basically just mind-controlled marionettes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That unfortunately sounds a lot more interesting than it actually proves to be, since it involves retracing steps through a lot of the same areas and redoing a lot of the same simple tasks, like following ghostly apparitions along a preset path to piece together a slitterhead victim’s final moments. In between each mission you get to spend a little bit of time with your expanding roster of rarities, but unfortunately these exposition-dumping conversations are so poorly presented that I struggled to find anything of substance to really latch onto. They’re delivered in static snippets of text over repeated and rudimentary character animations, and I basically just mindlessly paged through them long enough to trigger the next story chapter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if I’d been able to better buy into each rarity’s individual plights, I don’t think it would have been worth my while, since this roughly 13-hour time travelling tale culminates in such a deflating and futile finale that it made me wish I could have looped back around to the beginning of my playthrough and prevented myself from ever hitting the start button on the title screen. It’s not even remotely scary either, which comes as a bit of a surprise given that it’s a horror adventure that’s been developed under the watchful eye of Keiichiro Toyama, director of the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill">Silent Hill</a>.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Crowd Strife</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is not without its charms, however. A simple one-button attack combo allows you to slit a head, throat, or whichever enemy body part comes within swinging distance of your bloody blades, but there’s more to Slitterhead’s fighting than first meets the eye. For starters, you can quickly beam between bystanders gathered around each arena in order to catch an enemy off guard with an attack from the rear, using the crowd to chip away at a target like some sort of GoFundMe for fisticuffs. Non-rarity humans have minimal amounts of health so I only ever stayed in control of them for short bursts before zipping back to my chosen rarity to unleash more damaging strikes, but hopping back and forth between them is a great way to draw enemy heat away and makes Slitterhead feel a bit like a supernatural spin on the real-time character-swapping battles of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are no medkits to collect and use, and instead health is replenished by hoovering up the pools of blood that form during each battle. It’s actually a pretty clever system, and it quickly becomes essential not only in terms of keeping your rarity alive, but also ensuring they’re topped up with enough hand-me-down hemoglobin to perform their unique blood-powered special abilities. Motorbike-rider Alex can create blood vortexes that drag enemies together and leave them open to attacks, cult member Tri can conjure up some blood blasting sentry turrets, while special agent Blake can unfurl a blood-powered mini-gun that rapidly whittles down both his and his opponent’s health bars in bursts of high risk and reward.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A simple one-button attack combo allows you to slit a head, throat, or whichever enemy body part comes within swinging distance of your bloody blades,</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It may cater to a variety of attack methods as its roster of rarities expands, however Slitterhead’s fighting system is not without its flaws. Most attacks land with all the weight of a wet newspaper, and although its thumbstick-based parrying system is fairly easy to get the hang of during one-on-one encounters, I could never rely on it during battles with multiple enemies at a time because the onscreen indicators too often failed to appear – even after I’d invested in the ‘6th Sense’ perk in Slitterhead’s modest skill tree system that’s supposedly meant to enable it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also bumped up against the fact that my progress through Slitterhead’s story came to a screeching halt on occasions when I hadn’t found a specific rarity, forcing me to replay levels (some that I’d already revisited as part of the story) in order to track them down and unlock a subsequent story chapter. At one point I was stuck spinning my wheels while I was forced to search for the same elderly woman rarity in six different levels, who had no involvement in the main story whatsoever and whom I never even used after I’d acquired her. In fact, although I did try most of the rarities as I recruited them, I ultimately continued to fall back on pairing the handy healing abilities of young actress Julee with the powerful double-barrelled blood gun attacks of Alex, since Slitterhead’s combat never really evolved to the point that I felt obligated to experiment with any other combination.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bloody Repetitive</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s largely because, while the developers have clearly spent a lot of time creating an expanding roster of up to eight rarities for you to choose from, it seems that not nearly enough time has been invested in crafting interesting enemies to face or scenarios for you to toss them into. Enemy variety is basically limited to the same rehashed handful of breeds – the pre-slitterhead humanoids with what look like a bunch of bananas for their heads, the repulsive mess of contorted limbs that are the evolved slitterheads themselves, annoying worms that can be wiped out with one hit, and the floppy, bipedal appendages that can really only be described as walking wieners. Admittedly, there are certainly a few different slitterhead types to take on, but I struggled to really find any meaningful difference between fighting an ‘octopus’ type and the ‘warty frogfish’ kind beyond their appearance, and tackled them all using more or less the exact same strategy – hopping between bodies like a sailor on shore leave and constantly shifting the attack from all angles until they were dispatched.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were a handful of instances where I was forced to think on my feet a little bit more, like in an early assault against SWAT-style human soldiers – some with machine guns, others with riot shields, and a few armed with jamming devices that temporarily disarmed my rarities of their special abilities. That at least forced me to prioritise the super power-spoiling soldiers first before I mopped up the rest of them, although strangely I never had to contend with that particular enemy type ever again. Elsewhere Slitterhead occasionally tried to impose a bit of urgency into an encounter by setting a scrap against a ticking time limit, but really the only clock I ever had my eye on was the one strapped to my wrist as I impatiently fought an ongoing battle against the same small set of enemy types and my own growing sense of deja vu.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not just the monsters that are recycled either, but wholesale mission structures. There are a few rare exceptions, like the time I had to figure out how to enter the top floor of a nightclub by teleporting back and forth between crane operators to swing iron girder platforms into place, or infiltrate a slitterhead-worshipping cult by sneaking past dimwitted guards shuffling along the most predictable, PSone-era patrol paths imaginable. But the bulk of Slitterhead’s objectives involve tracking down a monster disguised in human form by following a blue trail and using a ‘sightjack’ ability to get a glimpse of their current surroundings, ultimately exposing them, and then getting dragged into a clunky on-foot chase that’s less of a thrilling hot pursuit and closer to a tepid game of tag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I lost count of how many times I was forced to chase after the exact same monster types along the exact same loops through the exact same handful of grimy urban settings. It’s exhausting in the first instance, let alone the umpteenth – and although in the opening hours I found it annoying that there was no in-game map for some of its larger city areas, by the end of Slitterhead’s campaign I'd revisited every street, back alley, and rooftop so frequently that I could probably chart each locale from memory.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan's Favourite Games with Mind Control</h3></p></div></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Slitterhead features some interesting body-swapping exploration and a unique blood-based battle system, but it never fully capitalises on either of them due to its small handful of repeated level settings and largely indistinguishable enemy encounters. Its story is disappointingly primitive in its presentation, and its time-looping structure only really serves as a feeble attempt to mask the fact that it takes about one hour’s worth of story mission ideas and repeats them incessantly across its 13-hour duration. Like a bloody blade worn down by a few too many battles, Slitterhead grows increasingly dull over time and ultimately just doesn’t cut it. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Sailing back out of the wilderness of an abandoned console and form factor, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership is a return for another Mario RPG series. Where Paper Mario always lived on Nintendo’s premier console, Mario &amp; Luigi was the handheld counterpart, first on Game Boy Advance and then on Nintendo DS and 3DS. It’s been nine years since the last original game in the series, but if anything the brotherly bond that the series was built on is stronger than ever.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership – Yo-Ho, Bro! A Sea Shanty – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zyhWkdZGh00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>They’ll need it too, as they’re sucked into what appears to be the Bifröst from the MCU, only to crash out of it and land in the world of Concordia. This world was once completely connected and united, a cluster of islands floating across the oceans, all linked together by lighthouses and energy streams via the Uni-Tree. When that tree was destroyed by a machiavellian plot, all the islands floated away into isolation.</p>



<p>The brothers arrive at just the right time, meeting Connie, an apprentice Wattanist who’s planted a new Uni-Tree on Shipshape Island – which is part ship, part island – in an effort to reunite the world. To that end, you’ll be fired out of a cannon at all manner of themed islands, adventuring through their independent story arcs, and eventually reach their lighthouses to connect that back to Shipshape. There’s a good variety here, from jungles and deserts to high-rise city islands, and as you get deeper into the game, there’s often a new twist, whether it’s a high stakes rescue mission, detective investigation, or leaning on a newly learned ability. By and large, you won’t need to return once you’re done, though new paths will open up once the Connectar is flowing, and there’s smaller side missions that you can quickly complete.</p>

<p>All the Concordians you meet have the appearance of a US power socket, thanks to their long tall eyes and flattened faces, and the script and story is charged with a lot of electrical puns. The arch antagonist is revealed to be Zokket and his minions the Extension Corps, as one example. It doesn’t make for the wittiest script, which I found largely washed over me, though there were definitely some chuckles along the way for some of the most off-kilter plot beats. The main spark comes from Snoutlet –&nbsp;who’s definitely not a pig –&nbsp;who lives in Luigi’s hat and takes on the role of communicator and sass-giver that Starlow had in the last few games, though even Snoutlet’s character felt pretty mild to me. The real story is all about the youths of this world stepping up to fill the shoes of their mentors and guardians, in particular with Connie, who treks with you to the key encounters at the Great Lighthouses.</p>

<p>In the hands of original developer AlphaDream, Mario &amp; Luigi was well known for its gameplay gimmicks. Arguably the original concept of playing as both brothers in tandem, with individual jump buttons, was a gimmick in its own right, but then there was the brothers being shrunk down and adventuring within Bowser and with Kaiju-sized battles, or the RPG crossover of Paper Jam that brought Paper Mario into the fold. Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership is a back to basics adventure compared to those games, with the focus all on the brotherly duo battling it out together.</p>
<p>The pair always run together while adventuring in the world, Luigi trailing Mario’s footsteps, and you can still control their individual jumps and hammer slams, though you now generally just need to worry about Mario and Luigi will jump automatically on his own. The main twist to the open world adventuring is the Bros. Moves, which transform the two brothers and enhances their movement abilities. One has them basically turn into a UFO that can hover for a few moments and help reach more distant platforms, another brings back the Bros. Ball from Partners in Time.</p>

<p>Luigi’s got more of a mind of his own, which is pretty key for the Luigi Logic system. This pops up pretty regularly, with the poor fella scrunching up his face and jabbing the side of his head as he tries to figure out a way to help overcome an obstacle, before that Eureka moment hits. It’s invariably helpful, whether it’s locking him to a giant ‘L’ button that he can hammer to trigger things for Mario to navigate past, or key points in boss battles to help trigger a damage phase. He can also run off and smash crates and things for you too.</p>
<p>The duo are more united in battle than ever, as well. The satisfying rhythm of battle is back, with extra timed button presses to amp up an attack as it lands, jumping and hammering to dodge and counter, and more. Mario and Luigi now team up for every attack, so even a basic jump attack will have you use both ‘A’ and ‘B’ buttons, and that leads naturally into the Bros. Attacks with their far more bombastic animations. Initially, they have individual shell attacks –&nbsp;Mario’s directed on a single target, Luigi’s bounced back and forth between a crowd of enemies –&nbsp;but there’s more inventive ones that you eventually unlock.</p>

<p>Amping up your abilities further are Battle Plugs. Each one gives you a particular boost, such as making an ‘Excellent’ rated attack explode and damage nearby enemies, making your counters easier, adding anti-flying damage and more. What’s great is that you can swap these in and out mid-battle without taking an action, and there’s some nice synergies to find, though each one has a limited number of uses before it then needs to recharge for a certain number of combat turns. That will keep you strategising and mixing things up a bit, in addition to the slight variation between whatever gear you’ve given the brothers.</p>
<p>Blocking and countering is key, though, and you’ll have to learn to read all of the different attacks that enemies can unleash. It really keeps you on your toes, so a flying Snaptor might swoop in multiple times and throw rocks, springs and even brothers, which you need to identify and react to in the correct way and with correct timing. It’s easy to get caught out, and makes new encounters and boss battles in particular a real challenge. Thankfully, you’ve got manual saves, autosaves and can always retry any battle immediately if both brothers are KO’d –&nbsp;a second failure will offer you an easy mode. You do also have the ability to flee without consequence from any standard fight.</p>

<p>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership’s jump to Nintendo Switch also comes with a new art style. It’s fully 3D now, but also more cartoon-like, with black outlines to characters and the world. While it has its moments where it can look rather nice – the character animation in particular is pretty good for key moments – I do feel it suffers from lower texture detail and doesn’t hold up quite so well on TV compared to handheld play</p>

						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>The Mario &amp; Luigi franchise has always felt like the younger sibling amongst the various Mario RPG spinoffs. The series doesn’t have the historical significance of a Super Mario RPG and, unlike Paper Mario, always remained restricted to Nintendo’s handheld systems. Most figured that little sibling status would remain forever when longtime Mario &amp; Luigi developer AlphaDream went bankrupt, presumably taking the series with them. Needless to say, it was a bit of a surprise when Nintendo announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-luigi-brothership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>, an all-new, rather-polished-looking console revival of the series.</p>
<p>Does Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership continue the plumber's recent RPG hot streak following well-received remakes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Mario RPG</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>? Or does this new nautical adventure hit an iceberg? Batten down the hatches; it's time to find out.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFmarioandluigibrothership2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership kicks off rather abruptly, with our mustachioed duo being sucked into a vortex and deposited in Concordia, a fractured land whose residents all look like living electrical outlets (this is what comes from concept designers taking inspiration from whatever happens to be around the office). Concordia used to be bound together by the power of the Uni-Tree, but it's withered, causing the land to break into a number of remote islands.</p>
<p>Mario and Luigi soon reunite and cross paths with Connie, a "Wattanist" who tends to the Uni-Tree, and Snoutlet, a very piglike creature (who insists he's<em> not</em> a pig) that acts as your guide. These two recruit our heroes into reconnecting all the scattered islands to Shipshape Island, which is where the Uni-Tree now resides. Ah, but it won't be easy. A mysterious villain known as Zokket aims to stop you as they spread mood-altering "Gholm" throughout Concordia, and, of course, Bowser gets mixed up in everything as well.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFmarioandluigibrothership3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the setup of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership is at least somewhat novel, the game’s plot isn’t exactly captivating, as its villain is as stock as they come and its few twists and turns are telegraphed a nautical mile away. Granted, most of the islands you visit have their own cast of characters, and each of the game’s four acts kind of tell their own self-contained story. For instance, one act revolves around finding out why NPCs from multiple islands are being kidnapped, while another sees our heroes bring together two star-crossed lovers from rival clans. There’s no denying a lot of things happen over the course of Brothership's campaign, they just don’t necessarily add up to a super-compelling whole.</p>
<p>Perhaps most disappointing, the meta, tongue-in-cheek humor of earlier Mario &amp; Luigi titles, which the series helped innovate before the Paper Mario series really ran with it, is largely missing here. With the game taking place in a new world with a largely fresh cast, Brothership just isn't able to poke fun at Mario and Nintendo tropes in quite the same way as its predecessors. Even when recognizable faces like Princess Peach and Bowser show up later in the game, they're presented in a rather bland, by-the-books way. There are still some funny lines here and some cute moments, but don't go in expecting the sharper, lightly satiric tone of the best entries in the Mario &amp; Luigi series.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFmarioandluigibrothership4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully, while Brothership’s writing may lack some personality, its presentation doesn't. The game’s visuals are bright and colorful, with animation delivering a similar level of personality as the handcrafted 2D sprites of earlier entries in the series. There are some small polish issues, with framerate stutters sometimes cropping up as you explore (thankfully, they’re never an issue during combat), but overall, this feels like a top-tier Nintendo product. Probably their biggest and most ambitious of 2024, which isn’t necessarily something I would have expected of a new Mario &amp; Luigi game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFmarioandluigibrothership5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For those new to Mario &amp; Luigi, the core concept hasn’t changed much since the first entry in the series two decades ago. Players control both brothers at once, although unlike some of the series’ past entries, you don’t have to directly control both brothers’ jumps during platforming sequences – you command Mario and Luigi automatically follows along behind you. New this time around is “Luigi Logic,” which sees the green guy occasionally come up with unique solutions to obstacles he and his brother face. Usually, these take the form of a simple quick time event, although sometimes they set in motion a more elaborate gameplay sequence, such as Luigi sneaking around in a barrel to distract guards so Mario can slip by. Luigi Logic is also a factor during some battles, which we’ll get into in a bit, but, for the most part, the mechanic is just a way to give the long-suffering younger Mario Bro a bit of a chance to shine.</p>

<p>More central to the exploration side of Brothership are the returning Bros. Moves, which see Mario and Luigi team up to morph into various handy forms, including a UFO, Metroid-like ball, and more. These work quite well from a gameplay perspective, allowing for a variety of different puzzles and scenarios, even if the mechanic isn’t exactly groundbreaking (although the way Mario and Luigi strut around like they're doing the tango together while in UFO mode is certainly charming).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFmarioandluigibrothership7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Like previous entries in the series, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership combines turn-based combat with quick time sequences that are typically more elaborate and crucial to success than in other Mario RPGs.&nbsp;<span>While the timed button presses are more of a bonus in something like Paper Mario, in Mario &amp; Luigi, doing them correctly is&nbsp;<em>essential</em> to doling out damage and avoiding and countering incoming attacks.</span>&nbsp;This is particularly true when looking to pull off the more elaborate Bros. Attacks.</p>
<p>To this standard core action, Brothership adds Battle Plugs, which are essentially a twist on the Badge system from Paper Mario. A limited number of Battle Plugs can be loaded up at any one time, offering a variety of effects, such as making counters easier, giving you fire or ice elemental attacks, or preventing certain status effects. Each Plug has a limited number of uses, at which point, it has to recharge before being used again. This forces you to frequently swap them out and think strategically, as you may want to preserve certain plugs for specific maps or key boss battles. Speaking of boss battles, Luigi Logic also comes into play during them (the only time Luigi Logic can be used during battle). After whittling down a boss’ life bar enough, Luigi will get one of his brainwaves, allowing him to launch a unique-to-that-boss quick time event or minigame that can leave them stunned and open critical attacks.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFmarioandluigibrothership8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Overall, combat is engaging and timing your attacks just right is satisfying. That said, an issue this series has always had continues here – doing the various quick time events attached to each move eventually gets repetitive and the need to play out all these elaborate animations means combat can become quite drawn out. This is particularly an issue later in Brothership, as the game starts to throw enemies at you in large groups or give them rechargeable shields, turning even regular battles into a bit of a grind. Later boss battles are also real battles of attrition, dragging on for 20 to 30 minutes in some cases. While I quite enjoyed Brothership’s combat for about 80 percent of the game’s campaign, I can’t deny feeling pretty over it by the time I rolled credits.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFmarioandluigibrothership9.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Most Mario &amp; Luigi games have some sort of central gimmick, and as the title implies, Brothership goes the Wind Waker route with a bit of a nautical theme. Shipshape Island is, in fact, a literal ship, which you navigate toward the various islands you have to explore by selecting interconnected currents on a map that looks more like a collection of subway routes than any sort of traditional nautical chart. Once you get close to a new destination, you have to identify it with a spyglass and launch yourself there with a cannon before you sail out of range.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFmarioandluigibrothership10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Shipshape Island actually moves in real-time, with players being able to wander around it and other islands they’ve been to while it's en route to its destination. And you'll have to do that early on, as Shipshape initially moves... very... slowly. This can be a bit of a drag, particularly if you take a wrong turn or you've come to one of the parts of the game where you have a choice of islands to go to and want to survey both first. Again, you can warp to already-visited islands to pass the time, but you have to get back to Shipshape and your cannon once you reach your destination, which I found rather anxiety-inducing as somebody who dislikes both multi-tasking and being late.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the game does eventually give you the ability to greatly increase the speed at which Shipshape moves, making the sailing mechanic much less of a trial. Still, while the sailing mechanic doesn’t really detract from the overall experience, I’m not sure how much it really <em>adds</em>. As far as signature gimmicks go, it's much less compelling than, say, Bowser's Inside Story, which saw Mario &amp; Luigi literally exploring the guts of their nemesis.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/WCCFmarioandluigibrothership11.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the sailing mechanic isn't that groundbreaking in and of itself, it does allow the makers of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership to really get creative with the game’s various floating maps. The game serves up 15 or more islands, most of which are relatively tight and rigidly themed, almost feeling like levels from a 3D Mario platformer. While some of the islands feature fairly standard themes, platforming challenges, and puzzles – there are the expected lava, ice, and jungle maps here – others are much more unique in terms of motif and design. Lottacoins Island is a capitalist’s dream, tasking players with exploring a large office complex while solving some puzzles reminiscent of old-school adventure games, while Bulbfish Island offers a dark noir-ish tone with players having to unravel a mystery, to give just a couple examples. Brothership’s steady flow of creative new level ideas is its strongest feature.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership could have relied on its diverse array of islands to deliver a tight campaign with almost no duplication, the game mixes in just enough backtracking and padding to be somewhat annoying. This is particularly true in Brothership’s final act, where the successful rhythm of the game to that point is interrupted, and a bunch of unnecessary fluff is added just as it feels like you should be in the home stretch. Brothership took me around 35 hours to wrap up, and frankly, I probably would have enjoyed the game more if it had returned to port at the 25 to 30-hour mark instead.</p>

<p>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership brings back one of the plumbers’ more underappreciated series, offering plenty of visual pizazz, an impressive array of inventive maps, and a solid amount of RPG depth. It’s not a perfect relaunch, as Brothership’s writing lacks the snap of the best entries in the series and some unfortunate padding results in a game that arguably overstays its welcome, but overall, those still on board the aging Good Ship Switch ought to find this a charming-enough twilight cruise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24287092/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review-nintendo-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a character that’s been around so long, Mario is in something of a golden period. Since last year his mustache <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review">has been spotted in theaters</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604504/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-super-nintendo-world">theme parks</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch">the best</a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112724/super-mario-bros-wonder-interview-nintendo-switch">and weirdest</a>) side-scrolling <em>Super Mario</em> game in a long time. But he’s had a particularly strong run in role-playing games on the Switch, with recent remakes of both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162364/paper-mario-rpg-nintendo-switch"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a> and the original <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23960646/super-mario-rpg-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario RPG</em></a>. Now we have <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> which keeps the streak alive with a blend of charm, humor, and clever gameplay.</p><p><em>Brothership</em>, once again, starts with the brothers getting whisked away to a fantasy realm in need of help. This time it’s the oceanic world of Concordia, which has been broken apart into a series of islands. The bros end up in a place called Ship Shape Island, a name that’s a bit of a misnomer. While it’s technically an island, it’s also a ship, a floating city like something out of <em>Waterworld</em>. Soon they learn that they need to find the other broken-off pieces of Concordia and literally tether them back to Ship Shape, thus putting the world back together again. Also, for some reason, almost everyone in this world has a power socket for a face.</p><p>It’s weird, but things start out simple enough, as you have to pilot the seas to find each island, and then travel to them by firing yourself out of a cannon. There’s an overarching plot about an important lighthouse, a revered tree, and some evil electrical components, but <em>Brothership</em> has the most personality when you visit each of the disparate islands to solve their particular problems before connecting them.</p><p>What has always separated the Mario RPGs — aside from all of the Nintendo trappings — is their sense of humor. These games are <em>funny</em>. And <em>Brothership</em> is just as goofy as its contemporaries, with communities suffering from chronic hair gel shortages and characters that include a floating pig (who definitely isn’t a pig) and an old turnip who gives terrible advice and makes even worse puns.</p><p>That sense of playfulness extends to the gameplay. <em>Brothership</em> is a turn-based RPG with some light platforming and puzzle-solving. The battles, like the rest of the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> series, are based on timing; you have to hit a button at just the right time to get the most out of an attack. The timing varies whether you’re stomping on a bad guy’s head, smacking them with a hammer, or firing a Koopa shell in their direction, and the brothers can work together on most attacks. This means that, unlike most turn-based RPGs, you aren’t simply selecting actions from a menu. You have to be more involved even for the simpler battles.</p><p>This was all true of past games, and so initially <em>Brothership</em> can feel very familiar. But a few hours in it starts to open up with some clever role-playing features. Most notable is something called “plugs,” which are essentially buffs or actions that you can craft and then equip. These do everything from let the brothers heal automatically without using a turn, to increasing your attacks against flying enemies. There are a bunch, so you can really customize your bros, but the twist is that each plug can only be used a certain number of times before it has to recharge for a while. This forces you to experiment and think about what bonuses you want to use and when.</p><p>The other major new feature is also my favorite: Luigi logic. The idea is that, at key moments in the game, Mario’s brother will use his unique brain to find a solution to a particular problem. This could mean finding a strange way to navigate an obstacle or a weird new attack to down a boss. You don’t have any control over these ideas, but they’re very funny, and go a long way towards building out the goofy vibe that makes these games so charming. For once, Luigi is bumbling in a way that’s actually helpful.</p><div><p>Of course, <em>Brothership</em> is also notable for being potentially the last major Switch exclusive. There are some more remasters on the way, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a>, along with possible cross-generation games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>. But <em>Brothership</em> joins the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112407/princess-peach-showtime-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Princess Peach: Showtime</em></a> in ushering out the Switch in what is sure to be its last year as Nintendo’s main focus (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23921168/nintendo-switch-2-super-mario-wonder-zelda-totk">for real this time</a>). <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo">The wait for the next console has been an odd one</a>, but games like this make it a lot more tolerable.</p></div><p><small>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership <em>launches on November 7th on the Nintendo Switch.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Pokémon TCG Pocket, the new smartphone version of the classic Pokémon trading card game, looks to be off to a strong and lucrative start. 
</p>
<p>
A report into its launch by app store analytics firm AppMagic suggests the game has reached 12m downloads worldwide and earned $12.1m across its first four days, for an average of $3m every 24 hours (thanks, <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-earning-over-3m-per-day-with-over-12m-banked-to-date/">MobileGamer.biz</a>).
</p>
<p>
45 percent of earnings so far come from Pokémon's home turf of Japan, with US the second-largest market, providing 25 percent of the game's app store revenue.

<p>
Using the same metrics, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> is reported to net around $1m per 24 hours - though the game also generates revenue outside of its app via various means, most notably its increasingly-prominent web-based storefront.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon TCG Pocket is heavily engineered around the opening of card packs, though you can also unlock the ability to play a faster-paced version of the traditional Pokémon card game too. 
</p>
<p>
Players get to open up to two card packs per day for free, if you build up enough "Pack Stamina", and can purchase further packs for real-world money. 
</p>
<p>
Further microtransactions exist to reduce the wait for new packs and cards, plus cosmetic options where you can customise your digital card folders, playmats and coins. 
</p>
<p>
"There's one inescapable truth about TCG Pocket though - it is free-to-play, and it wants your money," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-focus-is-on-pack-opening-but-theres-a-promising-version-of-the-card-game-underneath">Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn wrote after playtesting Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>. "It wants your money so badly in fact, you'd think it's been possessed by a Gimmighoul."

<p>Insomniac Games has just revealed the PS5 Pro features for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, and reflections seem to be the main focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jacinda Chew, the Senior Art Director at Insomniac Games, recently <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1853157700408168553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke about</a> how the world of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is filled with reflections, whether it be the windows of the skyscrapers, Spider-Man’s Googles or even large water bodies. However, players cannot experience full fidelity when playing the game in performance mode, creating a “compromise between the creative vision and the technical limitations” of the console.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 on PS5 Pro, Insomniac Games has been working to provide incredible detail with much smoother gameplay, no matter what graphics settings players choose. The PS5 Pro offers higher fidelity, 2-3 times more ray tracing, a custom silicon AI upscale, and anti-aliasing that helps free up the GPU to provide even more quality and detail. </p>



<p>On the PS5 Pro, players will experience the same fidelity of the world and characters featured in the Fidelity mode while swinging through New York City at 60 fps. Bryan Intihar, the Senior Creative Director for Insomniac Games, stated that Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 on the PS5 Pro is the “quintessential version of the Spider-Man experience on the PS5”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Insomniac Game has confirmed that there are “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-additional-story-dlc-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no plans for additional story content</a>” for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. Also, check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC release date</a> for the game.

			<p>Several games, such as Dragon's Dogma 2 and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, sport significant improvements in performance and image quality on the PlayStation 5 Pro, judging from some early footage that started making the rounds.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@The21Master">Gabriel Master</a> started sharing footage of multiple games running on the new console launching worldwide this week, such as The Last of Us Part II Remastered, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Demon's Souls, and others. In some cases, the new console brings significant improvements, such as in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-playstation-5-pro-patch/">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, which runs way better than it does on the base model, and even the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-struggles-1080p-rtx-4070/">Monster Hunter Wilds concluded open beta</a>, which sports what seems like higher internal resolution and more stable performance in performance mode. Even <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-patches-ray-tracing-toggles/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, a game that already looks and runs great on the base model, looks significantly better on the PlayStation 5 Pro, as the new system can run the game at 4K resolution, 60 frames per second, complete with ray tracing.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro also improves PlayStation 4 titles via its Game Boost feature. In Red Dead Redemption 2, for example, the feature seems to slightly increase resolution and lightly improve image quality, as showcased in yet another video by Gabriel Master. Screenshots shared online also confirmed that, in some cases, such as Bloodborne, the image quality improvements involve a sharper image.</p>
