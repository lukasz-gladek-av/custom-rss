<p>Currently confirmed for "PC and Consoles"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><strong>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</strong> was one of the most surprising reveals at this year's The Game Awards, marking a huge return to the RPG series that put Bioware on the map.</p>
<p>The original developer is nowhere to be seen, however, with this new title now in the hands of Arcanaut Studios, founded in July 2025. Its CEO, Casey Hudson, is heading up development for Fate of the Old Republic (FOTOR..?), having previously directed the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_wars_knights_of_the_old_republic">Knights of the Old Republic</a> and the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> trilogy.</p>
<p>This is a pretty big deal, then. It's clear that the new game is early in development given how recent the studio itself was formed, and as such, no specific platforms have been confirmed beyond a rather vague "PC and Consoles". So we have no idea if this thing is heading to the Switch 2 or not, but we reckon it's a little too early to make the call either way.</p>
<p>The trailer itself gives us next to nothing, as you'd expect. It shows what is likely to be the main protagonist landing on a planet with two companions before making her way into a derelict crash site. There, she encounters a mysterious creature and ignites her lightsaber. That's it!</p>
<p>Lots of questions, then. Is this game even considered canon at this point? Our knowledge is a <em>little</em> rusty these days, admittedly, but our understanding is that the canon equivalent of the 'Old Republic' is now the 'High Republic'. All of that 'pre-Disney' stuff is now part of the 'Legends' continuity.</p>
<p>Still, it looks cool, and we'll be keeping a close eye on it in the months (and years) to come.</p>

            <p>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve is releasing in 2026, publisher Bandai Namco has revealed. The game, coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, was announced during last night's The Game Awards.</p>
<p>It's been seven years since Ace Combat 7 (and JPEG dog - if you know, you know), so this next entry is being developed on Unreal Engine 5 for the first time. Bandai Namco is promising an "emotionally charged" campaign, plus multiplayer modes, although firm details won't arrive until next year.</p>
<p>The first trailer for Ace Combat 8 can be viewed below:</p>

<p>In the campaign players will take on the role of an ace pilot (are there any fighter pilots who aren't ace?) in the fictitious Strangereal, with a fairly classic sounding plot that sees you fighting against the odds alongside three new pilots. Will you be able to be able to live up to the hopes of the people of the Federation of Central Usea? I assume yes, as it won't feel very heroic otherwise!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a> released on PS4 and Xbox One back on 18th January, 2019. A PC version arrived two weeks later in February, while a Switch port was released onto Nintendo's hybrid console on 11th July, 2024.</p>

<p>Yes, alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-game-awards-goty-for-2025-is-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Nintendo picking up a couple of awards</a>, there were also a bunch of "World Premieres" and updates for titles we can expect to play on our beloved hybrids at some point down the line.

<p>Below, you'll find a list of every Switch(2)-relevant announcement (and a compilation of titles currently unconfirmed for the console), linking out to our coverage of the full story. So, without further ado, let's get into it.</p>

<p>The following titles weren't graced with a Switch 2 logo at the end of their reveal trailers, but we think there's a pretty good chance of several them coming our way at some point down the line — either because the dev has sent their games to Switch in the past, or because the series has history with Nintendo consoles.</p>
<p>So here are all the games, in alphabetical order, that we're currently sticking on our 'unconfirmed' list, accompanied by coverage from our good friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The morning after The Game Awards, and anyone over here in Europe is likely reaching for the caffeinated drinks right now. There were an amazing batch of announcements, including massive franchise entries like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-casey-hudson/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>, through to exciting indies like Coven of the Chicken Foot. My highlight might be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-galactic-racer-speeds-us-back-to-a-galaxy-far-far-away/">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>, but then, I’m weird. I’ve been playing some great games this week, and that includes Aaero2 which I’ll have a review of next week, and the incredible <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/skate-story-review-the-grind-of-a-lifetime/">Skate Story</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> was first up, and he’s been on an indie game tear, playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/death-howl-review/">Death Howl</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/09/unbeatable-review/">UNBEATABLE</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/11/aethermancer-early-access-review-when-creature-collecting-goes-rogue/">Aethermancer</a> for review. He told us, “I didn’t really gel with Death Howl, unfortunately, despite it having some decent gameplay. UNBEATABLE is fun but the story mode is all over the place. The arcade mode is a much better experience. Aethermancer is shaping up to be a fun roguelike where you capture monsters to fight for you, but lose them at the end of a run. It makes you experiment with different party setups. I’ve also started Star Wars Outlaws, which I think I got as a present last Christmas. I’m still very early in the game but looking forward to exploring every inch of the map.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> stopped up late working on our TGA coverage with Tef, but that didn’t stop him from posting his stellar <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/terminator-2d-no-fate-review/">Terminator 2D: No Fate review</a>, which he definitely enjoyed for its throwback 90s arcade charms. That was the pitch and it absolutely lived up to it.</p>


<p><strong>Ade</strong> was next up, and he’s been playing Wizard of Legend 2 in local coop with Laura. He explains, “Apparently, the game wasn’t too well received back when it was launched but it’s great fun now! Like a multiplayer Hades really.” He also spent time with one of December’s biggest releases, saying, “I’ve also just started Metroid Prime 4 and I can exclusively reveal that it’s good and that I’m not finding Myles MacKenzie nearly as irritating as the internet told me I would. Actually, I shockingly – whisper it – find him quite endearing.”</p>
<p>When <strong>Laura</strong> wasn’t playing Wizard of Legend, she got up to more family making in Jurassic World Evolution 3, saying, “This week a baby T-Rex was born and frankly that’s trumps anything else anyone will tell you today!”</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> told us that, “Megabonk has claimed me” which feels like a cry for help. He continued, “I’ve nearly got every achievement and am trying to beat the high scores of my mates. I’ve also played a little of World of Final Fantasy, as I want to replay it, but not as much as I want to be a skeleton on a skateboard.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has had a fancy hat on and been playing Thief VR for review, while sneaking in a spot of Cyberpunk and Megabonk.</p>
<p>Sadly, <strong>Steve</strong> has only been playing ‘being off work with the flu’ so we all hope that he gets better soon!</p>
<p>Finally, a somewhat sleepy <strong>Tef</strong> has dipped back into Metroid Prime 4, finding all the collectibles but still contemplating a fresh run to do a 100%. Aside from that he dabbled with a bit of Nintendo World Championship NES Edition and Loop Hero.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Drops Sizable Free ‘Thank You’ Update After Sweeping the TGA 2025 Floor; AMD FSR 4 Added]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-drops-sizable-free-thank-you-update-amd-fsr-4/</link>
            <guid>1381579</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 literally swept the floor during last night's The Game Awards 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winning nine out of ten of the prizes it got nominated for</a>, including Game of the Year and Studio of the Year for its developer. It's a massive victory for a relatively small indie team that <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent less than $10 million making this title</a>.</p>



<p>As if gamers couldn't love them enough already, the French developer has now dropped the <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-start-franchise-post-launch-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously teased</a> sizable (and free) new update, version 1.5, which adds new features like <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fidelityfx-sdk-2-0-fsr-4-0-2-now-available-next-gen-neural-rendering-technologies-fsr-redstone-ready-for-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMD FSR 4</a> on PC and even new content, such as Verso's Drafts, a new playable environment that takes the characters of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover. Verso's Drafts is located on the world map right next to Lumière and becomes accessible from Act III. Esquie's underwater ability is required to access the environment.</p>



<p>That's far from the only addition of the so-called 'Thank You' update. New Luminas and weapons have been added; there are new costumes for each member of the Expedition, giving players even more customization options; there are new boss battles for late-game players to overcome in the Endless Tower, variations of iconic bosses from the main game that are designed to be even more challenging.</p>



<p>The "Old Key" quest item has been added to the final area of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. This specific item was previously only obtainable during the game's prologue, so this addition gives players a second chance to collect all journals within a single playthrough. New text and UI game localizations are available in Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19, with more to come, according to Sandfall.</p>

<p>Update 1.5 also introduces the following features: </p>



<ul>
<li>Lumina Sets, which enable players to save up to 50 different Lumina loadouts, allowing them to adapt their fighting tactics at any moment. </li>



<li>An Abandon Battle option in the pause menu is available and it can now be opened in battle.</li>



<li>A Photo Mode is now in the game with plenty of settings and options for players to get creative with while capturing their favourite moments from the game. It's accessible at any time from the pause menu.</li>



<li>A HUD Scale setting has been added to the game so that players may adjust the size of in-game HUD elements from 80% to 120%.</li>



<li>Input remapping is available for controllers.</li>



<li>The game is now officially certified for the Steam Deck and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ROG Xbox Ally</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are, of course, plenty of bug fixes too. You can read the full changelog <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/491585297311596633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Game Awards 2025 has come and gone, and as you might expect, there were a ton of reveals, announcements, and new trailers during last night's ceremony. Here's everything that was shown off during The Game Awards this year!</p><hr><h2><em>The Free Shepherd </em>kicks things off</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>D'awww. Look at the lil' dog.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first trailer we got to see was for a rather cute-looking herding game by the name of <em>The Free Shepherd</em>. It's got <em>Herdling </em>vibes, and it lands on PC and PS5 in 2027.</p><h2><em>Decrepit </em>looks ideal for <em>King's Field </em>fans</h2><p>If you like first-person dungeon crawlers like <em>King's Field</em>, <em>Arx Fatalis</em>, or the <em>Might and Magic </em>games, then <em>Decrepit </em>looks like it'll be for you. This one's coming to PC, and you can sign up for its playtest now.</p><h2><em>Audio Mech </em>is a musical adventure you can play tomorrow</h2><p>Next up, it's a new game from the folks behind <em>Audio Surf</em>, and <em>Audio Mech </em>will let you set any music to the action, including streaming. A demo is coming to Steam tomorrow!</p><h2><em>Pragmata </em>finally has a release date</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>We finally know when <em>Pragmata </em>is coming.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Capcom's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pragmata-thrusts-you-into-strange-new-earth" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dfa99aa5-9c5b-422d-88a1-08160cdee4be" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">weird action-strategy hybrid...thingy</a>, <em>Pragmata</em>, finally has a release date. It's launching on April 24th on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2, and a demo for consoles is available too!</p><h2><em>Solasta 2 </em>brings RPG goodness in March</h2><p>Have you been hankering for some good old-fashioned <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-style dungeoneering? If so, then <em>Solasta 2 </em>is here to whet your appetite. It's launching into Early Access on March 12th.</p><h2><em>Tankrat </em>has...well, lots of tanks</h2><p>Our next reveal brings post-apocalyptic <em>Mad Max </em>vibes along with it. <em>Tankrat </em>is a vehicular combat game that has a strong junkyard aesthetic, and it's coming to PC and PS5 in spring next year.</p><h2><em>Bradley the Badger </em>is an unexpectedly gory platformer</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption><em>Bradley the Badger </em>looks...odd.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'll admit I wasn't expecting <em>Bradley the Badger</em>'s titular mammal to brutally stab one of his enemies through the gut during the debut trailer, but hey, surprises are fun! This ambitious-looking game is coming to PC via Steam.</p><h2><em>Stupid Never Dies </em>looks pleasingly old-school</h2><p>Next up is a hack-and-slash-style action game with a graffiti-inspired aesthetic and plenty of enemies to mow your way through. <em>Stupid Never Dies </em>is what <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-producer-founds-new-studio-at-netease" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="872fe8bd-eb94-4ab0-bdbb-86eb30e948c8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">GPTRACK50</a> has been working on, and it comes to PC and PS5 next year.</p><h2><em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic </em>isn't the <em>KotOR </em>remake</h2>
<p>I know you're waiting on tenterhooks for news of that <em>Knights of the Old Republic </em>remake, but this isn't it. It's a whole new action RPG in the <em>Star Wars </em>universe, and it boasts the involvement of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mark-darrah-and-casey-hudson-leave-bioware" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c7cc9db0-f244-434c-b9b0-07e2c1b3c006" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">ex-BioWare bod Casey Hudson</a>.</p><h2><em>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando </em>has a release date</h2><p>Next, we got to see a snippet of the brutal and heavily 80s-inspired <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6b106e7f-a32b-4f2b-aea8-fe1cd5f39efb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</em></a>, which will be arriving on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on March 12th.</p><h2>Surprise! That statue was for <em>Divinity</em></h2>
<p>Hey, who'd have thunk? That mysterious statue out in the desert was for a new <em>Divinity </em>game by Larian Studios, so it looks like that's the developer's next big focus after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-has-way-over-10-million-players-mod-support-has-been-in-works-since" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6faddb2-01d3-46aa-a769-c7be021e6a4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hugely successful <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p><h2><em>4Loop </em>is a <em>Helldivers</em>-esque co-op shooter</h2><p>Next, it's <em>4Loop</em>, a <em>Helldivers</em>-style co-op shooter in which you and your squad are constantly reprinted (hence the "loop" of the title) to do endless battle with robots. PC and PS5 for this one, but no release date.</p><h2><em>Coven of the Chicken Foot </em>looks whimsically fun</h2><p><em>The Last of Us </em>director Bruce Straley's new game is next, and <em>Coven of the Chicken Foot </em>looks...not a lot like that game, actually. It's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-director-announces-intimate-puzzle-platformer-coven-of-chicken-foot" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e089c2ce-c3ac-4580-a171-b9aee3afdbfd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Last Guardian</em>-style companion puzzler</a> coming at some point in the future.</p><h2><em>Ontos </em>is <em>Amnesia </em>studio Frictional's new game</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>Frictional's next game is the very unsettling-looking <em>Ontos</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Frictional Games has developed a reputation for itself for making genuinely creepy, thought-provoking horror, so let's hope new sci-fi spook-'em-up <em>Ontos </em>continues that legacy. It'll arrive next year.</p><h2>Hey, Leon's in <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>!</h2><p>Another of gaming's worst-kept secrets was revealed next: Leon Kennedy is in <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, and he's playable as well. February for this one, remember?</p><h2><em>Order of the Sinking Star </em>looks suitably mind-bending</h2><p>Here's a puzzler for everyone who's smart enough to handle it (which, if I'm being honest, probably isn't me). <em>Order of the Sinking Star </em>is a reality-bending puzzle game coming sometime next year.</p><h2><em>Exodus </em>looks a little bit <em>Mass Effect</em></h2>
<p>Has <em>Mass Effect </em>left a hole in your life? Are you looking for a new sci-fi space opera to laugh and cry to? <em>Exodus </em>may well be the game for you. It's brought to you by Wizards of the Coast, and it's coming in early 2027.</p><h2><em>Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>has those high fantasy vibes</h2><p>Next, it's...erm, well, we don't really know what <em>Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>is just yet. We will do by summer 2026, though, when a gameplay reveal has been promised.</p><h2><em>Screamer </em>proves once again that driving and storytelling can work</h2><p>I'm honestly extremely glad that narrative racing games appear to be trying to make a comeback, and so is the beautifully-animated <em>Screamer</em>, apparently. March 26th for this one.</p><h2><em>Control Resonant </em>promises another mind-bending story</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>More <em>Control </em>is on the way!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you played the original <em>Control</em>, you'll know it was a wild and at least partly nonsensical (in a good way!) journey, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/control-2-announcement-promises-more-mind-bending-fun" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5caf8cb7-4c43-4da3-a766-14ea52221751" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">long-awaited sequel</a> <em>Control Resonant </em>promises more of the same next year.</p><h2><em>Gang of Dragon </em>looks very <em>Yakuza</em>, which is apropos</h2><p>Next, it's a trailer for <em>Gang of Dragon</em>, the debut game from <em>Yakuza </em>creator <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-creators-team-up-to-create-nagoshi-studios" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5bc54607-2218-4966-b372-9d5bd3fca3c5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Toshihiro Nagoshi's new studio</a>. Unbelievably, it looks a lot like <em>Yakuza</em>-slash-<em>Like a Dragon</em>, although there's sadly no release date.</p><h2><em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight </em>arrives in May</h2><p>The new <em>Lego Batman </em>game, which retells many of the Dark Knight's most iconic stories in Lego form, is arriving on May 29th, and you can pre-order it now. Wahey!</p><h2><em>Tomb Raider Catalyst </em>is the next big <em>Tomb Raider </em>game</h2><p>Cards on the table: I'm not really a pre-rendered game trailer fan. I want to see what the game plays like! That said, that's all we got for <em>Tomb Raider Catalyst</em>, but at least we got to see a new interpretation of Lara Croft. 2027 for this one.</p><h2>Surprise! It's actually two <em>Tomb Raider </em>games</h2>
<p>Crystal Dynamics announced a second <em>Tomb Raider </em>game next in the form of <em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</em>, a remake (yes, another one) of the first game in the series. It looks a bit more modernized this time around, though. 2026!</p><h2>Hey, <em>Forest 3 </em>looks pretty weird</h2><p>Endnight Games is working on a third <em>Forest </em>game, it turns out, and this one's taking...a more science fiction-y direction? It'll probably be a while before we hear from it again, at any rate.</p><h2><em>Orbitals </em>is one for classic anime fans</h2><p>Next up, it's <em>Orbitals</em>, a rather beautiful-looking retro anime-style sci-fi adventure game that also appears to be co-op. It's coming exclusively to the Nintendo Switch 2 next year.</p><h2><em>Diablo 4</em>'s next expansion is <em>Lord of Hatred</em></h2><p>Are you ready for yet more clicking on things to get EVEN BIGGER numbers and colors? <em>Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred </em>sure hopes you are. You can expect this one on April 28th.</p><h2><em>Lords of the Fallen 2 </em>is a Soulslike - who'd have thunk?</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>Oh, look! <em>Lords of the Fallen 2 </em>is a Soulslike!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>CI Games showcased <em>Lords of the Fallen 2 </em>next, and it's got pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Soulslike, to wit: lots of monsters, lots of killing, and, uh, the Pet Shop Boys. 2026 is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-2-2026-epic-exclusive" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a29f068a-b045-498e-a3eb-221278f803c0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">when this one is coming out</a>.</p><h2><em>Saros </em>launches in April</h2><p>Housemarque's next game, <em>Saros</em>, which continues the roguelite action trend of <em>Returnal</em>, is launching on April 30th, the studio announced last night. Get your pre-orders ready!</p><h2><em>No Law </em>has serious <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>vibes</h2><p>At first, I thought <em>No Law </em>would be some kind of <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>expansion, but nope: it's a new game from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-ascent-developer-neon-giant" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6b43493-28f9-4c5a-b90d-f0cb178c2f71" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Krafton and <em>The Ascent</em>'s Neon Giant</a>. You can wishlist it now across platforms!</p><h2><em>Total War: Warhammer 40k </em>is finally happening</h2>
<p>It's a match made in heaven (or perhaps the Warp), and so the existence of <em>Total War: Warhammer 40k </em>probably shouldn't come as a surprise. You can expect it on PC and consoles, although we don't know when.</p><h2><em>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve </em>soars in next year</h2><p>That's right: another <em>Ace Combat </em>game is coming! <em>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve </em>looks to continue the series' signature blend of high drama and, well, high drama when it launches next year.</p><h2><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer </em>has podracing action for you</h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>Time to show off your podracing prowess.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Hey, do you miss the glory days of <em>Star Wars Episode I: Racer</em>? If so, then <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer </em>is the podracing game for you. It's launching next year!</p><h2><em>Out of Words </em>feels a bit <em>Unravel</em>-y</h2><p>Next, it's puzzle-platformer <em>Out of Words</em>, which has a rather lovely (if very <em>Unravel</em>-esque) woolen aesthetic. You'll be able to check this one out next year as well.</p><h2><em>Phantom Blade Zero </em>is action-packed, and it has a release date</h2><p>Action game <em>Phantom Blade Zero </em>was up next, and we've got a release date for this definitely-not-a-Soulslike, too: September 9th on both PC and PlayStation 5.</p><h2>The Blue Bomber returns in <em>Mega Man Dual Override</em></h2>
<p>The good news: Mega Man is returning in a brand new sidescrolling adventure. The bad: we'll have to wait until 2027 to play it. Still, it looks like classic Mega Man, which is great.</p><h2><em>Highguard </em>is a free-to-play fantasy FPS from Respawn</h2><p>If you were hoping for the return of <em>Titanfall </em>during this Game Awards, then sadly, you'll be disappointed. We did get to see a new free-to-play fantasy FPS called <em>Highguard</em>, though, which is launching in January.</p><hr><p>We made it! That's everything that was announced during this year's Game Awards ceremony. Join us around the same time next year for more!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap]]></content:encoded>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
When <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-remastered">Deus Ex Remastered</a> was revealed back in September, it quickly became apparent how Simply Not Great this thing looked. There was way too strong of a "we have to make this thing look new and modern and well lit" vibe to it that did not go down very well with pretty much anyway. It even tried to convince us that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-deus-ex-remastered-i-simply-do-not-believe-you-need-an-rtx-2080-to-run-at-recommended-settings">you'd need an RTX 2080 to run it at the recommended settings</a>! The gall! And here we are, almost three months later, with word that the game has been delayed.
</p>
<p>
Not only has it been delayed, but it's been delayed indefinitely. Yesterday, developer Aspyr shared a statement on Bitter announcing the delay, writing that they've "listened to what you had to say, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> Remastered will no longer launch on February 5, 2026. We look forward to sharing more updates with you when the time comes."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered. We've listened to what you said, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026. <a href="https://t.co/NhalyPLm8q">pic.twitter.com/NhalyPLm8q</a></p>— Aspyr (@AspyrMedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Further than that, anyone that's preordered the game will receive a full refund. The statement doesn't provide any details other than that, nor when Aspyr expect to share any other details about the remaster. 
</p>
<p>
If you were someone desperate to jump back into a slightly flashier version of Deus Ex (but as Mark noted at the time of the remaster's announcement, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex">you can bag the OG for only £6</a>, so I'm not sure why you'd want such a thing), I'd keep your expectations in check for now. Such an overhaul will take quite a while.
</p><p>
It is worth noting that it's not just the graphics that got a new look. There are supposed quality-of-life improvements like autosaves, faster loading, controller support, little things we take for granted now essentially. When the time comes, it might be a nice new way to play the game, but for now, put it at the back of your mind.

<p>No details on how each version of South of Midnight will be tailored to the new platforms has been released, but a <a href="https://x.com/CompulsionGames/status/1999265661600645401">tweet by Compulsion</a> does mention the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, suggesting we might be getting some form of enhancement for Sony's beefed up console.</p>

<p>Cosmic conundrums</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Keplar Interactive and Japanese indie dev Shapefarm have announced that their brand new intergalactic puzzle adventure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/orbitals">Orbitals</a>, is coming exclusively to Switch 2 <em>sometime</em> in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Revealed during <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-game-awards-goty-for-2025-is-clair-obscur-expedition-33">The Game Awards</a>, which we shouldn't hold against it, Orbitals sees two players take on asymmetrical co-op tasks to stop cosmic storms from ruining their space station. Sounds quite tense. Set in a brand-new retro anime galaxy, the game is a debut effort from Shapefarm, and it's been built "from the ground up" for cooperative play, so we're looking forward to being treated to some smart puzzles, thanks.</p>
<p>You and your partner will set about utilising unique space tools, piloting a ship through meteor fields, or even just hanging out to revel in a retro anime vibe that's based off 1970s manga. So that's why the trailer, which you can see up top, looks so very cool.</p>
<p>Indeed, the devs have gone to the trouble of partnering up with Studio Massket, a storied Japanese animation house, to create a fully original anime world complete with hand-crafted cutscenes. Oh, and it's got full English and Japanese dubs (and you can check out the Japanese version of the trailer at the bottom of the page).</p>
<p>It's nice, too, to see a game that's aiming to utilise all the new tech capabilities we've got on Switch 2, with GameShare, GameChat, and all that caper used to further enhance the experience.</p>
<p>Here's some more info and some official screens to further whet your appetite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Orbitals captures the warmth and style of classic Japanese anime, brought to life with authentic detail and clear reverence by the Tokyo-based development team at Shapefarm.</p>
<p>Developed in Unreal Engine 5, Orbitals takes full advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware to deliver an unforgettable co-operative experience regardless of your preferred way of connecting together.</p>
<p>Either by teaming up with two pairs of Joy-Con 2 controllers on a single Nintendo Switch 2 device for split-screen local co-op, using the system’s GameShare feature to share Orbitals with another local player on a compatible Nintendo Switch 2 or Nintendo Switch device, or by matchmaking online with their friends and taking advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2’s built-in microphone and GameChat for crystal-clear communications, players around the world can team up and save the day together as one inseparable team.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>All right, I've definitely got a weakness for Star Wars games which shift the camera away from all the glowy sword fights and space politics, instead zooming in on galactic ne'er-do-wells getting up to mischief. I blame my dad's influence. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> stuck that chord for me, and Star Wars: Galactic Racer looks like it'll combine similar appeal with the trump card of chaotic off-road racing.</p>

<p>Announced during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced-for-pc">last night's Geoffs</a>, Galactic Racer's a speeder speedfest from Fuse Games - a new studio led by ex-Criterion devs with Burnout and Need For Speedy flavour to their CVs. Though, watching its trailer and reading through <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-galactic-racer-reveal-trailer?image_id=star-wars-galactic-racer-reveal-01_d7c67bb8">an interview</a> Fuse co-founder Matt Webster and Lucasfilm Games vice president Douglas Reilly have given to the official Star Wars website, my brain's been taken to a different racing place.</p>
<p>The trailer shows off packs of landspeeders and speederbikes swooping and slamming as they hover through trails that wind through the likes of a ship graveyard on desert world Jakku and the snowy wilds of Ando Prime. It's obviously leaning into the podracing vibes we've seen videogamed in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-episode-1-racer">Star Wars Episode I: Racer</a>, even starring Phantom Menace speedster Sebulba, but in practice, the action sounds like Evolution Studios' old PlayStation mud-fests.</p><p>"We’ve drawn real inspiration from runs-based games so the player will have meaningful, consequential decisions to be making on how they chose their path to become an elite racing pilot — from the vehicle they choose to start with, the upgrade choices they make to create a build that really suits their playstyle and what events they select in determining their path to become champion of the League," Webster said in the interview. "Along the way you’ll compete with rivals, journey to new planets, and master different classes of repulsor craft — or speeders — each with their own distinct capabilities.</p>
<p>"We have a range of racing repulsorcraft for players to discover in the game, each of which have unique handling characteristics to master. Speederbikes, for example, are fast and ferocious, you’ll be braking heavily into corners, really leaning in and then massive drops of acceleration as you power your way through the exit. Also notice that in many of our events, our different speeder classes race at the same time, with exciting physical interactions as those differing racing lines come together."</p>
<p>Given the off-roady courses, that last bit about routes aimed at the different strengths of different craft  diverging and coming back together is the aspect that's put my mind back in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monument-valley">Monument Valley</a>. Obviously, it's not like Galactic Racer's floaty rides will be getting stuck in the mud or splattering through it with chunky tyres, but cutting through narrow chasms in your nimble skim speeder to avoid being side-swiped by a bulkier landspeeder on a more open track definitely is.</p>
<p>All in all, the prospect of battling through the underground racing scene as Shade - "a lone racer with a dream of glory and revenge" - has definitely got my engine running at this point.</p>
<p>If the same applies to you, Star Wars: Galactic Racer's wishlistable on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4078430/STAR_WARS_Galactic_Racer/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>Film adaptations of video games are pretty hot at the moment, with the likes of The Minecraft Movie and The Super Mario Bros. Movie making big money. Next year we're getting a new take on Street Fighter, and now we've got the first look at it in action.</p>

<p>The trailer, which clocks in at under one minute, shows off many of the movie's (and game's) main characters, including Guile (wrestler Cody Rhodes), M. Bison (David Dastmalchian), and Akuma (wrestler Roman Reigns). If you know what you're looking for you can see Guile's flash kick and the classic car smashing bonus stage from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-2">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>

<p>Neat, right? What's even neater is the car carrying the same IC29 licence plate from the game.</p>
<p>Street Fighter is releasing in cinemas on 16th October, 2026. The latest game in the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, released back in June 2023 on PS4, PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S, and was followed by a release on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> for the console's launch in June this year.</p>
<p>What do you make of the trailer, and did you spot any more moves from the games? Surely it's got to be better than the Jean-Claude Van Damme-starring adapation from 1994.</p>

<p>Launching 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> might want to pay attention, because another co-op adventure is heading to the Switch 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/out-of-words">Out Of Words</a> launches in <strong>2026</strong> and is a stop motion co-op adventure from developers Kong Orange, Wired Fly, and Morten Søndergaard, with publishing duties from Epic Games. You'll explore the "wild, colorful realm of Vokabulantis" as Kurt and Karla, two mouthless individuals who must work together to overcome the odds.</p>
<p>The game got its public debut at Summer Game Fest in 2025 and received plenty of critical acclaim from those who went hands-on with the demo. It's lovely, then, that it's now been confirmed for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Find your lost voices in a co-op platformer adventure. Together with a friend, via online cross-platform or couch co-op, explore the wild, colorful realm of Vokabulantis as Kurt and Karla in a story about the first time they held hands — where everything you see is crafted by hand."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Game Awards also confirmed the existence of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man: Dual Override</a> for the Switch 2 (with the latter also heading for the original Switch ).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Highguard is a new PvP raid shooter from the creators of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=apex+legends"> Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/?s=Titanfall">Titanfall</a> which mixes guns with magic, plus some light horseback riding.&nbsp; You play as a Warden who must fight for the Shieldbreaker, which in turn lets you smash into the enemy base.</p>
<p><iframe title="Highguard - Official Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rh6Pi6h_css?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The rest of the game is being kept under wraps but we can see from the trailer it looks good, and while the hero character designs are impressive they do seem to fall in to the usual stereotypes. Maybe one day we will get a hulking, growly, muscle brute who’s actually a wizard with long-range attacks rather than a rage-filled, close combat animal.</p>
<p>The trailer also shows some of the abilities the heroes have and they are suitably splashy and spectacular and remind me of the Supers found in Destiny 2. In fact some of them seem very similar, the animations are very close, but I guess there’s only a finite number of ways you can wave your hands around to cast a spell.</p>
<p>There’s some horseback riding, but you can also ride a bear (don’t get any ideas), or a panther. Also in the mix is what appears to be medieval take on the Thundertank from Thundercats. The only thing that made me wince whilst watching the Highguard trailer was the blonde character shouting “Bring the heat”,&nbsp; that phrase has been used so many times in video games it is cheesy as hell.</p>

<p>The game is free-to-play which should give a decent start but the world of F2P shooters is already packed with the likes of RedSec, Fortnite, Overwatch 2, and COD Warzone and we have seen many games try and break in to that market and fail</p>
<p>Highguard will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on January 26th, 2026, will you be singing up to play?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ace-combat-8-wings-of-theve-announced-2026-launch-multiplayer-modes/</link>
            <guid>1381546</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bandai Namco Aces has announced ACE COMBAT 8: WINGS OF THEVE <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during The Game Awards 2025</a>. About a year and a half ago, an actor's resume <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-ace-combat-8-squadron-42-and-gearboxs-next-game-all-target-2025-launch-according-to-actors-resume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'leaked' its existence</a>, suggesting a 2025 launch, but the game will instead be released next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. Still, we don't suppose many fans of this franchise will complain. This is the first mainline installment in seven years, after all.</p>



<p>As you'd expect, the press release claims it will take the IP to new heights. Harnessing the power of Unreal Engine 5 in addition to proprietary technology, the studio promised players a visually stunning, ultra-realistic aerial thrill ride. It will feature an immersive campaign mode that places players in the role of an ace pilot, embroiled in an emotional tale of identity and duty as they fight for the survival of their homeland. ACE COMBAT 8: WINGS OF THEVE will also feature multiplayer modes that thrust players into high-speed aerial dogfights against friends and foes.</p>

<iframe title="ACE COMBAT 8: WINGS OF THEVE Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKIE3ClcDyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The press release notes that the new game continues the legacy of the ACE COMBAT franchise, which has consistently pushed the boundaries of game visuals and action-packed, arcade-inspired gameplay in the flight shooting genre. Players will fly various real-world fighter jets from around the globe in a game characterised by stunning visual detail and effects. They will navigate realistic expanses of clouds, finely rendered terrain and landscapes, and inclement weather. Bandai Namco Aces also teased thrilling cinematics and the option to view them from a first-person perspective, which could potentially enhance the immersion of the story.</p>



<p>The announcement trailer provides a first glimpse of the game's in-depth Campaign Mode, in which players take on the role of an ace pilot in Strangereal, a fictitious war-torn world. The weight of decisions, the pressure of command, and the bonds forged in battle will feel very real. With their nation, the Federation of Central Usea (FCU), occupied and its navy destroyed, players take on the role of the 'Wings of Theve' – a legendary ace whose name is synonymous with Theve, the capital of the FCU, and who is a symbol of hope for every citizen in their homeland. Joined by three new fighter pilots, they embark on a mission to reclaim their homeland and eliminate the threat to their people, carrying the hope of every FCU citizen and taking on the name of their capital city.</p>

			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>, publisher KOEI TECMO and developer Team NINJA announced that a new demo of their upcoming dark samurai action RPG, Nioh 3, will be released on January 29, 2026 on PlayStation 5 and PC (via Steam). The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-visual-performance-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous demo</a>, as you might recall, was only available for PS5. Players will be able to sharpen their blades in the new demo in solo mode or in online multiplayer mode with up to three other players. Cross-play is not supported for online multiplayer, according to the press release, and this limitation applies not only to the demo but also to the full game. After completing the demo, fans will be able to carry over their save data to the final game.</p>



<p>Pre-orders are now open. The Standard Edition is priced at $79.99, while the Digital Deluxe Edition costs $119.99. This version includes the Season Pass (also available for separate purchase), as well as the following items: </p>



<ul>
<li>Nioh 3 season pass bonus "Chijiko Netsuke Charm" (accessory)</li>



<li>Infernal Weapons Set (14 types)</li>



<li>Kodama Netsuke Charm (accessory)</li>
</ul>



<p>The season pass is a set including add-on DLCs. The DLCs include new stories, enemies, yokai, boss characters, and equipment. The aforementioned season pass bonus items will be released on the same date as the base game. Add-on DLC 1 is set to become available by the end of September 2026, and add-on DLC 2 is set to become available by the end of February 2027.</p>



<p>A SteelBook edition is also available to pre-order and includes the base game and two exclusive DLC bonuses. Players can also pre-order a special PlayStation 5 physical edition exclusively through the <a href="https://store.nisamerica.com/products/nioh-3-treasure-box" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NIS America Store</a>. The Nioh 3 TREASURE BOX includes the base game, a Scampuss Furball Netsuke Charm Keychain, a Nioh 3 Original Desk Pad, the Official Artbook, and a Nioh 3 Selection Soundtrack CD.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Additionally, new exclusive bonuses for players who purchase the game early have been revealed. These players will receive bonus armour sets inspired by protagonists from previous titles: the “Youngblood Armour (Samurai)”, worn by William in Nioh, and the “Lone Wolf’s Armour (Ninja)”, worn by Hide in Nioh 2. These items can be obtained by redeeming the “Hellfrost Armour Set” early purchase bonus in the game. Lastly, a special discount is available on the Steam version of Nioh: Complete Edition, which offers players a 90% discount on the first title in the franchise.</p>



<p>Nioh 3 launches on February 6, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and PC. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Wccftech's Francesco De Meo</a>, who recently played the game at a preview event, it feels like the culmination of every previous Team NINJA title. The developers also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-dev-made-sure-there-wont-be-sudden-difficulty-spikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assured fans that the game won't feature sudden difficulty spikes</a>.</p>

            <p>
The future is here! Or, I guess it's around 40,000 years away, but that's still more or less here for the Total War series, which'll be tackling a futuristic setting for the first time in last night's reveal of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-is-real-and-features-orks-space-marines-the-aeldari-and-for-some-reason-david-harbour">Warhammer 40,000 spin-off reveal</a>. It's got most of what you'd expect, like those mean ole Space Marines, and big, dramatic, explosive battles with so much going on on screen you'll get a hernia. But there were a few details shared in a post-reveal blog post that go into some small bits that weren't a part of the big reveal.
</p>
<p>
Right at the bottom of said <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/total-war-warhammer-40000">blog post</a> is an FAQ, with the first notable question there being "where are the Chaos Space Marines?" As it stands, the only revealed factions so far are the regular Space Marines, Orks, Aeldari, and Astra Militarum. In response to that question, Creative Assembly explained that the Chaos Space Marines won't be there at launch, but they'll "absolutely" be a part of their plans "at some point, along with all the other iconic factions from the setting."
</p>
<p>
Then there's the question of modding. From right off the bat, the team wants to support modding on the Steam Workshop from launch, but it's the official modding tools you'll have to wait a while longer for. This is down to Creative Assembly's new Warcore engine, and they note that they'll have more details to share on that "close to launch." Oh, and don't worry, there won't be any blood DLC because the "41st Millennium is a setting of eternal war, so blood and dismemberment is key to creating an authentic experience."
</p>
<p>
The blog post also makes mention of a "small roundtable with members of the development team" coming next week on December 16th. Important to note that you shouldn't expect a big look at gameplay, it sounds like more of a light chat about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game. A full look at its story and gameplay will apparently come in spring, so hang tight for now.

		<p>I know I really like Ace Combat, but in the world of gaming storylines, I couldn’t tell you one little detail about the somewhat crazy geo-political shenanigans that the series is known for. Still, we can all hope that the story becomes a touch more affecting with the announcement of the latest entry, Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve, with its Top Gun-inspired aerial combat due for release at some point in 2026 and coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="ACE COMBAT 8: WINGS OF THEVE Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKIE3ClcDyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from Project Aces and Bandai Namco, Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve is a direct sequel to Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown which released all the way back in 2019. This time out, you’re a fighter pilot, adrift at sea in a rescue boat until the outdated aircraft carrier, Endurance, pulls you aboard. The ageing vessel, its decks crowded with refugees, has already retreated far from the front lines.</p>
<p>On this ship, you’re given a new name: “Wings of Theve”. A legendary ace, a symbol of hope, a name tied to Theve, the FCU capital. But, as it turns out, that legend was a lie; it was just a story made to keep morale alive. Now, you must carry that name and take to the skies with three new comrades at your side, fighting to reclaim your lost homeland.</p>
<p>Ace Combat 7 earned a hefty <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/18/ace-combat-7-review/">9/10</a> when it launched, where I said, “In Ace Combat 7, dogfighting games have a new Top Gun. The VR sadly turned my stomach, but the series’ trademark action is bigger and better than ever, with the spectacular weather effects introducing a level of realism and drama that will win over any wannabe Mavericks.”</p>

<p>I definitely can’t wait to check out some more aerial combat, and I’ll certainly try to remember more of the story this time out, with the new first-person cutscenes looking like they’ll put you right at the centre of the action.</p>
<p><em>You can already wishlist Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2288340/ACE_COMBAT_8_WINGS_OF_THEVE/">Steam</a>.</em></p>

			<p>As <a href="https://x.com/NeonGiantGames/status/1995417593407050185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> in the past few days, Swedish developer Neon Giant, known for 2021's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-ascent-qa-neon-giant-shares-info-on-game-length-crossplay-and-the-games-living-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ascent</a>, has revealed a new game called NO LAW during <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>. While The Ascent was an isometric twin-stick shooter, though, this upcoming game is a first-person open world shooter roleplaying game that, at least on the surface, is highly reminiscent of CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>In NO LAW, players take on the role of Grey Harker, a former soldier who has left his war-torn past behind in favour of a quiet life tending to his plants, until trouble finds him again. When his peace is shattered by violence, Harker must rely on his black-ops instincts and customised equipment to reclaim what was stolen and confront the city that wronged him.</p>



<p>Set against the backdrop of the sprawling port city of Port Desire, carved into the cliffs above a restless sea, the game invites players to explore a neon-sleazy world where regulation is absent. This vibrant metropolis is a hub of import and excess, teeming with colourful characters whose motives are as murky as the smog-filled skyline. Every inch of Port Desire, from the rooftop gardens to the alleys below, is alive and reactive, waiting to be shaped by the player's choices.</p>



<p>Every decision carries weight, according to Neon Giant. Should you help a friend in need or silence an enemy permanently? Should you take the tactical route through the shadows or unleash chaos in open combat? Even in a city without laws, actions have consequences. Each playthrough promises new possibilities, allies and outcomes, making NO LAW an immersive shooter that is as much defined by its story and morality as by its firepower.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, NO LAW blends visceral first-person combat with deep player agency. Whether the player favours precision, stealth or destruction, their approach will define the in-game experience. Players can master advanced military upgrades, experiment with sci-fi tools and vertical movement, and transform every mission into their own tale of revenge, consequence and survival.</p>



<p>Claës af Burén, Managing Director at Neon Giant, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>NO LAW represents the next step for us as a studio. With The Ascent, we built a strong foundation for how we approach worldbuilding, systems, and storytelling. This new project takes everything we’ve learned and applies it to a completely different kind of experience — one that’s bigger, more reactive, and more personal than anything we’ve done before.</em></p>



<p>The game, which will be published by Krafton (the Korean studio acquired Neon Giant in 2022), is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. It can be wishlisted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2161710/NO_LAW/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, where we found the recommended system requirements.

When the game's director, Guillaume Broche took the stage, he thanked <a data-target="true" href="https://www.gamespot.com/">a number of individuals</a>, but he ended his speech by giving a very special thank you to us, the players, not with a speech, but with a rather sizable update for the game that dropped the second he walked on stage to accept the award.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WPmS4eSknc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6WPmS4eSknc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Dubbed "The Thank You Update", this is no mere costume/weapon set, though there's over a dozen each of those to go find too.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/terminator-2d-no-fate</link>
            <guid>1381489</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161075/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Are you old enough to remember being a kid and seeing a NES, Super Nintendo, or Mega Drive game of a licensed movie, and having your imagination run wild as to all the playable scenarios potentially contained within? If the answer is 'yes', then you’re equally likely to remember the actual experience typically being rushed, poorly coded junk that barely resembled the material upon which it was based.</p>
<p>But, in an alternate timeline, UK developers Mike Tucker and Matthew Cope would grow up to form a future resistance in 2016 under the moniker Bitmap Bureau (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xeno_crisis">Xeno Crisis</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_vendetta">Final Vendetta</a>). Their mission: return to the early '90s to create the 16-bit movie licensed game kids always dreamed of, before travelling back to 2025 to correct the past and save the world. Confused? Wait until you find out who the dad is.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">Terminator 2D: NO FATE</a> <em>is</em> that game: prophesied to say "hasta la vista" to the memory of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=company%3Aljn">LJN</a> and its Skynet-like destruction of movie licenses. It recreates Cameron's action spectacular right down to the tiniest of details, forging it into the 2D gaming adventure it was destined to be.</p>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161073/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What I value about Bitmap Bureau is that it always aims squarely for the Super Nintendo and Mega Drive game that never was. Terminator 2D’s entire design feels born out of an alternate timeline, like a genuine 16-bit companion to the movie’s 1991 release.</p>
<p>There are two starting modes and several locked bonuses, including a Boss Rush and an Infinite Mode. Story Mode is stuffed with cutscenes taken from the movie's sequences, with text outlining the narrative. It’s also a longer game, in that it’s bookended with stages that occur before and after the events of the movie, having Sarah Connor first retrieve a kidnapped John from a Mexican cartel, before breaking into Cyberdyne Research. This actually alludes to what John Connor tells his friend early in the film: that his mother was arrested trying to recover something she believes to be hidden within Cyberdyne's lab.</p>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161079/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>From there, you leap to the future war, playing adult John as he faces off against the machines, and the epilogue ensures there’s a climactic finale beyond Arnie's 'thumbs-up' farewell. As Bitmap Bureau isn’t restricted to following the movie’s blueprint in these original stages, they're actually some of the best: freer in design, more creatively bold, and teeming with colossal machine bosses.</p>
<p>In Story Mode you only have one life and four continues, but can greatly increase their stock by finding special icons throughout the campaign. With a generous life bar and liberally distributed health icons, it’s surprisingly easy on defaults — especially so when compared to Bitmap Bureau's infamously brutal Xeno Crisis. Seasoned gamers will likely finish it in just a few attempts, but tweaking the difficulty up from "No Problemo" to "Hasta La Vista" adds in additional enemies, rearranges some objects, and makes the time limit more pressing.</p>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161076/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finishing Story Mode once opens up new paths with new stages and characters to play, triggered at choice-based junctures. Will you off Miles Dyson in front of his family? Or will you install Arnie’s skull chip and finally get your hands on that Minigun? It’s an idea that greatly improves replay value, especially since the alternate routes are altogether awesome, and it takes the total number of stages to at least 16, as far as we can gather.</p>
<p>Arcade Mode, while equally soft enough to beat, requires you do so on one life and no continues. It’s also shorter, cutting out the precursor stages and cutscenes to focus only on the movie-related parts, making for a brisk, exciting experience. And, if you’re struggling to nail a particular stage, there’s a Practice Mode to help out.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is superb, blending those classic Terminator musical motifs into all-new mixes, and graphically it’s very impressive. The capturing of the movie’s characteristics is applause-worthy: fans will be grinning ear to ear and end to end as it works through every set-piece and minute detail in grand 2D style. The recreation of even the smallest of particulars is superb, from that burning tyre that rolls out of the post-aqueduct explosion, to the T-1000 getting Hasta La Vista’d into liquid nitrogen chunks. It’s all so thoughtfully reproduced, there must be an award in here somewhere for movie-license accuracy.</p>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161077/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The sprite work, though, is a touch stilted in places. Most enemies look fine, collapsing to the ground fluidly when shot, but the human-sized guard dogs are just strange. Sarah Connor can’t bend her knees much and her gait appears stiff. And, while the giant, towering future war Hunter Killer machines and gunships look fantastic, we would have liked the emblematic T-800 endoskeletons to have had a little more presence and threat. It’s a mixed bag that mostly ranges from sufficient to great, and it’s a minor criticism in a game where tight controls gloss over any aesthetic dips. It’s just surprising that, with an art team capable of feats like animating the T-1000’s entire lava-death transformation, some of the sprites appear, well, slightly robotic.</p>
<p>Stages are piece by piece constructed from the movie’s sequences, and it’s all action all the way. There’s no faffing about collecting coloured keycards here: it’s all gunning, lobbing grenades, barging, punching and driving. Much of the game plays like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/contra">Contra</a>, with 8-way directional fire and a useful slide attack, but different characters have different moves depending on the scenario.</p>
<p>When Sarah is breaking out of prison (one of the more difficult stages in the game), she only has bare feet, a nightstick, and a lock-picking mechanic; but when she goes militaristic, planting bombs in Cyberdyne’s HQ, she can wield certain enemies as human shields and slide kick falling debris into encroaching assailants. In the famous “Your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle” sequence, you play naked Arnie in a simplistic beat-'em-up-inspired stage, roughing up bikers to the film’s actual background music (make sure you destroy that Jukebox!). Elsewhere, you race down the aqueduct as John, before switching to a shotgun-strapped Schwarzenegger to shoot out chain-link fences.</p>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161074/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So much from the movie is present, in fact, I only lamented not getting to evade the T-1000 through a giant '90s arcade centre. Well, that and the fact Schwarzenegger's likeness couldn't be acquired for the game (but there are some clever workarounds).</p>
<p>In an odd way, Terminator 2D is so thorough in tracing the movie’s sequences that it almost doesn’t feel like a game in the traditional sense. Every stage is different, piecemeal, with clever gameplay implementations that make each feel unique — but it’s extraordinarily linear on the whole. Most stages take less than three minutes to beat, and go by in a flash once you know the layout. There is the odd hidden item to find just off the beaten path, and whether taking cover behind walls to avoid a laser barrage or triggering traps to catch the T-1000 in machine assemblies, it’s plenty of fun to learn.</p>
<figure><a title="Terminator 2D: NO FATE Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161078/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, it’s more a series of endearing movie vignettes than a full-blown game in the traditional sense. By sticking to the source material so exactingly, it limits itself in scale, more akin to a compilation of arcade-like bonus games than a series of fully-articulated stages.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Interestingly, half of what makes Terminator 2D fun is its painstaking reproduction of the movie on which it’s based. Were it to have no relationship to a beloved IP, it would likely be criticised for its brevity, linearity, and general simplicity. Once fully beaten, you won’t likely return to it for anything except a nostalgia hit, but T2 fans and 16-bit diehards will feel well-served by its detailed reminiscence.</p>
<p>A great deal of the game's charm is derived from its novelty factor, and it's that novelty, in conjunction with some clever ideas and impressive authenticity, that should inform your purchasing decision.</p></section>

Star Wars Episode I: Racer – which appeared on a bunch of great consoles like the Sega Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 – was centred on the hyper-fast pod racing scene that George Lucas made a highlight of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, and, somewhat unbelievably, remains the highest-selling sci-fi racing game of all time. Ahead of Wipeout and F-Zero! It makes sense then that we would eventually see a new game set in a galaxy far, far away, and it’s called Star Wars: Galactic Racer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars: Galactic Racer™ - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RiavNl4qxWY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set after the fall of the Empire, the trailer shows a variety of different Star Wars vehicles racing across places like Rey’s home of Jakku and what looks like the ice planet Hoth, with vehicles including speeders and speeder bikes. There are things that look like Luke’s X34 Landspeeder and the iconic Endor Speeder Bike, but I’m sure the red-and-black vehicle is a Sparrow from Destiny. That would make sense after the recent Renegades expansion took Star Wars into the Destiny universe, and Sparrows were ultimately based on Star Wars’ own vehicles in the first place. </p>
<p>At the end of the trailer there’s a reveal for anyone who knows Star Wars, with the Dug, Sebulba, appearing while stroking his beard fronds, and the iconic sound of a pod racer engine rumbling in the background, so you have to assume that pod racing is included, or at least some of the vehicles. Sebulba was famously Anakin’s key rival in The Phantom Menace’s race scenes, where the arrogant alien sabotaged Anakin’s pod racer, before proceeding to ram all the other racers off the track. Here’s hoping you’ll be able to return the favour in Star Wars: Galactic Racer!</p>
<p>Star Wars: Galactic Racer is due for release in 2026. </p>

			<p>“The guiding principle of Terminator 2D: No Fate’s development was always to make it feel like the kind of arcade game that could’ve come out in the 90’s alongside the release of Terminator 2: Judgement Day,” say the developers, Bitmap Bureau, and it’s fair to say that is exactly what they have made. I am old enough to have been gaming in the 90s and Terminator 2D: No Fate reminds me of the excellent RoboCop 2 game that was released on the Commodore Amiga.</p>
<p><iframe title="Terminator™ 2D: NO FATE – Official Launch Trailer (PS5®, PS4®, Nintendo Switch™, Xbox &amp; PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yPzOPAJpYDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story follows the plot of Terminator 2 fairly closely, with a few extra missions set in the future. All the key scenes from the film are brought to life in chunky pixel graphics with even chunkier pixel text explaining the plot before you set off on your rampage of violence.</p>


<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate is a side scrolling shoot ’em up in which you play one of the famous characters from the game and run around shooting bad guys until you reach the boss and finish the level. You can only fire in eight directions, starting with your basic pistol or automatic rifle, with bonus weapons such as spread fire lasers hidden throughout the levels. These pick-up weapons only last for a limited amount of time rather than a number of bullets – in true action movie style, those are infinite. Shotgun, pistol, or laser cannon; it doesn’t matter what you use, the weapon never needs reloading.</p>


<p>To mix things up a little, there are two driving sections, both based on the chase sequence from the film where the T-1000 has a truck, and Arnie is on his bike. You also get to play as a completely naked Arnold – his nether regions naturally being pixellated to hide anything saucy – in a beat ’em up sequence set in the Biker bar.</p>
<p>There are four difficulty levels and the harder you make the game the more enemies you get, the less health you have, and other additional factors are added such as time limits and limited continues. The developers suggest playing the game on Hard and that does give you a true arcade experience. By that, I mean you will be cursing a lot, and gradually working your way through each level over many, many attempts, as you learn the positioning and patterns of the enemies and commit them to muscle memory; 90s games were as much a test of your memory as of your joystick skills.</p>

<p>While the game does use the 90s aesthetic there are a few modern improvements. Most notable is just how slick the animation is, which has many more frames than you would have got back in the day when one megabyte was considered a lot of memory. The music is also rather epic with a couple of licensed songs that play out under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>The big question is, does this retro gameplay work in the modern day? For me it absolutely did, I found myself playing just like I did in 90s, learning the enemy patterns and firing in their direction before they even appear. Terminator 2D: No Fate is a challenge on the harder levels, but deaths rarely feel cheap and it does have that much needed “one more go factor” that will have you playing in to the small hours. That said there is one level where you are chased through entire level by the T-1000 and if you miss-time opening a door or take a misstep then you will get speared through the eye with a metal spike. It verges on being frustrating but does feel like an achievement when you finally make it through.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/total-war-warhammer-40000-announced-total-war-40k-ps5-xbox-pc/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Creative Assembly has announced Total War: Warhammer 40,000, leaping from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/14/total-war-warhammer-3-review/">Warhammer Fantasy</a> setting to the grimdark future and galactic warfare.</p>
<p>A release date has not been given, but the game is in development for PC as well as PS5 and Xbox Series X|S – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/total-war-medieval-iii-announced-at-series-25th-anniversary-total-war-engine-gets-ready-for-console-gaming/">as was teased at the 25th anniversary stream</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total War: WARHAMMER 40,000 - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KVgCDqLTaJk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As the brief snippets of gameplay hint at, Total War: Warhammer 40,000 will actually look to adapt the war for the galaxy and planets as opposed to settlements and cities – a more thematic, but no less significant change for the feel of the game.</p>
<p>You’ll still have the same empire expansion gameplay here, capturing planets, upgrading your fleet and having a war economy to feed further growth. Sieges become orbital bombardments, assaulting the walls of the castle becomes sending in the drop pods and landing and army. And if you need to, there’s always planet-killing weapons.</p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Four factions will be playable to start with – Space Marines, Orks, Eldar and the Astra Militarum (AKA the Imperial Guard) – and you’ll have the ability to customise your troops, choosing colours, emblazening uniforms and armour with particular iconography and also affecting their gameplay style. Change a combat philogophy, arm them with tactical abilities, signature traits and arcane wargear.</span></p>
<p>Game director Attila Mohacsi said</p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">“Hi everyone!</span></em></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">I can’t tell you how incredible it feels to finally share this with you: Total War is heading into the Warhammer 40,000 universe! For so many of us on the team, this isn’t just another project. It’s a dream come true. We spent years imagining what Total War could look like in the grim darkness of the far future, and now we’re in the process of making it a reality.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">A lot of us are lifelong Warhammer 40,000 fans, so this is personal. We want to do justice to the scale, the drama and the sheer intensity of this universe while staying true to what makes Total War special. It’s the start of a brand-new chapter for the franchise, and we couldn’t be more excited to go on this galactic journey with you.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span lang="EN-US">We’ll have more to share, and we can’t wait to hear what you think.”</span></em></p>
<p>So… whaddya think? For more details, the studio will be hosting a round table discussion for broad strokes about this game’s development and direction.</p>
<p>Creative Assembly are going to be busy with developing Total War 40K as well as Total War: Medieval 3 (as was announced last week) and building their game engine to better handle consoles.</p>

<p>The Janitor’s Ending is the second escape route in Dig To Escape. Instead of digging forever to escape your cell, you can simply buy the Keycard and escape through the janitor’s room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This method is not only faster but also demands stealth in the second part of the escape, where you must collect Batteries. Players must also save a staggering 200 Toilet Paper to purchase the Illegal Keycard in the first place. You are advised to dig and even out the surface rectangularly instead of digging a hole straight down. This way, you’ll clear the entire layer and scavenge all available items using your basic spoon Shovel. This guide will explain more about the Janitor’s Ending, important tips, and the late-game scenario.</p>

<h3 id="h-what-you-need-to-know-before-going-for-the-janitor-s-ending-in-dig-to-escape">What You Need To Know Before Going For The Janitor’s Ending In Dig To Escape</h3>



<ul>
<li>Your primary objective is to save 200 Toilet Paper, the amount required to purchase the Illegal Keycard.</li>



<li>When digging, clear the ground in a rectangular pattern rather than digging straight down. This method helps you find a lot more items, then sell them to earn a minimum of 20–30 Toilet Paper per day.</li>



<li>Trade only for energy-based items (food), as maintaining your digging stamina is essential for quick progression in Dig To Escape.</li>



<li>With consistent digging, eating, and selling, you should be able to save 200 Toilet Paper within roughly 10 in-game days.</li>



<li>Avoid spending Toilet Paper on Energy Surge upgrades, extra Storage, or new Shovels, these are unnecessary for completing this specific escape route.</li>



<li>Do not trespass at night to trade or sell items. The guard patrols aggressively and may easily catch you. Instead, take advantage of the vent system, slip out during the “Afternoon” hour, and use the vent in the main hallway, which gives you access to four nearby cells.</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Keycard Scanner in Dig To Escape | Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li>The vent inside your own cell leads to the prison restroom. From there, you can reach both the Janitor’s Room and the adjacent Security Room.</li>



<li>One of the four NPC prisoners will eventually offer the Illegal Keycard for sale. On Hard difficulty, expect the Keycard to appear only after 15–17 days of trading cycles.</li>



<li>Once you’ve saved the required 200 Toilet Paper, purchase the Illegal Keycard.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-what-to-do-after-getting-the-illegal-keycard-in-dig-to-escape">What To Do After Getting The Illegal Keycard In Dig To Escape</h3>



<ol>
<li>Wait until morning before making your escape via the Janitor’s room. Escaping at night is risky because the Dig To Escape guard patrols the hall, and getting caught ends the run.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Equip the Keycard, walk up to the lock, and scan it using the interact button.</li>



<li>Grab the ladder, equip it, and carry it over to the Janitor’s room.</li>



<li>Place the ladder right under the vent.</li>



<li>Open the vent, climb the ladder, and crawl inside.</li>



<li>Your prisoner will end up in a small room with a small switchboard, while a guard patrols the hall outside with a flashlight.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-how-to-find-the-12-batteries-in-dig-to-escape">How To Find The 12 Batteries In Dig To Escape?</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Batteries location in Dig To Escape | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You need to be careful and precise with your movement. The guard in this <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-midnight-chasers-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game has unorthodox pathing and can easily ruin your escape if you’re not alert. You must collect 12 Batteries and place them inside the switchboard to restore power and escape. The Batteries don’t have fixed spots, they spawn in random places throughout the hall and the rooms connected to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the rooms needs the Keycard, so be ready to equip it and scan the door immediately. Don’t waste time on interactions here because the guard is very fast. Preplan your route first, then act. There’s also a cheeky trick where you can insert Batteries through the wall by standing in the room next to the switchboard. This bug saves you from entering the actual switchboard room.</p>







<p>Batteries usually spawn in a few common spots: the second room on the middle table near the monitor, on the circular table at the end of the hall, along the cabin path, and inside the room you open with the Keycard. Just move safely, stay patient, and gather all 12 Batteries to restore power.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-to-do-after-finding-the-batteries-in-dig-to-escape">What To Do After Finding The Batteries In Dig To Escape</h3>



<p>Once you’ve inserted all 12 Batteries into the Switchboard and the power comes back, wait for the guard to move away from the left side of the hall. When the path is clear, make a run towards the bright open elevator to complete Dig To Escape. After you enter, the “JANITOR ENDING” screen will pop up along with your Dig To Escape gameplay time.</p>

It will launch for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,032 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,060 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via Steam and <a title="Companies > Epic Games [354 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/epic-games">Epic Games</a> Store in spring 2026. Users who own <em>TankHead</em> for PC via Epic Games Store will receive <em>TankRat</em> as a free upgrade.<span id="more-1014638"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Kepler Interactive:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ Fact Sheet</strong></p><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In the aftermath of a war that reduced the world’s most fantastic city to ash, the Event Containment Area (ECA) stands as a monument to humanity’s ambition and ruin.</p><p>A wasteland of twisted metal husks, the remnants of mankind’s greed spread like mechanical cancer across the world. Only steel remains, humans having to project their consciousness into mechanical “Shells,” powerful drones that can salvage and control armored tanks of a lost age.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You are Whitaker, a Sleepwalker—a digitized consciousness inhabiting a Needle, a hardened drone built to endure the storms and <a title="Genres > Horror [792 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s of the ECA. And your <a title="Genres > Survival [495 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> will be earned, one kill at a time.</p><p>Welcome to the end of the world, it’s time to hunt TankRats.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Become What You Break</strong> – Shift seamlessly between the agile Needle and powerful combat Tanks as you explore the ECA’s Dead Zone. You must traverse what remains of a once advanced society to scavenge all the materials you can to upgrade your machine. Dismantle enemies, strip their wreckage for weapons, armor, and tech, and graft their parts onto your own rig. Every trip through the wasteland is a chance to rebuild, respec, and come back stronger.</li><li><strong>Tear Through <a title="Platforms > Meta [165 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>l</strong> – Blast through swarms of corrupted drones and mech-monsters in fast-paced, brutal vehicular combat across shifting battlefield conditions. The Dead Zone’s greatest terrors are the TankRats, wandering remnants of lost Sleepwalkers, twisted by the Shroud and time itself. You’ll need to exploit every weakness to bring these metal titans down. The only way out is through, and the only way through, is to destroy everything in your path.</li><li><strong>Rise Above the Ruins</strong> – The fabled city in the sky, Highpoint. A whispered truth buried in the ashes of a lost civilization. You don’t know why, but you know with absolute clarity that the only reason you fight is to uncover the truth behind the Shroud, a radioactive storm that warps time, memory, and reality itself. What are you willing to give to make it to the promised land, and what will you do if you don’t like the truth you find there?</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_1014642"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>■ FAQ</strong></p><p><strong>What if someone already owns <em>TankHead</em> on Epic Games Store?</strong></p><p>If you already own <em>TankHead</em> on the Epic Games Store, you will receive a free upgrade once <em>TankRat</em> releases, giving access to all the new features and content. The game’s page will be updated to reflect this update and name change later in Spring 2026.</p><p><strong>Why the name change?</strong></p><p>We changed the name because the game has evolved so much, and we wanted to signpost that really clearly. We believe it provides a clearer throughline to the scavenger-driven identity at the heart of the player character, and an ode to the colossal enemies you’ll be fighting to the death against on your journey through the wasteland.</p><p><strong>What can be expected for <em>TankRat</em> compared to <em>TankHead</em>?</strong></p><p>A lot of work went into <a title="Genres > Crafting [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> <em>TankRat</em> as the ultimate evolution of <em>TankHead</em>. We added more story content, more bosses, more biomes, more customization options, a refined battle system as well as many more surprises that we can’t wait to tell you more about. Stay tuned for more information on our channels!</p><p><strong>Is <em>TankRat</em> single-player or <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [658 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a>?</strong></p><p>TankRat is single player.</p><p><strong>What languages will <em>TankRat</em> support?</strong></p><p><em>TankRat</em> will be voiced in English, and feature subtitles in French, German, Spanish, Russian, Japanese and Simplified Chinese.</p><p><strong>Who are the main characters in <em>TankRat</em>?</strong></p><p>Whitaker is a Sleepwalker, someone who has the capacity to teleproject his conscience into machines. This is the only way humans can survive in the wastelands of the ECA. Driven by a thirst to reach Highpoint, he will fight to the end to uncover the mechanical mysteries of the world.</p><p>In his journey, Whitaker is guided by Cyril, a mysterious and charming “fixer,” occupying a mechanical body. Cyril probably knows more than he shares, and his lure for profit makes him a difficult character to trust.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

Working together, they will brave the perils of space to save their crumbling space station home from the dangers of a supernatural cosmic storm. Whether it’s by using unique tools to open the path forward, piloting their spaceship through dangerous asteroid fields or taking a break and soaking up the lavish anime-inspired atmosphere, players will embark on an intergalactic adventure and forge new bonds as friends together.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1014665"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Developed in Unreal Engine 5, <em>Orbitals</em> takes full advantage of the <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [778 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> hardware to deliver an unforgettable cooperative experience regardless of your preferred way of connecting together. Either by teaming up with two pairs of Joy-Con 2 controllers on a single Nintendo Switch 2 device for split-screen local cooperative play, using the system’s GameShare feature to share <em>Orbitals</em> with another local player on a compatible Nintendo Switch 2 or Nintendo Switch device, or by matchmaking online with their friends and taking advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2’s built-in microphone and GameChat for crystal-clear communications, players around the world can team up and save the day together as one inseparable team.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Orbitals</em> captures the warmth and style of classic Japanese anime, brought to life with authentic detail and clear reverence by the Tokyo-based development team at Shapefarm. The artists and developers at the studio have lovingly created a brand-new original world inspired by retro anime from the early ’90s and brought the artform to life in a way never before seen. Additionally, the developers have partnered with Studio Massket, the animation house behind hundreds of some of the most beloved and popular Japanese anime, to create hand-crafted cutscenes for the game for that extra layer of authenticity for fans of the anime medium. Combined with both full Japanese and English audio dubs, Shapefarm intends to honor the anime artform with a cooperative playable adventure that fans can fall in love with.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
