The next part of this new Batman franchise focuses on Farrell’s take on Penguin villain and builds an epic, <em>Sopranos</em>-like mafia show around the character and other criminals in Gotham. One of these criminals was the powerful Carmine Falcone, played by John Turturro in the film. But in the series, he’s played by someone else. Turturro recently explained why. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/news/john-turturro-pedro-almodovar-the-room-next-door-turning-down-the-penguin-severance-season-2-1236187588/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/john-turturro-pedro-almodovar-the-room-next-door-turning-down-the-penguin-severance-season-2-1236187588/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new interview with <em>Variety</em></a></span>, Turturro explained that he didn’t reprise his role as Falcone in the HBO series because he had already done what he “wanted” with the character. He also wasn’t a fan of the show’s violence. </p><p> “In the show, there was a lot of violence towards women, and that’s not my thing,” said the actor. While the character was brutal and dangerous in the 2022 movie, the violence “happens off-screen” claimed Turturro. “It’s scarier that way.” In the HBO show, Falcone is played by Mark Strong. </p><p>Finally, he told <em>Variety </em>that another reason he ultimately turned down the chance to return as Falcone in the new <em>Penguin </em>series was that he claimed to have too many projects he was interested in and not enough time to be a part of all of them, adding: “You can’t do everything you want to.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/clayster-retire-from-cod-esports/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>James ‘Clayster’ Eubanks, one of the greatest esports competitors of all time and a legend in the Call of Duty space, has officially announced his retirement after more than 15 years in the game. His origins in Call of Duty stretch back to COD 4: Modern Warfare, and his career spanned 14 unique titles.</p>



<p>In his retirement video, Clayster explained he ‘came across from Halo’, like so many Call of Duty pro players did, and that he’d been neck-deep in the COD world since he was 16 years of age. Now, at 32 years old, he’s retiring from COD esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-the-beginning">From The Beginning</h2>



<p>Clayster’s retirement marks the end of an era. He’s the last ‘OG’ player to pull out of active competition at the top tier of Call of Duty esports, having played through the last season of the Call of Duty League in the Carolina Royal Ravens. His stretch around the block has taken him through some of the most prestigious organisations and teams in esports, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>OpTic</li>



<li>Kaliber</li>



<li>Envy</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>eUnited</li>



<li>NYSL</li>



<li>Dallas Empire</li>
</ul>



<p>In a 29-minute video, Clayster poured his heart out to his community, expressing how tough it is just to keep up these days as an active competitor.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I know how much it takes to win, especially now. In Call of Duty now, it’s so hard to win. It’s incredibly difficult to not only compete but just win a match against good teams. It’s so hard in the CDL nowadays. I tried my heart out, I did want to succeed for her, in her memory. It’s just hard to play with so much on your mind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In that line, Eubanks was referring to his younger sister who passed away in her sleep in August 2022.</p>



<p>Clayster has refused to relent as a competitor season after season, even when many of us knew the end was getting close. He remained a stalwart leader and a ferocious personality, always trying his utmost best to bolster that status as a three-time world champion. With 19 chips and more than $1.1 million in earnings, he’s one of the winningest players of all time.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to talk. I’m thankful I got to see it from playing out of my mom’s house in my bedroom to then playing in huge arenas, so I’m grateful that I got to see the wave go while I was competing.</p>



<p>I feel really blessed to have had the career that I’ve had, the fanbase I’ve had… It has just been a dream come true. For a kid from a small town in Virginia, you know? I’m a hometown hero back there, it’s crazy. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full video from Clayster:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>For any Call of Duty esports fan, this is a huge moment. It’s not <strong>unexpected</strong>, but seeing it up there in lights is pretty tough to come to terms with. I fell in love with competitive Call of Duty way back when Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was doing the rounds in 2009, and the likes of Scump, Crimsix, Karma, and Clayster stuck with me for <strong>years</strong>.</p>



<p>What a way to usher in the Black Ops 6 season.</p>

The game, which aimed to deliver a physics-based multiplayer co-op experience, raised only $2,388 of its $15,183 goal (converted from Singapore dollars) with just 50 pledges. In a statement posted on <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1848982250316304734" rel="nofollow ">social media</a>, the studio indicated that Escape Factory had not generated sufficient interest and would be placed on hold, while announcing the development of a new project called Items, an action-horror prop hunt game.</p><p dir="ltr">Fntastic took "full responsibility" for the failures associated with The Day Before--which ranged from misleading marketing, severe technical issues at launch, and accusations of scamming players--and committed to transparency and community engagement as it transitions to the newly announced project. As a result, all funds will be refunded to backers, and development on Escape Factory will be temporarily suspended.</p><p dir="ltr">Fntastic mentioned that the studio had received numerous requests for a prop hunt game, influencing its decision to pivot towards Items. "We have received many requests for a prop hunt game, and after careful analysis and discussion with the team, we have decided that our Escape Factory project has not generated enough interest," Fntastic stated.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also indicated plans to release mobile games alongside Items, with revenue from these apps allocated directly to development costs. "All funds generated from these apps will go directly into development," the team added.</p><p dir="ltr">Fntastic previously released Propnight, which faced its own set of challenges, including a server closure earlier this year. Items may be supported by a future Kickstarter campaign, allowing players the opportunity to test the game before its official launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-marketing-budget/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is everywhere, and everyone knows it. From billboards and commercials to restaurant takeovers and social media promotions, Black Ops 6 is being thrust into the eyes of hundreds of millions of gamers (and of course, non-gamers) worldwide. In the last couple of weeks, ‘The Replacer’ has been everywhere, and the orange and black iconography of Black Ops 6 is on every applicable surface, digital or otherwise.</p>



<p>It comes as no surprise to learn that Activision and Microsoft really pushed the marketing budget to the limit for this game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-heights">New Heights</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 is probably the most highly anticipated Call of Duty game in several years. It has everything fans have been asking for, and a little more besides. There’s a round-based Zombies offering, a stacked multiplayer platform, and a campaign that should offer more than a few hours of entertainment.</p>



<p>It did superbly in the open beta, and fans are eagerly anticipating the game’s first season, the competitive scene ahead, and of course, the <strong>launch </strong>of the game itself on October 25.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-activision-xbox-microsoft-1236185153/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Variety</a>, Activision’s CMO, Tyler Bahl, revealed how big the team went on marketing Black Ops 6:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>(It’s comparable to a) major motion picture blockbuster that would be launching this year.</p>



<p>Obviously, we want to generate sales, but I think overall, just awareness of the new game coming out. That’s always a focus, making Black Ops 6 the number one game this fall. </p>



<p>Overall, I just want people to like the campaign and the work that we’re doing as marketing group. I think some of the work is really innovative. Like we’re not just making a spot – The Replacer is showing up in all these weird and different places that are truly exciting. That’s what gets me excited.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Before the marketing campaign for Black Ops 6 kicked off, The Replacer hadn’t been seen in commercials since 2018. His return has been a stunning one, and he has replaced everyone from presenters on DAZN to presidential candidates, and from restaurant workers to NFL quarterbacks.</p>



<p>All that’s left is for Black Ops 6 to take over the LA Sphere, or something.</p>

Titles like <em>Contra</em>, <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, and <em>Mega Man 2</em>, all from the late ‘80s, provided a unique gaming experience that’s hard to replicate today with modern technology. Hard, sure, but it’s possible—as we’ve now witnessed firsthand with the release of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865"><em>UFO 50</em></a></span>.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,196358,196789" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The collection—presented as a lost collection from a forgotten developer of the era—features an assortment of single- and multiplayer games across multiple genres, from platformers to roguelikes, with even a few in-depth RPGs mixed in. All are created with an 8-bit retro style that harkens back to the days of gaming in your living room after school. You can beat some of the games in mere minutes, then move on to the next; others, however, require a few hours and multiple playthroughs. They’re all unique, many of them are memorable, and some deserve no more than a single run-through.</p><p>When we sifted through the Steam user reviews, we found an overwhelmingly positive reception from the gaming community. Most people love the indie retro collection and cannot praise the fun factor enough. As you’ll see below, nostalgia plays a significant role in many of the reviews. Numerous players gave a thumbs up because it felt like playing a game from their childhood, and there’s nothing wrong with feeling young again and enjoying your hobby!</p><p>But a few couldn’t get past many titles, which lack the quality-of-life features in modern gaming, or--they say--feel outdated and unnecessarily complex just for nostalgia’s sake. Despite the positive reviews, the negative ones prove highly negative. Many curse out the game and its developers; they shout from the rooftops about how unfun they thought most of the retro titles were to play.</p><p>Surprisingly, we didn’t find many meme reviews, just plenty of positive or negative reviews to help you better understand the game. Here is <em>UFO 50</em>, as told by Steam reviews!</p><figure id="" data-id="9cf88cf8eb6f665cc0da8da701d224b1" data-recommend-id="image://9cf88cf8eb6f665cc0da8da701d224b1" data-format="png"

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/">Sea of Thieves</a> players recently celebrated a long-awaited addition to the game: After six years, players finally had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-finally-gets-a-much-requested-feature-after-more-than-6-years/1100-6527259/">the ability to crouch</a>. The game's latest update added a number of new stealth features for players to make use of, but unfortunately, almost all of those features have now been disabled due to bugs.</p><p dir="ltr">The additions were part of the game's stealth-focused 14th season, and two of the season's biggest features--trap-laying and ledge-hanging--were cut before they even hit the game due to stability concerns uncovered during a last-minute round of playtesting. Now, just a few days after Season 14's launch, even more features have been removed.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're dealing with some significant issues," production director Drew Stevens admitted in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwUlQFtY-rw">a video update</a> posted to the Sea of Thieves YouTube channel.</p><p dir="ltr">"I want to be clear that we're taking this situation very seriously," Stevens continued. "We're really unhappy about the quality of Season 14's launch, and we're going to be be taking some pretty drastic steps to get us back in control. Our first priority is stabilizing your experience in Live [Mode], we'll then move to reenabling features once we're confident they meet our quality bar. So today, we're taking Sea of Thieves down for a short maintenance [period]. Now, given it's only been a few days since launch, we don't have a hotfix that addresses the high-impact issues yet. We will, however, be making some changes today."</p><p dir="ltr">Some of those high-impact issues include the return of several exploits Sea of Theives developer Rare has previously addressed in the past, like the ability to swap weapons rapidly and control a character's movement after being shot out of a cannon.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, new features like disguises and crouching have been disabled, leaving blowdarts and grappling guns as the only Season 14 features to survive its launch. Stevens says Rare hopes to have a hotfix for crouching, gun swapping, and the game's other "high-impact" issues by next week, with plans to implement the promised trap-laying and ledge-hanging sometime in November.</p><p dir="ltr">"I know I've spoken about it before, and I'm sure you're sick of hearing it, but we know we need to do better here, and Season 14 has suffered from a lack of quality control," Stevens admitted in the video announcement, before reassuring players that Rare is taking Season 14's issues very seriously.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're going to be all hands on deck through the next releases to get back in control of game quality."</p>

<p>In the announcement video four of the main cast of Critical Role; Sam Riegel (Scanlan Shortholt), Marisha Ray (Keyleth), Laura Bailey (Vex'ahlia) and Taliesin Jaffe (Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III) gather to share the news.</p>
<p>"We have some amazing news to share. We've been picked up for a season four!" - Sam Riegel</p>
<p>An incredible feat that the first three seasons of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> has managed to maintain is that all are rated 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>
<p>Season four of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina </em>will likely continue the story where the party left off, with Thordak's demise and the party separating for some time they will be coming back together as rumors of a new&nbsp;Ziggurat surface.</p>
<p>Season three has already made all kinds of interesting changes to the original story of Vox Machina so who knows what's in store as it continues.</p>
<p>Sam Riegel, executive producer and founding member of Critical Role released the following statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are beyond thrilled - and grateful - to continue the epic and wild adventures of Vex, Vax, Keyleth, Percy, Pike, Grog and everyone’s favorite character - Scanlan,&nbsp;With each season, this show levels up, and we already have big plans to level up both our heroes and villains in Season Four.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this time it isn't known when we should be expecting to see season 4, but it's likely it will be sometime after the first season of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story">Critical Role's TV show for their second campaign, The Mighty Nein.</a></p>

<p>Fntastic just refuses to give up. After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-day-before-devs-return-fntastic-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing a comeback</a> in September and launching a Kickstarter for a new game called Escape Factory, Fntastic is back with yet another announcement. This time it’s to tell everyone that funding attempts for Escape Factory failed and it would no longer move forward with its development.</p>



<p>But don’t worry, Fntastic isn’t going away that easy.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1848982250316304734/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">same statement</a> claiming that interest in Escape Factory wasn’t there, Fntastic announced the development of yet another game: Items. Items is, supposedly, an “action-horror prop hunt game” that it says people “have been waiting for”.</p>



<p>Unlike with Escape Factory, there is no trailer or demo currently available for Items. However, the studio claims that once there is a “fully playable demo” they may start yet another Kickstarter for funding.</p>



<p>“It’s important to us that our players get the chance to play and test the game in advance,” they said in the statement.</p>



<p>Lastly, Fntastic said that it will be launching new mobile games as well in order to fund the development of Items. None of those games were announced as well. </p>



<p>After Fntastic first announced its comeback attempt in September, it was quickly discovered that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fntastic-new-game-asset-flip-dataminers-escape-factory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape Factory was an asset flip game</a>. The studio, however, denied those claims.</p>



<p>What do you think of Fntastic announcing yet another game after their first attempt at a comeback failed? Let us know in the comments, or join the discussion in the Insider Gaming Forums.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-c9-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The C9 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-release-date-time-countdown-launch-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>‘s take on the classic MP5 SMG, which is one of Call of Duty’s most iconic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons</a>. Just like its predecessors, it’s an extremely powerful close-range weapon with a fast fire rate and excellent mobility, especially with the right attachments.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for the best attachments, Perks, and Equipment to use with the C9, here’s the best loadout for it in BO6.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-c9-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-c9">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-c9">Best Secondary for C9 </a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-c9-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock C9 in Black Ops 6</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-c9-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the C9 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-c9-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-c9-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best C9 attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong>&nbsp;Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong>&nbsp;Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong>&nbsp;Extended Mag II</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong>&nbsp;Ergonomic Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong>&nbsp;Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Kicking off our best C9 loadout in Black Ops 6 is the <strong>Suppressor</strong>, which keeps you off the minimap when shooting and has no negative effects. The <strong>Reinforced Barrel </strong>boosts the gun’s damage range and bullet velocity, making it stronger when outside of close-quarters combat. </p>



<p>Then, the <strong>Extended Mag II</strong> is a no-brainer, as it gives you 50 rounds instead of 30, while the <strong>Ergonomic Grip</strong> improves mobility so that you can stay on target while jumping, sliding, and diving.</p>



<p>Lastly, <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> improves the C9’s already great rate of fire, making it more deadly in close-combat situations, as you can get more shots off in a shorter period.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-c9">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for C9</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Frag Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-comms-equipment-perks-scorestreaks-intel#enforcer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Perks</a>, I love the <strong>Enforcer Perk Combat Specialty,</strong> so <strong>Gung-Ho</strong>,<strong> Double Time</strong>, and <strong>Dexterity</strong> all combine nicely to not only improve mobility but also provide the bonus, which regens your health after getting a kill.  Thanks to the <strong>Perk Greed Wild Card</strong>, you can then select Ghost as a fourth Perk, which keeps you hidden whenever an enemy gets a UAV.</p>



<p>To support your attack, <strong>Frag Grenades </strong>are always a great option when enemies are on an objective or in a dangerous position. <strong>Stim Shots</strong> will allow you to stay in the fight for longer too, regenerating your health much faster.</p>



<p>Lastly, for the Field Upgrade, the <strong>Trophy System</strong> means you can support your team and protect them by blocking enemy Tacticals and Lethals.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-c9">Best Secondary for C9</h2>



<p>To support the C9, the <strong>Stryder .22 </strong>is the best Secondary option for finishing off kills when you need to reload or you run out of ammo. It’s semi-automatic, so you’ll need a fast trigger finger to get the most out of it. If you don’t have it unlocked yet, any Pistol makes for a good backup to the C9.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-c9-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock C9 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You will <strong>immediately unlock the C9 once you gain access to Custom Loadouts at Level 4</strong>. You won’t have any issues reaching this level and will probably get it done in a few matches of multiplayer. You can also rank up in ZOmbies, so if you prefer slaying the undead, head into Terminus or Liberty Falls.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-c9-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the C9 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes</strong>, The C9 is a meta SMG in Black Ops 6, which may be surprising since it’s unlocked so quickly, however, you still need to play to its strengths. It’s not overpowered, but it excels at close range, so don’t try to use it outside of its limits.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-c9-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the C9 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If you’re looking for another dominant SMG, <strong>Jackal PDW</strong> is an amazing choice, with high damage and clean iron sights. If you want to move away from close quarters, give the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">AK-74</a> a go, as it’s a heavy-hitting Assault Rifle that shreds in the mid-to-long ranges.</p>

            <p>
Following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-is-ditching-psvr-support-next-year">recent decision to end PSVR support</a> for Minecraft, developer Mojang has announced it'll be doing the same for VR on PC, with the ability to don VR goggles and stroll through Minecraft set to be removed from both platforms from March next year.
</p>
<p>
"Our ability to support VR/MR devices has come to an end, and will no longer be supported in updates after March of 2025," Mojang wrote in a notice buried midway through its <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-40-bedrock-changelog">patch notes for Minecraft's latest Bedrock 1.21.40 update</a>.
</p>
<p>
Following March's update and the demise of Minecraft's official VR support, all existing worlds will at least still be available to build in using non-VR/MR devices, and all Marketplace purchases (including Minecoins) will continue to be available too.

<p>
But while Mojang is waving goodbye to VR in an official capacity (meaning no PSVR2 support for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-years-after-ps5s-launch-minecraft-finally-gets-a-native-version">Minecraft's newly launched native PS5 release</a>), all is not lost for VR-loving Minecraft players on PC. As noted by <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/minecraft-openxr-pc-vr-psvr-support-dropped/">Road to VR</a>, virtual reality support can still be modded into Minecraft's Java edition using <a href="https://www.vivecraft.org/">Vivecraft</a> (which supports LAN and server multiplayer, but isn't compatible with official servers or console cross-play), and there's also <a href="https://questcraft.org/">Questcraft</a> for Meta's Quest headsets.
</p><p>
As for everything else in Minecraft's Bedrock 1.21.40 update, there's the full launch of Mojang's previously experimental Bundles feature - which gives players a way to stack different blocks or items together in the same inventory slot to save space - and a new Hardcore mode, all detailed in the studio's latest patch notes. This follows Mojang's recent decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-ditching-single-summer-update-for-more-regular-releases-ps5-version-incoming">ditch its traditional single summer Minecraft update</a> in favour of multiple content drops throughout the year.

		<p>Capcom’s latest <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> showcase has delved into more biome and monster reveals for the much anticipated new game, as well as confirming an open beta test that will take place next week across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxYKTXuoxXQ">the full showcase here</a>, or just catch the latest snazzy trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 5th Trailer | The Black Flame" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ahy0AO8WwRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s cut to the chase, the Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test will take place at the following dates and times next week, with PS Plus subscribers getting a two days early access window.</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 with&nbsp;PlayStation Plus Early Access – October 29 at 03:00am GMT – October 31 at 02:59am GMT</li>
<li>PS5 (Non-PlayStation Plus), Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam – November 1 at 03:00am GMT – November 4 at 01:59am GMT</li>
</ul>
<p>PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass subscriptions are not required for the wider open beta from 1st November, but will be for the full game next year.</p>

<p>The open beta test will feature three parts: the complete character creation tool (which you can transfer to the full game), a Story Trial from the opening of the game with tutorials and a Chatacabra hunt, and the free-roaming Doshaguma Hunt where you can pursue the Doshaguma pack or explore the Windward Plains.</p>
<p>It will feature full cross-play between all platforms, and take part will award players with a bonus pendant to decorate their weapons or Seikret mount in the full game.</p>
<p>We’ve already tried out this content with our hand on time in early September. Check out our preview!</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-a-seikret-ride-on-the-wild-side/">Monster Hunter Wilds Preview – A Seikret ride on the wild side</a></h2>
<p>And then for the new gameplay reveals and details from the stream. Capcom dipped a toe in to the Oilwell Basin, &nbsp;named after the boiling oil wells that feature in this region. These can cause firestorms during periods known as Firespring, making the world dangerous in its own right!</p>
<p>Here the newly revealed Brute Wyvern Rompopolo (not as cute as it sounds) is on the prowl, expelling toxic gas to weaken prey, both from its mouth and by injecting gas into the tar on the ground. Lovely. Ajarakan also live here, the two species often vying for terrirory. The Ajarakan is a fanged beast with a thick shell to cover itself in high temperature armour.</p>
<p>Within this region, you’ll be able to visit the village of Azuz, which features a massive forge at its centre, and where you’ll hear tale of the Black Flame that lies beneath the basin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is set for a 28th February 2025 release date, the long-awaited monster hunting sequel coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-day-before-developers-fntastic-scrap-failed-kickstarter-announces-a-new-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It comes as no surprise <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-day-before-team-fntastic-are-back-asking-for-15k-to-develop-new-game/">that the Kickstarter</a> that Fntastic put out failed. The developers behind The Day Before came back with a statement, talking about how they deserved a second chance and that their game Escape Factory would be just that. However, the Kickstarter didn't go according to plan, and they decided to postpone any work on Escape Factory and cancel the Kickstarter. Luckily, it means those who donated to Kickstarter will be able to get their money back. It's been specified that no funds have been collected, so those who donated don't need to panic about what happens next.</p>
<p>However, that isn't all for The Day Before developers, as they are surprisingly persistent. Despite the fact that their return wasn't accepted with open arms, they are announcing that they are developing a new game. This title is an "action-horror prop hunt," similar to Propnight, mostly likely. Propnight was one of their more popular titles and was well-received by audiences who played it. However, they lost the rights to that game and are now working on making their very own prop hunt game called Items.</p>
<p>Fntastic said that the community was asking for a prop hunt game, so this time, they are working on delivering exactly that. Considering that they had a Kickstarter to try and be able to make Escape Factory, it begs the question of whether or not they will now boot up one for this game. In the announcement for Items, they've stated that the development of the game will "require significant resources," and as a result, they will be releasing mobile games parallel to the development of Items to ensure that they can support the progress of the prop hunt game.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1848982250316304734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their statement on X</a>, they also mentioned that they "may launch a new Kickstarter campaign or explore other options for release." While they sound optimistic and rather hopeful about their upcoming project, it doesn't mean that it is being well-received by the gaming audience. It's going to be hard for Fntastic to build up any sense of trust with their audience after what happened with The Day Before, and rely heavily on the community to fund their projects that may never even come to light.</p>
<p>Whether or not Items takes off and manages to become a full-fledged game remains to be seen, and we're just going to have to sit back and watch this unfold.</p>

            <p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> open beta will launch next week, Capcom have announced. It’ll be live on Steam from 31st October to 3rd November 2024, allowing the more impatient Capcommandoes amongst us to get a taste of the new setting and combat mechanics ahead of the game’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-releases-28th-feb-2025-which-gives-modders-enough-time-to-silence-the-uncanny-talking-palicos">full release in February next year</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As detailed <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/obt/">on the official site</a>, the beta includes the game's character creator and a couple of hunts. The first hunt is a story trial mode, in which you get to watch the opening cutscene, complete some tutorials, and hunt a Chatacabra. The second is a Doshaguma hunt.</p>
<p>I’m not acquainted with the Chatacabra – a cursory wiki inspection reveals it to be a frog made of boulders - but I’m sadly familiar with the Doshaguma. It’s the huge woofy bovine creature they ritually murdered at Summer Games Fest, so that they could show us all the new terrain elements in action. That Capcom presenter is the real monster here, and so are you if you try do anything to the Doshaguma except give it a nice gentle pat on its big floppy head.
</p>
<p>
In the event that you accidentally pat the Doshaguma’s head with your greatsword, causing it to sit on you with extreme prejudice, 1) that’s what you deserve, you filthy trouser-crafting carnist, and 2) you can summon up to three other hunters to help using SOS flares. The beta will include NPC bots but also supports multiplayer. Last but not least, it’ll allow you to ride about a large desert map on your Seikret – think Chocobo, but toothier - and switch between two different weapons on the fly.
</p><p>
The beta isn’t just a disposable prelude: you’ll be able to import your custom character and accompanying Palico (read: prancing cat minion) to the full game. Which, going by what I saw of it at SGF, should be pretty good fun, given the customary Monster Hunting prerequisites of a heart blacker than pitch and a frankly unreasonable urge to turn everything into pants. You can read my full preview <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-alpha-doshaguma-the-doomed-dragonfighting-guinea-pig-of-my-monster-hunter-wilds-demo">here</a>.

It is masterful in its creation of a cursed ship, a missing crew, and the unwitting insurance investigator who gets to the bottom of its compelling mystery. <em><strong>Return of the Obra Dinn </strong></em><strong>is also crucially discounted to $13.39 until November 1 on Steam, PlayStation, and the Nintendo Switch.</strong> It’s a game best enjoyed over a few nights while you’re huddled under some blankets in the dark, making it a perfect game to enjoy as Hallloween draws closer.</p><p>In <em>Obra Dinn</em>, you are cast as an investigator sent to unravel the mystery of the titular ship, which has unceremoniously appeared in the harbor after having been believed to be missing. Except when it turns up at port, the Obra Dinn is missing every member of its crew, and shows signs of having been through hell to get there. With a ledger that accounts for everyone that should’ve been on the ship, you begin poking and prodding at corpses on the vessel in order to discover the fate of everyone aboard, as well as that of its missing goods.</p><p>In order to help piece things together, you use a pocket watch that the game refers to as a Memento Mortem. When opened, the world gets enveloped in a void that comes from within the watch, transporting the player to the moment of the corpse’s death. These frozen scenes are the bulk of <em>Obra Dinn</em>, and a key component in how utterly cool the game is. Once you’re dropped into them, these immaculately choreographed scenes welcome you to begin connecting names to faces thanks to morsels of dialogue and situational awareness. The game is one big logic puzzle where you are literally just trying to deduce who died and how, but the greater mystery and story that unfolds as you piece that together is nothing short of epic.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="2435db98e7be98e71a014e7c83e20c58" data-recommend-id="image://2435db98e7be98e71a014e7c83e20c58" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Return of the Obra Dinn, showing the Memento Mortem pocket watch as well as two figures in a bloody brawl in the middle of a frozen scene." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Return of the Obra Dinn, showing the Memento Mortem pocket watch as well as two figures in a bloody brawl in the middle of a frozen scene." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucas Pope</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2435db98e7be98e71a014e7c83e20c58" data-recommend-id="image://2435db98e7be98e71a014e7c83e20c58" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Return of the Obra Dinn, showing the Memento Mortem pocket watch as well as two figures in a bloody brawl in the middle of a frozen scene." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Words cannot express how much joy I got out of <em>just </em>that. At first, everyone but the captain of the ship is a mystery to you and little more than a name in a book. But over the course of the story, certain characters step up and become more than just another crew member. Even if they aren’t the primary focus of the scene, there are plenty of folks in <em>Obra Dinn </em>who largely operate in the background, and studying them and their motivations is just as compelling as the central mystery. At times, the two are even intrinsically linked, and it can pay off to be particularly studious, especially when it comes to making breakthroughs in the late-game stretch. I spent an entire holiday guffawing at the actions that some characters took and cheering on the breaks in the case that I made by following certain folks closely.</p><p>Much like this year’s wonderfully weird <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a></span>, <em>Obra Dinn </em>is a big-ass puzzle box telling a swashbuckling tragedy in an arresting style. <em>Obra Dinn </em>is a fully 3D game that invites you to walk all across the derelict ship, but it’s presented in 1-bit-style graphics. The monochrome style of older PC games is alive and well in <em>Obra Dinn</em>, and the distinct look gives this otherwise deceptively cutting-edge title a vintage feel.</p><p>If you’re looking for a game that welds classic and modern adventure games into a succinct and stylish package, you can’t go wrong with <em>Return of the Obra Dinn. </em>It’s got a simple but electrifying premise, and it isn’t long before it gets its claws into you. Deciphering who’s who on such a large ship can feel like a daunting task, but once you get to know a handful of characters, the game really comes alive, and before you know it, you’ll be ripping through it. My advice: savor it as much as you can by spreading it out over the week. Give yourself the time and space to ponder the faces and words of this enigmatic crew and really live on board the Obra Dinn. By the time you’re done, you’ll almost have wished you were aboard for its final, cursed voyage. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game that started Capcom’s remake trend (which the rest of the industry soon copied) is a recreation of a horror classic that surpasses the original. A blend of old-school and modern design, the <em>RE2</em> remake thrills and terrifies at every corner and will make a horror fan out of you in no time.</p></div><div><p>If you are a horror aficionado who’s seen every movie there is then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-quarry-guide-until-dawn-horror-video-game-1849055831&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-quarry-guide-until-dawn-horror-video-game-1849055831"><em>The Quarry</em></a></span> might be perfect for you. From developer Supermassive Games, <em>The Quarry</em> is pure ‘80s B movie goodness. You (and a group of friends in multiplayer mode) get to control a handful of camp counselors trying to stay alive over the night when attacked by mysterious creatures. The best part of <em>The Quarry</em> is that you can turn it into the biggest gore fest ever by purposefully making bad decisions, which is always fun.</p></div><div><p>What could be more fun than running around trying to kill your friends (in a video game)? Not much. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-and-dragons-castlevania-dlc-1851477094&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-and-dragons-castlevania-dlc-1851477094"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a></span> is perfect for a night in with friends (lights off, of course). The asymmetrical multiplayer game lets you live out your horror movie dreams and prove that you could actually escape the crazed killer, or be the best killer in the group.</p></div><div><p>Resident Evil 4 is likely the popular pick for the best <em>Resident Evil</em> game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891"><em>RE4</em></a></span><em> </em>got the remake treatment last year and the seminal action-horror title still holds up incredibly well, probably because most modern action games are inspired by it. This is the franchise at its best. It has camp, action, horror, and hotties (just look at Leon and Ada).</p></div><div><p>Not only one of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-horror-games-ps5-xbox-steam-pc-silent-hill-2-1851671021&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-horror-games-ps5-xbox-steam-pc-silent-hill-2-1851671021">best horror games</a></span> in the past decade, but also an amazing sequel to one of the best horror movies ever made. Taking place after the events of Ridley Scott’s <em>Alien</em>, <em>Isolation </em>expertly captures the helplessness that film’s titular monster instills in its victims. For the majority of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-the-i-cant-believe-i-waited-seven-year-1846817646&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-the-i-cant-believe-i-waited-seven-year-1846817646"><em>Isolation</em></a></span>, you will not have any way to fight back against the monster, only hide and hope for the best. It’s utterly horrifying in ways few games are.</p></div><div><p>For something a bit more unique, try out this amazing 2023 indie. Instead of running from monsters, you take on the role of a radio DJ fielding calls from listeners being hunted by a serial killer. In<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/killer-frequency-best-survival-horror-game-steam-fnaf-1850410187&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/killer-frequency-best-survival-horror-game-steam-fnaf-1850410187"><em>Killer Frequency</em></a></span>, rescuing these callers turns into unique puzzles you can only solve through finding useful information in your small recording studio or calling phone numbers. It plays like a single-player version of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-bomb-defusing-video-game-tested-my-relationship-1736320189&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-bomb-defusing-video-game-tested-my-relationship-1736320189"><em>Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes</em></a></span> and infuses the horror elements with a dose of ‘80s camp.</p></div><div><p>In 2014, <em>Resident Evil</em> was a series that had leaned into action over its survival horror roots. Thankfully series creator Shinji Mikami delivered a classic take on the genre with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-evil-within-the-kotaku-review-1649303587&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-evil-within-the-kotaku-review-1649303587"><em>The Evil Within</em></a></span>. Great gunplay and a truly terrifying atmosphere make this one of the best <em>Resident Evil</em> games there is, even if it doesn’t bear the franchise’s name.</p></div><div><p>While the <em>Pinocchio</em> Soulsike isn’t strictly a horror game, the gothic vibes are still plenty spooky. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-review-pinocchio-soulslike-bloodborne-sekiro-1850857903&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-review-pinocchio-soulslike-bloodborne-sekiro-1850857903"><em>Lies of P</em></a></span> is a fantastic iteration of the <em>Dark Souls</em> formula that emphasizes movement and discovering your own playstyle. Come for fantastic gameplay and stay for a gripping retelling of the classic fairy tale that is better than it has any right to be.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zero-sievert-is-%E2%80%98graduating%E2%80%99-into-a-1-0-release-today.1017480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/zero-sievert-graduation-1-0-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Zero Sievert, originally released in early access two years ago, is launching as a full, 1.0 product <strong>today</strong>. This exciting news comes directly from CABO Studio and Modern Wolf, who confirmed a lineup of developments coming to the 1.0 release of Zero Sievert. This is one of my favourite extraction shooter titles, simply because it’s so unique.</p>



<p>If you’ve never played Zero Sievert, read on to learn about the 1.0 release and why you should give it a shot.</p>



<hr>







<p>Zero Sievert is a charming game marketed as a ‘top-down survival extraction shooter’, and as a single-player game, it ticks so many boxes for me as a player. When you start playing Zero Sievert, you’re walked through the base mechanics and then thrown into a harsh and unwelcoming world ravaged by mutated creates and nuclear fallout.</p>



<p>Every time you load into a map, you’ll be exploring something procedurally generated, which keeps things fresh and unpredictable. From wildlife and raiders to horrifying mutant creatures, you’ll need to be on your toes if you’re going to get in, loot up, and get out with your life intact.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Following the 1.0 release of Zero Sievert, players will be able to access an ‘endgame zone’ of the Zakov City map, which allows them to finally complete the story. The overall gameplay loop has been polished, and community-led improvements have been applied across the board.</p>



<p>In a statement, the lead developer at CABO Studio, Luca Carbonera, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are beyond excited to finally bring ZERO Sievert out of Early Access into the hands of our players. This Early Access period has given us a fantastic opportunity to really listen to everyone’s comments and opinions and make some great changes. We’re now super proud of where we have the game. Existing fans will love the 1.0 update, and we hope to see new faces drop into Zakov!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zero Sievert can be purchased exclusively on Steam for $24.99, which is a small price to pay for infinite replayability. </p>

On Monday, a whistleblower had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1g95e9o/rumor_the_wolf_among_us_2_facing_major/" rel="nofollow ">claimed on Reddit</a> that the project was at risk of being shelved due to financial difficulties and internal pressure. While the original post has since been deleted, Telltale has now directly responded to the rumors.</p><p dir="ltr">"As a rule, we don't comment on rumors and unsubstantiated Reddit threads.

"We've been quiet because we've been heads down, focusing on the promise of TWAU2. While we can't give a big update yet, here's a little something for you," Telltale wrote in a forum post.

However, Telltale's response has refuted these claims, assuring fans that the game remains in production. Despite significant layoffs in September 2023, which affected most of the team working on The Wolf Among Us 2, Telltale <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/telltale-games-calls-recent-layoffs-regrettable-confirms-the-wolf-among-us-2-is-still-in-production/1100-6518220/" data-ref-id="1100-6518220">reiterated in October that year that the game is still in development</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Originally announced in 2017, The Wolf Among Us 2 faced numerous challenges, including a restart in development and multiple delays.

<p>During today's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>showcase, we got to see some of the monsters and geographical features of the Oilwell Basin ecosystem, including a brand new and terrifying-looking monster known as the Black Flame.</p>
<p>Other monsters we got a glimpse of include the bulbous Rompopolo, which often finds itself embroiled in territorial struggles with the fanged and thick-shelled Ajarakan. You'll be able to encounter both of these monsters in the Oilwell Basin.</p>

<p>It'll be available across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, but if you're subscribed to PlayStation Plus, you can enjoy an early access test period, which runs from October 29th at 3am GMT until October 31st at around the same time.</p>
<p>According to Capcom, the open beta will consist of three parts: character creation, the opening part of the game's story, and an open hunt for the Doshaguma, which will also let you explore the Windward Plains area.</p>
<p>You can either experience the latter two parts solo, enlist the help of NPC hunters, or team up with players online during the open beta.</p>

<p>Participating in this open beta will net you a special Pendant to decorate your weapons or mount, and you'll also get a "helpful item pack", although Capcom doesn't say what that pack will contain.</p>
