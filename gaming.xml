<p>Coming in early 2026, <a href="https://x.com/SEGA/status/1957457668689260742">Sega has announced</a> the <strong>SEGA Villains Stage</strong>, and first up for our daring ninja is the blue blur's rival himself, Dr. Eggman. Joe Musashi and Eggman have actually met before in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/sonic_and_all-stars_racing_transformed">Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed</a>, but this time, we imagine things won't be settled in a kart race here.

<p>In the promotional image, you can also see two more sets of eyes lurking in the shadows either side of Dr. Eggman. No idea who those will be yet! Any guesses? Maybe a <strong>Like A Dragon</strong> villain? Mr. X? Dr. Curien?</p>

<p>It's a fun concept, and we're excited to see some of Sega's rogue's gallery in lovely painterly form. Lizardcube's new entry in the Shinobi series already looks fantastic, so this is a fun little cherry on top.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-state-of-play-coming-in-september-2025-it%E2%80%99s-claimed-%E2%80%93-rumor.1273143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has had a State of Play, or some kind of presentation in September every year for the last six years, and according to Jeff Grubb, who has proven to be a reliable source for information ahead of official announcements, they won't be breaking that streak in 2025 with a State of Play, "<em>maybe a Showcase</em>," planned for "<em>before the end of September</em>."</p>



<p>Grubb made his claim during Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings show, at the 20 minute and 10-second mark while Grubb and his guest, IGN's Seth Macy, were discussing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fairgame-canceled-according-to-michael-pachter/">weekend scare that Fairgames from Haven Studios had been canned</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="45-Minute Kirby Air Riders Direct Announced" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KYP00kf4GM?start=1221&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>I've heard, - and this one I feel comfortable saying, you can go write headlines about this if you want</em> - <em>they're planning a State of Play, or maybe a Showcase, but probably a State of Play, for the end of September, or before the end of September. So we're gonna hear, we're going to get updates from Sony here pretty soon</em>,<em>" </em>Grubb said.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-similar-length-tsushima/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, we don't know what Sony has lined up for the remainder of 2025, and after Gamescom ONL tomorrow, September would be the perfect opening for Sony to let players know what they can look forward to for the rest of the year.</p>



<p>The last <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/">State of Play this past June</a> included mostly news for third-party titles and 2026 releases. In the very likely scenario that a September 2025 State of Play is on the horizon, hopefully it includes more news about what's coming from PlayStation and Sony in the next few months.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam Makes A Big Change To How Review Scores Are Calculated]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-reviews-wuchang-fallen-feather-china-language-filter-2000618249</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-makes-a-big-change-to-how-review-scores-are-calculated.1273134/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Valve is overhauling how Steam reviews are displayed in a new update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/500579345320904529?l=english">it announced on Monday</a>. The percentage score usually assigned to games based on the number of positive and negative user reviews will now exclude reviews written in other languages. The change comes as Steam becomes an increasingly popular global PC storefront and routine review-bombing from players in specific regions can torpedo a game’s rating for everyone on the platform.</p> <p>“Steam’s growth since then into an even larger global presence means customers in different regions of the world may have vastly different experiences from each other for the same game,” Valve explained <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/500579345320904529?l=english">in a new blog post</a>. “There are a variety of reasons this may happen for a particular game, including translation issues, cultural references, poor network connections, and many others; things that the Overall Review Scores haven’t been able to capture until now. Calculating a language-specific review score means that we can better distill the sentiment of these different groups of customers, and in doing so, better serve potential customers that belong to those groups.”</p> <p>Not every game will be impacted by the changes. Valve said it will only start calculating “language-specific review scores” for games with at least 2,000 total publicly visible user reviews, and at least 200 written in a particular language. Players can now click through the review score section of a game’s Steam store page to get a breakdown of the scores across different languages. While this will now be the default mode for review scores on Steam, everyone will still have the option to toggle back to the old system.</p>

 <p>“We realize that whenever we make changes to User Reviews, we’re inviting some scrutiny into our motivations for making those changes,” Valve wrote. “Maintaining trust in the system is crucial to us, so we’ve erred on the side of being as transparent as possible.”</p> <p>The move comes just days after one of Steam’s bigger releases of the season, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-mod-censorship-1-4-2000618179"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></a>, implemented controversial changes to the game following apparent pushback from some Chinese fans over historical references in the fictional Soulslike. While it’s unclear if that game factored into this new policy at all, games on Steam increasingly get review-bombed for all sorts of reasons that don’t always necessarily have to do with the underlying functionality or experience, from allegations of using generative AI to complaints of terms of service requirements in places like Europe.</p> <p>Data from <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/4-great-graphs-and-1-new-feature">Simon Carless’<em> Game Discover</em> newsletter</a> earlier this year showed that a plurality of Steam users in 2024 had “simplified Chinese” as their primary language on the platform, followed narrowly by English in second place. Over the summer, <em>Helldivers 2</em> was <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-eos-prosperity-china-steam-reviews-1851782983">briefly review-bombed</a> after an apparent translation error led Chinese players to feel cheated by one of the game’s weekly mission objectives. The latest changes to review scores seem like an attempt by Valve to keep those two audiences separate, at least when it comes to rating new games.</p>

              <p><span>The Marvel universe is so vast that games like hero shooter </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-eomm-steam-reviews-max-payne-remake-n64-2000617137"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span> and fighting game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-vs-capcom-state-of-play-ps5-1851783734"><i><span>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</span></i></a> <span>already have a virtually endless bucket of characters to draw on for their growing rosters. Nevertheless, it sounds like NetEase is at least considering making its own original heroes for </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>at some point. You know, if that was something you ever thought about.</span></p> <p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/netease-green-light-marvel-create-original-characters-marvel-rivals"><i><span>MP1st</span></i></a><span> asked </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>director Guangyun “Guangguang” Chen if NetEase had considered adding heroes of its own to fight alongside Marvel staples like the Avengers and the Fantastic Four in a future season. After all, other Marvel projects like the MCU movies have created new characters. Would it be out of the question for </span><i><span>Rivals </span></i><span>to also indulge in making people up to capture an objective or push a payload? Well, Chen says that Marvel has given the team the green light to do that. While he told </span><i><span>MP1st </span></i><span>the team is “allowed to introduce original characters,” Chen played coy when asked if any are coming down the pipeline, merely saying “stay tuned.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Maybe my immediate aversion to this is just because </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>isn’t even a year old yet, and the thought that someone’s favorite comic book mainstay could get sidelined for some OC cooked up in the NetEase offices feels bad. However, Luna Snow, one of the most popular characters in </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>,</span> <span>also started as an original character in the mobile game </span><i><span>Marvel Future Fight</span></i><span>, which has been a point of contention considering all the attention she gets in terms of cosmetics compared to fan-favorite heroes who originate from the comics. I don’t doubt some interesting heroes might come out of this, but you’re still covering the classics, NetEase, so I hope any original characters you might introduce come after you’ve spent a bit more time filling out the roster with established heroes people are still waiting for.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For more on </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>, check out </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s review</span></a><span>.</span></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Guilty Gear Strive - 9 Minutes Of NEW Lucy Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The most notable move in Lucy's arsenal, however, is her Quickhack super move. Here, she produces a menu of six unique perks that change her attacks, give her added buffs, and even debuff the opponent for a short time. Each activation of Quickhack gives Lucy a limited amount of RAM to use when selecting perks--which each cost a specific amount--so she won't be able to activate all six at a time, but she will come out at an advantage after each Quickhack.</p><p dir="ltr">The six Quickhack perks, along with their RAM costs and abilities, are below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Contagion</strong> (costs 3 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Lucy's attacks deal damage over time</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Energy Siphon</strong> (costs 6 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Lucy's attacks also restore her health</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Algorithm Malfunction</strong> (costs 13 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">All of Lucy's attacks trigger a Counter Hit</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Resistance Glitch</strong> (costs 9 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Opponents build RISC levels faster by blocking Lucy's attacks  <ul><li dir="ltr">The higher RISC a character has, the more damage they take from the next combo that hits them</li></ul></li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Pacify</strong> (costs 8 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Opponent gains less Tension gauge, GG's version of super meter</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Optics Inhibition (</strong>costs 3 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Lucy becomes glitched and hard to see, making opponents' moves miss more often</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Guilty Gear Strive is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Lucy will be available on August 21 as part of the game's Season 4 content bundle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has released a new gift code for Escape from Tarkov players, and it offers a hint regarding the game’s imminent graduation into a fully released game. For almost a decade, Escape from Tarkov has been a beta product, but in the coming months, it’ll transform, and the latest Escape from Tarkov reward code is teasing exactly that.</p>



<p>The latest Tarkov code offers a stack of free items, but more importantly, it tells us that the game’s full release is <strong>coming soon</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-latest-tarkov-code-gives-free-kit">Latest Tarkov Code Gives Free Kit</h2>



<p>If you want to redeem the latest Escape from Tarkov code, you’ll need to head to <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/promo/activate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, sign in, and click on ‘Activate Promo Code’. Then, type in this code: RELEASECOMINGSOON.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that you can only redeem these free Tarkov items on a PvP account and <strong>not </strong>on a PvE account. If you’re only tied to the latter, you won’t even be able to claim the code, period.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here’s everything you get when you redeem the new Escape from Tarkov gift code:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tactical Sport Headset</li>



<li>Fleece Beanie</li>



<li>TGlasses</li>



<li>AFAK</li>



<li>Esmarch x 2</li>



<li>Ultimag x 3</li>



<li>Zarya Flashbang</li>



<li>SJ6</li>



<li>7.62 PP x 60</li>



<li>7.62 PS x 120</li>



<li>RGD-5 x 2</li>



<li>Propital</li>



<li>Morphine</li>



<li>CALOK-B</li>



<li>CMS</li>



<li>Vaseline</li>



<li>A18 Skanda Armoured Rig</li>



<li>AKMN (fully kitted)</li>
</ul>



<p>The AKMN assault rifle you get with the new Tarkov code is a beaut, boasting the red hex components that are guaranteed to make it stand out.</p>



<p>You’ll notice that when you head to Escape from Tarkov to collect the rewards, you’ll be met with a message from System that simply reads ‘Soon.’</p>



<p>It’s indicative <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">of Tarkov’s 1.0 release</a>, which might drop before the year is out (but more likely it’ll come in 2026).</p>



<p>Let me know if you’re excited about Escape from Tarkov’s imminent full release on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game"><u>Magic: The Gathering</u></a> has been around since 1993, but it wasn’t until 2011 that Wizards of the Coast debuted preconstructed decks (Precons) for the Commander format (also known as Elder Dragon Highlander).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Commander is the most popular way to play Magic, and a big part of that is that Wizards of the Coast regularly releases preconstructed decks that are playable right out of the box. Still, some are drastically more expensive than others, or hard to get hold of after limited print runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, I’ve put together a list of great preconstructed decks you can still get hold of. They’re not all cheap, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-magic-the-gathering-commander-decks-sale-new"><u>there’s a handy list of more affordable decks here</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Criteria</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To be considered for this list, a deck needs to tick a few boxes. For one, it needs to be available, and not just on the secondary market. While some of these are getting harder to find, you can still do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The decks also need to be fun to play, with a cohesive game plan, and some nifty reprints wouldn’t hurt, either. There’s also a hefty dose of my own opinion here, and I’ve not played with or against every deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all that said, here are my picks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Draconic Destruction</h2><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226645"><div id="226645" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Draconic Destruction</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, it used to be much, much cheaper, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKg0pB?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Draconic Destruction</u></a> is a great precon if you’re into casting dragons and sending them at opponents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s still a deck I find myself returning to because it’s remarkably easy to play, and while Atarka, World Render is hardly a pricey Commander, there are still some slightly pricier cards to be found, like Scourge of Valkas and Dragon Tempest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The strategy is simple: Cast big dragons, and get Atarka on the board to give them double strike. That makes it perfect for newcomers.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Quick Draw</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226646"><div id="226646" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Quick Draw</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Spellslinger decks in red and blue are nothing new, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7oAY?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Quick Draw</u></a> has a cool Commander in Stella Lee, Wild Card, which gives you access to more spells to cast, and the ability to copy instants and sorceries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll need to keep track of what you’re casting, but it can get out of hand pretty quickly when you’re throwing Vandalblast and Windfall around. Plus, Veyran, Voice of Duality remains a few dollars, alongside Thunderclap Drake and Niv-Mizzet, Parun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a subtle amount of player manipulation here, too, with Propaganda and Niv-Mizzet incentivizing some politics around the table.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Jump Scare</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226647"><div id="226647" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Jump Scare!</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Zimone, Mystery Unraveler helms this Duskmourn Commander Deck, and can allow you to cast big spells face-down until the moment comes for them to pop up (like a <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qbb3pJ?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Jump Scare</u></a>, get it?).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Being able to (potentially) cheat out cards like Worldspine Wurm, Shriekwood Devourer and Thunderfoot Baloth is nice, but there are some solid reprints, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aesi, Tyrant of Gyre Strait is a big beast that would cost you around $10 on its own, while Giggling Skitterspike and Ashaya, Soul of the Wild aren’t far behind. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Scrappy Survivors</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226648"><div id="226648" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Scrappy Survivors</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Our first Universes Beyond entry (and one of two from the Fallout decks), <a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8ZGy?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Scrappy Survivors</u></a> is a fun deck that’s helmed by a very good boy, Dogmeat, Ever Loyal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea is scrapping Aura and Equipment cards through milling, and then reclaiming them onto your creatures. Given there are some high-mana cards that fit the bill like Almost Perfect and Mantle of the Agents, it’s a solid plan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Codsworth, Handy Helper has seen its price skyrocket, too, thanks to some Final Fantasy synergies, while Silver Shroud Costume is still holding a decent value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mutant Menace</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226649"><div id="226649" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Mutant Menace</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The kind of deck that elicits a collective groan at any table, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YWvA4?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mutant Menace</u></a> is another Fallout deck, but one that’s far less wholesome than the last entry on this list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, Mothman’s whole shtick is the ‘Rad Counter’ mechanic which means players mill every turn. Doing so not only burns through their deck at an alarming rate once it gets going, but also powers up The Wise Mothman himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mutational Advantage and Power Fist are still pretty valuable, alongside Guardian Project, but the biggest draw is that nothing plays quite like this.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Riders of Rohan</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226650"><div id="226650" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Riders of Rohan</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sticking with Universes Beyond, while many of the plaudits went to other decks in the Lord of the Rings Commander lineup, <a href="https://zdcs.link/akK6OX?object_uuid=7bd959b6-28fc-4b23-8997-9b500bbc3eec&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Riders of Rohan</u></a> is powerful and relatively simple.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eowyn, Shieldmaiden lets you build an army of token creatures with trample and haste, and turn those into card advantage, while also being a 5/4 with first strike in her own right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With cards like Beregond of the Guard able to pump those tokens and give them vigilance, it’s not uncommon for this deck to be the most aggressive at the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Door of Destinies is the priciest reprint, so you can find this precon a little cheaper than others.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Revenant Recon</h2></div><div catalogid="1a55b4be-3681-4113-a0db-7db754e45084" id="226651"><div id="226651" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Revenant Recon</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this Murders at Karlov Manor deck the best around?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-converted-kevin-feiges-son/">Marvel Rivals</a> has been one of the most popular games of 2025 so far, and has already introduced <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-3-5-release-date-update/">several famous Marvel characters</a> to its roster, with more on the horizon. But if you were wondering if NetEase would ever go beyond the limits of the vast list of characters in the Marvel universe, that option seems significantly more likely after recent comments from the game's director, Guangguang.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/netease-green-light-marvel-create-original-characters-marvel-rivals">MP1st</a>, when asked if making an original character was something NetEase was even allowed to do, Guangguang confirmed that NetEase does in fact have Marvel and Disney's approval to make an original character for the game. As to whether NetEase will take advantage of that free reign, Guangguang simply said to "<em>Stay tuned</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Yes, we are allowed to introduce original characters in Marvel Rivals</em>," Guangguang said in response to the question of whether NetEase could even go that route.</p>



<p>Guangguang doesn't confirm or deny that they're looking to make an original character, but it's exciting for players and Marvel fans to know that the option is open to the studio. Though, as interesting as it would be to see NetEase create their own Marvel character, it's worth wondering if that is even worth the time and investment with a game like Marvel Rivals, that leans so heavily on NetEase taking well-known existing characters from the Marvel universe and putting their own artistic spin on their design and gameplay mechanics.</p>



<p>NetEase puts its own stamp on the Marvel franchise with its sharp designs for each character. It doesn't necessarily need to go the extra step and create a wholly original character, but it's nice to know that the option is there for the team if they ever decide to use it. And who knows, there could be one waiting in the wings to be announced with the game's next major update.</p>



<p>As Guangguang said, we'll have to wait and see what NetEase does next.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Two years ago we learned, thanks to the FTC, that Microsoft was working on a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/22/23770460/microsoft-xbox-xcloud-gaming-subscription">separate “dedicated” version</a> of Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft Gaming CFO Tim Stuart then hinted, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/23999661/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-free-version-ads">a few months later</a>, that there could be a free version Xbox Cloud Gaming in exchange for ads. Now, Microsoft is hinting at making Xbox Cloud Gaming “more affordable” again.</p><p>Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s VP of Next Generation, has appeared on the company’s official Xbox podcast today, to discuss Xbox Cloud Gaming, Xbox Play Anywhere, and Microsoft’s next-gen chip partnership with AMD. At the moment Xbox Cloud Gaming is only part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, meaning you have to pay $19.99 a month to get access to xCloud.</p><p>“One of the things we see is there’s a lot of players who use Game Pass Ultimate to access the cloud, whether that’s the primary way they play, or an additional way to play on the go,” says Ronald. “I think for us, it really opens up the opportunity to make it much more affordable, and make it more accessible to players. Whether that’s going into new regions, or new ways to actually access the [Xbox] cloud.”</p><p>Microsoft’s hints of a more affordable version of Xbox Cloud Gaming come just hours before Nvidia has some “major” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760527/nvidia-geforce-now-major-news-gamescom-stream">GeForce Now news</a>. Nvidia’s cloud gaming service is far superior to Xbox Cloud Gaming, thanks to PC-powered performance, better bitrates, higher resolution gameplay, and lower latency. Microsoft has even integrated GeForce Now into its own Xbox game pages.</p><p>Ronald stops short of announcing a new Xbox Cloud Gaming tier, but it’s clear that’s been Microsoft’s thinking for a few years now. Microsoft started expanding Xbox Cloud Gaming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300547/xbox-cloud-gaming-game-library-streaming">beyond just the Game Pass library</a> last year, with the ability to stream games you own as long as you’re an Ultimate subscriber.</p><p>There’s an opportunity to bring that Ultimate paywall down, especially for mobile streaming. Microsoft had planned to sell games directly in its Xbox app for Android and allow customers to immediately stream those games directly to their phones and tablets, but a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313976/microsoft-google-xbox-app-android-future-notepad">legal battle</a> has put those plans on hold.</p><p>Microsoft is currently preparing the next generation of Xbox Cloud Gaming, alongside its next-gen Xbox console work. “Together with AMD, we’re designing dedicated silicon and hardware to enable the next generation of gaming experiences,” says Ronald. “We’re investing deeply in the next generation of rendering technologies, such as neural rendering, which will bring a new level of quality to the games that you’re having.”</p><p>That next generation of Xbox hardware will likely see Xbox and Windows move even closer together, alongside the choice of different stores for Xbox owners. It’s also an opportunity for Microsoft to bring more AI-powered features to the next Xbox.</p><p>“We’re also investing in dedicated silicon to enable the next generation of AI capabilities, that will be transformative in how you actually experience your gameplay,” says Ronald. Microsoft will “start experimenting” with some of these AI-powered features on the upcoming Xbox Ally X device, because it has a dedicated NPU chip just like Microsoft’s Copilot Plus PCs.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/760813/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-new-price-plan-hint]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's rare for Epic Games to make a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Icon skin for a content creator who isn't specifically focused on Fortnite, but it <em>does</em> happen occasionally. And it looks like another influencer is joining that club this week, as Kai Cenat teased on Sunday.</p><p>As the tweet indicates, Cenat is going to reveal the new skin on Monday night at 8:30 PM PT / 11:30 PM ET, and the announcement should happen live on Twitch, since that's usually how they do these things. There will probably be a tournament in the next few days where players can earn the skin for free, before it releases in the item shop later in the week.</p><p>Fortnite typically awards Icon skins--that being a skin based on a real human being, rather than a fictional character--either to streamers who have a specific focus on Fortnite, or celebrities who are much more broadly famous, like Mariah Carey, Shaquille O'Neal, Sabrina Carpenter, and other folks like that.</p><p>Cenat, however, is Fortnite's third Icon Skin, after Mr. Beast and Khaby Lame, that falls in between those two categories--content creators who are famous enough to get a skin despite not being known for playing Fortnite. Epic doesn't do this very often. The Mr. Beast skins were released in December 2022, and Khaby Lame was on the Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass two years ago. Cenat will be the first such Icon skin to hit Fortnite since Khaby Lame.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[CI Games says Lords of the Fallen 2 will be their “Empire Strikes Back” Moment, and a “Darker” Game Than the 2023 Reboot]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ci-games-lords-of-the-fallen-2-empire-strikes-back-dark-knight/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ci-games-says-lords-of-the-fallen-2-will-be-their-%E2%80%9Cempire-strikes-back%E2%80%9D-moment-and-a-%E2%80%9Cdarker%E2%80%9D-game-than-the-2023-reboot.1273032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The very first Lords of the Fallen release came in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/265300/Lords_Of_The_Fallen_2014/">2014</a>, and while it was able to find an audience, it ultimately didn't make a huge splash. Despite a myriad of issues, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">2023 reboot</a> fared much better, so much that CI Games has already announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-egs/">sequel in the works</a> for 2026. After spending a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/">significant amount of time fixing the 2023 release</a>, the studio is confident that its sequel, titled Lords of the Fallen 2, will be the studio's "<em>Empire Strikes Back</em>" moment.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/lords-of-the-fallen-2-ci-games-empire-strikes-back-sequel-darker-title">MP1st</a>, creative portfolio strategist at CI Games, David Valjalo, likened Lords of the Fallen 2 to the famed Star Wars sequel back when the original trilogy was all we knew, or for those who may not have grown up with Star Wars the way Valjalo's generation did, he instead likened it to the studio's Dark Knight moment, the famous sequel in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy.</p>



<p>"<em>We're right on track and in the thick of it now</em>," Valjalo said. "<em>The sequel is looking spectacular. I have the privilege of seeing all the juicy behind the scenes bits and pieces - art, animation, combat, - and each day there's something that just stops me in my tracks. It's bloody, bold, brave...it's a true sequel. It improves on the previous game but carries its spirit forward. It's also a darker game, tonally, with a really unique setting and even higher stakes than the last game, if you can believe that. It's our Empire Strikes Back. Or for Gen Z I suppose it's their Dark Knight</em>."</p>



<p>Strong words from a studio that took two years to release an overhauled "<em>2.0</em>" version of their last game that launched with a bevy of issues, so many that our reviewer called it "<em>one of the most frustrating Souslikes ever released</em>." CI Games also recently permanently reduced the price of the 2023 title, and every game in its catalogue, as part of what it called its <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-permanent-price-cut-ci-games/">"<em>player first</em>" commitment</a> that also couldn't help but read like an apology for the fact that they released a product below their standards two-years prior.</p>



<p>If it does hit its 2026 target release window, then perhaps by 2028 it'll be the studio's 'Empire Strikes Back' for the series.</p>

              <p><span>I like horror movies okay, but I need a good concept to draw me in. </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span> certainly has one of those, but the concept that makes it compelling is also one that taps into my most </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-nickname-pet-name-go-black-white-legends-arceus-1850392164"><span>deep seated fears</span></a><span>, and I don’t know if I can handle it. As the name suggests, </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is a spooky movie whose events are viewed from the perspective of a dog. Aren’t we as humans subjected to the horrors enough? Do we need to bring our canine companions into the pain and suffering?</span></p> <p><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>premiered at South by Southwest way back in March, and the reception to the supernatural horror movie has been </span><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/good_boy_2025"><span>really strong so far</span></a><span>, with early reviews </span><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/good-boy-movie-horror-movie-review-dog-pov-1235102488/"><span>calling it one of the best in the genre this year</span></a><span>. Though I don’t know where it all ends up, several reviews call out that it’s very emotional and heartbreaking—which could mean anything, really—so if you’re looking for a straightforward scare, be aware that </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>might have a bit more going on. The film stars Indy as a dog whose owner has suffered a death in the family and who moves into a haunted house. Ever the watchful companion, Indy notices that something is amiss and he and his owner are not alone. Now, he has to do what he can to save his owner from the dangers lurking in their new home.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Good Boy - Official Trailer | HD | IFC Films" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4-CRkd_74g?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Y’all, I’mma throw up. There’s a reason Does the Dog Die?, an entire website dedicated to </span><a href="https://www.doesthedogdie.com/"><span>asking if a dog you see in movie trailers is going to die</span></a><span>, exists, and it’s for people like me who can’t handle that shit. There’s already a page for </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>on that website and I saw it as I was grabbing the link. I can barely handle seeing a dog be in distress under normal circumstances, much less supernatural ones. Whether Indy makes it out or not, he’s about to have a bad night. I guess I’ve got some time to figure out if I want to see </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>, as the movie is coming to theaters on October 3. </span></p>

              <p>The second season of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505">Amazon Prime’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> show</a> arrives later this year, but before then, we have some new images of the post-apocalyptic series, and one in particular featuring a shot of Las Vegas before the bombs dropped and turned it into <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-series-prime-new-vegas-canon-1851410280">New Vegas</a> is very, very intriguing.</p> <p>On August 18, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/fallout-first-photos-season-2-1236489897/">Amazon shared seven new images</a>&nbsp;of the upcoming season of its hit <em>Fallout</em> TV show. The new screenshots show a variety of characters and locations, but the one that immediately caught my eye was a single shot of Howard Cooper (Walton Goggins) in a car driving down the Las Vegas Strip. (After the bombs fall, it becomes New Vegas.) In the window is a reflection of the Lucky 38’s large and iconic sign, first seen in <a href="https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346">2010’s <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>.</a> In the show, Cooper survives the bombs falling and becomes the decaying bounty hunter known only as the Ghoul. But before that, he had a life pre-war that intersected with Vault-Tec and the company’s nefarious plans. And now it seems like he might have met Mr. House, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-tv-mr-house-new-vegas-1851559169">a villain from <em>New Vegas</em> who was teased back in season one</a>. Okay, <em>Fallout</em> season two, you have my attention.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618243" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618243"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618243">©Amazon / Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>The other teaser images released by Amazon include looks at Ella Purnell’s loveable Lucy and Aaron Morten’s Maximus. We also see Lucy’s dad, played by Kyle MacLachlan, who was revealed to be a pretty bad guy at the end of the show’s first season. He ran off in a power suit to New Vegas, and it seems we’ll be catching up with him later this year. Of course, this isn’t <em>actually</em> the first time we’ve seen some of this stuff, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-new-vegas-set-leaks-lucky-38-amazon-1851768855">as set leaks earlier this year</a> hinted at some pre-war flashbacks set in Las Vegas.</p>     <p>Last year, after premiering in April, the <em>Fallout</em> series received rave reviews, big ratings, and lots of award nominations, leading to a spike in people playing old <em>Fallout</em> games. Amazon quickly announced a second season, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-prime-bethesda-1851421573">which wrapped up filming in May</a>. The highly anticipated new season of <em>Fallout</em> arrives on Amazon Prime this December, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-trailer-new-vegas-season-3-ghoul-lucy-1851780416">the show has already been picked up for a third season</a>. Here’s a teaser for the show’s second season:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fallout Season 2 Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tu5EN8V35JM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

<p>It's not a huge surprise, of course, but it's good to see, nonetheless. Slightly further down, you'll also see that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is still doing pretty well at number three, jumping up one position from the previous week. And of course, just like recent weeks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is also hanging out in the top ten, producing yet another double-whammy for Nintendo.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_PuEn0ZOn5c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f036zlkxnp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PuEn0ZOn5c" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> does when it launches later this year. Be sure to keep an eye out for the upcoming Direct presentation on <strong>19th Aug</strong> for more information!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of 2025’s biggest and most important titles is a remake—Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. It’s a full remake of MGS3, and the review embargo will tell us if it’s lived up to the original game’s legend, or if it’s fallen flat on its face in Tselinoyarsk mud.</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid is an all-time franchise. Its stories still stand the test of time, and there are gameplay ideas that had they not been done previously would be unthinkable in 2025—although looking at the back of the game case would be slightly problematic in the digital era. I don’t think there’s a finer example of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-boss-fights-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MGS than Snake Eater</a>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater remake</a> is a fitting first reimagining. Even though Hideo Kojima isn’t at the helm of the project, we still expect this to be a hit. So let’s check out its review embargo details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Fans will hang onto the word of reviews. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Several sources have quoted August 22 as the game’s review embargo date, with a release time of 12:01 AM PT.</strong></p>



<p>Many outlets and critics already seem to have gotten their hands on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. You can see from Destin Legarie’s <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page that this is the case.</p>



<p>Destin is quoted as saying: “I’ve played Metal Gear Solid Delta on PS5 and PC. Embargoed for Friday, August 22nd, 2025 as 12:01am PT. Coverage beyond me fanboying will be live at embargo.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>I’ve played Metal Gear Solid Delta on PS5 and PC.

Embargoed for Friday August 22nd, 2025 as 12:01am PT

Coverage beyond me fanboying will be live at embargo.</span></p></article></div>







<p><strong>Expectations for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater are sky-high, and I expect the reviews to follow suit with a Metacritic score in the region of 90-95.</strong></p>



<p>A telltale sign that Konami is confident about Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is that review copies are already out weeks in advance. The other sign is the review embargo date being a week before launch. Companies only do this if they’re confident about their product.</p>



<p>I would suggest Konami is more than happy with the state of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. This is great news when you consider 2004’s original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater has a <strong>91/100 rating</strong> on Metacritic. As long as the remake builds upon existing greatness and adds some modern-day quality of life changes, it’s hard to see the score dropping below 91.</p>



<p>Using my reasoning, I don’t think a <strong>92 or 93</strong> score is out of the question.</p>



<hr>



<p>The wait for the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review embargo will be more excruciating than Naked Snake using CQC to battle a crab. Let me know what score you think the Snake Eater remake is going to score. Be sure to check out the Insider Gaming forum for more MGS discussions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're still on the hunt for a Switch 2 console, here's a rare opportunity to get one at a discounted price. In fact, this may very well be the only Switch 2 deal we'll see for 2025. AliExpress is offering a genuine <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wR6Ay?object_uuid=01572a01-6e23-42b9-be2f-996e784ab5e0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a> for just $428.99 after you apply a $100 off coupon code "<strong>AEUS100</strong>" or "<strong>USAFF100</strong>" during checkout. Alternatively you can bundle it <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxA4Lk?object_uuid=01572a01-6e23-42b9-be2f-996e784ab5e0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">with the Mario Kart World game</a> for just $452.11 after the same coupon. Both consoles ship free locally from the United States and arrives within 1 to 2 weeks, however you will still have to pay local sales tax.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The catch? Although these are genuine Switch consoles, they are Hong Kong imports. Like all Switch consoles, they are <strong>region unlocked</strong>, meaning you can play them in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. They'll come with a Hong Kong style plug, but a US adapter is included. Imported consoles do not get a US-based Nintendo warranty. AliExpress does include a 90-day free returns window for the Switch 2 console and a 15-day free returns window for the Mario Kart bundle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch 2 Is on Sale at AliExpress</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Brand new, genuine, imported, region unlocked units</strong></em></p><div catalogid="36a3b9f5-2ced-42c2-8fd0-f4fa3b4e7cdd" id="223120"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 console was released on June 5. It is backwards compatible with nearly all Switch 2 games as well as the original Joy-Cons and Switch Pro controller, although the new Switch 2 controllers offer more functionality. In his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2 review</a>, Tom Marks sums up the Switch 2 as "a vital but unexciting upgrade to a console I already love."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two major Switch 2 video games have been released: Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Logan Plant reviewed Mario Kart World</a> and wrote that "Mario Kart World may not make the most convincing case that going open-world was the boost the series needed, but excellent multiplayer racing, incredible polish, and the thrilling new Knockout Tour mode still more than live up to its legacy." <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7xlD?object_uuid=01572a01-6e23-42b9-be2f-996e784ab5e0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a> currently sells for $79 if purchased separately, so it makes a lot of sense to buy it as a combo with the console for only about $23 more ($57 in savings), even if it means going through the workaround process mentioned above.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Donkey Kong Bananza is the Only 10/10 Masterpiece of 2025</h2></div><div catalogid="7e14ca20-d3b4-46c3-be95-0d920f6e2169" id="227037"><div id="227037" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only did we rate Donkey Kong a 10/10, it's the <em>only</em> game we've given a Masterpiece rating so far this year. In his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>, Logan Plant writes that <strong>"</strong>The leader of the bunch is finally back to kick some tail in Donkey Kong Bananza, a brilliant successor to Super Mario Odyssey and a smashing return for a classic Nintendo character. Granted there isn't too much competition in the way of Switch exclusive games for 2025, this has been a fantastic year so far for console gaming in general. We've seen some of the best games released in recent history, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/17/kingdom-come-deliverance-review">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Death Stranding 2</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, all of which got close to a Masterpiece rating but didn't quite hit the mark. That's not to say that Donkey Kong Bananza is necessarily better than those other games since, after all, different people have reviewed each of these games, but it's a testament to just how outstanding Donkey Kong Bananza is on its own merits to have achieved that score.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

<p>If the above image wasn't enough of a giveaway, we're talking about Rayquaza, the Gen III legendary dragon. As it turns out, there are a few different ways that folks have been pronouncing this one, with the big split being between 'Ray-KWAY-zuh' and 'Ray-KWAH-zuh'. At least, that <em>was</em> the big divide, because TPC laid out the <em>official</em> pronunciation at this week's competition — it's <strong>Ray-KWAY-zuh</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fnxsgou&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Now yes, more than a few of you are likely shouting "well, of course it is!!" at your screen of choice right now, and you would be correct. After all, that's how the name has been pronounced in the anime for years, and even the 3DS' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/pokedex_3d_pro">Pokédex 3D Pro</a> was perfectly matched in its emphasis. But that's not to say that everyone agrees.</p>
<p>A brief glance across social media reveals a swathe of Pokéfans who aren't about to back down from their own pronunciation, official or not. The big question is, how do you say it? Have you always been on the side of TPC, or do you opt for something else entirely? You can let us know in the following poll.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Destiny: Rising is a new mobile title from developer and publisher NetEase, licensed by Bungie, and it's due out in just 10 days from the time of this writing. It was first announced back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/">October 2024</a>, and since then the hype around it for mobile gaming and Destiny fans has built to the point where now, days before release, NetEase confirms that over 10 million players have pre-registered for Destiny: Rising.</p>



<p>NetEase has also debuted a new trailer for Destiny: Rising, featuring Gwynn the Reaper, a new character who will be playable in Destiny: Rising when it arrives in a little more than a week's time.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Destiny: Rising | Gwynn Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cUEDuuYEkG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The pre-registration milestone doesn't just mean a moment of celebration for NetEase, as it's also a boon for the millions of players ready to jump into the fight on August 28. NetEase set rewards that players would receive the more people pre-registered, with 10 million being the final goal to be reached to unlock an exotic ornament.</p>



<p>While these pre-registration numbers are good news for NetEase, it can't help but seem like mixed news for Bungie, because it feels like the most significant Destiny release players are excited for is a game that they didn't have very much to do with.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Bungie's in hot water trying to figure out how to re-introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/">Marathon</a> to players following its plagiarism scandal, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-out-now/">Edge of Fate</a>, the latest expansion for Destiny 2 seems to have come and gone without much fanfare.</p>



<p>We'll see if the rest of the year can potentially get a bit better for Bungie. In the meantime, NetEase is prepared to enjoy having two of the biggest games of the year in their portfolio between <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-converted-kevin-feiges-son/">Marvel Rivals</a> and Destiny: Rising.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rewilders-the-lost-spring-new-action-roguelite-bafta-winning-herobeat-studios/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bafta-winning-developer-herobeat-studios-announces-next-title-action-roguelite-rewilders-the-lost-spring.1272975/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217470/Rewilders_The_Lost_Spring/">Rewilders: The Lost Spring</a> is a new action-roguelite game from the BAFTA-winning developer, Herobeat Studios, the team behind 2022's heart-wrenching indie, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-dominates-bafta-games-awards-2023-with-five-wins/">Endling - Extinction Is Forever</a>.</p>



<p>Only the studio's second project and its first self-published title, Rewilders: The Lost Spring, will be heading to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch at some point in the future, as a release date or even a release window for the title was not announced. </p>



<p>According to a press release, Rewilders will feature "<em>some themes with Endling on the story and narrative</em>," but the gameplay is significantly different as Herobeat calls Rewilders a "<em>creature collection</em>" game with <em>"metroidvania-like progression</em>" that's also a "<em>Soulslite</em>," on top of the other descriptors already put to the game as an "<em>action roguelite</em>."</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Rewilders: The Lost Spring puts you in the shoes of Abi, who is returning to their home planet after surviving a terrible event that poisoned the surface of their home. You'll collect creatures called Hântu, and bring them along on your missions into the various corrupted biomes you'll attempt to heal.</p>



<p>Levelling up, feeding, and bringing different Hântu along with you on each excursion can help shape your strategic approach to each run, while planting and growing different resources back at your sky base helps unlock permanent upgrades, as is the roguelite tradition.</p>



<p>Even though the narrative will share some themes with Herobeat's debut game, it's good and interesting to see the talented team flex its skills with a new gameplay approach. Hopefully, we'll hear more on Rewilders: The Lost Spring, soon.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/18/shenmue-iii-enhanced-announced-for-consoles-and-pc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shenmue-iii-enhanced-announced-for-consoles-and-pc.1272951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Shenmue III is the latest game to be polished up for the current generation of consoles, that being PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and “Nintendo” – presumably Switch 2.</p>
<p>The enhancements are fairly minor, the game never really pushed Unreal Engine, and all you’re getting this time are 4k Textures and “Enhanced Graphics and Performance”. These are not specified but that’s probably because they don’t want to say 4K 60fps when Switch 2 might not manage that.</p>


<p>You also get faster load times, which are entirely due to the game upgrade and not because everyone has a SSD these days. DLSS/FSR Support will be added along with a Classic Camera mode and minor gameplay tweaks. Here’s the full list of improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Graphics and Performance</strong>&nbsp;– Sharper textures, richer details, faster load times, and smoother gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>4K Texture Uplift</strong>&nbsp;– Refined, more detailed environments and characters.</li>
<li><strong>DLSS/FSR Support</strong>&nbsp;– High-quality upscaling without sacrificing performance (supported platforms only).</li>
<li><strong>Increased NPC Density</strong>&nbsp;– The city village Niaowu feels more alive with more characters populating the streets.</li>
<li><strong>Classic Camera Mode</strong>&nbsp;– An optional camera perspective inspired by&nbsp;<em>Shenmue</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Shenmue II</em>, alongside the modern view.</li>
<li><strong>Gameplay Tweaks</strong>&nbsp;– Optional stamina system adjustments, health restoration before fights, and reduced money barriers for smoother progression.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Interactions</strong>&nbsp;– Cutscene and conversation skip options, expanded quick-time event timing window for more accessible gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>Menu and User&nbsp;Experience&nbsp;Enhancements</strong>&nbsp;– Streamlined navigation and helpful purchase alerts.</li>
<li><strong>Optionality First</strong>&nbsp;– All major changes can be toggled to preserve the original experience for purists.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you own the PS4 or PC version, there will be an upgrade path. A release date for Shenmue III Enhanced has not been announced.&nbsp; There’s no trailer or screenshots either, so here’s a kitten instead.</p>

<figure><a title="titanic scion preview" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/20a90ece310c0/titanic-scion-preview.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure><p>When Nintendo Life reviewed the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/daemon_x_machina">Daemon X Machina</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/daemon_x_machina">back in 2019</a>, Chris Scullion called it "a solid mech action game that controls well and gives the player a generous helping of customisation options." However, he noted that mission structure, performance, and overall story were lacking, which dragged things down a little.</p>
<p>Fast-forward six years and I'm back in the land of Femto and giant laser swords for Marvelous' supercharged sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a>, which makes a whole raft of big changes that should, in theory, alleviate some of the downsides with the original experience.</p>
<p>Let's rewind a minute first to give newly interested parties — and those, like me, with a short memory — a quick rundown of what this series is all about. You assume the role of an Outer (that's the name for a new breed of human that arrived in the aftermath of the "Moonfall calamity") and, as a result, you're a bit of killing machine. Outers, you see, have been exposed to Femto, a mysterious red alien material that's spread around the planet, and they can therefore upgrade aspects of themselves for battle - which is very useful when you're starring in a video game about battles.</p>

<p>As a mech-suited Femto merc, then, you're on the front line of a desperate war for humanity's survival against corrupted AIs who're currently rebelling against their human creators. Piloting a fully customisable mech known as an Arsenal, you team up with other mercs (CPU and/or human) to complete missions to defeat the AI "Immortals" once and for all. So, it's kinda like a standard Saturday night in Glasgow, basically.</p>
<p>It's in the customisation and building of mechs that the first game found a lot of its depth, attempting to give us a proper meaty robot experience for folks who love to build, paint and outfit these great big death machines, whilst also giving us large areas to blast around in. 2019's effort did well, for the most part, in presenting all of this on Switch, and on systems where it didn't struggle with performance (whilst also looking quite a lot nicer, it has to be said), it's a game that still warrants a playthrough. Think <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/armored_core">Armored Core</a>, but newer and a bit sexier, and you're almost all of the way there.</p>
<p>Moving on to Titanic Scion, and having played up to the end of the first nine chapters for this preview, I'm heavily impressed thus far with what Marvelous is getting up to. This is a much bigger and more open game than its predecessor, that's immediately apparent, and although it's not a fully open world, its segmented regions are huge (well, so far anyway) and the time it takes to travel betwixt them means it's got the necessary sense of epic scale and draw which was somewhat missing from part one.</p>

<p>Movement, whether on land or in the air, has also seen some big changes, or at least it feels that way to me. Everything is zippier and more approachable, and combat in general is a different beast as a result of this. Part of it comes down to the actual physical size of the mech suits, as the ones I've used so far are more slimline and fast-moving exosuits than any sort of traditional, tanky robot design. Another part comes down to new systems in place to make the whole thing more interesting.</p>
<p>I've already seen some comparisons online to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter</a> in the approach that Marvelous is taking, you can see it in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-drops-two-new-gameplay-videos">the combat trailers</a> and other things that they've released so far, but in practice...wow...yeah, it really does feel quite like a big robot take on Capcom's series in its more modern form.</p>
<p>Missions are carried out in much the same way as the original, with preparation crucial in your downtime. Buying new weapons, crafting, re-speccing, and outfitting your mech, and then jettisoning yourself out into huge big landscapes where you are free to explore as you wish, before heading towards whatever objective marker is up next. Heck, you can even knock parts and materials off enemy mechs to use in crafting. How much more Monster can this Hunt get?</p>

<p>Yep, as you might have pieced together yourself if you've checked out any of the reveal trailers, Immortal enemies all now have, well, it's kinda like DNA. They each have their own little genetic marker collectibles that you can strip from them once they are dead, and these are then collected to unlock a ton of skills and buffs, new weaponry, new moves and mech parts. It feels deep. I haven't fought enough huge mechanised beasts or robots to really see where it all goes, but so far it makes for gameplay that has real motivation where the first game didn't. There's a lot of cool gear, a lot of upgrades and skills and ways to build, and seeking out big scraps and hunting down rare bad guys seems to be how you're going to get your hands on a lot of this stuff.</p>
<p>So, once you get your materials stripped off (and note that you can also whittle down a baddie and then get in close to start yanking off parts), you can start getting into the game's fusions. These give you upgrades split across four sections — Genes, Skeleton, Might, and Shell — and there's so many new weapon skills and moves to unlock here that you're going to be playing this one for <em>a long time</em> if it grabs your interest in any way.</p>
<p>Once you're out into the game's world and into any of its huge big hunting grounds, you can take on groups of bad guys, as well as lots of mutated local wildlife, wrestle back control of fast travel locations, and get busy hoovering up the contents of chests (the loot thus far has been pleasing) whilst also mining for materials. There's even an entire card game to play, which I have yet to find - even though I've already discovered quite a few special playing cards hidden around on my travels.</p>

<p>It's all great fun right out of the gate because it gives you the freedom to do all this stuff fairly quickly, and most of the huge arsenal of weapons you can acquire simply give you a tutorial on-the-fly as you pick them up. There's a balance being struck here between keeping things moving, keeping it exciting, and giving you the time, space, and depth you would want in a mech game. Listen, I am a big mech game fan, okay - we like to look at numbers and make the numbers go up and spend lots of time doing decals. All that stuff is here, too.</p>
<p>Oh, and I want to give a shoutout to a very small detail in how nabbing gear from fallen foes works, because it pleases me. When you open up the inventory to see what they've got, you'll be presented with multiple options, but you only get to choose <em>one</em> thing. Again, this might change with a perk, but it makes grabbing gear more interesting and exciting in the early hours. Place this on top of the fact there's just so many varieties of gear on offer, from great big auto-lock missile turrets down to schematics for graceful swords, and you've got a whole big bunch of ways to gear up, level up and grow into your role as an AI-killing machine.</p>
<p>In terms of the combat, once it gets going, it feels excellent. Locking onto targets is a simple matter of clicking the right stick - à la any Soulslike - and weapons can easily be cycled between your main left and right, two side weapons, and a bunch of different throwables, including grenades and lots of poison and fire traps so far. At the moment, I'm switching between two sets that give me dual-wielding SMGs, which work really well for smaller airborne enemies, and a sword and shield because it looks bad-ass.</p>

<p>You also have big old shoulder weapons and an auxiliary slot to place grenade launchers and other gadgets. Emergency dodges feel great to pull off, grabs (which you can do to dazed foes) make for a fun way to throw airborne enemies around, and the game's search mode does a neat and clean job of picking up hidden loot in your vicinity. Oh, and have I mentioned laser swords yet? I have? Good. There's loads of them.</p>
<p>I've got to say, too, that being able to ride around on horses you find in the wild whilst still in your mech suit, or driving around in regular army vehicles in the thing, besides the aesthetic of future-mech-badass-on-horseback (which is fairly epic as these things go), it also makes exploring feel a little <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo</a>-esque at times in how knockabout and silly it can be. Add in an early vehicle sequence and I get the feeling I'm in for a lot of huge big set pieces alongside action that, on the ground and in the air, feels great so far.</p>
<p>Nine chapters might sound like a lot, but in actual fact it's only brought me to what I would consider the first proper boss battle-of-sorts in the game. At this point, I've got the hang of fighting gangs of mechs in the air and on the ground. I've nailed the timings on my dodges, boosts and, to a lesser extent, barrel rolls (barrel rolls are back, baby...I just don't really know how I'm doing them yet!). I've also got the hang of the mining minigame that has you target and shoot little circles in order to knock down a gauge - the more critical hits you get, the better your haul.</p>

<p>I'm also getting a good feel for how smartly designed these initial areas are, with crystallised shards of Femto placed everywhere, you can just shoot at it from range and collect it up (Femto doubles as your fuel), meaning that I'm never really worrying about having to stop flying. Hooray! Indeed, flying around feels great. However, it's also where my one major issue with the game thus far begins to raise its head. Well, in docked mode it does, at least.</p>
<p>Now, for full transparency, prior to a Day One patch dropping during the preview period, I had to get a <em>little</em> negative about a few aspects of the game's performance in docked mode. It was pretty much fine in handheld, but once hooked up to a TV, it struggled as you pelted around the open world in places. Not a game-breaker, but a little worrying when playing a new game on a new console. However. Joy of joys! Now that patch is live, I have very few negative things to say.</p>
<p>Let's start with docked mode, where now both the resolution and frame rate are rock solid, thankfully. The only place I'm really seeing any notable stutters are when zipping into a new area. You'll notice that tell-tale micro-stutter as you make your way to the same point in the tunnels that link landmasses, for example. For a game this big, this action-packed and this nice-looking, I'm impressed.</p>

<p>In handheld, any little issues you may have in docked mode with textures or pop-in are minimised hugely on the smaller screen, and everything just feels that bit zippier and smoother. Where big open-world-esque adventure games on Switch 1 could often feel as though they were about to fall apart in trying to present high-octane action together with expansive landmasses (with the notable exception of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>), on Switch 2 it feels like we can breathe a bit more easily.</p>
<p>As for the controls, I was dreading there would be input lag and latency issues but they are nowhere to be found, and taking on huge monolithic robots who rise up dramatically from the sand when disturbed, or flocks of tiny mechanised annoyances as you zoom through the sky (there's an altitude limit in place so you don't get too close to the sun), things feel responsive whilst looking just-about on-point.</p>
<p>In fact, as I've just mentioned it, Xenoblade Chronicles X is a good frame of reference here. Take its mech combat - once it really gets going in the latter stages - and place it in a much more action-heavy and adult-oriented world. Now add a ton of depth to the robot weaponry, design and build aspects, and you're sort of getting close to what's going on here.</p>

<p>So, overall then, I'm thoroughly impressed with Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion so far. The narrative is only just getting started, so there's very little to discuss on that front. But in terms of spectacle, action, and depth with the mech builds, we could be onto a winner. I've arrived at a point in the tale where important characters, future squad mates and things of this nature are beginning to take shape and show up, and it's got me fully onboard. Indeed, I've already spied one or two potential new team members who I'm quite looking forward to getting to know.</p>
<p>There's also a nice, adult, grown-up feel to everything so far. It's dark, the stakes are high, and consequences are dire when mistakes are made. Throw in combat and exploration that's doing the business, (and the very exciting prospect of co-op mode once the thing actually releases) and I'm fairly excited to see where the rest of the game takes me.</p>
