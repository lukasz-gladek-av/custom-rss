<p>Use these Roblox FIFA Super Soccer monthly redeem codes to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including special Xmas packs, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIFA Super Soccer, as the title suggests, is an official FIFA-sponsored <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-fireball-training-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience centered around football, including attire, emotes, celebrations, and dribbling, among other talking points. Coins are the primary in-game currency and are rewarded to players after every match. The winning team, the MVP, and players who score goals earn more Coins. These Coins can be spent on various packs, however, they often cost several thousand Coins and require intense grinding. This is where active codes come in, as they can be redeemed not only for packs but also for free accessories and gear. This article covers all the active codes, inactive ones, instructions on how to redeem them, and more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marathon’s Visual Overhaul Has Some Fans Shocked At How Good It Looks While Others Think It’s Lost Its Soul]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-visuals-art-bungie-updated-director-2000655713</link>
            <guid>1392625</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bungie’s <em>Marathon </em>was&nbsp;recently re-revealed <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-runner-extraction-hardcore-1851775956">ahead of a March 2026 release window</a> and in addition to a number of new gameplay changes, the extraction shooter also looks surprisingly different from how it did during its 2025 alpha test. Whether that visual overhaul is good or not depends on who you ask. The glow-up has some fans more hyped than ever for the next multiplayer shooter from the makers of <em>Halo</em> and <em>Destiny</em>, but not everyone’s on board.</p> <p>While the studio recently released new gameplay footage as part of a recent vidoc <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-price-battle-pass-proximity-chat-2000653472">previewing the work that’s gone into the game</a> since it was originally delayed, there have also been leaks of recent closed beta tests <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ps4sga/20_minutes_of_new_marathon_gameplay_from_the/">going around</a>. Instead of shying away from how the game has visually evolved over the last six months, Bungie went ahead and released a brief before-and-after sizzle reel showing off the differences. The most notable shift is in the overall lighting, which is now much warmer with more dramatic shadows:</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">BEFORE // AFTER <a href="https://t.co/YdthsI78nm">pic.twitter.com/YdthsI78nm</a></p> <p>— Marathon (@MarathonTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2003888405449503173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>At first glance, it seems like there’s basically been another additional layer or two of visual depth and detail added to the visual presentation of each scene. It looks like the extra level of polish that you’d expect a game’s visuals to receive when going from alpha to the finished release, and which Bungie had already hinted at back when the game’s original open alpha test was taking place. The footage from those sessions was always a work-in-progress and supposed to be taken as such. The emphasis was more on having players react to the overall concept and moment-to-moment gameplay, all of which has been tweaked since its initially negative reception.</p>

 <p>“Genuine question how did this change in only a few months this is gorgeous,” <a href="https://x.com/Protheon_/status/2003955720262402494">wrote</a> <em>Destiny</em> streamer Protheon in response. “Yeah, that’s the stuff. Right into my veins please,” <a href="https://x.com/Skarrow9/status/2003894013641085355">shared</a> Skarrow9, another <em>Destiny</em> content creator. Prospective players were also impressed. “Like, come on, dude. This shit looks so good. We STILL got people who thought the alpha was gonna be the final product, too. I can’t fucking wait,” <a href="https://x.com/EndlessGl/status/2004348217782378572">wrote</a> X user EndlessGL.</p>

 <p>Not everyone’s on board, however. One of the major selling points of <em>Marathon</em> is its “<a href="https://x.com/josephacross/status/1663415932344225794">Graphic Realism</a>” art style that makes it look a bit like an early 2000s Nike ad by way of <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>. A lot of the the original <em>Marathon</em> alpha footage looked a bit hazy and unfinished, but it was also enveloped in some more striking color palette contrasts; hyper-saturated pinks and neon yellows pop among the cold steely blues and latex blacks.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Went from kinda unique looking to "Focus M, Bowser's castle is just up ahead" <a href="https://t.co/0SqZpOCfgB">https://t.co/0SqZpOCfgB</a></p> <p>— SSSS.ayah (@SayaDoesStuff) <a href="https://twitter.com/SayaDoesStuff/status/2004071219902198199?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The shift to more conventional, warmer lighting has some dunking on the new <em>Marathon</em> look as a generic fan reshade mod. “They replaced the cool minimalist environment art and deliberate use of color with generic ue5 rtx shadows fucking whyyyyyyyy,” wrote one person. “Went from kinda unique looking to ‘Focus M, Bowser’s castle is just up ahead,'” <a href="https://x.com/SayaDoesStuff/status/2004071219902198199">wrote</a> another. The post, with over 54,000 likes, was referencing a <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-parody-viral-voice-actor-ue5-instagram-2000655479">recent viral parody</a>&nbsp;of what <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> would look and sound like as a conventional AAA blockbuster.</p>

 <p><em>Marathon</em> doesn’t need to win over folks like this to succeed, and many fans were asking Bungie for a grittier, more realistic look to the extraction shooter while it was being tweaked during the recent delay. They’ll no doubt be satisfied by how the game’s overall visual presentation is shaping up. Bungie, and <em>Marathon</em> in particular, have also become popular to hate on for various online contingents who don’t actually have any personal stake in the game succeeding or any apparent interest in actually playing it. So it’s easy to brush off any nitpicking as just more online noise.</p>

 <p>But I’ll be curious to see just how much the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-shooter-best-vibrant-colorful-bungie-trailer-1850481359">striking imagery around <em>Marathon</em>‘s original reveal</a> can survive the messy road to actually shipping it. Senior art director Joseph Cross, who played a central role in helping define the visual language of the game, recently left the studio just months ahead of its new release date. “I’m super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years,” he told <em>Kotaku </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-2000654665">earlier this month</a>.</p>

            <p>The Switch 2 is out and Nintendo’s original handheld/console hybrid getting ready to sail west to the summer country. Since 2017, Nintendo has made the most of less-powerful hardware and created an ecosystem unlike that offered by its direct competitors. Compared to its high-end rivals, including its own next-gen successor, the Switch is by no means a very powerful way to play games today. But it’s still one of the most affordable and versatile, allowing you to play console-quality games from almost anywhere, from your couch to the bus. If you’re just now hopping on the Switch train—it’s still regularly <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-used-prices-xbox-series-x-s-preowned-2000614748">one of the cheapest machines on the market</a>—here are the best games to start with.</p>

              <p><span>Oh hey, it’s been a while since we did one of these. Actually, before we get to my favorite games of 2025, here were my favorite games of 2024 that I was so </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shepardcdr.bsky.social/post/3ldmmw2n25c2x"><span>rudely not allowed to tell y’all about</span></a><span> last year.</span></p> <ol> <li><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></li> <li><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></li> <li><em>Mouthwashing</em></li> <li><em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em></li> <li><em>1000xResist</em></li> <li><em>Shadow Generations</em></li> <li><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></li> <li><em>Astro Bot</em></li> <li><em>Marvel Rivals</em></li> <li><em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em></li> </ol> <p><span>I tend to get pretty reflective when I write these end-of-year lists. My </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-games-2022-pokemon-legends-arceus-overwatch-ofk-1849935691"><span>2022 list</span></a><span> was written mere days after I started here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-games-2023-baldurs-gate-3-cyberpunk-sf6-1851113163#:~:text=Baldur's%20Gate%203%20to%20Pok%C3%A9mon%3A%20Kenneth%20Shepard's%20Most%20Spellbinding%20Games%20Of%202023,-Pok%C3%A9monRPGStreet"><span>my 2023 one</span></a><span> was put together shortly after I’d watched the site I’d moved my life across the country for get torn asunder in spite. I imagine my 2024 list would have read similarly, but my 2025 one? I’m maybe a little more hopeful than I’ve been in a while.</span></p> <p><span>In 2025, I’ve started to feel my spark come back. I’m writing things I’m proud of, I’m enjoying games like I’ve regained my sense of taste, and every now and again I get riled up about something happening in the industry with a passion that once felt like it had been siphoned out of me. In a roundabout way, my anger at an industry that keeps finding new ways to treat the people in it like they’re disposable is probably a good thing. A year ago, or even six months ago, I might have just let out a defeated sigh and rolled my eyes, then turned back to the blog mines. Now? I can feel my blood boiling again in a way it hasn’t in a long time.</span></p>

 <p><span>There are days when I still feel like I’m getting back on my feet, and like my legs are shaking underneath me as I try to stand tall again. Well, as tall as a 5’3” man can, at least. But if I’m feeling something about the games I’m playing and writing about, that’s an improvement over this time last year, when I wondered if I’d ever feel that again. Here are the 10 games that helped me get my spark back.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Honorable mentions: Battle Suit Aces, Absolum, After Love EP</span></i></p> <figure id="attachment_2000655449" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655449"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655449">© Surgent Studios</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>10.<i>&nbsp;Dead Take</i></b></h2> <p><span>Surgent Studio’s escape room horror game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-take-review-ben-starr-neil-newbon-horror-game-1851787439"><i><span>Dead Take</span></i></a> <span>was one of the biggest surprises of 2025 for me. Though I find its overreliance on jump scares exhausting, I was enamored with how it captures the horrors of being in a competitive, creative field. During a long exploration of an abandoned mansion after a party he wasn’t invited to, Chase Lowry discovers horrors beyond comprehension behind every locked door(and some captured on USB drives). Even if I’m not an actor, anyone who has worked in a competitive, creative field knows how dangerous people in power with a cult of personality can be. They’ll manipulate people into betraying one another, and the desperate will grovel at their feet in the hopes that some of their prestige and notoriety will trickle down into their hands. Desperation breeds tragedy, but so does selfishness, and </span><i><span>Dead Take </span></i><span>delivers that unmistakable truth in every corner and hidden passage of its mansion.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000005257" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005257"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005257">© Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>9.<i>&nbsp;Split Fiction</i></b></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><i><span>Split Fiction</span></i></a> <span>was an early favorite for GOTY that I feel like a lot of people cooled on pretty quickly. I understand why, to some extent. Its storytelling, while well-intentioned with its parallels to current anti-AI sentiment, is pretty amateurish for a game about fiction writers. But it also has the kind of varied, tight, cooperative platforming that only Hazelight is making these days, and the final level is a truly astonishing feat of technical prowess and design bravado that is so confident, you can tell Hazelight knew it was cooking when it pulled it off. I still remember how it felt when my co-op partner (shoutout </span><i><span>Restart</span></i><span>’s Jesse Vitelli) and I reached that moment in which the simulation of my character’s science fiction stories and his character’s fantasy ones overlapped, and the game didn’t so much as stutter as it seamlessly blended them both into one final, incredible set piece.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642518" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642518"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642518">© Nice Dream / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>8.<i>&nbsp;Goodnight Universe</i></b></h2> <p><span>There aren’t a lot of games that could possibly live up to </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>, which remains one of the most affecting things I’ve ever installed on a game device. The eye-tracking adventure game’s follow-up, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/goodnight-universe-review-before-your-eyes-webcam-baby-2000642517"><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i></a><i><span>, </span></i><span>had incredibly big shoes to fill, and I have to commend developer Nice Dream for even trying. Though it didn’t hit me the same way its predecessor did, I was still moved by the team’s knack for drawing connections between its characters that echo every messy, tangled web of feelings we might have for one another. </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>’s eye-tracking mechanics are simultaneously bolder and less thematically precise than those of its predecessor, which makes some sense considering its story is less straightforward, yet it still manages to bring it all together in a stunning closing chapter. But it is, to its detriment, not as focused as </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>, so it doesn’t stick the landing as well. Even so, these guys are ones to keep watching, and I will be first in line for whatever comes next.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000003670" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000003670"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000003670">© Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>7.<i>&nbsp;Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</i></b></h2> <p>I’m 33 years old now, and I’m still fighting battles I did as a kid. <a href="https://kotaku.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-2-review-dont-nod-swann-1851776436"><i><span>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</span></i></a> <span>is a game for the quiet kids who, even once they reach adulthood, overthink everything they say and do when they’re in a group setting. You can know everyone in a room loves you and wants you there, and you’ll still second-guess every word that comes out of your mouth. Don’t Nod’s supernatural narrative adventure is a return to the </span><i><span>Life Is Strange</span></i><span> studio’s roots, and it’s wonderful to see the team back in its element, examining human connection in a way that, even if it appears singular on the surface, can resonate with anyone who’s ever once felt like they were on the outskirts of a group waiting for their turn to speak up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Even as I, playing as the introverted videographer Swann, sat in a small diner with people who were ostensibly my friends during the game’s modern-day segments, the flashbacks that colored in the lines of our relationship felt like the kind of intrusive adolescent memories that are embarrassing to look back on, as they’ve become distorted over time. </span><i><span>Lost Records</span></i><span> makes you look back on moments that felt huge as a kid only to realize they would feel small as an adult, but because they felt cataclysmic when you were young, the wounds they leave last far longer. The game</span> <span>understands that nostalgia and trauma intermingle, and examining one means encountering the other. The rose-colored filters through which we sometimes look back at the past can’t hide the challenges Swann and her friends sought to forget, and Don’t Nod is in top form as it lets you fill in the blanks.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000630352" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630352"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630352">© Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>6.<i> Digimon Story: Time Stranger</i></b></h2> <p><span>When you finish </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i></a><span>, the credits will show little sprite versions of your party, as it existed in specific story moments, walking across the screen. For me, it was always some form of three Digimon: Guilmon, Gabumon, and Gatomon. These three have been my favorite Digimon for over 20 years, and every time I head back to the Digital World, I’m looking for these three.</span></p> <p><span>One thing I will give the </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>games over most other monster-taming games is that their experimental evolution system means you can have just about any party you want right out of the gate. I’m a sentimental guy, and having my three favorite Digimon as my only party throughout the entire run of </span><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i><span> helped the RPG coast over some of the bumps in the road. I had my core three before I left the first dungeon, and I didn’t use any others throughout the rest of the main story. The advantage of these modular systems in monster-taming RPGs is that you are free to write your own story with your own party, and while I probably could have made the game easier if I’d traveled alongside other monsters, this was </span><i><span>our </span></i><span>story, and my friends aren’t replaceable.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000283175" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000283175"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000283175">© Ritual Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>5.<i> Fretless – The Wrath of Riffson</i></b></h2> <p><span>I will take a rhythm game in just about any form I can get it, and as developers have started adding musical mechanics to just about any game they can, I’m not really hurting for options. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fretless-wrath-riffson-deck-builder-music-rpg-review-1851786514"><i><span>Fretless – The Wrath of Riffson</span></i></a><span> marries sonic strategies and deck-building duels to such great effect that playing through its turn-based battles felt like reawakening to an old, often dormant version of myself who used to perform music professionally. I know a rhythm game is good when its musical minutiae becomes second nature to me, like the muscle memory of playing your favorite song on guitar. </span><i><span>Fretless </span></i><span>linking every dodge and damage boost to the beat of its music makes its timing-based mechanics a breeze because you feel it in the riffs and percussion underneath them. Sometimes I miss that old musician version of me, but it’s nice to know something like </span><i><span>Fretless </span></i><span>can bring him back out.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000621057" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000621057"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000621057">© Too Kyo Games</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>4.<i> Shuten Order</i></b></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/shuten-order-review-kodaka-danganronpa-hundred-line-2000621052"><i><span>Shuten Order</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> individual murder mystery routes might not seem like that much to write home about, but together, the “multi-genre” detective story is a pretty ambitious effort made of five compelling adventure game stories. Rei Shimobe wakes up with amnesia, and is told that God himself has tasked her with solving her own murder. To do this, she must investigate one of five possible suspects. Each suspect leads her down a different route, with each having a completely different set of mechanics to play with and mysteries to solve. Though you’re accusing a different person of facilitating your demise each time, following each path to its conclusion is the only way to find the truth. </span><i><span>Shuten Order </span></i><span>is full of signature Too Kyo Games twists and turns, and yet, even as a connoisseur of the team’s work, I was still enraptured by the game’s many mysteries, and how it managed to essentially create five different games within one.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000003155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000003155"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000003155">© Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>3.<i> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i></b></h2> <p><span>From its first hour, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>had its sights set on me, an RPG fan with a proclivity for stories that pick at every wound I’ve ever suffered. Sandfall Interactive’s debut game is a series of gutpunches punctuated by flashes of hope, with elaborate, timing-based battles in between. It circumvents a lot of the problems I have with turn-based games which can often feel too simple for my tastes, with battles that feel like wars of attrition rather than strategic encounters in which my build decisions truly make a difference. In </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>, dodging and parrying keep things interesting in the moment, but finding synergies in its characters’ bespoke mechanics is where the real thrills come in.</span></p> <p><span>But </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s grief-driven story is what has stuck with me the most. It is a story of despair, loss, and misdirection, with each twist more devastating than the last. Games about how the living must carry on when they have to leave those who have passed behind hold a vice grip on me. Grief holds a grip around my throat unlike any other experience in this life, and every time I see someone else’s interpretation of what it means to persist without those who helped you get where you are, I feel like I learn something new about how I handle it myself. Not every emotion and feeling </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> elicited from me on that front was a positive one. But I think that’s okay. I don’t think pretending grief always ends with acceptance is my style. It certainly isn’t </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000652247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652247">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>2.<i> Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i></b></h2> <p><span>There’s a moment in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> late game in which every named hero you’ve met in its Paris-inspired metropolis </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>bands together to save the city</span></a><span>, and it made me set down my controller and just take it all in. It has been three years since we got a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPG, and it was within those three years that I’ve moved to New York City and grown to care about people and a place in a way I don’t think I ever have before. I’ve been putting off doing a lot of </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i></a><span> DLC side quests because there’s something comforting about knowing I still have reason to go back to Lumiose City, as if when the credits roll, all those feelings of community and home might disappear.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is not a perfect game, and there are no doubt people reading this who are throwing tomatoes at their screen because I’m not mad about window textures, but it is a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game that speaks directly to me. Its real-time fights represent one of the most interesting evolutions of the series’ battle system, and make for a much more entertaining, almost puzzle-like iteration in which even quick fights feel fluid, strategic, and engaging in a way they don’t in even my favorite </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games. But more than that, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> cultivates a feeling of belonging by focusing on a city and the people who would lay their life on the line to protect it and each other.</span></p> <p><span>I run around Lumiose with my Raichu by my side who, after a decade of waiting, can finally Mega Evolve, and stories play out in my mind of Grisham waving as we pass by his coffee shop, or Tarragon’s workers yelling at us as we climb their scaffolding. We return to Hotel Z and meet up with the rest of Team MZ, ready to discuss how we can best help the city as it struggles to figure out how to allow humans and Pokémon to live in harmony. I love going on journeys across a region in </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>, but for this moment in my life, a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game that spends a long enough time in one place to actually think about its world and how to make it a better place is exactly what I need. If the </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>series is going to be Game Freak’s place to experiment, I’m so on board for whatever it does next.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000002144" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002144"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002144">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>1. <i>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</i></b></h2> <p><span>It’s kind of a bummer to say that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-the-kotaku-review-2000651792"><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i></a><span> is my favorite game of the year but I will probably not be “finishing” it any time soon. I have seen Too Kyo Games’ incredible, ambitious visual novel/tactical RPG’s true ending, but there are still dozens of final chapters I haven’t seen myself. I don’t know if I ever will. The knowledge that so many are still waiting for me is so daunting, it keeps me from picking the game back up and diving in. But knowing those 90+ conclusions are in the game, and that I could have stumbled upon any of them if I’d made one different choice, is still such an achievement. Even as it intimidates me, I can’t help but be in awe of </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>I really can’t name a moment in a video game that hit me harder this year than the first “ending” in </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>. I’d spent 100 in-game days fighting an invading alien force attacking the titular academy only to fail the mission I’d been tasked with. I could let myself sit in that failure, or I could go back in time, repeat those 100 days, and hopefully do it better next time. I felt a mix of awe and anxiety, as I had an embargo coming up and realized the game was going to be, at minimum, twice as long as I’d anticipated. I wrote a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031"><span>vague impressions post</span></a><span>, singing its praises but not being able to explain why; then, a few weeks later, I finally </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786"><span>laid out what happened</span></a><span>, and why I wasn’t ready to review the game here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. I spent a vacation dragging myself through the game’s “truth” route, uncovering all the mysteries within the school and finding a stunning Kazutaka Kodaka finale. That guy hasn’t let me down once on that front, and it makes the promise (threat) of 100 endings as scary as it is tantalizing.</span></p>

 <p><span>I know I can count on Kodaka for a lot of things. He takes narrative swings most writers would shy away from; his work is polarizing and obnoxious on its way to making an incredibly profound and existential point about why any of us even bother to get out of bed in the morning when giving into nihilism and rotting away would be so much easier, and my god, does he know how to deliver it with the force of a baseball bat to the gut. </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>isn’t just one of the most ambitious visual novels of all time, it’s led by one of the only writers with the gusto and reckless abandon to make it work.</span></p> <p><span>I hope one day that I’ll head back to the Last Defense Academy to uncover more of its secrets, silly antics, and strategic battles. But at the moment, what I’ve seen is enough to know that I could not have played a game this year that would have resonated with me more than </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-microsd-card-drops-to-0-13-per-gb-record-low-practically-free-storage-upgrade-for-nintendo-switch-steam-deck-and-more-2000655456</link>
            <guid>1392598</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Everybody loves a great gift bundle, even when it’s of the DIY variety. If you already have a Steam Deck or Nintendo Switch 2 bought and wrapped and ready, there’s still time to create an awesome holiday bundle by making the very small addition of the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/">Samsung P9 Express microSD card — the 256GB version is selling at Amazon for 40% off, and going fast.</a></p>
<p>The P9 Express microSD card isn’t exclusively a gaming accessory — it works like any microSD card, with the ability to add storage and memory to tablets, drones, digital cameras, and more — but it has the speed and thermal protection that make it ideal for handheld consoles like the Switch 2 and the Steam Deck. Its transfer speeds reach up to 800 MB per second, which is an impressive 4x faster than Samsung’s standard microSD cards. When you’re using it as an extended storage device for games and downloadable content, that speed makes a huge difference.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best of the Best</h2>
<p>Samsung’s enormous footprint in the tech world makes it easy to forget the fact that they’re also the world’s No. 1 flash memory brand, and have held that title since 2003. It makes sense that in the Samsung universe that’s populated by elite-level big-screen TVs, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and wearables, a humble microSD card that measures just 0.59 by 0.43 inches and weighs less than one-hundredth of an ounce can be easily overlooked.’</p>
<p>But the data sheet for the P9 Express microSD card makes it look like an absolute giant. That sequential read speed of 800 MB/s is tailor made for handheld gaming consoles. Games load and install far faster than with other microSD cards, and the all-important downloadable content that often requires weeks of gaming to earn is also safely stored and at the ready.</p>



<h2>More Than Just Fast</h2>
<p>The amazing speed is obviously the main draw to the P9 Express microSD card, along with its seamless compatibility with the market’s two top handheld gaming consoles — the Nintendo Switch 2 and the Steam Deck. Then there is its expansive compatibility with other tech devices like digital cameras, drones, smartphones, and more. But none of that would matter if the card itself was fragile, or prone to breakdowns and data failure.</p>
<p>Samsung, thankfully, has given the P9 Express six distinct forms of protection to ensure its long life and reliability. The P9 Express is designed to withstand extreme temperatures ranging from -13°F to 185°F, up to 72 hours immersed in seawater, airport x-ray machines, magnetic forces up to 15,000 gauss (equivalent to a high-field MRI machine), drops of up to 16.4 feet, and up to 10,000 swipes. Needless to say, it’ll survive the rigors of handheld gaming.</p>
<p>The Samsung P9 Express microSD card makes a fine stocking stuffer on its own because it’s so universally useful, but as a companion with a brand-new handheld gaming console, it’s a serious winner. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/">It’s also selling seriously fast at Amazon right now, so get there before the 40% off deal dropping its price to just $33 ends.</a></p>

<p><em>Mario Kart World </em>is, according to pierre485's figures, also the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch 2 game, as well as the best-selling game of 2025 altogether. Remember, this data applies specifically to Japan and not to the rest of the world.</p><p>Back in November, Nintendo revealed that <em>Mario Kart World </em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-dk-bananza-switch-2-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4e02a144-2a45-4743-8394-5954013f8f00" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">nearing the 10 million sales mark</a>, with fellow Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>sitting at a very respectable 3.5 million at that time. It's not clear whether this new data has helped the game cross that line; we'll likely find out when Nintendo next announces its financials.</p><p>Indeed, it's been a strong year for the Switch 2 on the whole.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After being announced in <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-announces-metroid-prime-4-1796058481">2017</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400#comments"><em>Metroid Prime 4: </em><em>Beyond</em></a> finally launched on Switch and Switch 2 earlier this month to solid reviews, but also plenty of complaints about the game’s open-world desert hub. Well, it turns out that despite realizing that players were souring on open-world games, development studio Retro was stuck with its design and had to finish it.</p> <p>In a new interview with Japanese video game magazine <em>Famitsu</em>, the development team behind <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-graphics-comparison-switch-2-ugly-2000650585"><em>Prime 4</em></a> talked openly about the game’s controversial open-world hub and motorcycle. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-famitsu-interview-with-nintendo-staff-regarding-metroid-prime-4-beyond-its-development-history-origins-its-placement-within-the-timeline-etc.1392244/">The answer below comes from ResetEra via machine translation</a>:</p>

 <p>“At the start of the project, perhaps due to the influence of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, we saw a lot of comments on the internet saying ‘we want to play an open-world <em>Metroid,</em>‘” explained an unspecified member of Retro Studios. “However, <em>Metroid’s</em> core element of ‘increasing the amount of explorable areas by unlocking powers’ is not very compatible with the ‘freedom to go anywhere from the beginning’ of open worlds. Thus, we thought to design a limited area that could be freely explored, and have that be a hub that could connect to other areas.”</p>

 <p>However, the development of<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> took “longer than expected to finish” and had already been reset once <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/metroid-prime-4-on-nintendo-switch-samus-aran/">in 2019</a> after Bandai Namco, the game’s original developer, was removed from the project and replaced with <em>Prime</em> creators Retro. And in that time, Retro says fan feelings towards open-world games “changed.” But, apparently, another reset was “out of the question,” and so the team had to move forward with its open-world hub despite knowing that many players wouldn’t be happy about it.</p>

  <p>In the same interview, it’s further explained that during the creation of <em>Prime 4,</em> shooters and action games evolved and became faster. The team ignored these changes so it could retain the “tempo of an adventure game.” The end result, Retro says, is a game that is “pretty much divorced from the changing of times.”</p>

 <p>As for the inclusion of the game’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657">divisive motorcycle, Viola</a>, Retro told the outlet that it came about because the player moves fairly slowly in <em>Prime 4,</em> and traversing the large open area of the desert was a problem.</p> <p>“While Samus possesses high-speed abilities like the Boost Ball and Speed Booster, we determined that ‘riding a bike’ was the optimal solution to satisfy both the perspective of ‘moving freely and quickly across large areas’ and the perspective of ‘looking cool,” said Retro. “Then we thought that if one could move around on the bike in a satisfying way in that area, it could be a segment that mitigates the tension from exploration, and paces the whole game.”</p>

 <p>It’s certainly nice to hear more about how these decisions were made, but it doesn’t change the fact that the open-world hub in <em>Prime 4</em> just didn’t work out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-attack-pathing-bug-2000655683</link>
            <guid>1392577</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’ve put dozens of hours into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>, and for a while, I thought the issue I was encountering on occasion in which my Pokémon, when fighting in the new Hyperspace maps, would go in the opposite direction of their target and attack air, was just a minor, occasional oddity not worth much attention, and so I opted to just navigate around it as best I could. But after putting way more time into grinding the game as I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-dlc-mega-dimension-special-scan-2000654217"><span>try to find Latias in a randomly generated portal</span></a><span>, I went looking to see if anyone else had experienced this odd, battle-breaking bug. </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegendsZA/comments/1pmgt7x/what_the_heck/"><span>Turns out, I am not alone</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Though this glitch isn’t exclusive to one of the randomly selected Hyperspace maps, this odd attack pathing does seem to occur most frequently on the one that has a mostly open field with one or two large scaffolding structures on the edges of the area. These maps are made up of the “dreams” of Lumiose City citizens, so they manifest as distorted images of the actual metropolis, mashing together different areas with no rhyme or reason. So while this area doesn’t have buildings, it does have scaffolding of the sort you often find near buildings in the real Lumiose, and if you use a close-range attack, Pokémon will often race toward the structure and get caught in it long enough that the attack will time out and they’ll automatically use the move, often striking the air instead of a wild monster.</span></p>

 <p><span>I managed to capture this footage of my Mega Raichu flying away from an Alpha Pidgeot that’s about to whoop my ass when I told him to use Thunder Punch. This move should be a quick close-range jab, but instead Raichu decides to take the scenic route and gets caught on the scaffolding.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655687" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655687"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655687">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For the moment, in the absence of an official fix, players are finding ways around it. Attacks like Psychic and Thunderbolt don’t miss, so even if your Pokémon takes an odd detour in Hyperspace, you can at least know you won’t be wasting your </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-hyperspace-donuts-tips-2000652670"><span>limited time in these rifts</span></a><span> with an attack that won’t land. But it would be nice to not have to do that, so we’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company for comment on the situation.</span></p>

 <p><span>While many fans have reported weird attack pathing with close-range attacks and Pokémon taking odd routes to strike an opponent, the oddest example of this for me involved one of my Pokémon barely moving at all when using mid-range ones like Flamethrower. My Houndoom, who is my go to fire-type attack user, is typically able to breathe fire on an enemy and take them out in one hit. However, when positioning for this attack in Hyperspace, the hellhound almost always stops short of getting its target within the attack’s actual range, leaving my opponents with a strange hot flash rather than anything that actually makes contact. If my trainer character wasn’t in range himself, Houndoom would never get close enough to land the hit.</span></p>

 <p><span>In </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, you’re often challenged to initiate battles without being detected, and if you can get in range to lock onto a foe, your Pokémon will move in to close the distance, but with mid-range attacks like Flamethrower, the pathing seems wonky in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>I really didn’t notice it much during my initial playthrough, but the more grinding I’ve done, the more I see this is a really strange and frequent problem, especially for types that typically battle at close range like fighting and normal. Hopefully this can get patched soon and Mega Raichu can keep flying up to fools and knocking them out </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Superman-style</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>Multiplayer games have always been about more than just winning or losing. They’re the late-night sessions that go longer than planned, the friend you squad up with every weekend, and the moments that turn into stories you still bring up years later. Whether it’s competitive chaos or cooperative problem-solving, multiplayer experiences have a way of creating memories that single-player games simply can’t replicate.</p>



<p>That sense of shared experience is reflected in the voting for the Insider Gaming community’s Best Multiplayer Game of 2025. In one of the closest results of all the awards, it was clear that the community was torn between two contenders. But, in the end, it was ARC Raiders that stood out on top as the Best Multiplayer Game.</p>







<p>The extraction shooter from Embark Studios received 31.3% of the votes in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>. It just beat out the other major multiplayer juggernaut of the year, Battlefield 6, which came in second at 26.8%. </p>



<p>Coming in a distant third were actually two games as both Peak and Split Fiction received 10.7% of the votes. They were followed by Mario Kart World at 8.9%. Other games receiving votes were Marvel Rivals, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and Escape From Tarkov.</p>



<p>Circling back on Arc Raiders, what makes the game so special? Well, just take a look at what Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill had to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">say in his review</a>.</p>







<p><strong>“I was holding fire on ARC Raiders for the longest time, but I need to admit that it’s everything I’m looking for in an extraction shooter,”</strong> Taylor-Hill wrote.</p>



<p><strong>“There are plenty of places to loot and explore, the resource pool is diverse, and the core concept of the game is intriguing and engaging. I’m a huge fan of the combat, which invites you to try out a range of fighting styles and approaches, and I love how accessible the game is, catering perfectly for casual players just as much as die-hard veterans of the genre.”</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Tarkov is Made for Satisfaction, Not For Fun’, Battlestate Games Explains]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-battlestate-satisfaction-not-fun/</link>
            <guid>1392571</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As you might know, Escape from Tarkov is one of the most soul-crushing games on the market. It’s also one of the most rewarding, provided luck is in your favor when you decide to play it. It’s the pioneering extraction shooter that popularized the genre, and for several years, it has been known as one of the most challenging titles ever made.</p>



<p>Recently, we caught up with Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, the developer behind Escape from Tarkov. As our conversation unravelled, we learned about the team’s goal when it comes to evoking emotion in players, and as it turns out, it’s not about encouraging <strong>fun</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-you-don-t-play-it-for-a-good-time">You Don’t Play It For a Good Time</h2>



<p>If you’ve never heard of Escape from Tarkov, you might be missing out. As the premier extraction shooter, Escape from Tarkov challenges players to load into a borderline milsim environment, accepting that a single bullet can destroy their entire session and cause them to lose everything.</p>



<p>But for as off-putting as that sounds, it’s a hugely satisfying game when things <strong>go right</strong>. If you go on a winning streak, you’ll be elated, and every raid that you launch in Escape from Tarkov has the <strong>potential </strong>to yield massive rewards.</p>



<p>It’s gambling, in a way. That’s why extraction games are so successful, and it <strong>all started </strong>with Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Talking to Nikita Buyanov on the most recent episode of Access Granted, we learned how the team views Escape from Tarkov from an emotional perspective:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>People really want to play this kind of game, they really want to play something intellectual, hard, punishing, unforgiving… Something that will actually shake their emotions, not the game for the enjoyment.</p>



<p>Tarkov is made for satisfaction, not for fun. Not for enjoyment.</p>



<p>To have a chance to get the satisfaction or to frustrate. It is what it is. It’s polarizing. You get everything or you get nothing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s an honesty that is rarely seen in the industry. This is a developer acknowledging that their game can be challenging to the point of ‘not being fun’, but that’s entirely the point. It’s why Escape from Tarkov has spent so long at the top of the extraction shooter table. It knows what it is, and it delivers so perfectly on what might seem like a bizarre gameplay loop to some.</p>



<p>If you want to check out the full interview with Nikita, you can do so on the Insider Gaming app, available now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.insidergaming.app">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/insider-gaming/id6753984648">iOS</a>. It’s available exclusively for Insider Gaming Premium subscribers.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-goes-full-clearance-on-noise-canceling-earbuds-as-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-hit-an-all-time-low-2000655308</link>
            <guid>1392553</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good-quality in-ear headphones offering solid sound with a comfortable fit, plus a decent battery life, can be hard to find. And when you do manage to find a pair, it usually costs an arm and a leg. Well, that’s not the case today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/">We just spotted the 2nd-generation Bose QuietComfort Ultra wireless noise-canceling earbuds going for $249 at Amazon, after the retailer took a nice $50 off their usual price</a>. The offer also includes a 60-day free trial to Audible, which sweetens it even more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Listening Modes</h2>
<p>This premium pair of earbuds lets you choose from nine combos of eartips and stability bands to find the right fit for yourself. The umbrella-shaped tips seal the opening of your ear to prevent outside noise from coming through, but the customization does not end here. QuietComfort Ultra earbuds pack CustomTune technology that analyzes the shape of your ear and adapts the headphones to it for an even better sound experience.</p>
<p>Audio quality is top-notch. There are multiple listening modes to choose from; Quiet, Aware, Immersion, and Cinema. The Quiet mode offers active noise cancellation, which blocks all background distractions (laughter, chatter, traffic). It’s great for when you want to focus on a task in a busy setting, or just want to zone out with your favorite song for a bit. Of course, this level of noise cancellation does not work for every situation. Sometimes, it’s better to stay aware of all that’s taking place around you, and for that, there’s the Aware mode. This one lets some ambient sounds in while still offering high-quality audio. You will be able to enjoy music while also staying in touch with the outside world.</p>



<p>The Immersion Mode blends noise cancellation with Bose Immersive Audio for the most realistic listening experience, while the Cinema mode balances background sounds and sound effects for a theater-like experience. Basically, these handle everything from energy-filled tracks to calm sounds, video content, and more with ease.</p>
<p>Phone calls get better with the Bose SpeechClarity technology that uses noise-rejecting mics to cut out background noise and focus on your voice. Translation? Clearer calls, even when you’re in a noisy cafe or a packed subway.</p>
<p>As for the battery, you’re looking at around 6 hours of playtime in Quiet or Aware Mode, and up to 4 hours with Immersive Audio. The case holds up to three full charges, meaning topping these up on the go won’t be an issue. What’s more, the pair supports both wireless and wired charging via USB-C, so you’ve got options on that front too. It’s best to download the Bose app to keep your gear updated and access all the latest features as they are released.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/">On a regular day, this pair would run you around $299, but the current 17% discount makes it easy to pick one up for less.</a> The offer applies to all color options, including black, plum, gold, violet, and white. You can pick the one that goes with your aesthetics the best.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stardew Valley Gets Free Upgrade For Switch 2 But There Are Some Issues]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-switch-2-free-upgrade-multiplayer-2000655682</link>
            <guid>1392550</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Stardew Valley</em> just got better on Switch 2, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is pitching a big 2026, and we finally have our first teaser trailer for Nicolas Cage as John <em>Madden</em>. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. While many were battling big game service outages over the holiday, from <em>Arc Raiders</em> to Steam, I was battling <em>Minecraft</em> for the original Switch, which I bought for my kids because of the Mario add-on but which keeps crashing on startup.</p> <p>It’s something fans have apparently dealt <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1jdy320/minecraft_nintendo_switch_keeps_crashing_i_feel/">with for years</a>, but I’m still shocked that a mash-up of two of the biggest franchises in gaming on the second-most-popular console ever is in such poor shape. We ended up going analog instead and playing the board game Trouble, which devolved into hitting and shouting even more quickly than our normal <em>Mario Kart World</em> Grand Prixes. This Christmas left me with much to think about!</p>

  <p>The hit pixel art farm sim costs $15 on Switch 2 and the <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/2004216532658946536">upgrade is free</a> to everyone who already owns the game. You might be thinking, what is the point of a Switch 2 upgrade for a 2016 indie game? Well, this one adds mouse control support, local co-op support for four-player split-screen (up to eight online), and Game Share support so people can play on different Switches together locally even if they don’t own the game.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, the Switch 2 version also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1pvzsr7/ca_has_acknowledged_the_issues_with_the_switch_2/">has some unexpected issues</a>, including errors when people try to connect to multiplayer online and crafting resources not being spent correctly. “I am aware that there are some issues with the nintendo switch 2 edition that just dropped,” the developer <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2004474989119160737">wrote on X</a>. “I take full responsibility for this mistake. We will fix this as soon as possible.”</p>

 <p>ConcernedApe’s next game,&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, is due out in the next couple of years, but <em>Stardew Valley</em> has continued getting big updates in the meantime. For anyone who still can’t get the Switch 2 version to appear in the eShop for them, <a href="https://x.com/ralumss/status/2004481466525442375">try deleting the game and re-installing</a>.</p>

 <h2>2026 will be the year<em> Star Citizen</em> crosses $1 billion in funding</h2> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/star-citizen-is-on-course-to-reach-usd1-billion-in-player-funding-in-2026-and-we-still-might-not-get-to-play-its-singleplayer-campaign-next-year/"><em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a> that the sci-fi ship simulator has currently reached $927,641,376 in funding from over 6 million players. That puts it on track to cross the $1 billion threshold sometime next year. That’s more than most big blockbuster game development budgets put together, coming from a mix of crowdfunding and microtransactions. What we don’t still know, however, is when the game’s long-awaited single-player campaign will arrive. Director Chris Roberts <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/chris-roberts-hopes-star-citizens-launch-will-be-almost-as-big-an-event-as-grand-theft-auto-6-still-targeting-2026-for-its-squadron-42-singleplayer-campaign/">recently projected</a> that the game might hit 1.0 sometime in 2027 or 2028.</p>

 <h2>You can now wash in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>‘s rivers</h2>  <p>That’s thanks to a new mod from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/7688?tab=description">user Saul0097</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-immersive-washing-rivers-lakes/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>). The new mod lets you dip into any body of water in the sprawling open-world game and wash all the mud, sweat, and blood off your face and clothes. Another small step for modders, another big leap for immersion.</p>

 <h2><em>Marvel Rivals</em> isn’t going anywhere</h2> <p>“2025 was more of a warm-up period for us,” executive producer Danny Koo <a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/games/marvel-rivals-creators-on-leveling-up-the-game/">told <em>Den of Geek</em></a>. “Next year, we’re going to have bigger plans. We’re not going to slow down. We’ve already planned more than a year ahead and I can’t wait for our players to see it.”</p> <h2>Ex-<em>GTA</em> dev doesn’t think Rockstar will get “greedy” with<em> GTA 6</em> pricing</h2> <p>“I don’t think the price tag for <em>GTA 6</em> will be $100,” former animator Mike York <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/">told <em>Esports Insider</em></a>. “I think it will come out at $70, around the flatline of normal releases. I don’t think Rockstar Games feel they need to release it at a higher cost. They’ll sell so many copies of the game that they won’t need to be greedy and charge $100.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-wave-map-leak-pikachu-professor-2000655613">New Pokémon leaks show the gen 10 games might be going full<em> Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em>-mode</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-no-better-time-than-the-holidays-for-time-traveling-jigsaws-2000655404">The winter break is the perfect time to try <i>Strange Jigsaws</i></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-2-gen-ai-awards-sandfall-interactive-2000655599"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>‘s developers say their games will only be made by humans moving forward</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Knife Arena Codes (December 2025)]]></title>

<p>Use these Roblox Knife Arena monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including release cases and much more.</p>



<p>Knife Arena is a fast-paced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-anime-ragnarok-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> FFA battleground where players engage in knife-only combat, testing their reflexes and tactical skills in close-quarters battles. Unlike games with varied weapons and complex progression systems, success in Knife Arena hinges entirely on your blade mastery, movement precision, and split-second decision making. The game’s instant respawn system ensures continuous action, making every match an intense test of timing and precision as you dash, dodge, and deliver devastating strikes.</p>







<p>Progression revolves around the game’s skin collection system, where players can unlock various knife cosmetics to personalize their gameplay experience. Although knife skins and other cosmetics can be earned through regular gameplay by accumulating coins from victories and kill streaks, the fastest way to enhance your collection is by redeeming codes. While the base mechanics remain consistent, having rare knife skins adds a visual flair that helps you stand out in the arena.</p>

<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes, so players can redeem the active codes safely.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to activate all the active codes in Knife Arena:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot Knife Arena in Roblox</li>



<li>Click on the setting buttons on the top-left corner</li>



<li>Then click on the Redeem Code button shows up</li>



<li>Type or paste the code into the text box</li>



<li>Press redeem and enjoy the freebie</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-knife-arena-codes">Where To Get More Knife Arena Codes?</h2>



<p>Knife Arena codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Discord server, where you can join discussions and see announcements before they’re widely known, the One Hit Studio (9D GAMES) Roblox group page, and their social media accounts where they post updates about the Roblox game.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones, major updates, or special events, but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. The developers don’t typically announce expiration dates for codes, making it crucial to redeem them promptly. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>

It's the day after Christmas for those who celebrate, and you're probably either back to work or chilling at home, enjoying the gifts you received this year. Or maybe you're still in a food-induced coma. Regardless, the holiday season is coming to a close, and the big man dressed in red is back home at the North Pole.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, Christmas (which is always my favorite holiday of the year) was extra special – it was the first one with my almost-9-months-old daughter, and though she basically had zero idea what was going on, it still made for some memories I'll forever cherish. I didn't buy her any video game gifts this year – that'll come in due time – but my wife and I did get her some climbing blocks and a large hexagonal activity cube, with which my daughter completely ignores the abundance of fun interactive activities on it to... also climb it. My daughter is at the age where she's pulling herself up to stand and so anything and everything she can climb on, she loves, which is to say my wife and I crushed it this year.&nbsp;</p><p>But in lieu of my not purchasing any video game-related gifts this Christmas, I want to know: what video game gifts did you give or receive this Christmas? It can be games, consoles, merch, ornaments – anything!

                <p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a> games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blox-fruits/">Blox Fruits</a> might just be the biggest, and that doubles for both popularity and scope. With a level cap of a whopping 2800, working your way up from the beginning is one hell of a journey. Luckily, we’re here to help you with Blox Fruits leveling and offer some small tips that’ll help you as you battle enemies and try to get more powerful in this thrilling Roblox experience.</p><h2 id="Blox_Fruits_Leveling_Explained">Blox Fruits Leveling Explained</h2><p>There are plenty of ways to level up in Blox Fruits, and even more reasons for doing so. Naturally, like any other RPG, you will get stronger with every level, and this is the key to taking on more powerful enemies on different islands.</p><p>For clarity, leveling up will give you access to several new things, including:</p><ul><li>New islands to explore</li><li>3 stat points to spend as you like</li><li>Level-gated NPC quests</li><li>Other gameplay elements like Raids, Awakening Fruits, and Elite Pirates</li></ul><p>One of the most important parts of leveling up is the stat points, which you can spend in any of the following categories:</p><ul><li>Melee</li><li>Defense</li><li>Sword</li><li>Gun</li><li>Blox Fruit</li></ul><p>How you spend your stats will depend on your playstyle, but it is important to remember that Melee increases your energy, while Defense increases your health. Then, later, when you unlock different Blox Fruits, the Blox Fruit stat will increase each Fruit’s damage.</p><h2 id="Best_Blox_Fruits_For_Leveling">Best Blox Fruits For Leveling</h2><p>Early in the game, the best Blox Fruit for leveling up is the Buddha. If you can get your hands on it, this Legendary-tier Fruit transforms the user into a golden, glowing, giant.</p><p>This transformation crucially negates a huge chunk of incoming damage, meaning you can tank some big hits. But it also extends your hit box, making it easier for you to mow enemies down. Alongside this, it also has several AoE-focused special attacks, making it easy for you to hit multiple foes at once and spread out your damage. This is fantastic for farming smaller enemies when you want to grind XP, and also helps you to take on some of the tougher early bosses in the game. If you do pick up the Buddha early, it is also wise to power up your Melee stat to boost its power, and the defensive capabilities of the Buddha mean you can worry less about the Defense stat.</p><p>However, at a whopping $1,200,000, or 1,650 Robux, you may not be able to pick up the Buddha for a little while. In the meantime, some other picks like Flame or Light can offer a huge help at the start of your Blox Fruit journey. Both Flame and Light have great damage stats, but Light also has some fantastic mobility to help you find those first few islands.</p><h2 id="Best_Blox_Fruits_Fighting_Style_For_Leveling_Up">Best Blox Fruits Fighting Style For Leveling Up</h2><p>At the beginning of Blox Fruits, it's best to focus on either the Melee or Sword fighting style to just help you quickly grind through the early enemy NPCs you‘ll find scattered around the seas. While there are many better fighting styles later on, Sword and Melee are really effective for just spamming enemies and growing those early levels.</p><h2 id="Best_Tips_For_Leveling_Up_In_Blox_Fruits">Best Tips For Leveling Up In Blox Fruits</h2><p>How you choose to grind through Blox Fruits is entirely up to you, and the way you level up will ultimately be defined by your preferred playstyle. However, there are some basic tips that should help people, no matter how they like to play.</p><p>First of all, be mindful of the accessory you use. While most of the time you should just choose one that you like, or love the design for, when grinding, you should be focusing on boosting your stats to save time. Early items like the Black Cape are great here, which you have a chance of earning by defeating Elite Pirates.</p><p>One slightly cheesy method folks love to implement has been dubbed the ‘Fountain Method’ as it is particularly useful on the First Sea’s Fountain Island. Upon engaging with certain mobs, if there is a wall nearby, you can simply hop behind the wall and attack from a distance. While enemies have a much lower range behind walls, yours is slightly longer, so you can use this to spam even very tough enemies. Just be careful of your distance!</p><p>Next, while it can be good to find the toughest enemies you can currently handle when you're grinding, you generally save time grinding islands with more mobs, even if they aren’t quite as strong. This is also very important when using double XP codes, which, while very effective, work better against large amounts of enemies instead of a single high-level mob or boss.</p><p>Finally, if you are grinding bosses and are getting sick of waiting for them to respawn, many players find it helpful to jump between servers to find one where the boss is available again. This can be fantastic for grinding XP and items from those tough bosses.</p><h2 id="Best_Blox_Fruits_Locations_For_Early_Leveling_Up">Best Blox Fruits Locations For Early Leveling Up</h2><p>There are plenty of great places to grind levels in Blox Fruits, but if you’re just starting out, or bumping up against some difficult enemies, here are some of the best places to grind in the first sea and those essential early levels.</p><ul><li>1-55 - Grind the bandits on the opening island, then use the Fountain Method on Fountain Island</li><li>55-90 - Attack the Chef on Pirate Island, and use server hopping to get quicker respawns</li><li>90-105 - Grind by attacking the Snow Bandit in the Frozen Village</li><li>105-130 - Attack the Yeti Boss in the Frozen Village, and remember to use server hopping</li><li>130-220 - Use server hopping to grind the Vice Admiral boss in Marine Fortress</li><li>220-350 - Grind the bosses in the Prison using server hopping</li><li>350-435 - Attack the Magma Admiral in the Magma Village and use server hopping to ensure respawns</li><li>425-500 Attack the Fishman Lord in Underwater City</li></ul>

<p>In addition to the 1.0 release, <em>Phasmophobia </em>is also getting a brand new character creator next year, which will allow you to "customize your Ghost Hunter in-game with free cosmetics and different looks". You can also look forward to an animation overhaul that's aimed at creating a more immersive gameplay experience through increased realism of movement.</p><p>A rework for <em>Phasmophobia</em>'s Tanglewood Drive map is also on the way, and while Kinetic acknowledges that the announcement of the map's rework was met with "a bit of trepidation", the studio says it hopes its work on the Bleasdale and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-nells-diner-grafton-farmhouse-rework" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="16b7262e-f986-499e-8c3c-16ca2352333c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Grafton Farmhouse map reworks</a> will reassure players that the aim is to "level up the location".</p><p>All of this is, of course, alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 port of the game that Kinetic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-switch-2-version-on-way-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="159fca3c-8df3-41ad-98da-95af3a28123c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced back in December</a>, as well as the <em>Phasmophobia </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="456ae148-4707-46f3-8535-d25532383d9e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">movie that's currently in development</a> at horror production studio Blumhouse. Suffice it to say that it's a good time to be a <em>Phasmophobia </em>fan (or perhaps that should be "phan").</p><p>If you aren't familiar with <em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer ghost-hunting horror game in which the goal is to find and document various paranormal phenomena haunting a range of different maps. You'll use tools and observation to figure out what's haunting where, then report back to your teammates.</p>

<p>It's been...well...it's been a year in which we have all existed, that's for sure, and as a result games happened. Loads of them, in fact. Of course, and as is tradition at this time of year (it's Christmas, mate, wake up), you've got your usual shoe-ins for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-of-2025">Game of the Year</a>, your fancy writing awards, nice acting, and good gameplay nods.

<p>However, and as anyone who's drunk as much festive sherry as we have over the years will tell you, there are many more games worthy of a mention in any given year when you broaden your horizons ever-so-slightly. Who needs the pomp and circumstance of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, for example, when you've got the guns and squirrels of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel with a Gun</a>? That sort of thing.</p>
<p>Now, that's not to say what follows is in any way less prestigious, mind you. We've got some absolute bangers in here. It's just that some good games come at you from unexpected angles. Y'know. Like those wee Christmas vol-au-vents. You just never see them coming.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, and before these delicious flaky pastries go cold, let's dig into our 2025 Alternative Award choices. <em>Regarde!</em></p>

<p><strong>Winner:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a></p>
<figure data-uuid="073b3de12a895"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/073b3de12a895/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion was announced for Switch 2, this particular writer couldn't quite contain their excitement. The reason? Well, it seemed as though this sequel to a super-solid predecessor was going to give early Switch 2 adopters exactly what they wanted to see on a new console. Huge big open worlds, high-octane robot fights, and all the other sorts of things that made the original Switch crap itself.</p>
<p>In the end, and as you can read about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">in more depth in our review</a>, what we got was a very good game at its core, but one that just didn't satisfy when it came to performance at all. This 30fps effort stuttered too much, it's too janky overall, and combat that sings on other platforms feels well mushy and unsatisfying at points here as a result. A shame! There have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/another-switch-2-game-has-been-updated-this-week-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">updates and fixes</a>, so there's hope yet.</p>

<p>One of the tougher categories to judge, as we're sure you can imagine. <strong>*cough*</strong> This prestigious — and also very large and expensive — award goes to a bit of a left-field choice in this category. Yes, that's right, it's Dee Dee Creation's Squirrel with a Gun.</p>
<p>Congratulations to everyone involved in a game that sure did make this writer's children laugh a lot. They also know the names of loads of types of real-world guns and weapons now, too. LEARNING BONUS MULTIPLIER X5!</p>

<p>This very (bald) writer gave Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles a great big <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">juicy 9/10 in our review</a> back at launch, and he'd do it again!</p>
<p>Yes, some folk haven't taken to the way in which some War of the Lions content was cut, but honestly we reckon the remix works better overall. Also, the extra fighting you got in War of the Lions...who really needed it? Seriously. You just had like 40 hours of top-notch combat and you're kicking up a stink for more?</p>
<p>With meaningful quality-of-life enhancements, gloriously slick visuals and performance, and CPU tweaks to make battles even better, this is the best version of one of the best FF games. So there.</p>

<p>Unbelievable scenes here at the awards. Unreal stuff. We were up all night (this writer pulled all of his own hair out), but in the end the decision has been made to award Best Game Featuring A Glass Skater Whose Soul Is Chained To Their Board 2025 to...<strong>*drum roll*</strong></p>
<p>It's Skate Story! Devolver has given us another one of those games, you know the ones, like your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hotline_miami_collection">Hotline Miamis</a> and whatnot, that immediately...as soon as you start to play...you just <em>feel</em> x100 cooler. The plot (involving hell, souls, demons, glass things, skating) is exactly mad enough that you simply must know how it ends, and on this chaotic hook is then hung some supremely good skating.</p>
<p>Like, actually. The skating is great. Who knew?! We just thought it was gonna look nice, but it's got the whole lot this one. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Check out our 8/10 review</a> if you don't believe me.</p>

<p>The folks at Hello Games are no strangers to pulling off a late save and turning things around on a game (or in this case port) that looked all but out to sea. Or maybe that should be out to space or something. Something clever.</p>
<p>We loved the Switch 1 port, but No Man's Sky is a game transformed on Switch 2, now with all the bells and whistles you'll find elsewhere. And it runs good. And it looks great. It's also a game that benefits hugely from having portable mode on the table - exactly the sort of thing you can leave on your console for years and pick at during lazy periods (Mon-Fri, 9am - 5pm).</p>
<p><strong>Runners Up:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a></p>

<p>Winner: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/labyrinth_of_the_demon_king">Labyrinth Of The Demon King</a></p>
<figure data-uuid="75de073047e5b"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75de073047e5b/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Top Hat Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might think there'd be a whole lot of competition for this one. Centipedes have long been a fundamental and core part of gaming. However, and as we can see, these modern game-makers...they just don't honour the classics amongst...eh...computer game insects?</p>
<p>Anyway. Labyrinth of the Demon King is absolutely stonking (and stinking) stuff. It's a belter. And you, my friend, should play it. It also has some great big centipedes in there. And they are poisonous. The good stuff.</p>
<h3 id="best-end-of-year-arrival-that-dropped-too-late-to-make-our-goty-list-2025">Best 'End-Of-Year Arrival That Dropped Too Late To Make Our GOTY List' 2025</h3>
<p><strong>Winner: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">Despelote</a></strong></p>
<figure data-uuid="84527fa1d00f1"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/84527fa1d00f1/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now this was a shame, actually, because Despelote really is a special game - a December arrival in the US and we don't get it on European eShops until 13th January. A roughly two-hour experience, it's something we can <em>all</em> make time to play, and something we really should, too.</p>
<p>Set during the Ecuadorian team's historic 2001 World Cup qualifying campaign, this is a beautiful thing to just lose yourself in for a single sitting, and it's also the sort of game (given the running time especially) that you shouldn't let anyone ruin for you. So no spoilers here. It's a top tale told well. It's also a game that displays a deep knowledge, not just of its subject matter, but of video games and interactive stories and how they are told in a way that best conveys the emotion, alongside a time and a place that is universal to anyone who's ever been a child (that's, like, loads of people).</p>
<p>Seek it out, submit to its story and enjoy a very special thing indeed.</p>

<p>This one is terrifying for this writer because I was on reviewing duty and it's genuinely hard to believe this wasn't about two years back.</p>
<p>Regardless of how long and tiring you may or may not have found this year, one thing is for certain: it's always worth giving XCX a shout.</p>
<p>This Definitive Edition makes good on the promise of the OG, adding performance boosts and other enhancements that make for one of the best open-world games (and/or Mecha games) on Switch consoles as of writing. We're really feeling it! Still.</p>

<p>Who wants 20 more hours or thereabouts of premium-grade Chained Echoes content? We'll tell you who.</p>
<p>Me. We. We mean we do! And also, you. Perhaps. Let's forget about this sentence. Chained Echoes is one of the greats of recent times, a belter that everyone should dig into. Ashes of Elrant (and keeping it vague, so no spoilers) adds more of everything you may have loved about the main game. Hey, it's got 15 new songs in it. 15!</p>

            <guid>1392511</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="408">Ever experienced this? You’re recording an important moment on your phone, maybe your child about to score their first goal in a peewee soccer game. You decide to run alongside them, phone in hand, trying to capture the action. But when you watch the video afterward, you realize it’s a shaky, unwatchable mess. The footage bounces around with every step, making it nearly impossible to see what’s happening.</p>
<p data-start="410" data-end="803">That’s why anyone serious about filming, whether professionally or as a hobby, should consider adding a gimbal stabilizer to their toolkit. Amazon has some excellent year-end deals active right now with some great discounts on DJI’s phone stabilizers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4668/">For example, the DJI Osmo Mobile 7P, usually priced at $129, is now only $109.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4668/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="805" data-end="1071">While the Osmo Mobile 7 and 7P share many features, the 7P offers a few upgrades. One key difference is that the 7P includes a retractable extension rod built into the handle, which adds extra versatility, allowing you to use it as either a selfie stick or a tripod. It’s worth the little bit of extra change to have that flexibility in how you can use it.</p>
<p data-start="1073" data-end="1229">Attaching your phone to the gimbal is a breeze thanks to DJI’s magnetic connection system. This means you can start filming immediately with minimal hassle.</p>


<h2 data-start="1073" data-end="1229">Native Tracking</h2>
<p data-start="1231" data-end="1700">The Osmo Mobile 7P come with intelligent tracking features that make your filming experience much smoother. They can automatically track your subject, keeping the camera stable and free from any shaky hands or movement. Even if your subject suddenly changes direction, the gimbal adjusts to keep them in focus. If the subject briefly disappears from view, like behind a tree, the gimbal will continue tracking, ensuring your footage stays seamless and fluid.</p>
<p data-start="1231" data-end="1700">If you’re filming solo and want to shoot in selfie mode, you’re covered. Just convert the handle into a tripod, allowing the gimbal to stand upright on its own. You can control the shot remotely with simple hand gestures. For instance, raising your palm will start or stop the tracking, while a “double-L” with your thumbs lets you adjust the framing. A “V” or peace sign will trigger the camera to take a photo or begin/end video recording.</p>
<p data-start="2165" data-end="2378">The battery life on this model is impressive, lasting up to 10 hours on a single charge. When you’re done filming, the gimbal folds up easily into a compact, portable form, making it convenient to take on the go.</p>
<p data-start="2380" data-end="2560" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With this DJI stabilizer for iPhone and Android, you’ll never have to worry about shaky footage again.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-games-you-must-play-on-playstation-plus-released-in-2025/</link>
            <guid>1392508</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In 2025, PlayStation Plus members can enjoy an impressive lineup of titles. Explore the vibrant streets of Night City in Cyberpunk 2077, embark on an epic journey through the breathtaking realms of God of War: Ragnarök, or face the chilling horror of Alan Wake 2. There’s something thrilling for every type of player to discover this year.</p>



<p>PlayStation Plus adds tons of titles to the subscription service each year, providing access to more and more games for every higher tier. Out of this massive library, some titles are certified hits, whereas some are just space fillers. Check out Insider Gaming’s top 10 picks for PlayStation Plus 2025 games below. </p>



<h2 id="h-top-10-playstation-plus-games-of-2025">Top 10 PlayStation Plus Games of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>First up is the game that came out in January, a sequel to one of PlayStation’s most popular franchises, God of War. If you have played the first game, then you should definitely give Ragnarök a try as it improves on the base game immensely, adding new gameplay elements, fresh realms to explore, and a proper conclusion to the story.</p>



<h3 id="h-high-on-life">High On Life</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>High on Life is a first-person comedy adventure developed by Squanch Games and released in 2022. It is known for its humorous narrative, filled with quirky characters and featuring talking guns as the highlights. You are tasked with saving Humanity, who is threatened by an alien cartel that wants to use them as drugs. The title is also receiving a sequel soon, so it might be the perfect time to catch up on the first game.</p>



<h3 id="h-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are into 2D platforming metroidvania games, then Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown might be an excellent pick for you. It features an original story in which players explore a Persian-inspired world filled with larger-than-life landmarks. You also get to use time abilities and platforming skills, which can be used to perform combos against time-corrupted enemies and other mythological creatures. </p>



<h3 id="h-hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you haven’t had the chance to try Hogwarts Legacy and are a big fan of the Harry Potter franchise, then there is no better game in this list for you. Though the game’s events take place 300 years before the books and movies, it is a familiar magical world that players get to explore as a new character. It features an original story, familiar location, spell casting, crafting potions, and everything else that you love about this universe, all revolving around an original story. </p>



<h3 id="h-blue-prince">Blue Prince</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Blue Prince is a new indie title released in 2025 that has won the hearts of many around the globe. The critically acclaimed title takes players to Mt. Holly, a mysterious manor with shifting rooms. The player has inherited this manor and is searching for Room 46. To get to this room, players will have to go through all the doors, which lead to new and exciting chambers with their own secrets and challenges. </p>



<h3 id="h-cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is my pick of all the games. I can tell you that I spent over 70 hours just scouring through the open world, not even finishing half of the story, with my total gameplay coming in at 140 hours. I am not a fan of first-person games; however, this title has been the best entry into the genre. The world of this game is so incredibly dense, and the characters are so well defined that you will spend most of your game exploring Night City, which, to be honest, is the real main character of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-lies-of-p">Lies of P</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are looking into testing a challenging soulslike title, then Lies of P might be more your speed. In this game, you get to play as Geppetto’s puppet, who has been tasked to slay unearthly monsters while unearthing the secrets of Krat, a city set in the Belle Epoque era. The 2023 title is Neowiz’s take on&nbsp;the beloved fairy tale of Pinocchio, with a dark, grim spin. </p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-s-spider-man">Marvel’s Spider-Man</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Again, if you are a PlayStation player, then this game cannot be missed. Marvel’s Spider-Man is one of the biggest PlayStation games and also one of the best superhero games out there. It is a remastered version that features higher resolution and a higher frame rate, while offering players an original story in which they play as Peter Parker, fighting crime and iconic villains as they swing through New York.</p>



<h3 id="h-alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Alan Wake 2 is the critically acclaimed sequel to the 2010 title; however, players don’t need to play the first game to experience this mind-bending survival horror. It features Alan Wake, a writer trapped in a nightmare, and Saga Anderson, who is in the world of the living. Players get to play as two characters and even explore two locations, the majestic landscapes of Cauldron Lake and the nightmarish cityscape of the Dark Place. The game puts you in close-combat situations with various supernatural enemies, and the ultimate weapon for survival against them is the light. </p>



<h3 id="h-red-dead-redemption-nbsp">Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Red Dead Redemption is the first game in the series, even though the events of the game take place after RDR2. Players get to play as John Marston as he tracks down the last remaining members of the Van Der Linde Gang in his quest for revenge. The new version of the game offers higher resolution and a higher frame rate, making it better suited for current-gen consoles.</p>

              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Earth Directorate Commander Ash was sent to settle a labor strike issue on behalf of Auntie's Choice, in an effort to gain favor with the corporate conglomerate. A bit of an outlaw, and someone who excels in shooting, lockpicking, and smooth-talking, I felt like my character was primed to work out a result that was favorable for the workers without too much of an issue.</p><p dir="ltr">I was able to enter the closed-off facility and even nab some blackmail on the manager in charge before confronting her directly about the labor strike. I conveyed the workers' demands, and expected to be able to convince her to see things my way--after all, I invested a decent amount of points in speech.</p><p dir="ltr">It quickly became clear that no amount of talking was going to solve this dispute. As far as the manager was concerned, any concessions she might make would prevent the factory from hitting its quota. Someone with engineering or hacking skills may have been able to solve this issue by messing with the equipment in the factory, but my character wasn't built for that. My character was good at three things, and I'd already exhausted the lockpicking and talking options.</p><p dir="ltr">So Commander Ash solved the problem the only other way she knew how: shooting the manager in the face and telling the striking workers to take it from there. What could easily feel like a failure of the game--not offering me a more diplomatic solution using whatever skills I had invested in--instead felt right, given the story I had built for myself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4624358-theouterworlds2-2025_11_08-19_12_56large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624358" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4624358-theouterworlds2-2025_11_08-19_12_56large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624358"></a><figcaption>The limited number of skill points in The Outer Worlds 2 means you can only build up a handful of skills.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4624358-theouterworlds2-2025_11_08-19_12_56large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In prior games in a similar style to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, including the modern Fallout games, Cyberpunk 2077, and the original The Outer Worlds, I always had trouble resonating with the story. I would neglect the role-playing part of the RPG, not out of some refusal to engage with the story on its own terms, but because of the particular way I like to play games. I have a tendency to want to do everything and see everything, without the need to play through multiple times.</p><p dir="ltr">I would often end up with a hodgepodge of skills, some points to improve combat skills, a few to increase carry weight to deal with my need to pick up everything I find, and a few skills to get me into locked areas. This would always result in me having a character that was good at a bunch of things, but worthless for high-end skill checks. If I had the option to respec, I would cheat my way through, and if it didn't, I would grind for some extra skill points. Sure, I got to see everything in the game, but that often lessened the chances of something different or odd happening.</p><p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 doesn't have the option to respec, outside of one opportunity just after the opening sequence. On top of that, leveling isn't particularly fast, and you are only given two skill points to place into a massive list of skills. My particular playstyle would wreck my adventure here, making me lack the skills for interesting interactions and leaving me to suffer the consequences.</p><p dir="ltr">So, I made a game plan during character creation. I gave my commander an outlaw background, and focused on guns, speech, and lockpicking. I built her like a smooth-talking space cowboy, someone who could get into places via speech or lockpicking and when the time came, shoot her way out. I even managed to spare two points of medicine, although even that small deviation meant I wasn't high enough level for a lockpick in a main quest area I was definitely overleveled for.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4624359-theouterworlds2-2025_11_02-00_04_43large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624359" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4624359-theouterworlds2-2025_11_02-00_04_43large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624359"></a><figcaption>Not every door can be lockpicked open.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4624359-theouterworlds2-2025_11_02-00_04_43large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For as often as my speech skills could get me out of a jam, they also couldn't. After all, some people just can't be reasoned with. While I got through plenty of doors without issues, I would regularly run into a door that required hacking or another skill I didn't have. But I could always accomplish my goals in one way or another, I just had to make use of the skills I had chosen to invest in.</p><p dir="ltr">This resulted in an experience with The Outer Worlds 2 where I felt invested in role-playing. Without the option to run away from or fix my decisions in the level-up screen, I had to work with it. I had satisfying experiences convincing low-level lackeys that their bosses didn't care about them, causing them to run rather than fight me. When a villain started lecturing me about the state of the galaxy, it felt right to choose the attack now option. I'd heard enough and was confident in a duel.</p><p dir="ltr">It feels a bit silly to point out the benefits of role-playing in a genre with role-playing in the name, but respecing has become a crutch for some similar games. Playing Avowed earlier this year, while I felt like I knew who my character was from a personality standpoint, I regularly rebuilt my combat abilities and other skills, sometimes to use a new weapon or to deal with a situation differently.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Outer Worlds 2, I often had to deal with an outcome that wasn't what I was angling for, because I had to play with skills I chose. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/full-flaws-list-for-the-outer-worlds-2-best-flaws-to-pick/2900-7182/">flaws system</a> adds to this too, with my penchant for reloading constantly being something I could lean further into by getting a damage buff, so long as I didn't empty out my magazine.</p><p dir="ltr">These thoughtful decisions also resonated with my companions, with Niles turning from a once-dedicated and hopeful Earth Directorate agent into an outlaw of his own. I taught him that large organizations will never have your back, and sometimes the only solution to a problem is a bullet, something that he now believes too.</p><p dir="ltr">So while shooting that factory manager in the face might feel like a simple or unsatisfying solution in an RPG like The Outer Worlds 2, it was exactly what my character would have done in that moment anyway. Instead of trying to wiggle my way out of the consequences of my choices, undermining my own story in the process, I was forced to do exactly what my character was built to do, making something simple feel impactful.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>2025 has been a fairly quiet year in the world of video games with little in the way of scandals or surprises. Gone are the days of Giant Enemy Crabs or Microsoft completely flubbing an Xbox launch. Nevertheless we have spent at least an hour collating and debating these very special awards which are to be presented by Geoff Keighly as soon as we can drag him away from counting the millions of dollars he makes every year from presenting three hours of adverts.</p>
<h3>The Most Botched Game Launch Award</h3>
<p>When the trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mindseye/">Mindseye</a> landed it got the attention of a lot of people, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/mindseye-revealed-and-it-looks-pretty-darn-fantastic/">myself included</a>. A big open world action game with driving, explosions, and lots of gun play? Yes, please! But alarm bells started to ring when a very limited number of YouTubers got to preview the game a week before it launched and they came away thoroughly unimpressed. Those alarm bells tuned into the honking of a bin lorry slowly reversing into your house when Build a Rocket Boy decided not to send out any review codes.</p>
<p>When they reviews did arrive they were not good and Mark Gerhard, co-CEO of Build a Rocket Boy, claimed that a “third party” (he means his former employers, Rockstar Games) had made a “concerted effort to trash the game and the studio”. Rather than fix the game post launch, management instead decided to fire 300 employees.</p>
<p><iframe title="The $100,000,000 Disaster of MindsEye" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UT0EuK2Jo8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h3>The Most Inevitable Game Delay Award</h3>
<p>Speaking of Rockstar, if you have been playing video games for any length of time you will know that Grand Theft Auto games never come out on time and always get delayed at least twice. True to form, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> was delayed not once, but twice in 2025, with Rockstar <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">first pushing it back to May 2026</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">once again until November 2026</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>The Most Hated Review Award</h3>
<p>Who would have thought the game that got you most riled up this year would be a kid-friendly Pokémon game? We didn’t, but after we awarded <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> a<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/14/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/"> well-deserved ten out of ten s</a>ome of you decided to tell us we got it wrong. Did they leave a helpful comment here on the site? No, they found the reviewer’s honeymoon photos on Instagram and posted abuse there instead. Stay classy.</p>

<h3>The Worst Promotional Trope Award</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-casey-hudson/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>. The Elder Scrolls VI. Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2. Fable. The list of games that are revealed with CGI trailers before barely a line of code has been written grows every year and it is immensely frustrating. There is no need to announce your game five years before it comes out other than to impress shareholders. Stop it.</p>
<p>In the case of Fate of the Old Republic, Arcanaut Studios was founded by Casey Hudson this year and he reckons they’ll manage to ship by 2030. We’ll see you in the Most Inevitable Game Delay Award category in a few years.</p>

<h3>The Best Xbox Award</h3>
<p>This year, Microsoft really pulled it out of the bag and made PlayStation the best place to play Xbox games. You might not have expected this in 2020, but in 2025, the PS5 can play all of Sony’s exclusives and now pretty much all of the recent (former) Xbox exclusives as well. The Xbox fanboys have been incandescent with rage, but Microsoft were very happy with<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-date-set-for-april-22nd-launching-alongside-horizon-realms-update/"> Forza Horizon 5</a> and other Xbox games topping the PlayStation charts, month after month.</p>
<p>Although it makes no sense to the rabid Xbox fans the decision makes perfect business sense, the Xbox Series X|S consoles dropped to fourth in the US recently, behind PS5, Switch 2, and the NEX Playground.</p>

<h3>The Shirley Bassey Award</h3>
<p>Valve have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/12/valve-announces-the-steam-machine-steam-frame-and-steam-controller/">announced the Steam Machine</a>, a new PC in a console-like box that’s designed to go under your TV in the living room.</p>
<p>Just like the did ten years ago.</p>

<h3>The Most Ridiculous Video Game Title Award</h3>
<p>A packed category this year with strong contenders in the shape of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43PSM_b8aA">DDinosaur with Double D’s</a> which is <em>EXACTLY</em> what you think it is, and FUBUKI ～zero in on Holoearth～ HOLOLIVE ALTERNATIVE. However there is one clear winner and it insists on being in all caps. Well done to BRAZILIAN DRUG DEALER 3: I OPENED A PORTAL TO HELL IN THE FAVELA TRYING TO REVIVE MIT AIA I NEED TO CLOSE IT.</p>

<h3>The Most Pointless PS4 Remaster Award</h3>
<p>This award is returning for a second year, but for a different reason. Last year <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/16/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-review/">The Last of Us Part 2 got a PS5 version</a> which was clearly unnecessary when the PS4 version already had a free update to run at better frame rates on PS5. This year Sony decided to take the slightly polished PC version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/days-gone/">Days Gone</a> and shove it back on PS5. Did anyone notice? No.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Days Gone Remastered - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RjRLSZalxgs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>The Most Obvious Rip-Off, Like, Evs, Award</h3>
<p>When Tencent revealed<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/light-of-motiram/"> Light of Motiram</a> it was very clear that it was “inspired” but Sony’s Horizon games but when Sony got the lawyers involved we found out there was a lot more to it. It turns out Tencent had, on numerous occasions, pitched a Horizon game to Sony and had been turned down every time. Rather than give up they changed a few things and voila, Light of Motiram.</p>
<p>Sony and Tencent have now reached an out of court agreement and Light of Motiram has been removed from Steam and will no longer will be released. Who could have predicted that?</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Light of Motiram - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0Of5Xjdwbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>The “U OK HUN” Award</h3>
<p>Someone over at Ubisoft social media seems to be having a breakdown and is posting all sorts of weird “joke” posts on Facebook. We can’t tell if they are trying to be funny or if it is a cry for help.<br>
</p>
<h3>The Half-Life 3 Award</h3>
<p>Awarded for the second year in a row to all those top tipsters on the internet who were 100% convinced that Half Life 3 would be announced, this time as an exclusive for the new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/12/valve-announces-the-steam-machine-steam-frame-and-steam-controller/">Steam Machine boxes</a>.</p>
<p>It wasn’t.</p>
<p><em>And that’s a wrap! Another strong year in a lot of hotly contested categories, and&nbsp;</em></p>

            <guid>1392487</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s hard to think of the last time something changed home lighting as much and as radically as the advent of the multi-colored app-driven LED light. Edison, maybe? But even the Wizard of Menlo Park would have been blown away by the lighting setups that Govee keeps coming out with. If you’re&nbsp;<em>really</em> fast, you can order one like this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6591/">Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp while it’s 41% off at Amazon.</a></p>
<p>While this limited-time deal is still going, the Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp is easily the best $100 full-room transformation you can make. Even above the 1500 lumens of brightness that will fill your space, it comes with over 64 pre-programmed scenes and lighting effects, and the DIY potential to create your own is virtually limitless. It’s all app-controlled and smart home friendly, and it takes up precious little space in proportion to the way it fills a room with incredible lighting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6591/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tall Cool One</h2>
<p>The Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp is perfectly designed for corners, standing an impressive 68.8 inches hight but only 10.3 inches at the base and an especially slender 3.2 inches across the top of the cylinder. When we say “some assembly required,” we mean very, very little — it comes in five pieces, all of which screw together by hand. No tools required and certainly no knowledge of wiring or anything of that sort.</p>
<p>Once it’s up and running, you’ll go to the app to start experimenting. This is an easy rabbit hole to enjoyably go down, because there are literally millions of colors available. The brightness, timer, and patterns are all entirely under your control through the intuitive and free Govee Home App. The lamp can be set for accent lighting, fun party effects, or full-on room-brightening.</p>



<h2>How Customizable?</h2>
<p>The level of customization of the Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp’s effects is beyond impressive. Aside from having a palette of millions of colors to choose from and mix together, the Govee Home App even has a Finger Sketch feature that lets you draw a pattern with those colors, and then see the pattern take shape on the LED cylinder. Add your pattern or any other color scheme you create to the six different music sync modes to watch them dance in beat with whatever tunes you’re playing. Or, stick with the generous library of 64 preloaded scenes. There’s no shortage of compelling, mood-setting lighting effects available, from sedate to dramatic to whimsical.</p>
<p>The Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp is normally a $170 purchase, and well worth it for the amount of personal touch it adds to whatever space you use it in. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6591/">With this limited-time Amazon deal taking 41% off that price, it’s just $100.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A great pair of earbuds can change the way you experience your favorite music. If it’s time to try something new, you should get a pair of Apple AirPods Pro 3 Wireless Earbuds. These earbuds provide high-quality audio, top-notch noise cancellation, and easy connectivity for Apple devices. And you can get a pair on sale right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/">To take advantage of their sale price, which is now priced at $199 (down from its original price of $249),</a> just shop Amazon to claim the discount and see how much these AirPods can transform the way you listen to music, podcasts, and make or take calls.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Earbuds that provide excellent audio</h2>
<p>These earbuds have Active Noise Cancellation technology to help eliminate ambient sound so you can clearly listen to whatever it is you’re playing. Whether you’re using the earbuds while commuting through heavy traffic or you’d like to listen to music without distractions at home, the Active Noise Cancellation feature automatically adjusts to your surroundings.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you need to be aware of your surroundings, such as in a crowded restaurant or while walking through a busy airport, the Transparency Mode allows you to hear your surroundings by allowing ambient sounds to filter into the earbuds without needing to remove them.</p>
<p>All of that, and the AirPods sound great, too. They boast clear, balanced audio with crisp high notes and powerful low notes that make music feel alive. In addition, the Adaptive Equalizer (Adaptive EQ) dynamically adjusts the sound to the unique shape of your ears providing a customized listening experience without manual adjustment of the EQ settings.</p>



<p>But that’s not it, because there are some customization options, too. Each pair comes with multiple ear tip options so you can choose the one that provides the most comfortable fit for your ears. Once fitted correctly, the earbuds sit comfortably against your ear without being overly tight and can accommodate extended periods of use, whether for listening or working out. In addition, the AirPods Pro 3 Wireless Earbuds are water-resistant and sweat-resistant, ensuring they can withstand minor exposure to rain or sweat during a workout or other physically demanding activities.</p>
<p>In terms of battery life, these AirPods boast several hours of playback per charge and the compact charging case can give you plenty of additional power. In addition, when you need to recharge the earbuds, simply place them back in the case and they begin charging immediately. Then charge up your case and do it all again when it’s all depleted.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/">For just $199, you really can’t beat the latest Apple AirPods model.</a> They’re a smart investment for anyone looking for great audio, especially if you’re already a part of the iOS ecosystem.</p>

<p><em>“But... the future refused to change.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the most part, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> is a chirpy, cheery game. It’s lightning in a bottle, a magical experience full of joy and excitement. Yet, there are few endings as gut-wrenching as Chrono Trigger’s 'Bad' ending.</p><div><figure data-videoid="I2fL0wP73Io" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2fL0wP73Io?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytI2fL0wP73Io" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I2fL0wP73Io?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2fL0wP73Io?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed58d513ngjmzy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>You’ve spent hours travelling between time periods, rescuing innocent people, gathering allies, and seeing firsthand the evolution of Lavos, the cause of the apocalypse in 1999 AD and the origin of evil throughout history - throughout millions of years of history.</p>
<p>Travelling to 1999 AD and taking on Lavos right before it causes the apocalypse, only to fail, is devastating. “The future refuses to change,” and Lavos takes all life, including yours. Life and the world collapse and grey out before your very eyes. This beautiful world you’ve become acquainted with — that you’ve seen in six different times and witnessed the spirit of humanity change, adapt, grow, and evolve — is <em>gone</em>.</p>
<p>But the future <em>refuses</em> to change; it’s not that it can’t. The words on the screen, in front of that greyed-out image of Earth and Lavos’ blood-curdling scream blaring out of the speakers, might feel like a gut punch, but it also serves as the fuel, the motivation, to get back in the fight to save the world.</p>
<figure data-uuid="0decd5dafb8dd"><a title="Chrono Trigger Lavos 1999 AD" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0decd5dafb8dd/chrono-trigger-lavos-1999-ad.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But you already know that, right? In the 30 years since its release, everything that can be said about Chrono Trigger has been said. You don’t have to accept the world as it is. Pursue your dreams. Fight for change. You can’t change everything, but you can change some things.</p>
<p>Where many time travel stories are cautionary tales that preach the dangers of changing the course of history, Chrono Trigger throws caution to the wind and says, “Screw that: If you want to change the future for the sake of you, for the sake of the world, <em>change it</em>.”</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger’s message is poignant and, importantly, timeless. Things are crap right now, and I can’t really get through a day without feeling like the world is going to collapse in some way. If I had my own Epoch, I’d hop in it right now, travel through time, and do something to change the future. That’s what Crono, Marle, Lucca, and friends did. All because they love the world, and they love the people in it. And I do, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chrono Trigger throws caution to the wind and says, “Screw that: If you want to change the future for the sake of you, for the sake of the world, <em>change it</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chrono Trigger’s depiction of Earth is special, and it does something that very few RPGs manage to achieve – it makes its setting a character through its use of time travel. Over the course of millions of years, you get to: experience a <a href="https://www.snesmaps.com/maps/ChronoTrigger/ChronoTriggerMapSelect.html">world’s make-up physically changing</a>; spot similarities between continental shapes and town locations; see where certain islands have fused together, broken up, or even been completely wiped off of the map. The further you get through the game, the more similarities you’ll spot.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s obvious when you compare 600 AD and 1000 AD. The Middle Ages and Present Day only have a gap of 400 years to contend with, and many locations are in the exact same places. Truce, Guardia Forest, Porre, the Hero’s Grave, and a few other places have barely changed, and even where islands have merged, their locations match. The Sun Shrine is present in every single time period. Even the Tyranno Lair’s reappearance in the Middle Ages (as the Giant’s Claw), after millions of years, hammers home the importance of the world.</p>

<p>There are smaller details in all of the maps, too. The mountain range behind the Dactyl’s Nest in 65,000,000 BC remains all throughout history, even if it changes. Of course it would; rain, weather, and even human influence would erode the natural structures. The Ice Age alone seems to have created a more jagged range of mountains, compared to the lush green plateau of the nest millions of years ago.</p>
<p>Traditions have even survived Earth’s turbulent history, just as in real life. Ioka Village is home to a small festival where the people dance. Crono, upon visiting the village, is challenged to a soup-chugging contest by Ayla, the chief. This is in 65,000,000 BC. At the beginning of the game, in 1000 AD, Crono can take part in a prehistoric dancing game at the Millennial Fair. He can also imbibe in a drinking contest – not as safe as soup-chugging, kids, don’t try that one at home.</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger <em>loves</em> its world. And it loves its history. But it acknowledges history’s mistakes, too. The events of 12,000 BC and the collapse of Zeal more than amplify that message. Because of Queen Zeal and the (aptly named) Mammon Machine — because she tried to <em>use</em> Lavos — humanity’s innate ability to use magic was lost to time.</p>
<p>There are people that want to correct that mistake, like Melchior, one of the three Gurus and the architect behind the Mammon Machine. He warned Queen Zeal of the dangers of using Lavos’ power, but was thrust forward to 1000 AD. He <em>wants</em> to change 'history' – Antiquity’s future, the Present Day’s past, and the apocalyptic future of 2300 AD.</p>

<p>Even Chrono Trigger sets limits to what you can and can’t affect, though. You can destroy Lavos at the Ocean Palace in 12,000 BC – probably not until a second playthrough, mind you. But doing that doesn’t <em>change</em> the future, it just thrusts you back to the End of Time where Gaspar, another of the three Gurus, resides, and allows you to talk to the staff who worked on the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chrono Trigger <em>loves</em> its world. And it loves its history. But it acknowledges history’s mistakes, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defeating Lavos before killing the Black Tyranno doesn’t really change much besides two things: Lavos is dead, obviously; and, oh, everyone is a reptite now and forever – they never died out in this timeline. Otherwise, everything’s largely the same. In another ending, if you defeat Lavos while Crono is dead, then eventually Gaspar will intervene in the celebrations and insist that there’s still a way to revive Crono. There are many good and bad constants in <em>all</em> of these timelines, things that the party doesn’t have the power to change.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c7cc8fb14139c"><a title="Chrono Trigger Epoch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7cc8fb14139c/chrono-trigger-epoch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But it’s also not fair to call catastrophic events like the summoning of Lavos in 12,000 BC, or Magus’ attempt to summon the creature again in 600 AD, a blip in the timeline, because of the suffering those events inflict. History can be painful, and things that happen in the past ripple. We feel the after-effects of events from over one hundred years ago; they wound people, physically and mentally, and can alter paths. All we can do is bear the sins of the past and do something with that information, to change the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite everything, despite how bleak things are, there are things worth fighting for</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s that undercurrent of history's weight and the power of change that makes storylines like Fiona’s resonate so strongly. Despite only being a sidequest, how important it is to change the 'little' things has stuck with me, too. Restoring a forest might seem like nothing in the grand scheme, but to Fiona, it’s everything. And to you, who has seen firsthand what happens, you want to give that one person a spark of hope. You have to go back, convince someone to plant a seed, defeat the monsters in the Sunken Desert, then have Robo stay and water and care for the forest.</p>
<figure data-uuid="780c1d88c206e"><a title="Chrono Trigger Forest Camp" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/780c1d88c206e/chrono-trigger-forest-camp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the present day, you can see the fruits of your labour at Fiona’s Forest, a beautiful, lush woodland which is home to the game’s timeless campfire scene, and is an example of Crono, Robo, and the others giving back. It’s a small, positive change, and a beacon of hope. If we can do this one little thing, perhaps we can make a difference. Because we love this world, and we can make those ripples more beautiful, more positive. We <em>can</em> change the future.</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger’s world is what sets it apart from almost every other RPG. It’s small, but we become intimately familiar with it. Despite everything, despite how bleak things are, there are things worth fighting for: a better future.</p>
<p>Yet even in the face of the apocalypse, Chrono Trigger can make time for a joke or two. It stands as a beacon of light against tyranny and evil, and its message resonates now more than ever before. Instead of “The future refused to change”, consider the words of a random nun in the Middle Ages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In our world, every storm has an end. Every night has a new morning. What's important is to trust those you love, and never give up. We must all keep hope alive…”</em></p>
