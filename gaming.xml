		<p>NCSoft and Guerrilla Games have made a huge announcement for Horizon fans with the reveal of Horizon Steel Frontiers, a MMORPG set in the Horizon universe. Surprisingly, Horizon Steel Frontiers has not been confirmed for PS5, but for PC and mobile only. With the reveal, NCSoft has released two videos for Horizon Steel Frontiers, the first a 10 minute long announcement which delves into what the developers want to with the game, and the second video is a look at the gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Horizon Steel Frontiers] Announcement Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bN-NNgWIyIQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="[Horizon Steel Frontiers] Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9qwAulK6db4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Horizon Steel Horizons is set in an area called the Deadlands, a new location that is separate to Aloy’s own adventures which helps NCSoft keep the story separate from the events in the main Horizon games, though I would expect some influence or crossover in due time. The combat in Horizon Steel Horizons will be familiar to how it is in the Horizon games, though players will be working together on large raids to take down the most powerful of the machines. Players will be able to create and customise their own hunter to explore the Deadlands with, and there will be cross platform support between mobile and PC.</p>

<p>A release date for Horizon Steel Horizons has not yet been confirmed by either NCSoft of Guerrilla Games.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s got a fresh patch and it generally focuses on making the schoolgirl spookfest easier for those who want that option, or just aren't too fussed about fights. There's a new "casual" difficulty option and the chance to a certain sections during a new game plus run, plus some wider tweaks that should make the game less <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-loves-combat-so-much-it-feels-like-its-fighting-itself">combat-intensive</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/f/news/us/en/patch-note_v110">patch notes</a>
, the "casual" difficulty will be offered as an option when you start both regular and new game plus playthroughs, as well as popping up if you hit game over multiple times on any of the more severe difficulties. Meanwhile, the option to skip the section that begins once you pass through the a door after solving the mural puzzle during a new game plus run is seemingly aimed at new game plus folks who just want to see all of the endings.</p>
<p>If you opt to skip, things'll resume when Hinako awakens at the corridor of the Dark Shrine for the second time, with endings and branching story paths unaffected. Naturally, though, you won't have picked up any items in the skipped bit and three achievements tied to beating the game on different difficulties won't be unlockable for that playthrough.</p>
<p>Dipping into the patch's wider changes, you'll find stuff with similar purposes. The numbers of "unskippable combat encounters" and enemies have been dialled down, while Hinako regenerates stamina more quickly. She'll also take less damage on the hard difficulty and hold off on saying her line after beating a foe for a bit longer.</p><p>Taking a quick peek through the smattering of general bug fixes, "fixed bugs across multiple levels where clumps of flesh do not spawn" is a snigger-worthy one. Those pesky clumps of flesh, not doing what they're told. Shu should also no longer clone himself and monsters shouldn't randomly stop moving as much.</p>
<p>If you've not already, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-review">Oisin's review</a> of Silent Hill f for a verdict on it. They experienced some Scooby-Doo-style leg spinning, so it sounds like the horror flick at least does well on the zoinks-o-meter.</p>

<p>A new update is out now for Silent Hill f, which adds a new ‘Casual’ difficulty, optional skips for New Game+, and other fixes. </p>



<p>Silent Hill f was released on September 25, 2025 and has been doing quite well for itself, with sales exceeding one million units. Recently, we saw a Switch and previous-gen port <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-switch-and-previous-gen-port-might-have-been-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly being confirmed</a> for the title; however, there is no official update on it yet. In the meantime, the developers have released a brand new update for the title, which adds new features and addresses some in-game issues. </p>



<h2 id="h-silent-hill-f-difficulty-update-biggest-changes">Silent Hill f Difficulty Update Biggest Changes</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The first new addition with the Silent Hill F Update is the fresh action difficulty, Casual. Players will be able to choose this difficulty when starting a ‘New Game’ as well as trying out New Game+. Players who already have it on Story action difficulty or higher will see the new difficulty become selectable once they reach the game-over screen multiple times. </p>



<p>The next new feature in this update is optional skips for select sections of New Game+. Once players have installed this update, they will find an option to skip upon completing the “Go through the door” objective after solving the mural puzzle in New Game+. The game will then resume at the scene where Hinako awakens in the corridor of the Dark Shrine for the second time with the “Proceed” objective if skipped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should note that the items that were found in the skipped sections will not be collected. “Thankful to Be Here,” “Grateful for a Worthy Foe,” and “Clear Skies” do not unlock on a playthrough that uses the skip feature. Lastly, this feature will not impact branching paths or endings. Interested readers can check out the system changes and bug fixes in the patch notes below: </p>

<p>ARC Raiders has a fresh new patch ready to be downloaded today, and it introduces the North Line update, the new map (Stella Montis), two new ARC enemies, and <strong>much more</strong>. It also brings about a series of bug fixes and tweaks that address some of the game’s biggest concerns.</p>



<p>Read on to scope out the full ARC Raiders patch notes for the 1.2.0 update.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-patch-addresses-desync">ARC Raiders Patch Addresses Desync</h2>



<p>One of the core elements addressed in the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/north-line-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new ARC Raiders patch</a> is desync, which was causing players to look as though they’d been hit by incoming fire even after getting behind cover. Embark Studios has adjusted this, and it should no longer be a concern for players.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Skateboard Simulator monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Win Potions, Cash, Rebirths, Pets and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Skateboard Simulator is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-drift-36-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game where players are required to perform various skateboarding tricks to make themselves the best boarder on the platform. Players must train to gain strength before competing in various events to get better and upgrade their skateboards. With plenty of new areas to unlock and a variety of skateboard designs to purchase, Skateboard Simulator offers hours of mindless fun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boasting a rather aesthetic street theme and with endless progression opportunities, this will be a fun experience for anyone who has skateboarded before or even watched legends like Tony Hawk growing up. While simply playing the game will provide players with all the resources they need to get ahead of the competition, some additional free rewards never hurt anybody. That’s where these redeem codes will come in handy.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-active-skateboard-simulator-codes">Active Skateboard Simulator Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>update1</strong>: Get 1 Double Win Potion (NEW)</li>



<li><strong>RELEASE</strong>: Get 2 Double Win Potions (NEW)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-skateboard-simulator-codes">Expired Skateboard Simulator Codes</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Skateboard Simulator, as the game hasn’t been out for too long. However, one thing worth noting is that since its release, it has had regular content updates, meaning that more codes are likely to drop in due course. With this in mind, players are urged to make use of the active codes at the earliest, as the release of new codes could result in the expiry of the existing ones. Redeem them now so you don’t miss out on the free rewards and fall behind the competition.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-skateboard-simulator-codes">How To Redeem Skateboard Simulator Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Skateboard Simulator Codes redemption page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Redeeming codes in Skateboard Simulator is a straightforward process, as all players have to do is navigate through the menus and input one of the active ones into the text box. For newer players who may be unfamiliar with the Roblox environment, here’s a detailed guide on how to redeem codes in this game:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Skateboard Simulator.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Codes’ button on the right side of the screen.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes into the corresponding text box.</li>



<li>Click the ‘Redeem’ button to claim your rewards.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-skateboard-simulator-codes-nbsp">How To Get More Skateboard Simulator Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Skateboard Simulator has only had two redeem codes so far, but with the sheer amount of content that has been added to the game in recent weeks, new codes are surely close. Hence, players are urged to keep this page bookmarked, as we update this article as soon as the developers release new codes.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Do you like Death Stranding? Do you like anime? Then you’ll be overjoyed at the announcement for Death Stranding Isolations (working title), a new animated series that is coming to Disney+ in 2027.</p>
<p>Announced by Death Stranding’s creator Hideo Kojima and the animated series director Takayuki Sano during the Disney+ Originals Preview event, their creative partnership will broaden the Death Stranding universe in some new directions. The new concept art was created by Ilya Kuvshinov, who served as character designer for “Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045”, with the 2D animation for the full show to be brought to life by E&amp;H production.</p>


<p>It’s the latest in a number of Death Stranding film and TV adaptations that have been greenlit by Kojima and an array of partners. There’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/09/the-death-stranding-movie-has-a-director/">a Death Stranding movie in the works</a> with A24 and director Michael Sarnoski, there’s also an animated movie, <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/deathstranding-animation-film-announcement">Death Stranding Mosquito</a>, being directed by ABC Animation’s Hiroshi Miyamoto, written by Aaron Guzikowski. Now there’s this streaming series. You can’t really blame Kojima for striking as many deals and partnerships while his stock is so high, with the potential to turn this into a bustling multimedia franchise.</p>
<p>Here’s a little blurb about the story, both for the universe and this new series:</p>
<p>Once, there was an explosion…</p>

<p>Lonesome souls of the dead manifest in the physical world, reaching in search of the living. However, the connection they create triggers a massive explosion that eradicates anything of this world—a phenomenon referred to as the Death Stranding. These events wipe out nations as well as civilization itself. People who remain are now isolated, withdrawn, and without connections. As humanity stands at the brink a legendary porter set out to transport both cargo and wishes of its senders, reconnecting people in the hope that they might still be saved.</p>
<p>Somewhere in North America, just as Sam Bridges walks through the continent in order to save America, the someones are also trying to deal with their isolation in their own way. An old man trying to realize salvation through ways outside of the connection advocated by Bridges. A female warrior who tries to kickstart a world of constant fighting. A boy with a grudge against Bridges. A girl who embraces loneliness.</p>
<p>On the precipice of the end of humanity and the world, their fates and hopes converge, as another story of Death Stranding begins.</p>
<p>And now, comes another explosion…</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach arrived earlier this year to plenty acclaim, much like with the 2019 original. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/">our review of Death Stranding 2</a>, Tuffcub said, “Despite repeating huge chunks of Death Stranding 1, almost beat for beat, Kojima pulls it out of the bag in the end. The core gameplay loop remains satisfying enough to get you through to the good stuff, but I can’t help but feel disappointed just how similar this game is to its predecessor.”</p>

<p>As detailed on the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/">ESRB website</a>, Read Dead Redemption has been rated for the PS5, Xbox Series, and Switch 2. The accompanying text naturally details what kind of content is included to warrant the 'Mature 17+' rating, including "Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Nudity, Strong Language, Strong Sexual Content, and Use of Drugs".</p>
<p>We're not certain what kind of upgrades we'll be getting on the Switch 2, but we would expect to see stable 60fps gameplay along with a pretty sizeable boost in resolution in both docked and handheld modes. Perhaps the multiplayer mode, which was cut from the Switch release, will also make its return here.</p><div><figure data-videoid="nO48QYAS9Kg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnO48QYAS9Kg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nO48QYAS9Kg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed362f9ftkzqnv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/red-dead-redemption">review</a> for the Switch release, we awarded it a score of 8/10 and said that Red Dead Redemption is "a proper all-timer ported successfully to Switch and, if you can stump up the cash, you'll have a great time here regardless of the lack of TLC".</p>
<p>Rumours have been circulating for a while now to indicate that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> might also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/rumour-red-dead-redemption-2-port-for-switch-2-really-does-exist-its-claimed">receive a Switch 2 release</a>, but nothing official has been announced yet. The sequel / prequel originally launched in 2018 to critical acclaim and saw players take on the role of gang member Arthur Morgan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rockstar Games' <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">GTA VI</a> has been delayed again, with the highly-anticipated title now launching on 19th November 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Red Dead Redemption may be coming soon to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2, judging from a fresh finding.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the ESRB posted <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/">a new rating</a> for the classic Old West open-world game developed by Rockstar Games for the Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo current-generation systems. <span>The rating is unsurprisingly identical to the ones of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39915/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">PC</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39512/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">PlayStation 4,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39439/red-dead-redemption/" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;ports, an M for Mature 17+ due to the presence of blood and gore, intense violence, nudity, strong language, and more.</span></p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-point-of-a-new-port-of-red-dead-redemption">What's The Point of a New Port of Red Dead Redemption?</h2>



<p>Today's rating is somewhat surprising as Red Dead Redemption is already playable on all three systems via backward compatibility. As such, a new native release for current-generation systems can only mean that some new technical features should be included. In regard to content, no surprise should be expected due to the rating summary being identical across all versions of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-can-red-dead-redemption-be-improved-on-ps5-nintendo-switch-2-and-xbox-series-x-s">How Can Red Dead Redemption Be Improved on PS5, Nintendo Switch 2, and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The new Red Dead Redemption console ports may finally offer 60 FPS and beyond gameplay on all systems.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although the game can be played on current-generation consoles via backward compatibility, the experience may not be the best for the most demanding players, as 60 FPS gameplay is only available on PlayStation 5.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>PlayStation 4</th><th>Nintendo Switch</th><th>Xbox Series X|S</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1080p (PS4), upscaled to 4K on PS5</td><td>1080p docked / 720p handheld</td><td>1440p on Series S<br>Native 4K on Series X</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>30 FPS (locked), 60 FPS on PlayStation 5</td><td>30 FPS (locked)</td><td>30 FPS (locked)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Performance Enhancements</strong></td><td>Stable frame pacing, improved texture filtering</td><td>Optimized for handheld and docked play</td><td>Enhanced resolution, improved filtering, Auto-HDR</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-comparison-8k-rtx-4070/">PC port of Red Dead Redemption, on the other hand, is the most advanced</a>, offering up to 144 FPS gameplay, among other improvements that set it decisively above every other version of the game.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Red Dead Redemption PC Port Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution Support</strong></td><td>Up to native 4K resolution and ultrawide monitor support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>Up to 144 FPS support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics Enhancements</strong></td><td>Improved textures, enhanced shadows, updated anti-aliasing, higher draw distance, and overall graphical refinements, HDR 10 support</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other Features</strong></td><td>NVIDIA DLSS 3.7, AMD FSR 3.0, DLSS Frame Generation Support</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Considering the PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S have the horsepower to run what's basically an enhanced port of a PS3, Xbox 360 era game at high resolution and framerates, it's very likely the new Red Dead Redemption console ports will attempt to reach parity with the PC version in this regard. </p>



<p>Hopefully, a few more surprises will also be included in this new port, but even without any, improved resolution and framerates should be more than enough to make Red Dead Redemption an enjoyable experience on modern consoles.</p>

<p>A new entry in the Call of Duty franchise takes center stage in Black Ops 7, which follows the standard approach for the franchise with having a variety of level unlocks to gain access to new weapons, Perks, Scorestreaks, and more.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is making big changes to the formula this year, introducing a four-player co-operative campaign that is followed by a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-endgame-multiplayer-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new PvE endgame mode</a>, but there’s still plenty of familiar aspects to the game.</p>



<p>Unlocking the best weapons, Perks, Scorestreaks, and other items in Call of Duty is all part of the journey, and we’ve got details on all the Black Ops 7 level unlocks so you can track your progress.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-level-unlocks">All Black Ops 7 Level Unlocks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Progression is key. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 55 base levels to work through in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, followed by the customary Prestige system to further enhance your total level.</strong></p>



<p>While some weapons and Perks are available right from the start, the majority are unlocked through progression. However, Progression is universal in Black Ops 7, so you’ll level up whenever you play Campaign, Zombies, Multiplayer, or Warzone.</p>



<p>The table below showcases every level and what is unlocked by reaching it in Black Ops 7 Zombies. However, some content is only applicable for certain modes, so we’ve separated them out where appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-many-prestiges-are-in-black-ops-7">How Many Prestiges Are In Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 10 levels of Prestige available in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, with the final level, Death, coming alongside an endless amount of levels to churn through.</strong></p>



<p>Prestige Levels 1-9 follow the same process as the standard level-up, earning you unlockables at each level. However, you will receive a Permanent Unlock token after each Prestige, allowing you to choose any weapon, Perk, Equipment, or similar, to remain unlocked, whatever your level.</p>



<p>It’s worth using the Permanent Unlocks on items that are only unlocked in the higher levels of Black Ops 7, or for a weapon that has become your go-to in your chosen game mode.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gameplay Images and Information of Far Cry 7 Leak Online]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Images and information on Ubisoft’s upcoming Far Cry 7 and a separate extraction shooter have leaked online, but dataminers seem to be confused about what exactly they’ve unearthed.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming in 2024</a>, Far Cry 7 was originally under the development name ‘Talisker’, which was subsequently canceled, leading to the creation of two new Far Cry projects: Blackbird, its new mainline title, and Maverick, a new extraction-based shooter.</p>







<p>Some images were described by leakers as being from the Alaskan extraction shooter game, but, in my opinion, those images appear to be jungle-themed, with Maya pyramids found similar to those in the Mexican jungle, not Alaska. That’s because these images originate from project Talisker’s multiplayer mode, which was a team-based elimination-style mode, and is why giant billboards are scattered around the map. Concept art and early in-development images sent to Insider Gaming under the condition that they are not made public match the actual screenshots identically.</p>



<p>As seen in one screenshot we’ve embedded below, a giant rat seems to be pulling a dead player away because Talisker had animals experimented on in the story, which mutated. This story setting will still bleed into the main Far Cry 7 title, but as far as Maverick goes, you’re likely to encounter more realistic animals such as wolves and bears.</p>



<p>That’s, of course, if Maverick doesn’t get canceled, which, at the time of writing, is a possibility. According to sources, the game has struggled to find an engaging gameplay loop, and with constant leadership changes and development issues, the project could be at risk of cancellation. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://t.co/8JXwqqAzNu">https://t.co/8JXwqqAzNu</a></p><p>Far Cry 7 details have reportedly leaked via game files from XDefiant. Fans datamined images showing what appear to be locations from the next Far Cry, strongly suggesting an Alaskan setting, which lines up with previous rumors.</p><p>The leak also seems to… <a href="https://t.co/O1FztPsVxZ">pic.twitter.com/O1FztPsVxZ</a></p></div>— GameGPU (@GameGPU_com) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameGPU_com/status/1988730314726969477?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>One image from the three does stand out from the rest, though: the Beckett family. As reported in the past, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=far+cry+7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry 7 will have a 24 real-life hours</a> timer (72 hours in-game) to rescue their family, who have all been kidnapped. It’s not entirely clear how much this has changed (if at all), but at least at the time of writing, this somewhat controversial gameplay loop is still within the game.</p>







<p>As for who plays the protagonist in the game<span>, it’s currently unclear, as Cill</span>ian Murphy was reported (and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cillian-murphy-far-cry-7-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later debunked</a>) at one point, but I have heard that Kevin Durand (The Strain, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, The Naked Gun) was in the running for the role.</p>



<p>Apparently, these images originate from an old Ubisoft Confluence build, and could be why the screenshots and information are somewhat blurry from the original leakers.</p>

            <p>It's that time of year again. As a new Call of Duty is about to be released, FPS lovers are coming together in a long-lived and important cultural tradition. To play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> early, thousands of fans are digitally migrating to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Why are they doing this? Well, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 (like many games) doesn't have a unified worldwide release time. The game launches on the 14th November, and thanks to time zones it's playable earliest in New Zealand.</p>
<p>As such, players can hop into their console settings and change their region to New Zealand from the comfort of their home that in reality is thousands of miles away from the idyllic island nation. This lets an eager player easily access the game way earlier than intended, and they can always switch their regions back once the game is fully released worldwide.</p>

<p>This isn't a new phenomenon among Call of Duty players, or in all honestly players of various series which have disjointed global rollouts. It turns out the super-passionate gamer is a migratory bird of sorts, flying their profiles over to the home of the net gun to get some games in before heading home.</p><p>Already on community hubs for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 fans including Reddit, fans are celebrating <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/comments/1ova8ws/has_everybody_packed_their_bag_for_the_flight/">the incoming New Zealand release</a>. It's a running joke of sorts, with users speaking about these shenanigans as if going on a quick holiday. One user, Sneaky_Demise, wrote: "On my way to the airport now then a nap before midnight once I land".</p>
<p>You may be wondering, is this technique bannable? Well, over the past few Call of Duty games it certainly hasn't been. As long as players don't access the game prior to the New Zealand launch through more nefarious practices, and only start playing alongside their fellow gamers who actually live in New Zealand, it's been an unpunished practice. The New Zealand trick lives in the grey zone between what's allowed and what isn't, and has so far been ignored.</p>
<p>If you don't fancy heading on a quick trip to New Zealand, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-release-times-and-pre-load-dates">you can find the global release times for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> to make sure you're awake for the launch. The game is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-xbox-game-pass-games-for-november">also available in November's Game Pass line-up</a>, if you fancied trying it out before paying full price for it.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> and InZoi publishers Krafton have launched a voluntary redundancy program in what appears to be a bid to shed ballast and winnow out unbelievers as they reorganise around the usage of generative AI.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319">Business Korea</a> and passed along by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/krafton-launches-voluntary-resignation-program-for-employees-as-it-transforms-into-an-ai-first-company/">Automation Media</a>, the redundancy program follows a quarter of record profits. Krafton will dole out severance packages in tiers, with people who've been there one year or less getting six months salary, while those who've been there for over 11 years get 36 months.</p>
<p>According to a company spokesperson, "the core purpose is to support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation."</p>
<p>Krafton <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-to-undergo-complete-reorganization-as-it-positions-itself-as-an-ai-first-company">announced plans to refocus on generative AI for game development</a> in late October. These refocussings include splurging around $20.8 million/30 billion Korean won on retraining the workforce to use generative AI tools, while implementing some kind of automated management system.</p><p>They're also going to spend approximately $69.7 million/100 billion won on a new GPU cluster - that is, a frosty warehouse full of computers with phat graphics cards that pool their might to complete difficult tasks, like patterning a dataset to produce a mean Piña Colada recipe without exhorting the end user to drink sawdust.</p>
<p>Krafton have also announced a hiring freeze across all roles save for those related to developing new intellectual properties or doing things with fancy chatbots, as detailed by CFO Bae Dong-geun in an earnings call on 4th November. The emphasis will be on individual staff being more productive, instead. </p>
<p>"Excluding organizations developing original intellectual property (IP) and AI-related personnel, we have frozen hiring company-wide," Dong-geun said, adding that "rather than reducing costs through AI First, individual productivity must increase at the company-wide level, so we are stopping hiring for now, and we will organize and disclose later whether there will be changes to the five-year franchise IP strategy announced earlier this year."</p>
<p>This week, Epic's Tim Sweeney gave <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">an "optimistic" defence of generative AI</a> in response to Eurogamer's unimpressed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> review, arguing that "when tech increases productivity, competition leads to building better games rather than employing fewer people." It sort of feels like Krafton timed these announcements to wind him up.</p><p>Generative AI aside, Krafton are slap-bang in the middle of a legal war with ousted Unknown Worlds founders over the quality and release timing of Subnautica 2. I think Brendy and I have basically written a whole book on the subject by now. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-are-now-suing-their-former-execs-for-stealing-docs-and-sharing-them-with-the-press">the last news article we wrote</a>, in which Unknown Worlds accuse their old bosses of leaking things to the press.</p>

            <p>Red Dead Redemption has been <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/">rated by the ESRB</a> for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, suggesting a remaster is very much on the way.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, the game has been rated M, due to blood and gore, intense violence, strong language and sexual content, and more.</p>
<p>The description also notes gun fights with enemies will include zombies, suggesting the Undead Nightmare expansion will also be included.</p>

<p>Rumours of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-remaster-rumours-swirl">Red Dead Redemption remaster have been swirling for the last couple of years</a>. Originally released on the PS3, Red Dead Redemption is available on the PlayStation Store in its PS4 version - that's playable on PS5, but not fully optimised. Similarly, the original Xbox 360 version of the game is playable on current consoles via backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>This new rating suggests a native current gen version will be on the way. While the ESRB rating doesn't include a release date, its existence suggests it could be available soon.</p>
<p>Back in the summer, rumours circled of a next gen update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> - alongside a Switch 2 port. It's unclear if the sequel is also on the way, or if the two games have been confused in rumours.</p><p>Either way, Take Two CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-reportedly-set-for-switch-2-as-take-two-boss-praises-nintendos-console">Strauss Zelnick praised the Switch 2</a> in a financial briefing back in May. "Historically being a third-party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging," he said. "I think Nintendo's been very forthcoming in addressing that, and we're stepping up too because we have great optimism for the platform."</p>

			<p>There’s a deeply rooted part of the human psyche that plans and anticipates the worst things you can imagine. What if, while you’re stood in line waiting for the self checkout, or are sat in a cafe, a fight suddenly breaks out? What would you do?Suddenly you are daydreaming as you imagine the guy in front suddenly charging at you, but you move out of the way so he collides into the person behind you who was about to hit you with a stick. In your head, you can visualise these scenarios and outcomes as much as you want, but in reality you’d only have one shot. Forestrike takes that scenario of imagining fights and puts it in video game form.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forestrike | Gameplay Overview | The Fight Starts November 17" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hdWREMaGhJo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Forestrike, you play as Yu, who is an apprentice of the ability called Forestrike. The Order of Forestrikers used to be vast, but now it is just you and a handful of old masters imparting their knowledge to you as you go on a quest to save the Emperor and the Empire. The gameplay of Forestrike is built around a roguelite form, where each run offers different abilities to build up Yu to face the different combat puzzles ahead. And while it has all the appearance of a martial arts battler, Forestrike really is at its heart a puzzle game with combat elements.</p>



<p>As you progress through a run, Yu is put into different single scene situations with different enemy types being presented to you. This could range from two enemies up to around six. Yu’s own skills depend on which of the five masters you choose to follow for a run. Taigun, for example, is a master who values using enemy movements against them, encouraging a playstyle where you dodge and have enemies attack each other. Nodai, meanwhile, is much more focused on taking the tactical fight to the enemy, with his path offering a key block ability, and Ogai has the power of the storm on her side, and following her allows you to evade attacks and strike from behind.</p>

<p>While your chosen master gives you the bulk of the abilities on a run, you can pick up techniques from the other masters as you move along the paths, generally if you beat them in a fight. Some abilities will provide additional bonuses with dodging, better blocks, or ways to disarm enemies and cause more damage to them. All of them are reliant on your planning and execution, and that is where Forestrike comes in.</p>

<p>Unlike the majority of roguelikes, Forestrike allows you to practice a fight an unlimited number of times using the Forestrike power. When you foresee, you can test out different tactics to take out the enemies you are facing before they take you down. It doesn’t matter if you fail during this, because this is just Yu planning his attack in his mind. You are encouraged to find a tactic and practice it a few times before triggering the actual fight, because if you lose the real fight the run ends and you have to start again without any of your upgrades and abilities.</p>
<p>Some of the fights are relatively simple and may only need one or two practice runs, while others will need a lot of goes before going for the real attack. Even then, success is no guarantee, because a slight deviation from a plan can spell disaster. A misstep here or a rushed attack there may mean you suddenly need to think on your feet to salvage a fight, your best laid plan going right out the window. At other times you will face an impossible fight no matter what, whether that’s down to not having enough health or the wrong mix of abilities to progress. It can be really frustrating to reach those points, as you know the run is over no matter what you do.</p>

<p>Forestrike’s story is pretty run of the mill with a few little mysteries thrown in, but this is ultimately the struggle of a small group of rebels fighting against a powerful foe and their forces. I did like the music in the game as it has that martial arts feel to it, and the pixel art does convey the fight scenes pretty well.</p>
<p>A major issue I had while playing on Switch 2 was the game kept crashing at different times back to the home screen. A day one patch is planned that targets stability and performance, but Forestrike already had the foresight to save between each level, so runs aren’t cut short by crashes.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Forestrike is an entertaining blend of puzzle game and martial arts brawler, allowing you to experiment with different tactics. The different masters also provide variety with ability combinations that make each run unique. Running into some impossible fights that you simply can't beat and the crashing issue on Switch 2 do take some of the shine off the experience, though.	</p></div>

Back then, fans of the device had already been clamoring for a proper, more powerful new iteration, but Valve had just <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-might-not-arrive-until-2025-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that a Steam Deck 2 wouldn't be released until 2025 or 2026 because the technology they were looking for <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-0-doesnt-exist-because-technology-is-not-there-yet-valve-is-working-on-games-designed-for-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was simply not yet available</a>.</p>



<p>The Steam hardware family is officially set to expand early next year with the launch of the Frame headset, the new Steam Machine, and the new Steam Controller; however, there's no new Deck in sight yet. IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked Valve once again</a>, and Software Engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais reiterated that it still isn't time yet, although the company now has a good idea of what it's going to be. </p>



<p><em>Obviously the Steam Deck's not our focus today, but the same things we've said in the past where we're really interested to work on what's next for Steam Deck… the thing we're making sure of is that it's a worthwhile enough performance upgrade to make sense as a standalone product. We're not interested in getting to a point where it's 20 or 30 or even 50% more performance at the same battery life. We want something a little bit more demarcated than that. So we've been working back from silicon advancements and architectural improvements, and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there's no offerings in that landscape, in the SOC landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck. </em></p>



<p>It sounds like we'll have to wait until the latter half of 2027, in all likelihood, which could put the new Deck in direct competition with the PlayStation handheld that Sony is working on. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to rumors</a>, it's expected to offer a performance level similar to the base PlayStation 5 console. </p>



<p>Given that both devices will be powered by AMD technology, they could end up with similar performance if they are released near each other at a comparable price. Of course, there are too many unknowns at this point, which is expected given that these devices are a couple of years away. Still, keep following Wccftech to remain updated on the latest leaks, rumors, and news.</p>

            <p>Ah, it's gotten a bit worse. Bethesda are planning to release two patches to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> in order to rectify issues with its anniversary edition, meaning that the potential's there for more havoc to be played with mods. Though, outside of fixes for issues with the revamped Creations menu, it looks like a lot of the contents of these patches may end up being console-specific fixes, so there's a chance any extra PC disruption's relatively minimal.</p>
<p>I'd certainly hope it's less of a palaver than the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4s-script-extender-has-already-gotten-its-anniversary-update-as-bethesda-battle-creation-issues">update's initial arrival</a>, which many modders have been quick to get on top of and push updates for their works.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We’re actively investigating issues you’re encountering with the latest Fallout 4 update and Anniversary Edition launch," the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/377160/view/617683464289779908?l=english">Steam post</a> from Bethesda reads. "You should now see faster load times of the Creations menu, game menu, and redemption of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creation-club">Creation Club</a> items."</p>
<p>There's a hotfix coming to the game early next week, which the studio say will put the "issue causing creations that rely on DLC to not work" to bed, as well as a couple of problems specific to Xboxers and PlayStationeers. That ain't it, though. The hotfix'll be followed by two patches, the first arriving the week of November 24th, and the second being more loosely timetabled to rock up in the first half of December.</p><p>Bethesda haven't specified what'll be in either patch yet, with the exception of a boost to local Creations storage on Xbox. Maybe there'll only be one or two tweaks for us PC folk, but the studio not delineating these further patches as console-only suggests there'll at least be something PC-related in 'em. Here's hoping any tweaks are minimal, but even then, such is the nature of game updates that it can only take one bit of code moving or changing to throw a mod out of whack.</p>
<p>So, maybe leave any uber-modded returns to early next year if you want to play it safe in terms of avoiding any headaches.</p>

<p>In our Football Manager 26 review, I said, <em>“Football Manager 26 is the first step of a new era, and as we’re seeing with some of the biggest clubs in the country, any new era comes with the challenge of rebuilding and both setting and meeting expectations. Football Manager 26 can get better with updates, but I doubt that this entry will be the one to make the most of the switch to the new engine, overhauled UI and new features. It might take one or two more years for this rebuild to really meet its potential.”</em></p>

		<p>Embark Studios has released the 1.2.0 update for Arc Raiders, naming it North Line, which brings along the new Stella Montis map. Stella Montis is a facility that has lots of blocked up tunnels, but players are being tasked with digging deep into these tunnels to find out what was blocked off and why. In addition to the new map, Arc Raiders update 1.2.0 has fixed issues including players falling through terrain, an issue around missions not completing, and also introduced some balance changes. The full notes are below.</p>

<p>We are drawing ever closer to the release of Dotemu and Tribute Games' next side-scrolling beat 'em up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>, on <strong>1st December</strong>, and the devs have returned to give us another deep dive into some gameplay.</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/marvel-cosmic-invasion-devs-showcase-every-fighter-in-the-upcoming-beat-em-up">last video of this ilk</a> was all about the diverse character roster, this fresh peek gives us our best look yet at the tag-team-style 'Cosmic Swap' ability, which lets you sub in a new hero at the tap of a button.</p>
<p>We had spotted a bit of this arcade-inspired feature in previous trailers, but it's nice to have the minds behind the game run us through its intricacies.</p>
<p>"Gameplay-wise, the Cosmic Swap is an amazing tool," Game Director Frederic Gemus explains in the vid, "because it not only helps you address different situations with different characters, but also enables you to extend your combos by swapping mid-way and creating these amazing-looking combat sequences, or even just call in an assist so your teammate can take care of an enemy while you're taking care of another one."</p>
<p>It sounds like there's a good layer of depth to it all, too. Whether you want to tackle an enemy from a different angle or plan ahead to achieve a slick combo, the Cosmic Swap ability looks like it'll be something that we'll be using <em>a lot</em> in each and every playthrough.</p>
<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion arrives digitally on Switch and Switch 2 next month for <strong>£26.99 / $29.99</strong>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The final episode of swish and salacious Telltale-style caped tellydrama Dispatch released yesterday. It's been a surprise hit - according to the gabbling labcoats at GameDiscoverCo, AdHoc's superhero workplace comedy is approaching two million sales. Reasons given for this range from the appealing but uninvestigated - there's a Galactus-sized untapped audience for narrative single player games, and all the publishers are absolute spanners for doubling down on live service projects instead - to the boring - people are still keen on superheroes, especially sociopathic and disgusting superheroes that cut against archetypes from the more pompous Marvel films, and Dispatch is simply <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/telltale-and-the-boys-make-mostly-beautiful-love-in-dispatch-a-slick-and-surprisingly-tactical-superhero-comedy">a very well-made game</a>. </p>
<p>Good games sell? What a <em>gauche</em>, back-of-napkin excuse for industry analysis. There must be a more arcane and clever-sounding explanation for Dispatch's meteoric fortunes. Ah yes, here we go: speaking to GameDiscoverCo, AdHoc's CEO and exec producer Michael Choung has suggested that it's partly down to the weekly episodic release schedule.</p><!--more-->
<p>"We're really just borrowing a rhythm that's worked for decades on television," he <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/how-did-narrative-hit-dispatch-hit">told the site</a>. "That weekly cadence hits a sweet spot where anticipation builds, but not long enough to fade." That's it. That's the whole quote. Still, it has given me Thoughts. </p>
<p>One is that I can now no longer tolerate the thought of episodic schedules at all. After years of streaming TV platforms, I am now only capable of watching shows all in one go, while crying into bowls of lukewarm salsa. The thought of getting to episode 5 and having to wait multiple diurnal cycles for episode 6 is a source of torment. Anything could happen between episodes! I might start watching something else instead! A piano might fall on me! I might be forced to spend time with my own thoughts! A month between episodes? You might as well ship it after our sun goes supernova.</p><p>Another more developed thought is that I want to go back and compare the formal structure of episodic narrative artworks, from Star Trek to Telltale's Walking Dead games, thinking about how the release tempo affects, for example, the writing of relationships and the choice and structure of cliffhangers. Monthly episodes surely need to be more like standalone releases; within that, what kinds of narrative event are best for nurturing suspense and speculation over a 30 day interval? If I dangle the prospect of killing off a major character, is that a better fit for a weekly rollout? Sorry, these are questions of craft TV writers have been writing books about for decades.</p>
<p>A third thought is that all of this is a far cry from the Telltale days of multiple-month gaps between episodes. Episode 1 of The Walking Dead: Season 2 came out in December 2013. Episode 2 came out in March 2014. Incredible! Just imagine how many pianos could fall on you in three whole months. Telltale was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-telltale-games">notoriously mismanaged</a>, with parallel, staggered projects and changes of direction creating a culture of crunch; I'm not sure how much that dictated the longer gaps between episodes, but the studio was clearly operating at the brink of capacity, for a lot of the time.</p>
<p>A fourth thought is simply that I need to go back and finish Dispatch. I reviewed the first couple of episodes, but then a week went by in which I stumbled upon new anime series Sanda and decided to rewatch Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun (no high velocity piano encounters, at least). Still, I can just about remember enough of episodes 1 and 2 to grasp the stakes going into episode 3. IIRC, there are two romance interests, both Problematic, and a man with flammable BO wants to kick my head in.</p>

As ever, it's all about slapping up and taming big metal bears, birds and the like, this time as a custom character in a world filled with other players who're also in the robo-hunting business.</p>

<p>As Guerilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek says in the reveal video above, Steel Frontiers has been "built specifically for mobile" by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guild-wars">Guild Wars</a> publishers NCSoft, but is also coming to PC via the South Korean studio's launcher <a href="https://purple.plaync.com/download">Purple</a>.</p>
<p>Set in a region dubbed The Deadlands inspired by Arizona and New Mexico, the game'll see your custom Nora, Tenakth, Utaru, or Oseram "sharing the frontier with thousands of other players, sometimes working together to take down machines, sometimes competing with rival tribes, or fighting over resources". Sounds quite Monster Huntery, as you'd expect.</p><p>Executive producer Sung-Gu Lee says giving massive machine hunts the MMO treatment's been the key focus for Steel Frontiers. "We’ve added unique, original gameplay elements to the process of taking down giant machines," he explains. "For example, after destroying a specific part of a machine you can quickly approach and climb onto it using a Pullcaster, set traps on the damaged part, and inflict status effects. During battle, you can even pick up weapons dropped by the machine, carry them on your mount and use them in subsequent fights. At the heart of giant machine hunts are two core values: cooperation and strategy. Players must take on their roles, act strategically, and work together seamlessly. These combat mechanics truly shine in large-scale battles, offering the scale and dynamism that only an MMORPG can provide."</p><p>

The footage shown off thus far looks pretty graphically swanky regardless of the stated mobile-first focus, and contains a lot more big swords than I remember from my time playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Zero Dawn</a>. To be fair, I did spend 90% of that whacking things to death with Aloy's spear in a fashion I imagine led the game to sigh deeply while it gazed at the array of ranged weapons and gizmos I could be using if I didn't want to be flung at the scenery whenever I failed to dodge point blank swipes fast enough.

</p><p>Speaking of Aloy, she's nowhere to be seen in the video, so we'll have to see how or if the game works in any references to the metal-named huntress. As of right now, Steel Frontiers also doesn't have a release date. Alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-fire-arrows-alleging-nonsense-and-deliberate-corporate-water-muddying-at-tencent-as-horizon-lawsuit-rumbles-on-2">yelling at Tencent in court</a>, Sony and Guerilla have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/guerrilla-confirm-their-rumoured-online-horizon-game-is-indeed-real">previously confirmed</a> they've got a new mainline Horizon entry in the works, as well as an online Horizon game of their own.</p>

            <p>An upcoming and newly announced game in PlayStation's Horizon series is skipping PS5.</p>
<p>Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and Forbidden West developer Guerilla officially announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-mmo-reportedly-in-the-pipeline">series' long-rumored MMORPG</a>, known as Horizon Steel Frontiers. Steel Frontiers is coming from NCSoft, though Guerrilla has collaborated with the studio, and is a cross-platform release… for mobile and PC.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p><a href="https://hsf.plaync.com/en-us/conts/teaser#main">Steel Frontiers is described</a> as a "fierce survival adventure", in which players take on the role of machine hunters in a region known as Deathlands. The team promises "large-scale raids" and an "advanced combat system".</p>
<p>Along with the announcement, a trailer was shared for Horizon Steel Frontiers, which you can see further below in this article. However, while plenty have said the upcoming game looks actually pretty good, many have lamented that such a well known PlayStation series is getting a game that will not be released on PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>"It's a huge miss that this is skipping consoles," reads one comment on the trailer's YouTube announcement. Another adds: "I hope this comes to console soon because if not that’s CRIMINAL!!!"</p>
<p>Comments on X are similar. "Guys we want this on PlayStation too" and "how about starting by releasing this on PS5 as well? It looks awesome and I'd love to play it... On PS5!" are two such replies to Guerrilla's post.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Guerrilla/status/1988826301608661461?s=20">follow up post on X</a>, Guerrilla said it had "loved" working with NCSoft on Horizon Steel Frontiers, and the team is "beyond excited to be able to hunt machines together in the world of Horizon". The developer added Guerrilla itself is "still busily working on more ways for you to do just that", teasing "more on that to come".</p><p>While the studio is yet to officially reveal a third mainline entry in the Horizon series, Guerrilla previously confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-casually-confirms-horizon-forbidden-west-sequel">another game with Aloy at the forefront is in the pipeline</a>. In addition, a film adaptation based on the Horizon games is also in the works.</p>
<p>"Just imagine Aloy's beloved origin story set in a vibrant far future world filled with the giant machines brought to you for the first time on the big screen," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">PlayStation's Asad Qizilbash announced back in January of this year</a>.</p>
<p>For more on Horizon, earlier this year Aloy actress Ashly Burch spoke to Eurogamer about her thoughts on AI, and why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-developer-replacing-all-actors-with-robots-not-going-to-happen-says-aloy-voice-actress">she believes Guerrilla replacing all actors with robots is "not going to happen"</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> has received a fresh update that adds a new Casual difficulty option for combat, among other changes to make it easier.</p>
<p>While Konami hasn't detailed the specifics of Casual difficulty, it is presumably easier than the existing Story option. It's selectable when starting a new game, or will be an option after reaching the Game Over screen multiple times.</p>
<p>Other tweaks to make the game easier include faster stamina replenishment, fewer enemies in some encounters, and less damage taken on Hard action difficulty.</p>
<p>The update further adds an option to skip certain sections on New Game+, which won't impact branching paths or endings. Considering some story details are saved for later playthroughs, this change will make experiencing the full game a lot easier - as Eurogamer's Matt Wales explained in his piece on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-is-the-first-game-in-four-decades-to-convince-me-new-game-plus-is-worth-my-time">Silent Hill f's New Game+</a>.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Thank you to all SILENT HILL f players for your patience. Today we've released a patch that adds a new casual difficulty and addresses feedback we've received, including reducing the amount of forced combat areas, speeding up NG+ runs, and bug fixes such as Sakuko's diary in NG+. <a href="https://t.co/kCiz4DoDft">https://t.co/kCiz4DoDft</a></p>— Al Yang (@QQBert) <a href="https://twitter.com/QQBert/status/1988831306864538009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Though the game has been widely praised, Silent Hill f has been criticised for its combat encounters. In our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Eurogamer review of Silent Hill f</a>, Vikki Blake described the combat as "clumsy", which makes it "extraordinarily difficult to do any real exploration of the world".</p>
<p>As such, this new Casual difficulty should appease those critics somewhat, and allow more players to experience the story.</p>
<p>Below are the full patch notes.</p>

            <p>Hello. My name is Julian Benson and, as you will have gathered from the headline, I am the new Editorial Director of Rock Paper Shotgun.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While this is my announcement post, in truth, I've already been here a couple of weeks. However, I didn't want to draw too much attention to myself as I worked through the treehouse, mapping out its dimensions on gridpaper.* I have had some successes in puzzling out the workings of this ancient structure – for instance, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-only-more-games-ended-like-hardspace-shipbreaker">finding out how articles are posted</a>. Though, there are many rooms still to uncover, so I may remain in the background a little as I get situated. The bashing of furniture and snarls coming from behind the door marked  'Comment Moderation' suggest I should leave that one till last. But I did want to put my head above the treehouse's parapet – the crenellations are an architectural nod to its earlier days as RPS Towers and Castle RPS – and let you know who I am and why I'm here.</p>
<p>Back in 2012, when I was still working as a volunteer for long-departed gaming site Beefjack (alongside James, coincidentally), I reached out to Jim to pitch an article about transcribing games into musical notation. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/music-to-my-thumbs-transcribing-braid">The resulting article</a> was more ambitious than my writing ability could sustain, but I'll never forget the depth with which RPS's commenters engaged with and challenged my ideas. In all the years since, it was a level of discussion I've rarely seen at the other sites I've written for. Still, it would be more than a decade before I could return to RPS's pages outside of the Sunday Papers.</p>
<p>In the intervening years, I've worked for sites such as TechRadar Gaming, GAMINGbible, and Kotaku UK, as well as RPS's other other fanzine, PCGamesN. It was only when I returned to freelance in 2023, appearing in Edge, The Guardian, and GQ, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/julian-benson">I could once again write on RPS</a>. Even a decade later, it still carries the thrill of that first feature.</p><p>As long as I've been writing about videogames I've been reading RPS, and there is no publication that has had a greater impact on how I talk about games and see their role in our lives. Part of the magic of this site is that it is a place where writers and readers will afford a game equal attention, whether it was made by a single developer or built by thousands. It is a magic conjured by a team of passionate writers, and equally passionate readers, who care about games and how they fit into culture – which is to say, alongside other artforms, neither above nor below them. So when the opportunity to join the team arose, I seized it.</p>
<p>That RPS is a space where this discussion can take place is only because of the hard work of the many members of the team who came before, a line stretching back to the site’s founders. Though I want to acknowledge in particular the size of the shoes Graham has left behind. Each of his boots are big enough to comfortably fit a Clarks outlet in the toe and a Doc Martens warehouse in the heel. Over 12 years, he and the team established and maintained the direction and voice of RPS, making it into the place I have the opportunity to lead today. The footsteps he and the others left are clear and I'm going to try my best to follow them and keep them in sight whenever we strike out into the new.</p>
<p>In the months since Graham's departure, the team has done an excellent job of running RPS. Selfishly, their capability makes my job of proving I can be of some use much harder. Now that I'm here I can't wait to lend a hand wherever I can.</p>
<p>I find the title of 'Editorial Director' to be uncomfortably grand, but it does capture my responsibility: I will be working hard to support this talented team do their best work, and for you, the readers, I will be the point of contact when you want to discuss the direction of the site. I'm not on social media but you can email me or reach out through the comments whenever you need.</p><p>To give you a sense of our current plans, at the moment we are hard at work putting together all the pieces that will see out the end of 2025: Advent Calendars, Selection Boxes, and larger pieces, such as this year's RPS 100, which has seen some significant upsets in the voting since last year's edition – my love of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/orcs-must-die">Orcs Must Die!</a> will not be denied. And we will also be asking for your opinion, too, with a return of the RPS 100: Reader's Edition, which we plan to run through December.</p>
<p>We will have other announcements to make in 2026, I just need to find a way to get Graham's massive shoes out of my office so I can reach the desk…</p>
<p>So for now, I will say 'Hello! I am thrilled to be here'.</p>
<p>*I also used the time honing my Horace-drawing abilities. You can tell me if that time was spent fruitfully.</p>

<p>Season 5 in Marvel Rivals features all the tweaks we’ve come to expect with the seasonal transition of the title, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-team-up-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shake-up to Team-Up Abilities</a>, and tweaks are made to specific heroes to ensure they all remain viable.</p>

<p><strong>Season 5 sees potentially the biggest balance changes of all, and remarkably, there’s not a single nerf at launch. Instead, a host of characters are receiving buffs.</strong></p>



<p>For Vanguards, stand-out changes include Peni Parker’s Cuber-Webs now providing the same Healing Over Time and Movement Boost to ally players as she receives, while Magneto’s Metal Bulwark and Iron Bulwark have had their cooldowns seperated, although the shield value is reduced from 250 to 200.</p>



<p>In the DPS scene, Mister Fantastic’s Bonus Health has been tweaked to provide an addition of 350 Maximum Health and a one-time heal of 350, which is removed upon exiting his inflated state, while Squirrel Girl’s Burst Acorn damage has been increased to 110 from 100.</p>



<p>Finally, two Strategists have seen their base health increased, with Cloak &amp; Dagger and Loki receiving the boost, while Invisible Woman can now deploy a shield in front of her.</p>

            <p>Xbox boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has commented on Valve's freshly announced hardware, stating "gaming moves forward when players and developers have more ways to play and create, especially across open platforms".</p>
<p>Writing on social media, the exec praised "open platforms" for this forward momentum. "Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox's vision from the start," <a href="https://x.com/XboxP3/status/1988677531801944496">Spencer said</a>.</p>

<p>Rounding out his thoughts and congratulating Valve on its hardware announcements, Spencer closed: "As one of the largest publishers on Steam, we welcome new options for players to access games everywhere."</p>
<p>Elsewhere on social media, a fellow Xbox employee in the form of senior social media manager Josh Stein remarked that Valve's new hardware looked kind of like the "rumoured" Xbox Series S designs from back in 2019.</p>
<p>"All hail the cube," <a href="https://x.com/steinekin/status/1988671218099339775">Stein joked</a>.</p>

<p>While this may be quite a humorous coincidence, Valve has said the announcement of its Steam Machine stemmed from the company's own PC gaming experience. It is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-dont-work-back-from-whats-happening-in-other-spaces-valves-new-steam-hardware-stems-from-its-pc-gaming-experience-not-what-console-makers-playstation-and-xbox-are-doing">not coming from what fellow console makers such as Xbox were planning</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to our Will Judd on the new hardware's announcement, Valve said: "We typically just work back from our own experience playing PC games and what we wish was possible to do and what we hear our users say as well."</p><p>Valve's new Steam hardware will be released next year, though release dates are currently unknown. If you're hoping to get your hands on it all, know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-it-be-easy-to-buy-a-steam-machine-valve-confirms-its-continually-improving-how-it-distributes-hardware-ahead-of-the-release-of-its-new-hardware-launches">Valve will continue to self-distribute hardware just as it did with the Steam Deck</a>.</p>
