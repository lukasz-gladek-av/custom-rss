			<p>Stellar Blade's PC launch has been a smashing success, as the game has been confirmed to be the fastest- selling Korean game on the platform.</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://t.co/CkPC5KqbI6">financial report </a>for the second quarter of the current fiscal year, Shift Up reported an all-time best performance since the founding of the company, with an operating revenue of 112bn KRW and an operating profit of 68bn KRW. Much of this record-breaking performance is thanks to Stellar Blade, as 58% of the quarterly revenue was from the action RPG. By all metrics, the game continues to be successful even one year after its debut on PlayStation 5, as the game is the fastest-selling Korean game on Steam with <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">1 million units sold in three days</a>, and a total of 3 million sales across PC and console. The nearly 200,000 concurrent users peak on Steam also confirms the game's commercial success, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/">beating every other flasgship AAA games published by Sony</a>, including Ghost of Tsushima (77K peak Steam CCU), God of War (73K), Spider-Man (66K), Horizon: Zero Dawn (57K), and The Last of Us Part 1 (37K).</p>



<p>Seeing how Stellar Blade continues to be successful, it's not surprising to see Shift Up continuing to support it on both PC and PlayStation 5. Earlier this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-1-3-0-pc-patch-amd-fsr/">a new patch</a> went live on all formats, introducing improvements and bug fixes for a more enjoyable experience.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5, and may hit Nintendo Switch 2 at some point in the future.

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Doesn’t Use Controversial EOMM System, Says NetEase Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-does-not-use-eomm-says-netease-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-doesn%E2%80%99t-use-controversial-eomm-system-says-netease-games.1267788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Marvel Rivals player base has dwindled in recent times, and many in the community believe EOMM is a big reason. NetEase has publicly acknowledged the belief and says it’s not the case. The developer is preparing a video set to break down how the game’s matchmaking works.</p>



<p>When you think of matchmaking in major FPS games, you probably default to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM</a>. This is known as Skill-Based Matchmaking, and is a contentious (and constant) frustration across multiplayer games. It favors an algorithm that keeps players in matches with similarly skilled players. EOMM doesn’t get the headlines SBMM does, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-marvel-rivals-planning-collaborations-with-other-marvel-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has been linked with the controversial system for a while.</p>



<h2 id="h-netease-working-on-video-to-explain-marvel-rivals-matchmaking">NetEase Working on Video to Explain Marvel Rivals Matchmaking</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Swiping away the accusations. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>Presumably tired of the speculation, the Marvel Rivals <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account posted an update on August 12.</p>



<p>“Hi Rivals! As our game continues to thrive, we want to reiterate that Marvel Rivals does not use EOMM. We are currently working on a video to demonstrate our developer insights on the matchmaking and ranking system, which is expected to be released next week,” it said.”</p>



<p>EOMM stands for ‘Engagement Optimized Matchmaking.’ Whereas SBMM targets competitive matches and lobbies, EOMM focuses on player retention and engagement. The long-standing belief is that EOMM is designed to give you regular doses of the highs and lows of online gaming.</p>



<p>One second you’re wrecking lobbies multiple games running—racking up a nasty K/D and W/L ratio—the next, you’re on an unexplainable losing streak. The idea is that the wins keep you playing because you feel powerful, and the losses encourage you to keep playing to secure the next win.</p>



<p>It sounds similar to SBMM. However, the underlying motive is to keep you playing and coming back for more, increasing the likelihood of you spending money on microtransactions.</p>

<p>The video should be a fascinating peek behind the curtain. Will NetEase be completely transparent, or do you think the developer will retain some of the finer details?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-rileycs-cheating-allegations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/viral-vtuber-%E2%80%98rileycs%E2%80%99-has-been-banned-on-twitch-following-battlefield-6-cheating-allegations.1267785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A VTuber has been banned on Twitch after her Battlefield 6 gameplay clip amassed tens of millions of views.</p>



<p>The Vtuber, named RileyCS posted her Battlefield 6 clips on X on August 8, which prompted many users to accuse her of cheating. The discourse around the clip has resulted in the video accumulating 47.8 million views at the time of writing. </p>



<p>Presumably, the viral tweet has resulted in her being reported to Twitch by those who think she’s been cheating, which has resulted in her ban.</p>



<p>You can watch the clip below to decide for yourself if you think she’s cheating:</p>

<h2 id="h-the-battlefield-6-cheating-allegations">The Battlefield 6 Cheating Allegations</h2>



<p>At first glance, it isn’t difficult to jump to the conclusion that Riley is indeed cheating after watching the footage. Her unique playstyle, which requires her to ‘flick’ onto enemies to get gameplay clips for content, does have all the traits of cheating. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end/"><strong>RELATED – When Does The Battlefield 6 Beta End? Open Beta End Times Explained</strong></a></p>



<p>However, some have argued in favour of Riley, stating that she’s known within the community for this type of content. Battlefield YouTuber Enders has also analysed the clips, which makes for an interesting watch if you have the time. But then again, the counterargument is that you can turn aimbot on and off very easily (with a foot pedal for instance). </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Whether Riely is cheating or not is something that will probably be hotly debated for the foreseeable future until either EA comes out to debunk the claims, or Riely plays at some kind of LAN event.</p>



<p>Regardless, the viral clip has prompted dozens more players to capture similar clips and post them to X. So, the cheating accusations within the community against players, regardless if they are legit or not, will likely continue. </p>



<p><strong>UPDATE – Rileycs has now been unbanned from Twitch.</strong></p>



<p>What do you think of Riley’s clips? Do you think she was cheating in Battlefield 6? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/palworld-ripoff-palland-on-nintendo-switch/">The Gamer</a>, a new title by the name of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/palland">Palland</a> is now available via the Switch eShop, and everything from its basic description to its screenshots indicate that it's a blatant rip-off of Palworld. Does that also make it a rip-off of <strong>Pokémon</strong>..? Well, Nintendo would probably say so, yes. We're not so sure about Pocketpair.</p>
<p>Developed by BoggySoft (lovely), Palland was released on <strong>31st July 2025</strong> yet has already been heavily discounted by 60% to a paltry <strong>£3.99 / $5.99</strong>. Just goes to show how much faith BoggySoft has in its product, huh?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mypuqx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>We should also point out that the screenshots included on the eShop page (which you can view below) don't appear to be indicative of the actual experience. If you check out gameplay videos on YouTube from channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UebFsxkHwM">Nintendo Hall</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW4CCT5C7hQ">Game Buoy Games</a>, you can see that the visuals aren't even remotely comparable. Where's all the grass?! It's almost on par with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet and Violet</a>, for goodness' sake (<em>joking</em> - gosh).</p>
<p>Anyway, it's interesting (and funny) that the game responsible for Nintendo's recent lawsuit against Pocketpair now has its own rip-off – on the Switch, no less! Guffaw.</p>

<p>We're fascinated to see whether Pocketpair takes any action against BoggySoft and Palland while it's still knee-deep in its own legal battle against Nintendo. Chances are it probably won't, but who knows.</p>

            <p>Right, stop eating your mate for a minute. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>'s had a big update from developers Aggro Crab and Landfall Games, and it adds a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monument-valley">Monument Valley</a>-esque location for you to scale the cliffs of.</p>
<p>Before you can go mountaineering among the sandy cacti and roaring tornadoes, though, you'll want to put on some suncream. Yes, I know you now do the cannibalism thanks to co-op climber's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-cannibalism-is-delivered-by-the-co-op-climbers-latest-patch">most recent patch</a>, but you've still got to take your skincare seriously. Come on, at least take a parasol.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Mesa biome is Peak's first alternative to its standard Alpine island, with the two set to settle into a rotation once Mesa's had an initial week in the sun. "Explore the sandy terrain under the blistering sun... alongside plenty of mysteries that lie within the shade," the devs write of what to expect. It appears one of these hidden surprises is waiting for you inside a kiln (nobody tell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2onuBxhafg">the Aunty Donna boys</a>).</p>
<p>You'll be trying not to succumb to the heat, while dodging the likes of whirling tornadoes and tumbleweeds, which the update's trailer seems to suggest are more lethal than you might expect of your average meandering plantlife. That's in addition to the age-old Peak threat of just falling to your death from a great height, something I'd imagine won't be helped by the fact the update adds in sticks of dynamite that you and your fellow climbers can run across and make go boom. Hey, at least you can now point at a fuse whenever someone starts licking their chops at the idea of chewing your fingers.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>🌵 THE MESA UPDATE IS OUT NOW 🌵</p><p>a new PEAK biome has dropped on an island near you ‼️ </p><p>explore the sandy terrain under the blistering sun... alongside plenty of mysteries that lie within the shade. <a href="https://t.co/Ni6YGCpQLd">pic.twitter.com/Ni6YGCpQLd</a></p></div>— AGGRO CRAB 💥 (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1954936000045805590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Among the other new items added in are balloons, scout cannons, parasols, sunscreen, and aloe vera. So, it seems the devs have popped into their local health and beauty shop after raiding Wile E. Coyote's ACME surplus. Armed with this stuff, you're tasked with earning a bunch of new badges that dish out fresh gear.</p>
<p>The Mesa update also adds an optional no-insects mode for creepy crawlyphobes, makes some performance improvements, and dishes out some bug fixes. Among the latter are tweaks that prevent legs getting stuck in luggage, as well as one that stops you fiddling with your backpack after you've passed out.</p>
<p>"A lot of you are asking about future updates and to be as honest as possible - we aren't quite sure yet," Aggro Crab and Landfall wrote to close out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498328557405079710?l=english">the update's notes</a>. "We don't want to promise a bunch of stuff and not deliver. BUT we will continue to update the community on what we're cooking as soon as we can. At this stage, keep expecting bug + stability patches for now!"</p>
<p>Right, off you go to climb those buttes. You'd better not come back glowing pink or your mum'll be furious.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peaks-mesa-update-lets-you-shimmy-your-sandy-butt-up-some-sandy-buttes-adds-tornados-and-dynamite]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While admitting that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>'s launch on Steam "underperformed", developers Remedy have re-iterated their commitment to the co-op shooter in their <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">latest financial report</a>, saying that it remains "a solid game to build on" and confirming that a previously announced major update will arrive in late September.</p>
<p>The report also gives quick mini-updates on the development of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> and the combined <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/max-payne">Max Payne 1</a> &amp; 2 remake, both of which remain on course.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to Remedy CEO Tero Virtala, Control spinoff Firebreak enjoyed a launch that "succeeded technically" and attracted plenty of players on console. However, it "underperformed" on Steam, which had been pegged as the storefront through which it would attract most of its PC players. The overall result was launch sales that left the studio "unsatisfied", and have seen the game rely on Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus to prop it up out of the gate.</p>
<p>However, Remedy's commitment to updating and and improving Firebreak isn't faltering, and the studio are reportedly pleased with feedback to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-a-bit-of-a-rough-launch-remedy-promise-that-fbc-firebreak-improvements-are-on-the-way">the changes they've already made</a>, citing a turnaround in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fbc-firebreak-review">review sentiment</a> as updates have arrived. "FBC: Firebreak was designed as a game that evolves over time," Virtala said, "Despite the rocky launch, we believe we have a solid game to build on." Firebreak's first major update, which Remedy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540?emclan=103582791474781150&amp;emgid=536607976683733002">first teased last month</a>, is set to arrive in late September and bring a new job (aka mission) with it.</p>
<p>Remedy have consistently maintained their public-facing support for the shooter, and it's encouraging to see that hasn't changed now that they've had to explain its rough launch to the money types. After all, the need to make spreadsheets look and presentations sound as dollar-sign-heavy as possible is leaving an awful lot of games that won't provide immediate runaway successes (or need a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">long-term push to get them where they want to be</a>) facing the chopping block. That's been doubly true for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">multiplayer games which suffer difficult releases</a>.</p>
<p>As for Control 2 and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-are-remaking-max-payne-1-2">Max Payne 1 and 2 remake</a>, the former is "on track towards meeting its next milestones", with "the gameplay, environments, and missions" being the big focus of its development right now. Meanwhile, the Payne remake is still in the full production phase, with Remedy making sure they keep working closely with collaborators Rockstar as the game approaches a "next major phase". Sales-wise, the studio say both Control and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> are still ticking away nicely, with the rights to the former having now transferred fully into Remedy's hands.</p>
<p>So, all eyes towards that big September update for Firebreak, and the job Remedy do in continuing to revamp their game that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/controls-office-junior-firebreak-cant-decide-if-its-a-job">designed not to be a second job</a>, despite containing jobs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-are-still-backing-fbc-firebreak-despite-a-slow-steam-launch-confirming-its-next-major-update-for-september]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Final have a long and storied history in the audio sector. Established in 1974, the Japanese company soon became well-known for their detailed audio, with products from record player cartridges through to speakers and amps. In the present day, Final have retained that penchant for detail, turning their focus to consumer headsets and earbuds. The Final VR3000 Wireless is the latest of those products, a true wireless</p>
<p>The Final VR3000 Wireless is a pair of gaming-focused Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz wireless-equipped earbuds, with our review unit arriving in an understated black. In the pack you get the earbuds, a dinky USB-C low-latency wireless dongle, a curved charging case, a charging cable, and a selection of eartips so you can find the best fit.</p>
<p>The case is relatively small – about the same width as an Airpod Pro case, but thicker thanks to the wider earbuds inside. It’s pleasantly smooth, but it’s definitely lighter and more plasticky feeling than some of those you’ll experience with more premium earbuds. In terms of controls, there’s a single pairing button on the front, and four LEDs to show charging state and connection to the earbuds, while charging comes via the USB-C port at the bottom.</p>



<p>The earbuds boast a very good 11 hours of charge, with the case extending that by 38 hours, and they can both go&nbsp;from empty to full in two hours. The VR3000 Wireless have been great for a few recent trips, lasting through all of my Switch 2 gaming while on the go, and the few times I’ve had to charge they’ve topped up super-fast. They’re definitely easy to live with.</p>

<p>The low-latency USB-C transmitter is nice and small, so whether you’re using the top or bottom USB-C sockets on Switch 2 – or any other device, including mobile – it’s small enough to stay out of the way, and doesn’t look too odd or out of place. My one fear is that there’s no place for this in the charging case, and it feels as though it’s something that I’m going to lose sooner or later, or a feature that’s best kept at home.</p>
<p>The earbuds themselves take some design cues from Apple’s Airpods, with a short arm extending down from the body of the earbud, though the touch controls are on the main surface of the earbud instead of the stem. They have a larger central body though, and that undoubtedly helps the VR3000’s bass response. It doesn’t make them the slimmest or sleekest buds though, and I found they stick out just that little more than some earbuds out there. They’re made from relatively light black plastic though, and the low weight means that they don’t start to wear on you through longer listening or gaming sessions.</p>

<p>The Final VR3000 wireless sound excellent, especially for gaming. The use of the USB-C 2.4Ghz transmitter certainly improves the audio quality, but there isn’t a gulf of difference between wireless and Bluetooth that you might find elsewhere. The bass response is powerful and enveloping, making it ideal for high-action titles like Cyberpunk 2077, while it dispenses more thoughtful soundtracks like those found in Tales of Shire or Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar with careful nuance.</p>
<p>There is a little more mid in the mix than I’d often look for, particularly when listening to music, but it helps to lift vocals and dialogue from the other instrumentation or audio details. I did find that music listening benefited from some EQ tweaking, but Bad Omen’s Concrete Jungle sounded excellent, with powerful guitars grinding away while the soaring vocals showcase the separation that the VR3000 are capable of.</p>
<p>The VR3000 Wireless have clearly been tuned for gaming and content though. I’ve been consistently surprised by just how good they sound, and their form factor has made them an ideal choice for handheld and mobile gaming. I’ve been playing a lot of Wild Hearts S, and the monster-hunting action sounded brilliant with the VR3000, especially the Eastern-influenced orchestral soundtrack.</p>

<p>That’s helped by the hybrid ANC. The noise cancellation is clearly a step below what you’ll find in Apple’s AirPods Pro or Sony’s XM5 earbuds, but it does a decent job of erasing sounds like fan noise from your PC, Steam Deck or Switch 2, or cutting down on &nbsp;low-level train and plane background sound. The lighter effect does mean that no discernible pressure or audio alteration is happening, and if you’re playing competitively, that’s going to help you stay focused and on point. At this price point, it’s a welcome inclusion, even if it isn’t the strongest version I’ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>Final have their own Android and iOS app as well, though it is distinctly bare bones. It does, however, let you adjust the EQ settings, with a batch of presets, and there’s the option to customise the sound setup as well, which is essential. Besides that, you can turn the ANC on and off, or set it to Ambient, and update the earbuds’ firmware. It is all very clear and easy to operate, but it would have been nice to delve into the earbuds’ setup a little further.</p>
<p>At £129.99, the Final VR3000 sit in the mid-range price point for earbuds. If you’re gaming, the USB-C dongle offers a clear advantage over Bluetooth-only options, both in terms of latency and reliable connection. If you have a Switch 2 or a Steam Deck, that recommendation is even higher as the dongle pops into the top USB-C port. If you’re planning on listening to a lot of music though, the Hecate GX05 are the better option, offering Hi-Res audio, and a place to store the USB-C dongle, though the huge, heavy, screen-scratching metal case will be a distinctly bigger statement than the VR3000’s understated option. If you find you have more money in your pocket, there’s also the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds which have a lot of the same features, but improve on some of the VR3000’s core features such as ANC, while including having a space in the case for the dongle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1955159081259258112">has announced</a> that it’s bringing <em>Fortnite</em> back to iOS in Australia, after the country’s federal court ruled that Apple and Google’s app marketplaces are anticompetitive. Epic CEO <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1955163422502408272">Tim Sweeney said on X</a> that <em>Fortnite</em> will be made available on iPhones via the Epic Games Store “at a date to be determined,” while the company navigates the complexities of Australia’s antitrust ruling.</p><p>Epic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323100/epic-google-australia-legal-claim-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit">sued Google in Australia</a> in March 2021, after suing Apple in November 2020. A single court is handling both cases in parallel, even though they weren’t filed at the same time.</p><p>On Tuesday, federal judge Jonathan Beach found that Apple and Google misused their app marketplace dominance and in-app purchase commission fees of up to 30 percent to reduce competition, the <a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/federal-court-finds-apple-google-anticompetitive-in-fortnite-app-fight-20250811-p5mm2f"><em>Australian Financial Review</em></a> reports. However, Beach rejected Epic’s claims that the tech giants had broken consumer law or engaged in “unconscionable conduct” — meaning particularly harsh, unfair, or oppressive behavior that goes against societal norms. We are still awaiting further details from Beach’s final judgment, which is more than 2,000 pages long and won’t be released publicly.</p><p>“We welcome the court’s rejection of Epic’s demands that we distribute app stores from within the Google Play store, and Epic’s attacks on other critical security protections that users rely on,” Google spokesperson Dan Jackson said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>“However, we disagree with the court’s characterization of our billing policies and practices, as well as its findings regarding some of our historical partnerships, which were all shaped in a fiercely competitive mobile landscape on behalf of users and developers,” Jackson said. “We will review the full decision when we receive it and assess our next steps.”</p><p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-12/epic-games-fortnite-v-apple-google-federal-court-case/105641794">Australia’s <em>ABC News</em></a>, an unnamed Apple spokesperson said that the company welcomes the court’s rejection of some of Epic’s claims, but that it disagrees with other aspects of the ruling. “Apple faces fierce competition in every market where we operate,” the spokesperson said. “We continuously invest and innovate to make the App Store the safest place for users to get apps and a great business opportunity for developers in Australia and around the world.”</p><p>Epic originally sued Apple and Google in the United States on August 13th, 2020, in two separate cases which went before two separate judges, with dramatically different results in each case. Epic largely <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling">lost its fight against Apple</a> after attempting to take the fight all the way to the US Supreme Court, but Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">may lose a large degree of control over its App Store anyhow</a> because it failed to comply with the district court’s order.</p><div><p>After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments">removing <em>Fortnite</em> from the App Store</a> in 2020 amid its feud with Epic, Apple later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661290/fortnite-ios-iphone-epic-games-back-apple-app-store">brought the game back</a> to its iPhone app marketplace in May. <em>Fortnite</em> also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">returned to iPhones in the EU last year</a>, but only via the Epic Games Store for iOS.</p></div><p>Meanwhile in the US version of the Google trial, Epic has continually won: in late 2023, a jury unanimously decided that Google turned its Play Store and Play Billing system into an illegal monopoly, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716856/epic-v-google-win-in-appeals-court">just affirmed that decision at the end of July</a>.</p><p>That decision could blow up Google’s control over its app store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717440/google-epic-open-play-store-emergency-stay">within weeks or months</a>, unless Google gets the Ninth Circuit to grant a stay while it appeals to the US Supreme Court or grants a full en banc review of the three-judge panel’s decision.

Humanity might be on the ropes, but in the towering stronghold of The Belfry they have created a beacon of salvation that casts rays of hope across a ruined land.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That sense of optimism in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds is seared into the gameplay itself, with Stoic asking players to lean on their companions and fight for a brighter future by working together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grammy-nominated </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> composer Austin Wintory, who previously worked with Stoic to piece together the score for The Banner Saga, sought to mirror that sense of optimism and joyousness in the game's soundscape.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking about his process to Game Developer earlier this year, Wintory explained he strove to craft a score that refused to veer into nihilism or cynicism. Yes, there is darkness—but never without light. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> creative director Ernie Jorgensen told Wintory he wanted the title to reflect the sort of emotional qualities you often find in Pixar or Disney movies. The veteran composer did his best to oblige.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That [request] felt really novel because lots of games are all too excited to lean into the gritty side of things, not least of which our previous collaboration, The Banner Saga trilogy! Those games were super heavy, and so I think part of it was also just a reaction to that," explained Wintory.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/digging-into-sag-aftra-s-stellar-win-with-sarah-elmaleh-game-developer-podcast-ep-51" target="_self" data-discover="true">Digging into SAG-AFTRA’s Stellar Win With Sarah Elmaleh - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 51</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"How that manifested musically was a few different things but above all, the music is very very melodic. Big, old fashioned, almost 19th century-style Romantic melodies in a great big orchestral palette. In a world where so many games (including many of my own!) put tons of emphasis on mood and texture, leaning so hard into a bygone tradition gave it that optimistic quality. I think part of why that works, and maybe I'm simply being sentimental here, is that those traditions are really powerful and special, and it felt like we were doing our part to ensure their preservation."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Wintory, preservation is itself an act of hope. "To say 'these things that were plentiful before actually mattered, and are worth saving,' that feels like an intrinsically optimistic thing to do," he added. "That's my own projection at least."&nbsp;</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uBPHKPDIscw?si=b3bWIWbnXkcxwExm" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even so, Wintory admitted he initially felt as if he was "betraying" his own creative process by leaning on old fashioned techniques instead of taking wild swings. He said he strives to be as "radical as possible" within the parameters of each project, but this time around had to coax out his nostalgic side.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/sag-aftra-members-ratify-new-interactive-media-contract-conclude-year-long-strike" target="_self" data-discover="true">SAG-AFTRA members ratify new interactive media contract</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As part of that process, he sought to ensure individual musicians received their time in the limelight. Highlighting musicianship has always been a fundamental part of his approach, but it became even more central with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For example, the cello performances of Tina Guo in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Journey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were extremely significant to me. I wanted to make sure players don't just hear a 'cello' in some abstract way, but that they feel and hear her. Her choices, her subjective touches. Every project I've worked on except for the very, very tiny number of ones that were truly 100 percent electronic (like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>flOw</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, my first ever game), this has been important. But with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, there aren't really any tricks beyond that. It's the entire focus," he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"On top of that, our interactive combat system is built around an idea of really feeling the orchestra up-shift and down-shift in energy. Without feeling those changes in the actual performances themselves, and the way they made the air vibrate, the whole thing wouldn't come off. I wanted to make sure you could feel this amazing 70-piece orchestra pivot from playing very loud to very soft. The actual decibels on the recording are nearly the same, but the emotional impacts are so distinct from each other."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/sag-aftra-urges-more-non-struck-game-studios-to-sign-interim-agreement" target="_self" data-discover="true">SAG-AFTRA urges more non-struck game studios to sign interim agreement</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those performances were captured in Wintory's backyard of Los Angeles at the legendary Warner Bros scoring stage. The seasoned maestro said it's one of only a handful of video game projects to have been recorded in the city in the past 15 years—joining the likes of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in that very exclusive club. It has been 12 years since Wintory himself recorded there and it was a homecoming that felt long overdue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When I was about 14 years old I saw a documentary about the composer Jerry Goldsmith, my all-time favorite, and in it we see a lot of footage of him conducting the recordings from the 1994 thriller </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The River Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. And something I always loved was that he wouldn't say "French Horns, at bar 20 can you be louder?" He would say "Jim, a bit louder at bar 20." Or "Mike, let's try something else at the end here," talking to pianist Mike Lang," he explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The orchestra were his peers, even his friends. Almost like being in a band. And that was a huge motivation for me wanting to pursue music and composing, and also to live specifically in LA. A town where seemingly everyone is creative and you constantly go into a studio together to make art. What a dream!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Sadly, it's proven to not be the case in terms of recording games. I've been lucky to do a handful of movies and other things here over the years, but 99 percent of my game recording has been in cities like London, Nashville, Vienna and Skopje (Macedonia). And don't get me wrong, I've traveled to all those cities and built some amazing friendships and wonderful memories. But being the sentimental type that I am, it's never quite the same as recording in your home, with sort of 'chosen family.' These musicians here are so much a part of my social life, but so rarely my professional one. So it was a massively cathartic and wonderful experience to finally rectify that."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>The head of Riot Games' anti-cheat team Phillip Koskinas has confirmed why you can't have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/valorant">Valorant</a> running at the same time. Yes, it involves a clash between EA's Javalin anti-cheat and Riot's Vanguard anti-cheat.</p>

<p>In layman's terms, both Valorant and Battlefield 6 need to run in a particular way while they are running on your computer. When it comes to interacting with game memory, they do the same thing. Detecting another program is messing around at the kernel level and touching things they are monitoring, the anti-cheats identify each other as potential problems and thus issues arise.</p>

<p>The conversation around Javalin and Vanguard causing problems together stems from several posts during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-almost-250000-people-waiting-in-an-open-beta-queue">last weekend's Battlefield 6 open beta</a>, in which some users were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlwcbl/battlefield_6_just_told_me_to_uninstall_valorant/">reporting error messages</a> stopping them from playing the absurdly popular shooter while Valorant was running. So while you don't need to uninstall Valorant to play Battlefield 6 this weekend for its second open beta, you should probably make sure the game is totally closed before you do so.</p>
<p>Still it's easy to see why deep-access kernel level anti-cheats are used in games like Battlefield 6. According to EA, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-system-has-already-prevented-330000-attempts-to-cheat-or-tamper-with-anti-cheat-controls">Javelin caught over 330,000 attempted cheaters over its first weekend</a>. All this during what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">EA has dubbed Battlefield's biggest open beta ever</a>.</p>
<p>So for now it seems like an easy fix for those looking to get some Battlefield 6 games in. It does seem unlikely the way either Javelin or Vanguard work will be changing, due to the low number of players looking to run two shooters simultaneously. Still, as kernel-level anti-cheats become the norm these conflicts between opposing systems is something to keep an eye on.</p></div>

            <p>Remedy is "unsatisfied" with the sales of its live-service shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, as the game underperformed on Steam.</p>
<p>As part of the company's half year financial <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">report</a>, CEO Tero Virtala stated Remedy's revenue increased by 63.5 percent, with game sales increasing due to the release of FBC: Firebreak.</p>
<p>The launch succeeded technically and had over a million players in its first 10 days. However, the majority of players were on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, where the game was available day one on subscription services. On Steam - intended as the primary sales channel on PC - the launch "underperformed".</p>

<p>"The game's initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews," admitted Virtala. "As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive."</p>
<p>Virtala continued: "Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of FBC: Firebreak. Thus far, FBC: Firebreak's commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognised throughout the contract period."</p>
<p>The performance of FBC: Firebreak is important to Remedy as its first self-published game, a spin-off of its popular single-player game Control.</p>
<p>Shortly after the game's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-hears-your-criticism-loudly-and-clearly-and-is-fixing-things-starting-now">Remedy stated it heard fan feedback "loud and clearly"</a> and was committed to improving the game. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-team-acknowledges-onboarding-frustrations-assuring-things-will-change">Remedy acknowledged onboarding frustrations </a>and noted patches released for a better experience.</p>
<p>"FBC: Firebreak was designed as a game that evolves over time," said Virtala in the report. "Despite the rocky launch, we believe we have a solid game to build on. Players who spent over an hour with the game reviewed the game mostly positive - showing us that the core experience of the game is entertaining."</p>
<p>A major update is planned for September, which Remedy expects will drive further interest in the game. "We are committed to continuing to work on FBC: Firebreak, engaging with the community, and expanding the game," said Virtala.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the report, Remedy confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> development is "on track towards meeting its next milestones", focusing now on gameplay, environments, and missions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 &amp; 2 remake project is also in full production.</p>
<p>Lifetime sales of Control have now surpassed 5m copies. Earlier this year, the publishing, distribution and marketing rights for the game transferred to Remedy, resulting in positive sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, meanwhile, has "continued to sell steadily and accrue royalties", though no sales figure has been provided. The horror game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-fastest-selling-remedy-game-but-yet-to-turn-a-profit">Remedy's fastest-selling game</a>, but only became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-is-finally-profitable-over-a-year-after-release-says-remedy">profitable a year after release once sales passed 2m</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Finnish developer Remedy Games <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> the half-year financial report, admitting that FBC: Firebreak did not perform well. We already knew that, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-has-surpassed-1-million-players-though-remedy-knows-theres-a-lot-of-work-to-do/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">milestone of one million players</a> was highly misleading since the game was available on both Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus to the respective subscribers.</p>



<p>Indeed, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala said that the majority of the players were on those two platforms, whereas the Steam launch 'underperformed' compared to the studio's hopes:</p>



<p><em>The game's initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews. As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive.</em></p>



<p><em>Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of FBC: Firebreak. Thus far, FBC: Firebreak's commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognized throughout the contract period.</em></p>



<p>With that being said, it was not all doom-and-gloom from the Remedy executive, who noted that FBC: Firebreak was always meant to be a live, evolving game. The studio now thinks it has a solid foundation to expand on, with the next major update scheduled to go live in late September.</p>



<p>On the bright side, Control's lifetime sales have now surpassed five million units. Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-ip-acquired-by-remedy-for-e17-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regained full control of its publishing, distribution, and marketing rights in February 2024</a>, so the sales now go only to the Finnish developer. Alan Wake 2 continues to sell 'steadily' and accrue royalties, according to Virtala, who then switched to an update on the studio's upcoming projects.</p>



<p>Control 2 (which is being made <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a smaller budget than Alan Wake 2</a>) is on track to meet its next milestones, which will be focused on gameplay, environments, and missions. The studio wants the game to have a strong commercial offering when it launches. The Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake also made steady progress; during the last quarter, Remedy built on the momentum established earlier in 2025 while collaborating closely with IP owner Rockstar Games. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sarah-bond-brings-xbox-expertise-to-tyson-foods-by-joining-board-of-directors.1267695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sarah Bond, the President of Xbox since 2023, has revealed a new appointment on the Board of Directors at Tyson Foods. The curveball placement was uncovered in a press release from Tyson Foods, a company with Arkansas origins dating back to 1931. Under the Tyson banner sit the likes of Bosco’s, State Fair, Jimmy Dean, and Reuben.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean that Sarah Bond is relocating from under a tech titan to work at a food-focused conglomerate. She has joined the board as an independent director, which is a similar position she already holds at other corporations and companies.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dynamic-and-passionate">Dynamic and Passionate</h2>



<p><br>In <a href="https://www.tysonfoods.com/news/news-releases/2025/8/tyson-foods-names-microsoft-executive-board-directors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> celebrating the appointment of Sarah Bond to the Board of Directors at Tyson Foods, the firm wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Sarah is dynamic and passionate, with proven management strength, and her energy and personality are a wonderful fit for our culture. As our management team, members of the board and the Tyson family got to know Sarah, we immediately felt that she would be a tremendous addition to Tyson Foods.</p>



<p>We are confident that her unique expertise will help us continue to grow and serve our customers, our team members, and our shareholders.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a short response, Bond said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Tyson Foods is a world-class food company with iconic brands, and I am delighted to join the board and support the company as it continues to execute its long-term growth strategy with customers and consumers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Taking a glance at Bond’s LinkedIn profile, you can see that she’s also on the board of the USC School of Cinematic Arts and the Entertainment Software Association. In a report from <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/08/xbox-president-delighted-to-join-board-of-directors-at-tyson-foods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PureXbox</a>, it was also noted that Bond is on the board of Zuora, a subscription management platform.</p>



<p>When I looked up Tyson Foods, I found that the company provides extensive volumes of meat and ingredients to fast food chains like KFC, Taco Bell, McDonald’s, and Burger King, and that the titan boasts more than 120 food processing plants. That’s one hell of a global reach.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>MrBeast has officially joined Kick.com to further promote his TeamWater campaign, just weeks after receiving a one-of-a-kind trophy from YouTube for landing 400 million subscribers. The TeamWater campaign has just ticked over $15 million raised after a trio comprised of MrBeast, Adin Ross, and xQc fronted the mission.</p>



<p>The goal is to raise $40 million by the end of the month to support the provision of clean water to countries around the world. It’s a classic MrBeast move, and it has attracted the support of more than 3,000 influencers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-welcome-to-kick-mrbeast">Welcome to Kick, MrBeast</h2>



<p>MrBeast’s arrival on Kick was celebrated by the platform in <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/1955021765878616107" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a social media post</a> akin to the ones published to welcome <strong>partnered creators</strong>. In the hours that followed, MrBeast racked up thousands of followers on the third most-popular streaming platform in the business, further extending his reach and leaning on Adin Ross and xQc’s audiences.</p>



<p>It has been reported that ‘the deal’ to secure MrBeast’s affiliation included a $5 million donation towards the TeamWater campaign.</p>



<p>If there’s one negative sentiment to take away from this reveal, it’s that MrBeast has aligned himself with some less-than-favored creators who have worked hard drumming up awful auras for themselves in recent years.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If successful, the TeamWater campaign will provide clean water to a range of countries around the world, including those located in Africa and South America. After just a few days, almost 50% of the target has been hit, and efforts are expected to accelerate in the coming weeks as the deadline approaches.</p>



<p>MrBeast’s team is also supporting TeamWater by sending 100% of all merchandise purchases to the total money raised.</p>



<p>Are you <a href="https://teamwater.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">going to donate</a> to TeamWater’s campaign? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent hours, eagle-eyed Call of Duty fans have been finding and sharing teasers promoting ‘The Guild’, a fictional tech titan operating (assumedly) at the heart of Black Ops 7. The global reveal of Black Ops 7 is set to take place next week at the Opening Night Live ceremony at Gamescom.</p>



<p>The teasers, which include a trailer, a new Activision-backed website, and billboards in San Francisco, have fans theorizing about Black Ops 7.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-won-t-fear-tomorrow">‘We Won’t Fear Tomorrow’</h2>



<p>In social circles, a new website built by Activision is being shared. It promotes a fictional company called The Guild, an organization charged with shaping the future and using technology as the mold:</p>



<blockquote>

<p>Fans were quick to comment on the video and the teaser, suggesting it’s not at all what they were hoping for from Black Ops 7. One wrote that it’s ‘Black Ops Advanced Warfare with SBMM and futuristic garbage’, while another said, ‘Why even try with this BS?’</p>



<p>Plenty of netizens were keen to point out that Battlefield 6 is dominating this year. It’s accurate, given that the Battlefield 6 beta decimated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/">Call of Duty’s player records</a> on Steam and hit almost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beaten-almost-every-cod-game-twitch/">one million concurrent viewers</a> on Twitch. This could be the first year that Battlefield ‘beats’ Call of Duty, even if EA’s developers don’t feel they need to.</p>



<p>What do you think about the imminent reveal of Black Ops 7? Are you hopeful that it’ll be a banger year for Call of Duty? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-issues-legal-notice-to-banned-%E2%80%98predator-hunter%E2%80%99-in-freeschlep-drama.1267665/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Roblox Corporation has banned a prolific ‘predator hunter’ from the platform and issued to them a cease and desist order penned by the company’s lawyers, it has been revealed. In recent days, ‘Schlep’, a YouTuber with over 640,000 followers, has revealed a battle with Roblox that stems from his predator-hunting activities on the platform.</p>



<p>Schlep claims he has directly influenced the arrest of six predators using the Roblox ecosystem for nefarious activities, and historically, he has joined forces with other creators to trap and catch wrongdoers.</p>



<p>He’s now being pursued by the Roblox Corporation, which is eager to clamp down on his work, but the ‘FreeSchlep’ campaign is fighting back.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-sleep-well-at-night">‘I Sleep Well at Night’</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Schlep expressed his sentiments towards the ban issued to him by Roblox, before following up with a copy of the cease and desist order sent by the company:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No matter how it gets painted, me and my team got 6 predators arrested within the Roblox community in under a year. </p>



<p><strong>I sleep well at night</strong> knowing these people will not be able to abuse anymore children on Roblox. My work will always have amounted to something.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The cease and desist order from Roblox accused Schlep of:</p>



<ul>
<li>Engaging in simulated child endangerment conversations</li>



<li>Sharing or soliciting personally identifiable information (PII)</li>



<li>Directing users to move conversations off-platform</li>
</ul>



<p>The claim is that Schlep and ‘his team’ are directly undermining Roblox’s safety efforts and exposing users to <strong>more risks</strong>. </p>



<div><article><p><span>Full legal cease and desist notice from Roblox to me.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Schlep uploaded a video talking about the FreeSchlep situation that garnered more than 1.3 million views in less than 48 hours:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Roblox Is Threatening to Sue Me For Protecting Kids" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMqAw_NjHK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The ban and legal action have prompted a social media campaign fronted by the hashtag #FreeSchlep. The creator and predator hunter has been supported by other YouTubers like JiDion, who created a 15-minute video explaining the situation and revealed that he too is being pursued by Roblox.</p>



<p>Roblox has had a clear and well-documented issue with predators and child safety for years. It’s a critical concern that has been addressed publicly by many activists and protestors fighting against the inherently unsafe platform. It’s not easy to keep children safe on Roblox, despite the lengths the company has gone to in a bid to protect them.</p>



<p>Recently, in a bizarre twist, it was suggested that Roblox might soon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-dating-someday-for-those-afraid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">host a <strong>dating platform</strong></a> that users can lean on to find love in Roblox rather than meeting people in real life.</p>



<p>Do you think Roblox has a huge issue with predators, and this kind of legal action isn’t a good look for the corporation? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It has rubberized grips with a leather-like texture, which makes the controller feel slightly different than other Xbox Wireless Controllers with textured grips. On each side of the Xbox Guide button, you'll find two 3D "spikes" to mimic Doomguy's helmet. Since Doomguy is always slaying demons, the controller has streaks of blood and "chips" in the paint.</p><p>The Doom Slayer armor theme extends to the controls as well. The left stick is gray, while the right is red to align with Doomguy's chest port. Instead of ABXY labels, each face button is marked by a letter from the Sentinel alphabet. The triggers and bumpers are green on the left and silver on the right.</p><p>Inside the box, you'll find a voucher to redeem the Doom Slayer Executioner Skin in The Dark Ages. When you get the controller, remove the battery cover for a neat Easter Egg.</p><p>Like all Xbox Wireless Controllers from Microsoft, the Doom-themed model works wirelessly on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Mac, Steam Deck, and mobile.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548522-doomthedarkagescontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4548522" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548522-doomthedarkagescontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4548522"></a><figcaption>Doom: The Dark Ages Xbox Wireless Controller (Limited Edition)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548522-doomthedarkagescontroller.png"></figure><p>Along with Doom: The Dark Ages, fans can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DOOM-Anthology-Steam-PC-Other-System/dp/B0DCHS3FJB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">save on Doom Anthology</a>, which compiles six Doom games in one package with a steelbook case and a miniature BFG for display.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-nintendo-switch-games-hit-all-time-low-prices-at-walmart/1100-6533821/">Mario Nintendo Switch Games Hit All-Time Low Prices At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-dark-ages-limited-edition-xbox-wireless-controller-gets-massive-discount/1100-6533850/">Doom Limited Edition Xbox Controller Gets Massive Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-0-directors-cut-for-switch-2-is-discounted-for-the-first-time/1100-6531083/">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut For Switch 2 Is Discounted For The First Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crkd-gibson-les-paul-wireless-guitar-controllers-consoles-and-pc-buying-guide/1100-6529788/">CRKD's Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controllers Are Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rebuild-of-evangelion-blu-ray-editions-neon-genesis-evangelion-complete-series/1100-6533665/">Two Rebuild Of Evangelion Movies Are Finally Returning To Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-star-wars-3-in-1-clone-wars-mandalorian-adventure-gift-set-walmart-2025/1100-6533571/">New Lego Star Wars Gift Bundle In Stock At Walmart - 3 Sets For $45</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-minecraft-5-in-1-world-explorer-walmart-gift-set-2025/1100-6533572/">Lego Minecraft 5-In-1 Gift Set Up For Grabs For $45 Exclusively At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-deals-limited-edition-restock-guide/1100-6526172/">Rune Factory: Guardians Of Azuma For Switch 2 Gets First Discount</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>"Get ready for a whole new ball game"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last weekend, Nintendo held a special 'Global Jam' for the Switch 2 exclusive, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>.</p>
<p>This game is described as "the next generation" of 3-on-3 sports, where you use the mouse controls to speed around the court, and flick your wrists to perform tricks and shoot some hoops. To top it off, you can join in on the fun with up to 12 players online.</p>
<p>So, now that the Global Jam has ended, and we've even had the chance to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/psa-shoot-some-hoops-with-drag-x-drives-dev-team-this-weekend">take on the game's developers</a> during the same event, we're wondering about your first impressions and if you're planning to add it to your game library on release.</p>
<p>Leave a comment and vote in our poll. You can also see the skills of the developers in the video above.</p>

<p>Drag x Drive will launch on the eShop for the Switch 2 on <strong>14th August, 2025</strong> and is priced at <strong>$19.99 / £16.99</strong>.</p>

<p>If you can’t decide which one of the 32 NFL teams to use in your first Madden 26 Franchise mode save, this list should help narrow down your top choices. </p>



<p>EA gave overhauled Franchise mode in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-madden-26-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>. The first step in creating a coach is selecting your archetype, and the choices are offensive guru, defensive genius, or developmental wizard. Your preference will dictate the abilities you start with, which is a new feature for this title. </p>



<p>From there, it’s up to you to build a staff of coordinators, develop weekly strategies, playsheets, and mold your roster as you see fit. On-field performances and how well you manage relationships with the GM, coaching staff, players, fans, and media contribute to your approval rating. At the end of every season, coaches are judged by their approval rating, so it’s essential to pay attention to every detail. For those who are up for a challenge, here are the best teams to rebuild. </p>

<h3 id="h-cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</h3>



<p>The Cleveland Browns roster is full of intriguing question marks. Starting quarterback Deshaun Watson is expected to miss most, if not all, of the upcoming season because he re-ruptured his Achilles tendon. There are also doubts about his future, even when he returns. </p>



<p>Cleveland’s front office is fully aware of that and responded in the draft by selecting Oregon quarterback Dillion Gabriel in the third round, and Colorado quarterback in the fifth round. Both players are intriguing prospects, and there is a possibility that one of them will finally end the agonizing drought of not having a franchise QB. </p>



<p>There is one sure thing about the Browns, and that’s Myles Garrett. The superstar edge rusher signed a four-year $160 million extension in the offseason, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Standout outside linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah also signed a three-year contract in the offseason, and Denzel Ward is one of the best cornerbacks in the league, so the building blocks are there for a successful rebuild. </p>



<h3 id="h-carolina-panthers">Carolina Panthers </h3>



<p>It’s been seven years since the Carolina Panthers last made the playoffs, but things are looking up in Charlotte. At one point, it looked like Bryce Young would never live up to being the first overall pick in the 2023 draft after being benched. However, Young retook the starting spot and showed glimpses of becoming a formidable QB. </p>



<p>Carolina put faith in its rising star by drafting an exciting wide receiver, Tetairoa McMillan, and also revamped the offensive line last offseason. On the other side of the ball, Derrick Brown is back after missing the entire previous season. He is poised to be once again one of the best defensive linemen in the league, and Jaycee Horn has proven to be a lockdown cornerback when healthy. The Panthers still have several holes to fill, but the potential is there. </p>



<h3 id="h-atlanta-falcons">Atlanta Falcons </h3>



<p>Speaking of seven-year playoff droughts, Carolina’s NFC South rival, Atlanta, also has the same playoff drought. The days of Matt Ryan leading Atlanta on long postseason runs are far in the rear-view mirror, and fans have turned to a new face of the team in Michael Penix Jr. The league was collectively shocked when Atlanta drafted the Washington quarterback eighth overall after giving Kirk Cousins a massive contract in the same offseason, but the gamble paid off. </p>



<p>Cousins had a terrible start to the season, and Atlanta handed the keys to Penix Jr. It’s still very much a development project, but he showed flashes of being the guy. However, even if he doesn’t pan out, the Falcons are loaded elsewhere on the roster. Jessie Bates III is the best safety in football, Chris Lindstrom is a stalwart offensive lineman, Bijan Robinson is a star running back, and Drak London is one of the most electrifying receivers currently playing.  </p>



<h3 id="h-tennessee-titans">Tennessee Titans </h3>



<p>After potentially striking out on Will Levis, Tennessee shifted gears and drafted Miami quarterback Cam Ward first overall in the 2025 draft. EA only gave Ward a 72 overall and a Star development trait, but there is still a strong chance that the Titans have a franchise quarterback on their hands. The rest of the roster is relatively weak, but Jeffery Simmons has game-wrecking capabilities at defensive tackle, and Kevin Zeitler is a reliable guard.  </p>



<p>With that in mind, rebuilding the Titans will be much more challenging than other teams on this list, who have several exciting prospects and established veterans, but that’s what makes the challenge so exciting. From top to bottom, the organization needs a new identity and a new face of the team, and it’s up to you to solve that puzzle. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-york-jets">New York Jets </h3>



<p>While Panthers and Falcons fans have it bad, the Jets haven’t reached the postseason in 14 seasons, which is tied for the longest drought among all professional sports in the United States. It finally looked like the corner had been turned after signing Aaron Rodgers, but that experiment failed, despite having a talented roster on paper. </p>



<p>In the aftermath of Rodgers’s departure for Pittsburgh, the Jets made a low-risk, high-reward gamble by signing former 11th overall pick Justin Fields at quarterback. Meanwhile, star cornerback Sauce Gardner and standout wide receiver Garrett Wilson both signed four-year contract extensions in the offseason. The Jets also have plenty of other talent to fill out the rest of the roster, including the consistently dominant defensive tackle Quinnen Williams. The talent is there, but if history has shown anything, it’s going to take more than that to right the ship in New York.   </p>



<h3 id="h-new-york-giants">New York Giants</h3>



<p>Staying in the same stadium, the Giants also have a daunting rebuild ahead without a sure-fire guy at quarterback. New York gave Daniel Jones six seasons, but he never proved enough. With two first-round picks in the 2025 draft, the Giants added to an already dominant defensive line by selecting star edge rusher Abdul Carter third overall and selecting Ole Miss quarterback Jaxon Dart, with the 25th overall pick. </p>



<p>Offensive lines will have their hands full this season attempting to contain the front seven unit, comprised of the likes of Dexter Lawrence II, Brian Burns, Kayvon Thibodeaux, and the previously mentioned Carter. That’s not all on defense, as Bobby Okerke, Jevon Holland, and Paulson Adebo are also exciting players on that side of the ball. And wide receiver phenom, Malik Nabers, should help make life easier for the rookie QB Jaxon Dart. As long as you play your cards right and make smart draft picks and savvy free agency signings, this rebuild shouldn’t be too challenging. </p>



<h3 id="h-las-vegas-raiders">Las Vegas Raiders </h3>



<p>The AFC West is arguably the most challenging division to find success in because the Kansas City Chiefs have Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid at the helm, Jim Harbaugh and Justin Herbert are leading the charge with the Los Angeles Chargers, and Sean Payton and Bo Nix are building something special in Denver. All three teams have franchise coaches and quarterbacks, leaving Las Vegas in no man’s land. </p>



<p>Maxx Crosby, Brock Bowers, Kolton Miller, and potentially Ashon Jeanty are foundational pieces that can help turn things around, but the roster has a long way to go to stack up against the rest of the daunting division. It’s up to you to find a franchise quarterback and become a coach who can go toe-to-toe with legends of the game. </p>

<p>Before jumping into a game of Madden 26, it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with the best players and the top ratings by position. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-madden-26-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> and previous games, EA determines player ratings by evaluating 43 different attributes for each player, combining them with position-specific weightings, and updating them throughout the season based on real-world performance. There are dedicated employees tasked with analyzing film to make these subjective decisions. </p>



<p>In the 2023/24 season, several players had breakout seasons, while others suffered lackluster campaigns. Based on that data, here are the best offensive and defensive players in Madden 26. </p>

<p>Treasure Tracker also got a Switch 2 upgrade recently</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> has received its weekly update today and this time it adds the soundtrack from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to listen to tracks like the game's title theme, The King of Pyropuff Peak and much more. All up, this album contains a total of <strong>58 tracks</strong> and has a runtime of 1 hour and 46 minutes.</p>
<p>To listen to this soundtrack on the Nintendo Music app, you'll need to have an active Switch Online subscription.</p>

<p>This follows an update to the app last week which added the soundtracks for the Pilotwings series. The app was also recently updated to Version 1.3.0 – adding the ability to use some functions of the app, even without an active Switch Online subscription.</p>
<p>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker was originally released on the Wii U, and was followed up with a 3DS and Switch release. It was also one of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">12 free game upgrades</a> released alongside the Switch 2 recently, optimising the game visuals, and adding HDR and GameShare support.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-bloody-love-the-drifter.1267623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Drifter</em> is a new point-and-click adventure game from Powerhoof that I have been <em>very </em>into these past couple of weeks. It’s a game that owes a debt to many influences, all of which end up being a perfect match for this story, genre and, most importantly of all (for me), setting.</p><p>First and most obviously it owes a <em>lot </em>to the Lucasarts adventure games of the 90s, a subgenre that has inspired countless successors and imitators over the decades, but few--if any--that have felt as close to the source as this. Playing <em>The Drifter</em> is like visiting a parallel timeline where Lucasarts never went 3D after <em>Full Throttle</em>, and instead simply iterated on their existing art style over and over and at some point came up with, somehow, an even smarter interface.</p><p>But this is not a breezy adventure with a slapstick pirate and a load of double entendres, nor is it a game content to simply trace over the lines of a 30-year-old genre. <em>The Drifter's</em> own promos say the game draws heavily from "King, Crichton and Carpenter, with a dash of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozploitation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 70s Ozpolitation</a>", and those are all correct. <em>The Drifter </em>has a <em>mood</em>, nailing its self-proclaimed "pulp adventure thriller brief" absolutely, the whole thing dripping with atmospheric lighting and intrigue, a sci-fi noir vibe brought to life by some incredibly <em>cool </em>pixel art and voice acting. </p><p>It also calls itself a fast-paced adventure game, a sentence that makes no sense until you play it, then it makes perfect sense. While in some ways this is a traditional point-and-click adventure game, it's not the type to keep you stuck on a puzzle for 10 hours; between its snappy interface, in-game hints, action sequences (I can't explain these without spoiling a central story element, but just trust me, they work) and relentless pacing, it really does keep moving at a brisk rate, which doesn't just remove a long-standing roadblock with this genre but also helps keep the story zipping along.</p><p>Were this all I wanted to talk about--me taking time out of your day just to say "this is the best Lucasarts homage I've ever played"--I think <em>The Drifter</em> would be worth talking about! Its story of grief, love, murder and monsters plays like you're clicking rapidly through a pulpy graphic novel, and nailing that Lucasarts energy is hard! Those games were magic, making this magic by association!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Drifter - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CgNrA925M44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But what really got me about <em>The Drifter</em> was how <em>Australian </em>it is. Let me explain:<a href="https://aftermath.site/australian-video-game-list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Australia has enjoyed an indie renaissance over the past decade, a recovery from the dark days of the late 00s/early 2010s when a AAApocalypse closed all of the country's major studios</a>. From <em>Hollow Knight</em> to <em>Crossy Road</em>, <em>Goose Game</em> to <em>Cult of the Lamb</em>, <em>Plucky Squire</em> to <em>Unpacking</em>, many of the best and most important games of the last few years have been developed in Australia.</p><p>And almost none of them have anything to say about living here, or being from here, or just <em>here</em>. That's fine, nobody is obligated to make their game about anything, you can set it whenever and wherever you want. But when you live outside the US, Japan or Europe as a player, you're almost always playing games about other people's homes and other people's stories, and sometimes, just sometimes, I wish there were more video games set a little closer to home.</p><p>Of course the problem here is that even when a game <em>is </em>set here, depictions of Australia in popular culture tend to skew towards a spectrum of caricatures:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max_(2015_video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Mad Max</em></a> on one end, <em>Crocodile Dundee</em> on the other. Which is fine, but also sometimes I just want to play video games where the characters are Australian and they use Australian slang and the game is set here, but that setting doesn’t really doesn't <em>matter</em>, in a way that I would find nice but you (statistically most people reading this are not Australian) could play it and not mind either, the same way I (an Australian) find <em>Yakuza </em>or <em>KRZ </em>interesting.</p><p>(<a href="https://youtu.be/Xt2Rj1FeZgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wayward Strand </em>is a good example of what I’m talking about!<em>)</em></a></p><p><em>The Drifter</em> is very much set here, and has some of the most Australian voice acting I've ever heard in a game, but it's also extremely relaxed about it. Like yeah, this is an Australian video game, but it's not interested in cringe or tropes, desert vistas or kangaroos, it just wants to tell a very cool story that just happens to be set here. This is exactly what I've been after in an Australian game for a while now, so I'm very thankful to have got the chance to play through it here.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions"><h3>Recommending Books Is The Best Part Of Tiny Bookshop</h3></a><p>Forget The Lorax, kid; it's time for classic architecture</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/digital-foundry-ign-ziff-davis-eurogamer-patreon"><h3>Good For Digital Foundry</h3></a><p>'We answer to nobody but you, the audience'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia]]></content:encoded>

The announcement was accompanied by a teaser trailer that may give fans of The Witcher some Deja vu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHH6xQT2-dw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PHH6xQT2-dw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There's no English language audio option for this video, but the closed captioning does offer an English translation of the spoken lines. The woman's name is Myoan, and she's a shaman who performs a violent sacrificial rite with a snake. Woochi is the man who confronts Myoan at her dark shrine before she transforms into a monster before his eyes. Woochi isn't defenseless and the manifestation of his sword is impressive. However, Myoan overpowers Woochi before declaring, "Proclaim it to Heaven, we rise again."</p><p>The game is set durning Korea's Joseon era, and Jeon Woochi is said to be a man "who uses his powers to fight injustice and trick the corrupt." This is a single-player game built with Unreal Engine 5 by developer LoreVault Studio. The announcement notes the dev team is currently consulting experts on Korean literature and traditional music, while also scouting locations that will be used to recreate the period setting of the game. The game's music will be composed by Jung Jae-il, whose previous credits include Squid Game and Parasite.</p><p>Nexon Games hasn't set a release date yet for Woochi the Wayfarer, but it will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>
