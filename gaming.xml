			<p>Earlier this month, The Molasses Flood (The Flame in the Flood, Drake Hollow, and the work-in-progress Project Sirius) was officially dissolved following its merger into CD Projekt RED. The Boston-based game development studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-acquires-drake-hollow-developer-the-molasses-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was acquired</a> on October 22, 2021, but the merger did not happen until April 1, 2025.</p>
<p>The Molasses Flood co-founder Daniel Isla, who has now departed from the studio for a new adventure, talked about this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7315404560620044288/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a LinkedIn post</a>, where he also teased Project Sirius, which he described as an 'amazing' The Witcher multiplayer game.</p>
<p><em>To be ultra clear: this is a GOOD AND HEALTHY thing for the studio, and it was long-expected. It breaks down some organizational barriers, and better integrates the TMF team with the rest of the amazing CDPR org. Overall, it shows a very bright future for Project Sirius (aka "the multiplayer Witcher game," of which I was the Design Director for three years). It's going to be an amazing game, one for the books, and I cannot wait until the rest of the world learns about what we've been working on.</em></p>
<p><em>On the sadder side -- not to bury the lede -- I've decided not to follow TMF on this transition. So last Monday -- the last day of TMF's legal existence! -- was also my last day at the studio.</em></p>
<p>We don't know a lot about this game, although a few job ads from a couple of years ago <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-stylized-action-pve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that it would feature stylized visuals, action combat, PvE content, and cooperative elements. Project Sirius was, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-molasses-flood-rebooted-new-framework-cd-project-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebooted</a> in March 2023, when CD Projekt RED said it would formulate a new 'framework' for the project. A couple of months later, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-finalizes-its-new-framework-some-work-seemingly-salvaged/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that something might have been salvaged out of the previous work, so everything that Isla and his team have worked on could eventually come to fruition, although we have no idea when.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller isn’t the only new Nintendo gamepad getting two back buttons: the Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip has the additional buttons as well, according to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-charging-grip-123690%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo’s online listing for the controller</a>.</p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details">Pro Controller</a>, the new back buttons are GL and GR that can be remapped to other buttons, the listing says. However, the Switch 2’s Charging Grip, at $34.99, is cheaper than the Pro Controller, which costs $79.99, so the grip is a more affordable way to try out those new buttons.</p><p>However, as with the original Switch’s charging grip, this new grip only charges your Joy-Con while it’s plugged in. “Attach the Joy-Con 2 controllers to the Joy-Con 2 charging grip to use as a classic-style controller – or a handy charging station with the included USB-C charging cable,” the listing says.</p><p>I wish the new charging grip had an included battery. But the ability to charge the Joy-Con while playing and use the new back buttons does make it a step up from the basic Joy-Con 2 grip included with the Switch 2. (Though the back buttons do look quite small.)</p><p>The Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip is scheduled to launch on June 5th alongside the Nintendo Switch 2. Nintendo has delayed preorders for the console in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">US</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645240/nintendo-switch-2-canada-preorders-delayed-trump-tariffs">Canada</a> and hasn’t yet said when they’ll go live in those countries. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Thank you for your attention to this matter!</p></blockquote><p>It’s hard to take anything the White House says about its ongoing trade ware seriously at this point, but in the short term this means that places like Vietnam and Cambodia, where Nintendo moved much of its Switch 2 manufacturing in recent years, will only be subject to an additional 10 percent tariff as opposed to the rates of as much as 46 percent that had previously been announced. But any electronics coming out of China would presumably double in price as Trump ratchets up his tariff bluster. </p><p>The 90-day  pause on other tariffs takes us past the June 5 launch of the Switch, and presumably gives Nintendo and other manufacturers a brief reprieve during which more inventory can be shipped into the U.S. Some analysts feel that a certain level of tariff taxation was already baked into the $450 price, suggesting it might not increase if the pause continues. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036">Nintendo said that wasn’t the case</a></span>, however.

And in the days since that event we’ve learned more about the Switch 2 via statements from Nintendo, interviews, and more. For example, did you know that Nintendo confirmed Friend Codes are back, or that the Switch 2 carts will taste disgusting? </p><p>Keeping track of all this new information is tricky. A lot of it has been revealed in various places and across many days and it’s all a bit of a mess. To help, we’ve gone looking for smaller details about the Switch 2 that you might care about, but not be aware of yet. Then we took all those details and collected them into one easy-to-find place. We’re just really nice like that. </p><p>So here are nine things about the Switch 2 that you might not know about. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-recommend-id="image://7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-recommend-id="image://7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of Nintendo’s big shifts for the new hardware is the addition of GameChat, a tool for voice chat and sharing video with people on your friends list. But how do they get added to that list to begin with? Still friend codes, it turns out; Nintendo’s annoying method of finding other players that requires entering bespoke strings of numbers into a text field instead of browsing by username. </p><p>Fortunately, there’s now a new, easier way to link up with people that bypasses the tedium of entering friend codes: QR codes. Players can now share them via the smartphone app to easily sync up with one another. Not great, but still much better than the current system. —Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><p>Sadly, the Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 won’t have a musical theme like it did on the Wii. According to Nintendo, it’s not because they hate joy, but instead because the eShop has trailers and videos now and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553440/nintendo-eshop-no-music-switch-2-why&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553440/nintendo-eshop-no-music-switch-2-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the company didn’t want to “intrude” on that content</a></span>.

It was also a pain to transfer it between consoles when upgrading, requiring you to deal with an entirely separate smartphone app. Not so with Switch 2. System transfers have been streamlined for the new hardware, including when going from Switch 1 to Switch 2.</p><p>“When you do the system transfer, everything like save data will remain on the Nintendo Switch and once it moves to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well,” hardware director Takuhiro Dohta <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553410/acnh-animal-crossing-new-horizons-island-transfer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553410/acnh-animal-crossing-new-horizons-island-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Polygon</em></a></span>. The transfer will include players’ islands. “But the [<em>Animal Crossing</em>] island will be an actual move. So it will leave Nintendo Switch and move over to Nintendo Switch 2,” he added. Millions of players with hundreds of hours cultivating their <em>Animal Crossing</em> retreat can breathe a collective sigh of relief. - EG</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-recommend-id="image://2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-recommend-id="image://2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once again, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo has decided to not include system-wide achievements in a new console</a></span>.

<p>Whether you are on PlayStation 5, PC, or Xbox Series X, here is everything you need to know about the cost of Blue Prince and whether the game is free.  </p>



<p>Game prices are a hotly contested topic at the moment. Nintendo fans were shocked when it was revealed that Switch 2 games cost $80 instead of $60, as seen on the first Switch console. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo defended the decision</a> by arguing that it was due to the game’s value to players. </p>



<p>Additionally, physical Switch 2 games cost more than digital and will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost up to $98</a> when converted from Euros. This is, of course, in addition to the console itself, which is expected to cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$450</a> or more. Playing video games has always been a rather expensive hobby, but not all titles are increasing in price, as is the case with Blue Prince. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-blue-prince-cost">How Much Does Blue Prince Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Blue Prince is full of several mysteries to solve. Image via Dogubomb</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/BluePrince" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dogubomb community manager</a>, <strong>Blue Prince costs $29.99 / €29.99 / £24.99 on PlayStation 5, Steam, and Xbox.</strong> </p>



<p>Players can purchase the game digitally on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/blue-prince/9PFRTPRQ569Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft Store</a>. Blue Prince will not be available physically, and there is only one edition, meaning there aren’t any pre-order bonuses or early access. </p>



<p>Blue Prince will not be available on the Epic Games Store or GOG at launch. Dogubomb revealed that the game will be Steam Deck compatible, but that won’t be until a later date. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-blue-prince-free-to-play">Is Blue Prince Free to Play?</h2>



<p><strong>Blue Prince is not free to play</strong>, but it is available as a day-one release on PlayStation Plus Extra and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. </p>



<p>An Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription costs $19.99 a month, and it will set you back $14.99 a month to become a PlayStation Plus Extra member. </p>



<p>Blue Prince isn’t the only game coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-playstation-plus-game-catalog-games-announced-for-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Plus in April</a>. The fresh batch of PlayStation Plus Extra upcoming titles includes the likes of Hogwarts Legacy, EA Sports PGA Tour, and Battlefield 1. </p>



<p>As for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-south-of-midnight-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-clair-obscur-expedition-33-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a>&nbsp;are both day-one releases for the service. And if that wasn’t already enough,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 5</a>&nbsp;is also coming to Game Pass on April 15. </p>

Newzoo's tracking indicates the battle royale genre has shrunk in playtime, going from 19% of playtime in 2021 to 12% in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Citing its Game Performance Monitor which looks at 37 markets (excluding China and India) across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, Newzoo indicated that as a pair, shooter games and battle royale games routinely account for 40% of playtime. So as battle royale playtime has gradually shifted down, shooter playtime has been going up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the 7% shift, the difference within the genre might be the more surprising number. Per Newzoo, Fortnite went from a 43% share of the battle royale genre in 2021 to a 77% share in 2024. Essentially, even as battle royale games trended down, Fortnite ate up more and more of the space within the genre.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Role-playing games have also seen some noticeable growth, up to 13% in 2024 over their 9% share in 2021. Newzoo reported that 18% of RPG time in 2024 was spent in major releases from 2023, spotlighting Baldur's Gate 3, Diablo IV, Honkai: Star Rail, Hogwarts Legacy, and Starfield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Newzoo stated in its report, the fight for attention in playtime and hours is fierce. While games like Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Apex Legends carry on, other games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyper-scape-shut-down-ubisoft-battle-royale">fall by the wayside</a>. Meanwhile, shooters and role-playing games seem to be encroaching on more territory and mindshare. Looking at the success of standouts in those genres, be they Marvel Rivals or Baldur's Gate 3, it's hard to argue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With its constant slate of changes, updates, and growing library of gaming experiences and genres contained within it, it might not be surprising that Fortnite has weathered the storm. Still, time passes, and we'll doubtlessly see trends continue to shift as broad audience interests change as the years roll on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/why-trumps-tariffs-probably-wont-cause-an-immediate-switch-2-price-bump/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          
<p>[<strong>Update: </strong>Shortly after this story was published, Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/09/business/reciprocal-tariff-pause-trump/index.html">announced a 90-day pause</a> on his recently introduced tariffs with most US trading partners. The pause does not apply to China, however, which Trump says will see tariffs increased to 125 percent.]</p>
<p>Last week, Nintendo made the unprecedented move of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-to-assess-trump-tariff-effects/">delaying US Switch 2 preorders</a>&nbsp;to "assess" the impact of Donald Trump's massive tariffs on the countries where the console is produced. That move has left many wondering if the company may be mulling a last-minute increase in the Switch 2's $450 asking price to account for those import taxes.</p>
<p>While industry analysts think that kind of immediate price increase is unlikely, they warn that Trump's tariffs could have longer-term impacts on Switch 2 pricing and supplies in the US for years to come.</p>
<h2>Already baked in</h2>
<p>DFC Intelligence CEO David Cole, for instance, <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/the-evolution-of-console-gaming-insights-on-the-switch-2s-debut/">said in a recent analyst note</a> that the company is currently modeling "a 20 percent price increase over the next two years" across all video game hardware thanks to "broader macroeconomic challenges." In the case of the Switch 2, though, Cole <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/04/08/analysts-predict-potential-eventual-530-switch-2-price-after-tariffs/">clarified</a> that "we believe much of the 20 percent increase was already baked into the $450 price," which Nintendo is "not likely" to raise at this point.</p>
<p>Other game industry analysts similarly don't expect Nintendo to announce a price bump so soon after its initial pricing announcement. "I believe it is now too late for Nintendo to drive up the price further, if that ever was an option in the first place," Kantan Games' Dr. Serkan Toto <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/how-trumps-tariffs-could-affect-the-switch-2-and-the-rest-of-the-games-industry-1">told GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "As far as tariffs go, Nintendo was looking at a black box all the way until April 2, just like everybody else. As a hardware manufacturer, Nintendo most likely ran simulations to get to a price that would make them tariff-proof as much as possible."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5349650/trump-tariffs-nintendo-switch-2-doug-bowser">Speaking to NPR</a>, though, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser said the $450 US price for the console was "made based on previous tariffs, and there was no impact from previous tariffs on [that] pricing." Regarding the tariffs Trump announced last Wednesday—just hours after Nintendo's own pricing announcement—Bowser said that "much like every other company, I think, in the US right now, we're in the process of actively assessing what the impact may be."</p>

			<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-last-of-us-renewed-season-3-hbo-1236364271/">Deadline</a> reports that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-hbo-series-multiple-season-things-to-be-flipped/">HBO's The Last of Us</a> has been renewed for season 3 just a few days ahead of the season 2 premiere this coming Sunday, April 13, 2025. The news doesn't come as a total shock, considering how often showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann have talked about needing at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-show-will-have-a-shorter-season-2-but-season-3-will-be-larger-and-there-may-even-be-season-4/">least three, potentially four seasons</a>, to tell the whole story of The Last of Us Part II.</p>
<p>Realistically, we won't know how plausible a fourth season will be until we reach the end of season 2, and see how far along into the story of The Last of Us Part II this season takes us. But if a fourth season is needed, HBO sounds likely to grant it, with the executive vice president of HBO programming and head of HBO drama series and films, Francesca Orsi, expressing every confidence in Mazin, Druckmann, and the entire creative team behind the series.</p>
<p>"<em>It can't be overemphasized how proud HBO is for the outstanding achievement we believe the second season of The Last of Us is,</em>" Orsi said in a statement. "<em>Craig, Neil, Carolyn [Strauss] and the entire executive producer team, cast and crew have delivered a masterful follow-up and we're thrilled to carry the power of Craig and Neil's storytelling into what we know will be an equally moving and extraordinary third season."</em></p>
<p>In a separate statement, Druckmann expressed his gratitude to fans for their positive reaction and credited Mazin with playing a huge role in the adaptation's success.</p>
<p>"<em>To see The Last of Us brought to life so beautifully and faithfully has been a career highlight for me, and I am grateful for the fans' enthusiastic and overwhelming support. Much of that success is thanks to my partner in crime, Craig Mazin, our partnership with HBO, and our team at PlayStation Productions [...] We're thrilled to bring you more of The Last of Us!</em>"</p>
<p>For his own part, Mazin added that season 2 has "<em>exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew.</em>"</p>
<p>Just because we're getting a third season, though, doesn't mean a fourth will follow. Mazin previously said in an interview that he will <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-showrunner-will-flat-out-not-go-past-the-story-in-the-games/">"<em>flat out</em>"</a> not go beyond the plot of the games, and if that means only needing three seasons, then that's what it means. According to Mazin, only if a fourth season is needed will it happen.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> brought with it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-verdict-monster-hunter-wilds">the usual comments</a> about the hypocrisy of a series that wants to both protect ecosystems and grind them up for parts. "When will Monster Hunter just be honest about its desire to endlessly turn dragons into pants," we lamented to ourselves. "When will the Monster Hunters recognise - nay, <em>embrace</em> the fact that they are the biggest Monsters of all". </p>
<p>We could have saved ourselves a few thousand words and just pointed at Hunters Inc, instead. It's basically a first-person low-budget Monster Hunter game in which the Hunters are Orcs. Orcs do not do self-deception, as a rule. They do not go for sanitised violence or anthropocentric fantasies about becoming "nature's caretakers". They are straightforwardly happy to club things to bits. Looks like ludonarrative consonance is back on the menu, boys!</p><!--more-->

<p>In Hunters Inc, you and up to four of your greenskin friends rampage around procedurally generated biomes mashing up the fauna. Their weapons include spears, hammers and bows, and their prey ranges from giant spiders to smaller giant spiders, giant crocodiles and, er, snails. Not especially giant snails, no, just regular snails that made the mistake of looking smashable. There are four Orc RPG classes to choose from: the Berserker, who's all about DPS, the Tracker, who's all about recon, the Blacksmith, who builds war machines using gatherable resources, and the Shaman, who is armed with protective totems and spells.</p>
<p>The larger creatures are so large they can smash up bits of the environment. You'll need to kite them around and exploit the terrain to get the drop on them, which, yes, I do mean literally. Orcs don't seem to have a problem with fall damage as long as they land spear-first on something with tendons. Once slain, you can carve the beasts up for parts to upgrade your gear and yes, I <em>also</em> mean "carving" literally. There's no performative jabbing with your beltknife while the slaughtered quarry gracefully dematerialises, as in Capcom's game. You can actually chop a giant croc's head off and roll around in the gore like a toddler invading a chocolate fountain.</p>
<p>Creators Wylderzone are also responsible for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2514460/GUARDS/">Guards!</a>, in which you play a bunch of city watchmen hobnail-booting the crims. That game wasn't rapturously received, but perhaps they've struck gold this time. Regardless, I consider this good catharsis after Wilds. The only thing I'm left bewildered by is the "Inc" part. This is an Orc corporation then? Do they have shareholders? Where are they registered for tax purposes?</p>
<p>You can assess the game for yourself by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2937090/Hunters_Inc/">downloading the Steam demo</a>. The full thing is out in July 2025. I feel bad about writing this up because it absolutely should have gone to Nic, author of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-easy-being-green-a-brief-history-of-orcs-in-video-games">the very best piece on video game Orcs</a>, but that's what he gets for [placeholder for whatever he does next that annoys me].</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a recent interview with Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiFLwjFI4S4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zizaran</a>, Path of Exile 2 game directors Mark Roberts and Jonathan Rogers admitted some mistakes were made with Dawn of the Hunt, stating that many of the changes players complained about, especially in regards to the campaign, were unintended and meant to target endgame builds that were making endgame content "trivial."</p><p dir="ltr">"The first thing we thought was 'What the hell, we didn't even nerf the campaign," Rogers said in the interview. "Literally that's what a lot of developers were saying. 'We didn't nerf this, why is everyone saying we nerfed it?' We found a few things but we are still looking for what those things are. It's not always necessarily obvious with all the changes that you make."</p><p dir="ltr">Roberts said the team has adopted a "firing from the hip" approach given the game is in early access, and that if a change doesn't work out and is bad, they can simply undo it. That led to what Roberts said were some "pretty blatant f***-ups" in regards to things like some monsters having more life than intended.</p><p dir="ltr">Rogers went on to explain part of what he believes is one of the developer's main challenges with Path of Exile 2--that due to its slower-paced combat and intentionally higher-difficulty, GGG needs to be much more precise when it comes to getting the game's balance right. This is unlike in the original Path of Exile, where over a decade after its release, knowledgeable players can easily blast through everything in the game from the very start. It's for that reason GGG worries about reducing Path of Exile 2's difficulty too much, as Rogers said he thinks it would result in a game that isn't fun in the long term.</p><p dir="ltr">"If we get balance numbers wrong, if a monster has double life by accident in PoE 1, it doesn't even really matter," Rogers said. "Whereas if a monster has double life in PoE 2, it matters a lot. The threshold for what is right is way tighter in PoE 2 and that means it will just take longer to balance and get it all correct."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-into-path-of-exile-2-early-access/1100-6527842/" data-ref-id="1100-6527842">Path of Exile 2 is available in paid early access now</a> but will eventually be free-to-play. The game's development has thrown a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-is-throwing-a-wrench-into-updates-for-poe-1-we-were-fooling-ourselves/1100-6529154/" data-ref-id="1100-6529154">wrench in development for the original Path of Exile</a>, which GGG is continuing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-wont-replace-the-first-game-after-all/1100-6516398/" data-ref-id="1100-6516398">develop and support alongside its sequel</a>.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> has <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1909999973258719307">confirmed</a> HBO's acclaimed live-action adaptation of The Last of Us is getting a third season, even before the highly anticipated season two has aired.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us' TV debut in 2023 was met with huge critical acclaim and brought in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-finale-breaks-another-viewership-record">record numbers of viewers</a>, so it wasn't much of a surprise when HBO confirmed it had commissioned a second season. And with excitement building ahead of season two's start date this Sunday, 13th April (its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-breaks-hbo-record-before-its-even-aired">already managed to set two records for HBO</a>, even before it's aired), fans will no doubt be thrilled to hear things won't be ending with an abrupt full-stop.
</p>
<p>
Plans for a third The Last of Us season have been discussed previously, of course. In August 2023, showrunner Craig Mazin confirmed the team would need more than one season to cover the events of the second game, noting that "four seems like a good number". That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbo-expects-the-last-of-us-to-run-for-four-seasons">figure was repeated again earlier this year</a>, when HBO executive Francesca Orsi revealed that while a "a complete or final plan" wasn't in place, "it's looking like four seasons" for the adaption.

<p>
Addressing today's The Last of Us season three renewal announcement (thanks <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-renewed-season-3-1236363976/">Variety</a>), Mazin said, "We approached season two with the goal of creating something we could be proud of. The end results have exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew."
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us season two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">spans seven episodes</a> (one "quite big" in length), with episode one airing this Sunday, 13th April, at 9pm ET/PT via HBO and Max in the US. In the UK, season two airs on Sky Atlantic and NOW, with the first episode becoming available on Monday, 14th April - presumably at 2am for those that want to get ahead of spoilers.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us season two sees the return of Pedro Pascal as Joel, Bella Ramsey as Ellie, Gabriel Luna as Tommy, and Rutina Wesley as Maria, with new cast members including Young Mazino, Alanna Ubach, Ben Ahlers, Hettienne Park, Joe Pantoliano, Robert John Burke, Noah Lamanna, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-twos-abby-kaitlyn-dever-wants-to-do-this-character-justice-and-make-the-fans-proud">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a>. Additionally, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-catherine-ohara-will-play-in-the-last-of-us-marking-a-significant-change-from-the-games">legendary Catherine O'Hara joins the cast</a> as a Jackson therapist - one with an intriguing connection to a minor game character whose story is set to be expanded in a similar style to season one's hugely acclaimed Bill and Frank episode.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-ceo-controversial-decision-to-unban-adin-ross-was-about-%E2%80%98second-chance-%E2%80%99-not-%E2%80%98business-considerations%E2%80%99.1159668/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/adin-ross-twitch-unbanned-dan-clancy-explains<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the tail end of March, over two years after being given the boot from Twitch, Adin Ross was suddenly unbanned. This came as a surprise to many viewers – and not a pleasant one.</p><p>Ross’ first tenure on the platform came to an end in early 2023, not long after he began cozying up to the likes of professional misogynist and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/andrew-tate-arrests-explained.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assault/trafficking allegations</a> magnet Andrew Tate. Things did not seem on track to improve, with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/adin-ross-andrew-tate-white-supremacists-1234705845/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> writing a couple months after Ross’ Twitch suspension that he platformed an anonymous neo-Nazi on Kick. As recently as October of 2024, he <a href="https://x.com/BenjaminGoggin/status/1841823020576293197/video/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platformed white nationalist Nick Fuentes</a>, who proceeded to engage in Holocaust denial during the broadcast, as he is wont to do. Ross was also accused of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-i-failed-adin-ross-apologizes-accused-hitler-salute-viral-clip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nazi saluting some fans earlier this year</a>, which is the same year he <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-this-fault-adin-ross-takes-accountability-x-community-saying-evilest-things" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swore he’d turn over a new leaf</a>, at least in regard to chat moderation.&nbsp;</p><p>"I feel defeated tryna even repair things or explain stuff because there’s no explaining,” Ross <a href="https://x.com/AR15thed3mon/status/1899217716130599138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a> after the Nazi salute clip, originally from earlier this year, went viral in March. “I’m pictured the way I’m pictured and it sucks, sorry to everyone I have failed."&nbsp;</p><p>It is not difficult to imagine why Twitch employees, like Twitch viewers, were upset that Ross has been permitted to return to his old, significantly more visible stomping grounds. After all, his recent actions do not exactly scream “reformed.” During a Twitch all-hands meeting that took place last week, of which Aftermath has viewed video, one employee voiced their incredulity to Twitch CEO Dan Clancy.</p><p>"What evidence did you evaluate that Adin Ross had reformed enough since his ban to justify him being unbanned?” the employee asked. “To be transparent, this is one of the decisions we've made that I've disagreed with the most. I strongly believe that this opens the wider community to harm and sends a signal that we will allow the sort of vitriol Adin has been known to perpetuate."&nbsp;</p><p>Clancy largely replied in platitudes and rules-speak, which we’ll get to in a second. But the last part of his response is the most interesting, so let’s start there:</p><p>“I can say this emphatically to everyone: This is [in] no way, shape, or form based upon any business considerations whatsoever,” Clancy said during the meeting. “This isn't even remotely related to a business. It's about deciding about when you can give someone a second chance – and then giving them a chance, but if they don't live up to our expectations, we can take action. So in terms of this opening the wider community to harm, I think that if he doesn't live up to our community guidelines, then he won't still be on Twitch."</p><p>This line of thought is worth scrutinizing, because it’s unlikely that having Adin Ross and his army of disaffected boys back in town is <em>bad </em>for business. Indeed, it could even prove beneficial for Twitch in the long run if the company – and Ross – play their cards right. For one, Ross is undoubtedly a needle mover; his <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Kick stream with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump</a>, a masterclass in the art of shameless suck-uppery, peaked at over 580,000 concurrent viewers. For two, the far-right grift is in right now all across the internet, even on Twitch, where Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt’s daily missives decrying DEI and Democrats have installed him as the new politics king over deposed leftist himbo sensation Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker. Hate is against Twitch’s community guidelines – unless you <a href="https://aftermath.site/nickmercs-twitch-ban-transphobia-slur" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">know how to word it correctly</a>.</p><p>Lastly and perhaps most importantly, Ross has crossover appeal; one of the biggest creators <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-kai-cenat-trying-get-adin-ross-unbanned-twitch-one-last-time-amid-rumors-leaving-kick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advocating for his return</a> from exile was Kai Cenat, livestreaming’s biggest star of the past few years and a bonafide <em>real </em>celebrity at this point (though I guess now the two are <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/adin-ross-shades-twitch-streamers-who-abandoned-him-during-two-year-ban-3174580/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maybe beefing</a> over the notion that Cenat didn’t try hard enough to help him get unbanned? I don’t know, man; it’s beside the point). Ross is also buds with manosphere-adjacent luminaries like Jake Paul and UFC president Dana White. Basically, he’s a terrible, irritating link in a lot of lucrative chains.</p><p>If you were Clancy, the head of a company that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/twitch-amazon-video-games-investment-9020db87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everybody knows isn’t profitable</a> – and that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/10/12/amazon-twitch-streamer-70-30-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains in thrall</a> to Jeff Bezos, one of history’s most bottom-line-obsessed overlords – and you were not being disingenuous about your purpose, which is always to make decisions motivated first and foremost by business considerations, you could do quite a bit worse than this.&nbsp;</p><p>The remainder of Clancy’s explanation reiterated his philosophy on the idea of indefinite bans, which he’s outlined elsewhere and which he does seem to really believe in, at least insofar as it allows him to be <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nominally friendly with everyone regardless of ideological bent</a>.</p><p>“Adin's been banned for over two years,” Clancy said. “He was banned for having a certain number of strikes on his account rather than a singular offense that [led to] indefinite suspension. It's important to note these suspensions are indefinite, not permanent. They've always been thought of as indefinite. Many organizations use indefinite suspensions. In basketball, Draymond Green was indefinitely suspended from the NBA and then let back on.”</p><p>On Clancy’s watch, Twitch has been allowing indefinite suspensions – and the black marks on streamers’ records left behind by prior suspensions – to expire. Outside of a few select <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3llkq2h2wv224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“high severity harms”</a> like violent content and youth safety, indefinitely suspended streamers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3llkps6psis24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can apply to have their accounts reinstated</a> after six months. Clancy said that Ross passed the test.</p><p>“We have a team that looks into this, and it is always a challenging line. We do believe that it's important for people to be able to change the way they have behaved in the past. I think that's a critical component, and we try to assess the likelihood that you will behave consistent with our guidelines,” he said. “In this case, Adin has made a number of public statements about trying to change where he's been. We've gotten feedback from various people about him trying to change. As always with this, we will see how it works out.”</p><p>Clancy added that Ross will find himself under extra scrutiny for the time being and that he’s looking at fewer potential strikes before he’s out again.</p><p>“In general, for those who are unaware, when people come back from suspensions such as this, we also hold them to a fairly high standard,” Clancy said. “It's not like they start off from ground zero. The severity of any enforcement actions or otherwise might be more severe given where we're at.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review"><h3>No Other Game Is Shaped Like Blue Prince</h3></a><p>Defying definition and wholly itself, Blue Prince is one of the most unique games I've ever played.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/manga-no-name-ending-edgerunners"><h3>The Truth Behind The Sudden Conclusion Of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners Showrunner’s Short-Lived Manga Series</h3></a><p>Edgerunners showrunner Rafał Jaki mythbusts the ins-and-outs of creating his historic manga series, No\Name</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/into-dead-our-darkest-days-preview-side-scrolling-zombie-survival<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Whether you want to slay zombies or rescue survivors, you'll find opportunities for both in&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>by PikPok. A spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead</em>, a mobile action game, it's the first franchise entry to use sidescrolling mechanics. As a fan of survival games, I was interested in how this would differ from other recent genre titles. Just from the images, I was digging the retro late 70's-early 80's vibe the art really brings forth. Regardless of not having played either of the previous franchise games, I decided to try out&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>Preview - <em>Stranger Things</em> Meets <em>Late Night With the Devil&nbsp;</em>Vibes</h2>

<p>Right off the bat, the art direction for the title is on the nose for a late 1970's city. From the color palette used in text, to the style of clothing survivors wear, to the decor of different locations, everything oozes that end of the decade feeling. Every home has a corded telephone, TV's come with bunny ear antennas, the arcades are filled with retro machines, and the cars are long and boxy.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-vibes.jpg?itok=S0u0Drnf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-vibes.jpg?itok=ifH5nUs8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You get to pick two survivors to start with, each with their pros and cons. I personally love Penny and Daphne. Penny is an amazingly stealthy survivor. When armed with a blade, she can quickly take out a zombie without alerting others to her presence. Daphne is a multitasker built for shelter management. Able to get increased output from cooking and making medical items, her lessened damage crowns her as a shelter mother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scavenging is where all the action in the game takes place. You can send a max of three survivors out per phase, or day and night. Locations can be explored in a number of ways. You can go through the front door, climb a pipe to the roof, or jump to an overhang and climb through a window. Zombies can be stealthily killed from behind, but if you're seen, they can let out a horrible wail that alerts all nearby enemies to your presence. This can be negated by whapping the zombie before it unleashes its screeching howl.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The further towards escape you get the more zombies you'll encounter in a location. You'll have had the ability to upgrade your shelter units, though, allowing you to possibly arm yourself with guns or more durable weapons. Stealth is still important here, as you can quickly get swarmed with upwards of five zombies at a time. Taking hits from them can quickly render your survivor dead. The resources they gathered are left with the body, and all your survivors in the shelter get hit with a Grief state.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-recruit-barb.jpg?itok=HZKUvBUQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-recruit-barb.jpg?itok=KkQXasb9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>States in the game affect how characters interact with each other, what they need when at the shelter, and if they'll just up and leave your group. Grief can lead to the last result if left to turn into depression and hopelessness. This means you'll have to bench your best scavenger sometimes or risk the consequences.</p>

<p>A survivor's death also impacts your strategy moving forward. Are you willing to risk another survivor to get the items that were collected? I often sent someone to collect the backpack of a fallen survivor, especially if they had a gun. Guns are rare to find, so keeping your hands on them when you get them can mean the difference between successfully escaping or failing.</p>

<p>I found myself really enjoying trying to fully clear a location and find all the survivors currently available. There are hidden locations only found by talking to some survivors or finding secret notes. These are often filled with rare loot, including weapons and base materials. Sometimes, there are human enemies guarding these areas, adding a bit of spice to your zombie-killing routine.</p>

<p>There are ways to do no-kill runs at certain locations, which really challenges stealth and escaping alive. You can also kill every zombie you come across, managing the sound various weapons make as well as the lack of weapons you may run into by not paying attention to weapon durability. Depending on your playstyle, you can have a different experience from others while clearing locations.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-stealth-kill-with-bat.jpg?itok=bVZKT2k6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-stealth-kill-with-bat.jpg?itok=h-oi0UhE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The zombie sounds are eerie, even more so when you wear headphones and can hear all their movements. Some zombies cry or hum, and I've never heard anything as creepy. The first time I heard a zombie scream, the hairs on my neck stood on end. The audio is extremely important and highlights all aspects of&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days.</em></p>



<p>One of the major issues I take with the title is the lack of variety. There are plenty of locations you can scavenge, different weapons to use, and survivors with various traits to rescue. The main problem is the layout of the zombies themselves. Whenever you enter a place for the first time, the enemies are always in the same room, use the same movement patterns, and react the same way to loud sounds. If you end up replaying a part of the game multiple times, like the beginning, those areas can quickly become boring to explore. There's less challenge when you can memorize where the zombies are and move around them or stealth kill them without any worry for your survivor.&nbsp;</p>

Currently, there are two plans you can work towards to make it out of the city. The plans don't change. Their leads are located in the same places, the needed items are always found in the same area when scavenging, and the designated locations to progress the plan are the same. Again, if you play through multiple times, this can make the title more boring than intended.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are still a number of bugs that impact gameplay.&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</em>&nbsp;is in Early Access, so bugs are expected. Some that I've encountered include game crashes, softlocks, zombies attacking through doors, zombies moving through objects, and zombies not spawning correctly. The dev team has said they are working on them.</p>

<p>The number of times I've had to restart due to softlocks and crashes is far higher than it should be. Not only that, but there were different causes of the softlock, and they all resulted in an endless loading screen when returning to the shelter.&nbsp;Since returning to the shelter is when the game saves, this caused me to have to restart a new game multiple times. Depending on where you're at, this could be upwards of 10 hours invested in a save just gone.&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><span><span>Even though </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> has plenty of pros, the progression-ending bugs instantly kill any motivation to continue playing.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-zombie-in-car-bug.jpg?itok=1xsZGe2c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days-zombie-in-car-bug.jpg?itok=VStGWbQi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Thankfully, the game is in Early Access, meaning many of these issues are going to be addressed as time goes on. Development is already noted on the EA Roadmap for "curveballs", or world events that will affect your shelter in various ways. Further down the pipeline are additional survivors, NPC traders, an expanded map, more escape plans, and more zombie behaviors. These will certainly change how the game plays and, hopefully, keep it fresh and exciting each time you start a new game. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>PikPok is a leading game studio in New Zealand, so I have faith the development team will be able to remedy the different causes for crashes and softlocks, as well as the other bugs present in the title, before it fully launches. The core mechanics and the story of&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</em>&nbsp;is solid. Flushing it out with more variety or a more challenging mode will only make it a stronger contender in the survival genre.&nbsp;</p>

During the episode, they even show never-before-seen footage from behind-the-scenes, where Jones says to the camera, “My name’s Walter Jones, I play Zack. I’m Black, and I play the Black Ranger — go figure.” During the series’ casting, Oliver revealed how the Black Ranger “seemed to have the swagger of the group,” while the Yellow Ranger was “peaceful” who tended to “the conscience of the group.”</p><p>For many millennials, Power Rangers is a big part of their childhood, so of course they took to X with their thoughts on the matter. Some fans were quick to point out that the roles eventually were replaced, with a Black actor taking over as a Yellow Ranger and an Asian actor taking over as the Black Ranger.</p><p>Should they have thought more about stereotypes before casting the show this way? Or was the representation in the 90s good enough for the time? Fans seem divided on the issue. For some, this revelation is not that big of a deal. One user wrote, “Nobody was upset about this watching this as kids.” Another added sarcastically, “Cause 3 y/o me is so mad rn.”</p><p>One X user called out the show for making the Black Power Ranger “pop-lock before every punch/kick.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Reduce ‘story’ investment (costs so much for one time element in a ARPG) and focus on new classes, new mob types, new end-game activities that last more than a few days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If the cycle continues to just ship w/o fixing the fundamental issues, then I'm not sure where Diablo is going. You can add all the end-game activities you want, but you'll be running in place with the same issues. At some point there's just so many random things, it's not worth the effort.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The comments on Diablo 4’s expansions have to do with the delay to expansion two, which was once due out in 2025 but will now launch in 2026. Blizzard’s initial plan for Diablo 4 was to release an expansion every year, and while expansion one, Vessel of Hatred, launched in 2024, expansion two will skip 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our interview, Gibson discussed the reality of continuing to develop Diablo 4 as a live service game with free seasonal content as well as a big paid-for expansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I definitely feel like gamers are more hungry than they've ever been,” Gibson said. “And even if you delivered on their appetite today, that appetite will shift tomorrow. And so you just have to be in a really good spot to adapt to that situation. Because a lot of times too, what's important this month is going to be completely different three months from now. The priority of things can shift very, very quickly based on another game release or the state of your own game. Or maybe we've discovered something really cool and we want to be able to get it in there to change the formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And so it is definitely a new way of developing. It is definitely high interaction with the community. The interesting thing about Diablo is that we have a lot of different community types, right? We have our casual players, we have our hardcore players. They all fall into subdivisions of types of players inside of that. And so what we look to do is season upon season, look at the things that are important to some of those groups and go after them with focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you take a look at something like what we're doing in Season 8, we know we have a ton of boss lair feedback and so we're adding in the quality of life improvements for those players where that is a big focus of their gameplay type, or we might shift to nightmare dungeons when we're in Season 9. And so it's an opportunity for us to address different groups at different times, leading to an expansion where we're going to be addressing everybody all at once with something big.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo 4 Season 8 launches later in April, with Season 9 currently due out in the summer, and Season 10 later in the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gets-first-gameplay-video-and-info/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 would be featured in a Direct-style presentation immediately following the Xbox Summer Showcase slated for June 8. However, fans of the game were also treated to a surprise: IGN published the first gameplay video, and more coverage can be expected throughout April as part of IGN First.</p>
<p>The footage sees the player character infiltrating an N-Ray facility with the help of a slightly crazed cultist companion. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-gameplay-the-outer-worlds-2-ign-first" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to IGN</a>, the game features a full-fledged stealth system. Enemies can detect bodies and alert fellow guards, though players obviously have ways to prevent that from happening, including a skill that can disintegrate bodies as soon as they drop.</p>
<p>There are also more effective melee weapons and abilities to perform silent takedowns. Moreover, Obsidian introduced an easy way for players to gauge how much they're going to take out of the enemy's health with a stealth attack, so that they can assess whether a one-hit kill is even possible in the first place.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2: 11 Minutes of Exclusive Gameplay – IGN First" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LhDvnM3wBaQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>New gadgets are being used to spruce up the gameplay variety. In this mission, the N-Ray Scanner allows the player character to spot otherwise invisible cultists. Gunplay also seems improved in The Outer Worlds 2 compared to the first installment, with the developers claiming to have taken inspiration from Bungie's Destiny in that regard.</p>
<p>Movement was also fine-tuned to allow for greater agility, not to mention the addition of a sprint-slide move while aiming down sights. The Bullet-Time-like Tactical Time Dilation returns, and in the footage, we can see the main character tossing a grenade, activating Tactical Time Dilation, and shooting the grenade to have it explode on multiple enemies.</p>
<p>IGN also said that Obsidian mentioned having Fallout: New Vegas as the main inspiration for this sequel. The footage does hint at some of that when, all of a sudden, the player takes down a non-hostile character that had actually provided them with help (and could have been saved if provided with a trauma kit). It looks like there will be a lot of choices and consequences.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is scheduled to launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>Don’t get your hopes up for Titanfall 3 just yet. After a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/titanfall-3-is-almost-complete-says-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak came out suggesting</a> that Titanfall 3 is “almost complete” along with a number of planned features, one prominent journalist has publicly reported that none of the leaked information is accurate.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XsBHGnG9LQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Breaking News</a>, Jeff Grubb shot down the claims by Apex Legends leaker Osvaldatore. </p>



<p>“This isn’t real,” Grubb said. “I’m sorry. It’s not real.”</p>



<p>Grubb then went on to talk about Respawn having a small team that is “probably messing around with games that have titans in them”.</p>



<p>“Does he ( Titanfall 1 director Steve Fukuda) have something like a prototype that has titans in it? I would guess so,” Grubb added. “I don’t know for sure, but I would certainly assume that that is a safe thing to think.</p>



<p>“Now, is that going to get announced in 2025 and released in 2026? No way.”</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-2025">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase Announced For June 8, 2025</a></h6>



<p>He then touched on the fact that EA has been on a trend of canceling various games at Respawn. Those cancellations include Titanfall Legends which was a “previous version of Titanfall 3”.</p>



<p>“Do not expect an Unreal Engine 5, single player campaign Titanfall 3 with a full multiplayer suite,” Grubb said while saying he hated being the one to rain on the parade. “I’m not sure where this is coming from…don’t get your hopes up for Titanfall anytime soon.”</p>



<p>Do you think EA and Respawn will ever release a Titanfall 3? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1835/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

Nintendo will explore options for an official launch in China," Ahmad said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1281597128" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

originally debuted in March 2017. The PS4 and PS5 consoles also didn't arrive in China at launch either, nor did the newest Xbox systems. "Part of that is approvals / regulations, part of that is finding a suitable partner, part of that is demand," Ahmad said.</p><p>Companies not based in China need to have a Chinese partner for product releases. For the original Switch, Nintendo partnered with Chinese internet behemoth Tencent. For Sony, it partnered with Shanghai Oriental Pearl to bring PlayStation consoles to China. Microsoft, meanwhile, made a deal with BesTV to bring Xbox consoles to China.</p><p>The Switch 2 is set for release in the US and other markets on June 5. Nintendo announced a $450 price point for the console, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">some expect a price hike due to the impact of tariffs</a>.

The company said it was taking time to "assess" the impact of the tariffs.</p>

                <p>After launching in 2023 as a Switch exclusive, Disney Illusion Island is now coming to PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC on May 30. The port has been rebranded to <a href="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends</a>, and it now comes bundled with two previously released DLCs and a new DLC featuring Scrooge McDuck. Preorders are available now, and despite all the included DLC, it's available for $30--that's <strong>$10 cheaper than the base game launched for on Switch</strong>. That makes this an excellent time to dive in and explore everything this family-friendly metroidvania has to offer.</p><h2>Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey and Friends Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4473382-f6dc9c3e-f5a7-4697-8274-34968edf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473382" data-ratio="0.56264066016504" data-width="1333" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4473382-f6dc9c3e-f5a7-4697-8274-34968edf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473382"></a><figcaption>Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4473382-f6dc9c3e-f5a7-4697-8274-34968edf.jpg"></figure><p>Physical editions of the game come with an exclusive poster, though it’s only available while supplies last. This isn’t listed as a preorder bonus, but since inventory is limited, reserving a copy of the game is the best way to grab one before it disappears. The poster appears to be a universal bonus available at most retailers. We've verified it's bundled with purchases at Best Buy and GameStop, though double-check the listing if you're purchasing from other vendors.</p><div title="6530722 - Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3358" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6530722 - Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17442104080764?u1=subid_value\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value ">Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends Standard Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17442104080764?u1=subid_value\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/52c1qaxg0rztw?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442104080764?u1=subid_value ">$30 | Releases May 30</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This is the only version of the game up for preorder. Along with the base game and its three DLCs (Keeper Up, Mystery in Motion, and CASH featuring Scrooge McDuck), you’ll get the aforementioned poster while supplies last. Since this is $10 cheaper than the Switch version and it's loaded with DLC, it’s an easy recommendation for anyone looking to get started with the platformer. Physical copies of the game can be purchased at GameStop and Best Buy. PC players can also find it on Steam and GOG.</p><p>Expect more retailers to open preorders in the coming weeks.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you’re a Switch owner yet to play the platformer, you’ll find it available for $40 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-4-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09Z16XWH8?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/lrh6h7romg0ql?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17442102223806?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>. That makes the upcoming edition on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC a much better option, as it’s cheaper yet bundled with additional goodies.</p><p>Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey and Friends is a cooperative platformer where you play as iconic characters like Mickey, Donald Duck, and Goofy, who find themselves on the strange island of Monoth and are tasked with recovering three unique Tomes that protect the island.

It's grown to over 250 developers and has joined the ranks of larger triple-A studios now investing 4-5 years in each development cycle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Experienced developers know this is a uniquely challenging moment for companies making single-player games. One major driver of the massive game industry layoffs of the last year has been a series of stumbles at studios that grew too fast after making a hit game. Positive cash flow and healthy coffers unfortunately aren't enough to promise stability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And yet stability is what CEO Piotr Babieno says he's searching for. In an interview with Game Developer at the 2025 Game Developers Conference, the head of the studio known for making games featuring characters grappling with mental illness explained some of his thinking for leading a healthy workplace.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The most important thing," he said, "is to create a safe environment. Every single decision I make is not just about if the business is good, but if we'll be able to take care of the 250 people in the studio, and their families as well."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/behind-the-headlines-at-valve-s-rocky-start" target="_self" data-discover="true">Behind the headlines at Valve's rocky start</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a surprising value to hear from a CEO in the year 2025, when many are choosing to talk about going </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-desperately-wants-investors-to-know-it-s-on-the-generative-ai-bandwagon">all-in on AI</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or publicly criticizing their own employees about their games not having an "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-ceo-says-the-callisto-protocol-suffered-because-it-lacked-a-gameplay-edge-">edge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">." So what precisely, does Babieno define as a "safe environment?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Keeping your studio &quot;safe&quot; is a tremendous challenge">Keeping your studio "safe" is a tremendous challenge</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The word "safe" takes on a whole new meaning for a Polish game studio in the 2020s. Not only are the typical struggles of game development a day-to-day challenge, but, like many, Bloober had to learn about the realities of making games remotely in the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally the country is nervously watching developments over the border in neighboring Ukraine, where Russia's invasion sparks concerns over a broader response </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/poland-nato-rutte-russia-ukraine-49fa0ce0763926f3c57f6783457ec0e6">that could draw in NATO.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> With game development cycles for games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos: The New Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> running about 5 years, the decisions Babieno makes have huge ripple effects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Russia's invasion seems to be top of mind for Babieno, who explained that Bloober employs developers who hail from Russia and Ukraine—both of whom had to relocate given the circumstances of the war. The studio was also one of the first to publicly halt sales of its games in Russia—not out of spite for the Russian people, Babieno said, but because the company did not want to contribute tax revenue to the government's coffers which could drive spending on its invasion.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-microsoft-ea-and-others-unite-to-make-accessibility-messaging-a-priority" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo, Microsoft, EA and others unite to make accessibility messaging a priority</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Games should connect us rather than make [barriers] between countries or between fans," he said. "I feel we are doing everything we can to support our fans all over the world, but we will never support people who are destroying our world and making horrors bigger than we are able deliver [in our games]."</span></p><p>Image via Bloober Team.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that's a very high level issue. Day-to-day, Babieno said he's grappling with the same things many developers at his company (and around the world) struggle with: self-imposed crunch. "I'm not a good example," he admitted, describing the feeling of wanting to work longer hours because of "passion" for a project. "We are trying to support our team as much as we can and sometimes will increase the time of development if needed to create a good game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bloober apparently also connects employees with psychologists in and around the company to access mental health support (and considering their games are about psychological horror, perhaps some consulting on the topic), but Babieno said regular messaging about "having your own life" is the "first" step in creating that environment.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-games-boss-says-the-streamer-must-seek-to-cause-disruption-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Netflix Games boss says the streamer must strive to cause 'disruption'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the topic of depicting mental health in games—we've heard from developers over the years that sometimes researching real-world injuries, be they </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/id-have-these-extremely-graphic-dreams-what-its-like-t-1834611691">physical</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or mental, can sometimes have a psychological shock of its own. Babieno said he hasn't seen that happen at Bloober, in part because the studio is deliberate about what topics it tackles. "When we are creating a new title, there's always the question of 'what would we like to add to the conversation,'" he said, adding that these topics are meant to encourage "judgment-free" debate on the team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's the "planning" stage that Babieno seemed to circle back to in our conversation. If you want to better understand the company releasing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos: The New Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2025, you need to go all the way back... to 2019.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cronos"><span>Cronos</span> shows the strategic scaling of Bloober's headcount</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Track the arc of Bloober's lineup from 2015 all the way through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and you'll see a fairly steady increase in game scope going from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Layers of Fear</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Observer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, past </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Medium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and all the way through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This was deliberate, said Babieno, and followed a strategic decision in 2015 to commit to horror games. When the company had fewer employees, it focused in on narrative experiences buoyed by environmental storytelling, and scaled up to include more action and player navigation, now seen in the combat-heavy </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because of this, it was a natural step to increase the team and increase the scope of our games," he said, noting that the studio has picked up "more fans" because of this. He echoed a common refrain you hear from indie and triple-A studios, that the company is in business to make high-quality games, not just turn a profit. It does seem the company communicates to its workers that they have to make solid decisions as early as possible, because when they do, they're locking into a long commitment they can't easily get out of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When we are talking about what will be next, it has to be something we would like to work on for the next five years...to spend a big part of our life to create something unusual."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those kinds of impactful decisions can include something as fundamental as setting. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the second game from Bloober set in the studio's native Poland, a decision that doesn't seem so unusual in 2025 but Babienbo said in the beginning, it was a really risky call when trying to make a game that appeals to a global audience. "That was the conversation in the Polish game industry," he recalled. "That we shouldn't make games in Poland because it might not sell as well as if you made a game set in the United States."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers in other regions might feel buoyed by Babieno's words, as he said the "act locally and think globally" approach has paid off. Developers at the studio have an opportunity to be "faithful" to their homeland but also embrace the "trust" of players that they'll be curious enough to embrace that faith and explore new kinds of horrors in a land they may never have visited.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He tossed out the idea that Bloober could make a game set in San Francisco (itself beset by the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.inman.com/2016/04/15/is-the-san-francisco-tech-boom-harming-business/">horrors of the tech industry</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), but it would never be as good as one made by people living in the United States.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">None of what Babieno described in our conversation should be seen as easy or simple. It's common knowledge that in today's market, just making a good game isn't enough to sustain a business, and you can put "we don't crunch" in your company values all you want, but you might look up one day and realize your whole team has worked until 9PM out of love for the game. Taking on the mantle of leadership is about setting yourself up to make hard decisions. "If you would like to have advice, don't run a game studio because maybe it could kill you" Babieno joked.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Babieno—and Bloober—are still here, still alive and standing in the tough environment of 2025. Perhaps for however difficult the road has been, seeing his job as being about "protecting" his workers may be the kind of principle that could help other studios endure these difficult times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
