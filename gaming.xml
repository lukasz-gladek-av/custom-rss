            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Digital Foundry is back with another Switch 2 video; this time looking at how the console holds up next to the Steam Deck when benchmark testing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>.</p>
<p>There's a lot to get into with this, so we'll let the video do most of the talking, but in a nutshell, we're looking at multiple benchmark tests in docked and handheld mode with the Switch 2, including CDPR's 'official' test, the Kabuki run test, and The Beast In Me test.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the Switch 2 is leagues ahead of the Steam Deck when docked, with much better image quality thanks to DLSS, and a much more consistent frame rate in quality mode. In performance mode, during which the Switch 2 targets 40fps, there's a lot more inconsistency, but it still manages to outclass the Steam Deck for the most part.</p>
<p>Handheld mode is a different story. Performance mode isn't available for the Switch 2 in handheld, so we're looking at a target of 30fps, but interestingly, Nintendo's new console showcases slightly more instability than the Steam Deck during both the Kabuki run and The Beast In Me (albeit at a higher resolution). That said, the Switch 2 is much, <em>much</em> more efficient, drawing around 8.9w compared to the Steam Deck's 24.5w. Essentially, the Switch 2 is able to almost match the Steam Deck's performance using just 36% of the latter's power.</p>
<p>In fact, when lowering the power draw in the Steam Deck to match that of the Switch 2, the Steam Deck effectively runs in slow motion, with frame rate dropping to around 9-13fps. Of course, this won't mean a whole lot in real world use cases, but it's interesting to see the stark difference between the two.</p>
<p>Finally, it's worth mentioning that when replicating the Switch 2's performance on PC, a lot of the settings, including crowd density, contact shadows, volumetric cloud, and more are actually quite similar to that of the PS5 in performance mode. Not bad at all for Nintendo's new hardware!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stalker 2 PS5 Version Confirmed for Later This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-ps5-version-late-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-ps5-version-confirmed-for-later-this-year.1239303/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher GSC Game World has revealed that its post-apocalyptic RPG shooter&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is coming to PlayStation 5 later this year.</p>

<p>The announcement of the game's PS5 port was made via a rather amusing new trailer, which features a familiar character from&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>. I won't spoil its surprises, but you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qFxNZksiSw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check it out here</a> if you'd like to watch it.</p>

<p>According to GSC Game World, the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>will utilize the DualSense's haptic feedback and adaptive trigger features for "deeper player immersion", so presumably, that'll manifest in the form of trigger resistance for guns and various other fun little features.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-ps5-vista-pc.jpg?itok=9VWh0-ID 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-ps5-vista-pc.jpg?itok=zJcgxK19 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is hitting PS5 soon.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition, the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>will feature a number of enhancements for the PS5 Pro, so you can add the shooter to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">list of games with extra features</a> for the souped-up version of Sony's hardware.</p>

<p>Other than that, though, it sounds like this will very much be the same&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>with which you may already be familiar. It doesn't sound like GSC Game World will be adding any extra content for the PS5 release, so you won't be missing out if you don't pick it up on Sony's platform.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the long-awaited sequel to 2007's&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chornobyl&nbsp;</em>(not counting prequel <i>Clear Sky&nbsp;</i>or standalone sequel&nbsp;<em>Call of Pripyat</em>, although the latter does take place after&nbsp;<em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>).</p>

<p>The game follows new protagonist Skif, who must explore the Exclusion Zone in search of ways to make money to replace his destroyed home (at least, that's how the game opens; it takes some interesting turns after that which I won't spoil).</p>




<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. It's coming to PS5 in "late 2025", according to GSC Game World.</p>

            <p>I Don't Want To Be A Good Woman is an abstract walking simulator that depicts the experience of being a young girl in Iran - a country that, <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154306">as characterised by UN human rights investigators in September 2024</a>, operates "a system, both in law and in practice, that fundamentally discriminates on the grounds of gender". It takes the form of a molten grey landscape strewn with faceless figures, floating symbols and text.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Play consists of wandering around, witnessing frozen scenes and reading text based on stories the developers We Remember have "heard, gathered, or lived ourselves". The devs have omitted names and their own identities, which I am naturally a bit uneasy about, but the anonymity is to be expected given the Iranian state's <a href="https://iran-shutdown.amnesty.org/">track record for brutal censorship</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3779700/I_Dont_Want_To_Be_A_Good_Woman/">Find it on Steam</a>. Needless to say, I wouldn't play this one lightly. Here is how the developers describe the subject matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>This experience explores real-life challenges faced by women in Iran under Islamic law, including gender-based discrimination, restricted bodily autonomy, and limitations on freedom of expression. Themes such as forced hijab, lack of reproductive rights, and state violence are presented through a narrative lens. While the game contains no explicit imagery, it does involve mature social and political themes.</p>
<p>The game depicts discriminatory behavior toward women by state and religious systems from the perspective of a victim. These portrayals are not meant to promote hate or disparagement, but to raise awareness of real-world issues through an empathetic and objective narrative.</p> </blockquote>
<p>We've covered a few projects that address Iran's society and politics and its recent history. Back in 2013, Adam Smith (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-tehran-1979-revolution-black-friday">wrote about 1979 Revolution: Black Friday</a>, an adventure game created by Iranian developers based inside and outside the country, which casts you as a photojournalist during the overthrow of the (originally CIA and MI6-backed) Pahlavi dynasty.</p>
<p>You might also want to check out this <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/iran-video-games-timeline-from-1970-to-2019">abbreviated history of Iranian video game development</a> for Game Developer, written by Iranian journalist and designer Arash Hackimi in 2020. It spans the creation or importing of new hardware, from the Magnavox Odyssey-esque Video Master through bootlegged Atari 2600s to modern mobile phones; the arrival of Iranian video game magazines, such as Bazi Rayane; the origins of the first Iranian video game developer, Honafa; and the founding of video game festivals, like the Digital Media Festival in 2007.</p>
<p>Hackimi also details a few individual games, including the perpetual motion drawing tool <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/415170/Engare/">Engare</a>, the fantasy action-adventure <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/353990/Parvaneh_Legacy_of_the_Lights_Guardians/">Parvaneh</a> and <a href="http://farsh.golabistudio.com/">Farsh</a>, a puzzle game about unrolling carpets. All of which might surprise you if, like me, your understanding of Iran in video games begins and mostly ends with the likes of Prince of Persia.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-dont-want-to-be-a-good-woman-is-a-museum-of-resilience-that-explores-sexism-and-repression-in-iran]]></content:encoded>

Oblivion Remastered has enjoyed a hugely successful launch, with over 4 million players and a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam (although that's since fallen to 'mostly positive'). However, if there’s one issue that continues to crop up, it’s performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-revisited-profound-problems-have-yet-to-be-addressed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> found Oblivion Remastered on consoles to have significant problems across the board. DF’s Thomas Morgan said of Virtuos’ Unreal Engine 5 overhaul:</p><blockquote>No platform is spared of issues: whether it's PS5, PS5 Pro, or either Xbox Series machine, all struggle with traversal hitches while roaming the open world. Secondly, there's major sub-60fps frame-rates, where I've also discovered that performance slowly degrades with more playing time — quite possibly down to a memory leak. And finally, software freezes are the icing on the cake, with all PlayStation and Xbox platforms crashing to the system menu on loading a save one too many times.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">How does this manifest itself in-game? According to DF, a “charged” playthrough with more continuous play time behind it performs worse than a fresh boot. Cycling through saves also introduces bugs in the charged playthrough, Morgan revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And this is particularly curious: this also leads to the camera position being too high while riding horseback. You can fix this by resetting the game. The update 1.2 patch notes, below, include "Fixed player character height scaling," which may be a fix for this specific issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a dire position for any remaster to be in and developer Virtuos needs to address the game's stability - the crashes - as a priority,” DF continued. That’s a damning assessment of Oblivion on console, but what about PC? DF called PC performance “dire.” It’s worth checking out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-is-one-of-the-worst-performing-pc-games-weve-ever-tested" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DF’s analysis in full</u></a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology.

The special box is now available again for just £44.99, marked down from its usual market value of £84.95, but you’ll need to request an invite to purchase.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h2><div catalogid="5ff3030f-51b6-4106-a2b6-6e881ad1e801" id="224714"><div id="224714" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This limited, invite-only system is the same approach Amazon UK previously used for high-demand sets like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-amazon-invite-requests-151-and-prismatic-evolutions-sets-uk">151 and Prismatic Evolutions</a>. It’s a strategy aimed at cutting out scalpers and ensuring real collectors have a fair shot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather than competing against bots or watching third-party prices skyrocket, Amazon’s invite model gives fans the opportunity to buy at retail, without the usual stress. While receiving an invite doesn’t guarantee a purchase, it significantly improves your chances over a general public listing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar with the Destined Rivals expansion from Scarlet &amp; Violet, the Elite Trainer Box includes everything needed to dive into the set. Inside, you’ll find:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>9 Destined Rivals booster packs </li><li>1 full-art foil Wobbuffet promo card</li><li>65 themed card sleeves</li><li>45 Energy cards</li><li>Player’s guide, damage-counter dice, flip coins, markers, and a collector’s box with dividers</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this makes it ideal for both new players and seasoned collectors looking to build their collection if they haven't had chance to partake in the expansion yet. That's especially with Prime Day offering a rare discount and first-party availability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve missed out on past Elite Trainer Box drops due to inflated resale prices or rapid sellouts, this invite-request system might be your best chance yet. Head to Amazon UK, sign in with your account, and hit the “Request Invite” button on the Destined Rivals ETB product page to be in with a chance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you do recieve a "you've been invited" email, you'll have 72 hours to make your purchase before the offer lapses.

                <p dir="ltr">Razer has a new collaboration in the works with Pokemon, having teased the news on social media. It will be officially revealed later this month.</p><p dir="ltr">The gaming company shared a post on Twitter on July 7, with the question, "Are you ready for a new journey?" while tagging the official Pokemon account, along with the date and time of the announcement for July 17 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET. A short video with yellow fonts on a black background with the Razer logo pulsing with electricity suggests that this could be Pikachu-related.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on replies from Razer's account (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/pokemon-tease" rel="nofollow ">PCGamesN</a>), it seems this may be a collaboration that won't be region-locked, as has been the case with Razer and Pokemon partnerships in the past.</p><p dir="ltr">Razer has already previously released gaming peripherals featuring Gengar, Pikachu, and Eevee, but these had only been limited to a few regions, excluding the US. It's not clear whether this will include past collab products or something completely new, but wider availability will certainly be appreciated by Pokemon fans who haven't been able to get hold of a Pokemon keyboard or mouse, at least not without braving scalpers.</p><p dir="ltr">There's plenty of other partnerships Razer has with other major gaming brands, including Minecraft and Roblox, but a new Pokemon partnership will no doubt be a very hot item. That also comes ahead of the next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-july/1100-6531854/">Pokemon Presents Livestream</a> happening on July 22, where we expect there will be more news on Pokemon Legends: Z-A.</p>

                <p>Dynasty mode is one of the most popular game modes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>, and rightfully so. You're given the reigns of an entire school program and entrusted with making every decision regarding the team you put on the field. At the start of a Dynasty playthrough, you're able to pick your school and whether you're a head coach or offensive/defensive coordinator. If you choose to be a head coach, you then need to decide if you're going to use the school's real-life coach or design your own coach.</p><p>If you opt for the latter option, you get to fully customize your coach's appearance just like you would a custom player in Road to Glory. However, creating a custom coach also means you need to select a Coach Archetype, which can be a tricky task in College Football 26. To see the differences between the three Archetypes and which one you should pick, check out the guide below.</p><h2>What are the Coach Archetypes in Dynasty mode?</h2><p>If you played any College Football 25, then the Dynasty Archetypes will be familiar, as they're the same ones that are in College Football 26. There are three in total, and they are:</p><ul><li>Motivator (example: Marcus Freeman, Notre Dame)</li><li>Recruiter (example: Dan Lanning, Oregon)</li><li>Tactician (example: Steve Starkisian, Texas)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528601-img_6825.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528601" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528601-img_6825.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528601"></a><figcaption>The three Coach Archetypes in Dynasty mode</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528601-img_6825.jpg"></figure><p>Your decision in a Coach Archetype determines the coaching abilities you have access to early on in a Dynasty playthrough. It also plays a pivotal role in deciding what kind of coach you're going to be and where your strengths lie, both on and off the field.</p><p>When it comes to the coaching abilities you can unlock, every ability has a certain classification. You'll immediately unlock your Archetype's first coaching ability after starting a Dynasty playthrough, and you can unlock more abilities within that Archetype as you progress. However, you can still unlock abilities from other Archetypes, so picking one Archetype doesn't prevent you from being a well-rounded coach in CFB 26.</p><p>The first ability you have unlocked can be progressed to become more advanced, though. For example, if you pick the Recruiter Archetype, you'll immediately unlock the Firm Handshakes ability. This gives you 100 bonus XP for signing a recruit. This ability can be upgraded to Elite Recruiter with enough XP, which has even stronger benefits.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528602-img_6823.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528602" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528602-img_6823.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528602"></a><figcaption>A look at the coaching abilities in Dynasty mode</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528602-img_6823.jpg"></figure><h2>Best Coach Archetype to pick in College Football 26</h2><p>So, which is the best one to pick? Truthfully, you can't go wrong with any of the selections, as all three Archetypes cover important coaching areas that come with perks you'll want to have in Dynasty mode.</p><p>However, if we were to rank the Archetypes, here's where they would stand:</p><ol><li>Recruiter</li><li>Motivator</li><li>Tactician</li></ol><p>Recruiter is simply the best overall Coach Archetype for your long-term Dynasty playthrough. The other Archetypes focus on player ratings for the most part, and while that will help you win games, there's still an element of skill you need to have.</p><p>On the other hand, the Recruiter Archetype gives you perks that allow you to build a stronger team in the long run. Recruiter allows you to recruit much better players and develop a more efficient scouting process throughout a Dynasty playthrough. Without the Recruiter Archetype and abilities, you'll have a rough time trying to convince players to sign with your program until you manage to unlock some Recruiter abilities.</p><p>What it really comes down to is you can fully control what happens on the field, regardless of whether your players' ratings are boosted or not with the Motivator or Tactician Archetypes. However, you'll have a much harder time controlling what happens in the recruiting process if you don't select the Recruiter Archetype. It helps eliminate some RNG and frustration from a Dynasty playthrough and saves you heaps of time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528603-img_6824.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528603" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528603-img_6824.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528603"></a><figcaption>Architect is one of the abilities you want to work towards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4528603-img_6824.jpg"></figure><p>You also have to consider that Motivator and Tactician don't start out with great abilities. You'll have to work your way to abilities such as Architect and Strategist in addition to leveling up the Recruiter abilities. With Recruiter, you can max out your Recruiter abilities or go for some of the other ones to gain strength in additional areas.</p><p>Of course, choosing an Archetype also comes down to personal preference and what you enjoy when you play Dynasty in CFB 26. If you feel you'll really benefit from having players' ratings boosted, then go with Motivator or Tactician. Motivator is the better choice overall since Tactician only boosts players' ratings on gameday, but pick whichever one you feel good about.</p>

                <p>Sounds like Disney is cooking up something in the world of video games. A couple of job listings went up on the Disney Careers website at the end of last month, for <a href="https://www.disneycareers.com/en/job/california/senior-gameplay-engineer/391/83021111648" rel="nofollow ">senior</a> and regular <a href="https://www.disneycareers.com/en/job/glendale/gameplay-engineer/391/83021111392" rel="nofollow ">gameplay engineer</a> positions. As is par for the course for listings like these, what exactly it is you'd be working on wasn't mentioned, but it does say that Disney is "building an expert development team that will be building a groundbreaking game experience that will herald the next generation of Disney to the world."</p><p dir="ltr">Both roles mention Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel, so it sounds like it might be a cross-property project. Notably, it also mentions that having experience in Unreal Editor for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> and Verse (the programming language used for UEFN), making it sound like these roles could be for Disney's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-its-fortnite-deal-is-so-important-we-have-to-adapt/1100-6526831/">previously announced metaverse within Fortnite</a>. That deal saw Disney invest $1.5 billion into Epic Games, though we're yet to see any results from it bar the usual collaborations Fortnite features.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, prolific Fortnite leaker Hypex shared that this Disney metaverse had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disneys-fortnite-project-reportedly-reaches-a-major-milestone/1100-6529352/" data-ref-id="1100-6529352">moved into a "stable" build/branch</a>, but aside from the initial announcement last year, there's only been a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-teases-theme-park-integration-with-disney-x-fortnite-project/1100-6530010/">small tease</a> about how the house of mouse's theme parks might integrate with the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The senior gameplay designer role also makes mention of requiring experience in the prototyping phase of a project, so you probably shouldn't expect this Disney x Fortnite metaverse for a while yet.</p>

            <p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl - the former Xbox console exclusive - is coming to PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>"The Perimeter expands," Stalker 2 developer <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1942932316466065731">GSC Game World shared on social media earlier today</a>, along with a new PS5 announcement trailer, which you can see below. We don't have a release date yet for the game's PlayStation debut, but it is currently expected "late" 2025.</p>
<p>The upcoming release will make the most of the PlayStation 5's DualSense features, the team said, highlighting the controller's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. In addition, "further technical enhancements for the PS5 Pro are also in development," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> told <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-official-ps5-announcement-trailer">IGN</a>. You can <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10014084/">add Stalker 2 to your PS5 wishlist now</a>. </p>

<p>Stalker 2 initially launched across Xbox and PC last year, following a rather tumultuous period for the studio. Prior to its release, GSC Game World delayed Stalker 2 several times due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-on-hold-ukraine-based-developer-confirms">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>. The studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-developer-reportedly-moving-to-prague-to-finish-game">relocated staff</a> to safely finish the project elsewhere, while others <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-harrowing-update-from-gsc-game-world-the-stalker-2-developer-based-in-ukraine">joined Ukraine's armed forces</a>, and it also dealt with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-says-russian-hackers-have-leaked-test-build-online-asks-fans-not-to-share">Russian hackers who leaked test builds</a>. GSC has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-documentary-shares-personal-stories-from-development-against-the-backdrop-of-war">since released a documentary</a> detailing Stalker 2's particularly difficult development.</p>
<p>On its eventual arrival last November, the game was hampered by multiple technical problems, which the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">Stalker 2 team acknowledged from the off</a>. It has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2s-latest-patch-finally-fixes-a-life-arrives-alongside-700gb-of-official-modding-tools">since released a number of patches to address the issues</a>. None of this harmed the game's popularity, however, and just a few days after the release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">GSC announced Stalker 2 had sold 1m copies</a>.</p>
<p>Heart of Chornobyl "stays faithful to the open world survival shooter of yesteryear," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Eurogamer's Stalker 2 review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-stalker-2-set-for-ps5-this-year]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A little more than three months ago on April 2, 2025, Wargaming Group Limited, the studio behind live service hits like World of Tanks, launched <a href="https://wccftech.com/wargaming-announces-steel-hunters-early-access-date/">Steel Hunters</a>, a mech-themed free-to-play hero shooter that initially released on Steam in early access.</p>



<p>Today, Wargaming Group Limited announced that Steel Hunters will be shutting down this coming October 8, 2025, officially adding Steel Hunters to the pile of free-to-play titles unable live until its one-year anniversary, and in this case, it didn't even make it out of early access. </p>



<p>"<em>Today we share difficult news," </em>the studio began in a post on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340/view/527598784391155504?l=english">game's Steam page</a>. "<em>We've made the decision to sunset Steel Hunters. You've given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we've come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable. We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Steel Hunters was first announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/steel-hunters-is-wargamings-new-mech-themed-hero-shooter/">The Game Awards 2024</a>, with Wargaming's chief executive officer, Victor Kislyi saying at the time "<em>This is a massive moment for Wargaming...With Steel Hunters, we're pushing past our boundaries and bringing something completely new. Our ambition is to create one of the most exhilarating and compelling mech experiences ever</em>."</p>



<p>That the game will be shut down by October 8, 2025, means that it didn't even make it a year since it was revealed. </p>



<p>If you want to check out Steel Hunters before it is shut down for good, or if you were already playing it, then you'll be glad to know that Wargaming is unlocking everything in the game for all players. All available Hunters, including ones that Wargaming was priming for a future content update that no one had seen before, are now available in the game for players to have fun with. </p>



<p>Wargaming will also be releasing<em> </em>support for custom matches in the coming weeks so players who've enjoyed Steel Hunters can set up private community games with their friends. The studio will also host a farewell tournament for Steel Hunters before it is shut down, with more details for that to be shared soon via the game's official Discord.</p>



<p>"<em>We are immensely grateful for your time, feedback, memes, and countless memorable battles we've shared,</em>" the farewell post continued. "<em>From the very first days of Alpha, you've shaped Steel Hunters with your energy, creativity, and dedication, and we're honored to have had you on this journey. We couldn't have wished for a better community and we'll miss you all dearly. Thank you, Hunters, for everything</em>."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/solar-gardens-review-light-and-bright-victory-point-game-for-casual-crowd</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/solar-gardens-review-a-light-and-bright-victory-point-game-for-a-casual-crowd.1239252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For board games with a futuristic setting it can be fun to be in the depths of space, or in a Blade Runner-esc future of grit and steel, but it can also be just as refreshing for a game to be in a utopic future of glass buildings, sunny skies, and gardens all around you. That last one is the exact setting of Darrington Press and Designer, Alex Cutler's, new Victory Point game <em>Solar Gardens.</em></p>

<p>The premise of <em>Solar Gardens</em> is quite simple: spend each turn adding tiles to your garden — a 4x4 grid set on the top of a skyscraper — and position them in a way that will help you earn Victory Points and win the game.</p>

<h2>What's In The <em>Solar Gardens</em> Box?</h2>

<p>Within the <em>Solar Gardens</em> box, you'll find the following:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Rulebook</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Score Sheets</li>
	<li aria-level="1">5x Identical Game Boards</li>
	<li aria-level="1">5x Scoring Reference Cards</li>
	<li aria-level="1">1x Starting Player Token</li>
	<li aria-level="1">90x Garden Tiles</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solar-gardens-box-contents.jpg?itok=NrECdwKE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solar-gardens-box-contents.jpg?itok=0XZm0ahU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Getting set up is as easy as handing each player one of the identical game boards (give the player with the starting board the Starting Player Token) and shuffling and placing each of the Garden Tiles facedown.</p>

<p>Each player can additionally be handed a scoring reference, especially useful if you're a new player and want to get a better idea of what your aim should be. Starting new Victory Point games, I often find that the hardest part is keeping track of what you're trying to score, or at least if it's all only present in the rulebook, it's a lot of people asking to see it. These Scoring References are high quality, clear, and easy to share.</p>

<p><em>Solar Gardens</em> wasn't just an easy game to set up, but to teach it took less than five minutes. I wouldn't say that it's specifically targeted at a younger age group, but maybe a better target would be to say those who want to play a quick board game and want a lesser amount of antagonism from other players. <em>Solar Gardens</em> is a light-hearted and fun experience for the whole family.</p>

<p>The only complaint I might have is that the inside of the box is just empty space for you to dump 90 Garden Tiles into between games. Some wooden grooves to hold the pieces in place would assist in starting the game a bit faster, and not needing to re-flip all tiles to the correct side.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solar-gardens-mid-game-board.jpg?itok=ampsqlzX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solar-gardens-mid-game-board.jpg?itok=XsY8VyhZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Only four tiles in you can already see I have three Wind Farms in my top row, one more and I'd earn 4 points</figcaption></figure><h2>Taking Turns To Build Your Garden</h2>

<p>Each turn, the Starting Player will draw a number of Garden Tiles equal to one more than players and flip over the one on top. From there, they can decide if they want to add that Tile to their garden or pass it on to the next player clockwise in rotation.. This tile is passed down the line until it is claimed.</p>

<p>As you've drawn one additional Garden Tile there is one tile that you can discard a round if it fits no one's board, but after that what tile you're left with is what you get.</p>

<p>After a turn has concluded, the Starting Player will shift clockwise, and the process will repeat again.</p>

<p>I really liked the idea of it not just being a game of blind drawing, but a game of chance. If you have a tile in your hand that might contribute two points, do you want to settle with that, or do you think another token in the stack might yield you better results?</p>

<h2>Advanced Strategy With Familiarity</h2>

<p>During my games, it was already a fun enough time just to work on my own board, but I can also see a lot of strategy for more experienced players who aren't just looking at their own board, but the boards of their friends/opponents.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solar-gardens-completed-board.jpg?itok=0vMlrpcR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solar-gardens-completed-board.jpg?itok=iCU49WEB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of these were definitely a mistake to select...</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike other Victory Point games like Ticket to Ride there isn't a central place that players are playing, getting in one another's way. If you're looking at a token that might only get you one point… but could lead to the player to the left earning four points then it might just be worth you taking that to deprive them.</p>

<h2>Scoring Is Simple Enough</h2>

<p>While the Scoring References are a great aid in the scoring process itself, for <em>Solar Gardens</em> is incredibly easy to keep track of. The Rows and Columns want you to get four wind farms or four solar panels, respectively, to earn 1-4 points; your longest path is 1 point per path, connected animal habitats are three points (or 5 if you have all), and enclosed gardens with watering facilities earn additional points. There are also just statues that earn points based on their number of loops.</p>

<p>Each Garden Tile you place has the potential to have a number of different features. One might have two Solar Panels and a Wind Farm, another might have a hen house, an apiary, and a solar panel, and a third could just have a habitat and a three-point statue.</p>

<p>I found that even if a tile I drew didn't have exactly what I was looking for, there was normally some benefit in placing the tile.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solar-gardens-finished-game.jpg?itok=kz-OCQwN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solar-gardens-finished-game.jpg?itok=DJEcGB-z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A few Victory Point games I've played in the past have either felt like there was one single objective that was just too good to be true and all players chased that down, or if you went for one objective at the beginning and got poor luck, you were essentially out of the race.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <em>Solar Gardens</em>, the feeling of always progressing towards multiple goals did a great jobof&nbsp; keeping everyone not only engaged but in closer standing.</p>

<h2><em>Solar Gardens</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Solar Gardens</em> is a great representation of a game not needing the deepest mechanics or the longest runtime to be a fun game. For casual board gamers or a younger audience, this is a great way to get into a Victory Point game that might only take 20-30 minutes of your time.</p>

<p>As you play it more, you'll start to see patterns, and while there's definitely some skill to develop — focusing not only on your own board but on your friend's boards — <em>Solar Gardens</em> serves as a great launching point into some of those harder or antagonistic Victory Point games.</p>

<p>I can see <em>Solar Gardens</em> becoming a well-loved part of anyone's collection for that game to bring out when you just want to play a light board game.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-achievements-retroachievements-epilogue</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/retroachievements-gb-operator-collab-lets-you-earn-achievements-in-classic-game-boy-games.1239249/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>RetroAchievements has announced a collaboration with Playback, allowing you to earn achievements for your old-school Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Playback, it's <a href="https://support.epilogue.co/hc/en-us/articles/4402823733266-How-does-the-Playback-software-integrate-emulators" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">software</a>&nbsp;that uses the libretro API to integrate multiple emulator cores and let you play retro games. It's also software that comes with the GB Operator, a device that lets you emulate your existing cartridges on a PC, and that's where this collab comes in.</p>

<p>Essentially, if you pick up a GB Operator, you'll now find a new Achievements setting within Playback's Settings menu, which will enable you to turn on achievements for your Game Boy carts. You will need the physical device and a real cart, though; achievements won't work with simple ROM files, as far as I can tell.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-game-boy-advance-gb-operator-playback.jpg?itok=rQvoBmDC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-game-boy-advance-gb-operator-playback.jpg?itok=HoleHVK3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Playback now has RetroAchievements integration through GB Operator. Hooray!</figcaption></figure><p>Though RetroAchievements community manager Nebiki doesn't list which games are supported in this crossover, but I'd imagine the collaboration will stretch to all Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games currently supported by the site, as long as you've got the real cartridges.</p>

<p>The new achievements window in Playback comes complete with a dedicated overlay that will show you various categories, including whether achievements are earned, yet to be earned, or even missable. You'll even get notifications when you unlock an achievement, which is neat.</p>

<p>Obviously, the original Nintendo handheld cartridges don't have built-in achievements, so it's neat that Epilogue and RetroAchievements have built in a system to help those games feel that much more modern. Again, though, it's worth bearing in mind that these achievements won't work without the real cartridges.</p>

<p>That's likely because although Playback uses the mGBA emulator for Game Boy Advance games, it's extracting the ROM file from the real cart to avoid legal issues.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/game-boy-advance-nintendo-switch-online-wario-land.jpg?itok=4dFoLczo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/game-boy-advance-nintendo-switch-online-wario-land.jpg?itok=ZSW8QsWf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo's Game Boy and Game Boy Advance re-releases don't come with achievements, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>Many Game Boy and Game Boy Advance titles are available to play on Switch and Switch 2 via Nintendo Switch Online, of course, but these re-releases don't come with achievements, so if you want to feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with the little achievement "ping", you're better off with GB Operator and Playback, I reckon.</p>

<p>You can pick up a GB Operator right now via the <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/product/gb-operator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official Epilogue website</a>, and you can <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/downloads" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">download Playback</a> from the same place as well.</p>

<p>You play as Clive, a jaw-headed detective resurrected by a parasite and recruited into a secret taskforce, with the secret task of killing many people with a six shooter revolver and machete. The game lies in surviving ultra-lethal encounters by timing your reloads well, using cover smartly, and knowing when to use an excellent machete swing with some deeply satisfying forward propulsion. The game "contains lots of gore and violence against crooks and criminals," reads the content warning, which I'm sure the Hays code would approve of.</p>
<p>There's also a "noir mode" if you find the, I assume, deliberately headachey visuals a bit <em>too </em>headachey. Also, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3560730/MORTALITY_DECOMP_KILLERS/">latest patch</a> includes the note: "added 'Invert Y' sensitivity setting for FREAKS", which I approve of. Again, it's very free, seemingly forever, and is worth the small download just for that machete spin.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mortality-decomp-killers-is-a-free-post-void-like-that-scores-you-on-how-many-doors-youve-killed]]></content:encoded>

With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-take/" data-ref-id="5000-680655">Dead Take</a>, the studio sets its sights on creating a tense and atmospheric experience that tasks players with splicing together live-action footage as they explore a Hollywood mansion and the dark side of fame.

Monroe (Starr). As Chase explores the luxurious-yet-eerie Los Angeles mansion Vinny was last seen at, he is forced to wade through footage of the pair in an attempt to make sense of what happened. It's worth noting, however, that prior to Vinny's disappearance, both he and Chase were auditioning for the same role in a critically-acclaimed filmmaker's next movie, hinting that there might have been a bit of animosity between the pair. And yet, jealousy isn't the only dark force at work, as there seems to be a strange supernatural element to the game as well.</p><p>"The house is watching.

"Piece together what really happened last night as you discover a side of the entertainment industry only discussed in whispers. The cruelty. The sordid gossip. The auditions gone wrong. The shadowy figure with the power to make or break your career. There's only one way to guarantee your success: feed me something real."</p><p>Though Surgent Studios has yet to announce a release date, Dead Take is listed as "coming soon" on Steam. In the game's most recent press release, the studio stated that it will reveal the rest of Dead Take's cast, including "a notable line-up of cameos," in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p>
Developer Funcom has apologised to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> players and pledged to restore missing vehicles and items after a recent patch inadvertently deleted bases and other equipment.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening, you might recall, recently made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-deep-desert-pve-expansion">significant changes to its end-game</a>, introducing a substantial number of PvE-focused areas to its ever-shifting Deep Desert area following player complaints. During a subsequent update, several PvE-designated areas were inadvertently switched to PvP, and Funcom released a patch on Monday swapping them back.
</p>
<p>
However, as it's now revealed in a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/developer-update/">new post addressing the issue</a>, these changes weren't supposed to come into effect until the next Coriolis cycle, when the Deep Desert is reset and reshaped by raging sandstorms. As a result of their premature deployment, players who'd set up camp in the impacted areas suddenly found their bases gone and their hard-earned end-game resources and equipment missing. Annoyance, as you might imagine, ensued.

<p>
"This was an oversight in our development process and internal communications," Funcom explained in its developer update. "We're incredibly sorry that this happened and we want to acknowledge that this should have been handled better. We've changed our internal processes as a result of this and will be better in the future."
</p>
<p>
The studio has also pledged to restore all lost vehicles and items "to the best of [its] ability", noting that impacted players should see their reimbursed items, materials, and vehicle components appear in Dune: Awakening's in-game Claim Rewards tab by the end of this week. 
</p>
<p>
Funcom's post also addresses a number of additional issues it's currently tackling, including item and vehicles losses resulting from other bugs. "At launch we lacked the tooling and logging to identify and reimburse all circumstances of item loss," it explains. "But we have been working on improving our tools so that we can better reimburse players for vehicle losses due to bugs. There is a backlog of customer support requests, so we beg your patience when waiting for tickets to be resolved." It adds the team is "working to address the root causes of the item loss" and has a "dedicated team focused on mitigating vehicle/item loss on server crashes, disconnects, server mesh transfers, and travelling between maps."

<p>
And finally, Funcom notes its primary focus over the  coming weeks and months will - in addition to addressing critically gameplay issues and introducing quality of life improvements - be to remove identified exploits, including third-party cheat engines, client hacks, and in-game exploitation of game mechanics.
</p>
<p>
"We have zero tolerance for the type of player behaviour that has an impact on the experience of other players," it explains, "and we will continue to focus on ensuring that players can enjoy the game as it is intended." The studio reminds players to report cheats and exploits using the "available reporting channels", and notes it's already "taken action on several hundred players who have abused exploits, cheats and hacks", with "more waves of bans" on the way.
</p>
<p>
As for the game itself, it's a good 'un, teething troubles aside. "[It's] a case study in how to adapt a beloved body of work right," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">Eurogamer's Connor Makar wrote in his review</a>. "At a time when triple-A game development tends to play it safe, I'm sure there was real pressure to sand down some of Dune: Awakening's many quirks. I'm very glad that didn't happen."

		<p>AI has taken over the world of Ra Ra Boom. This is an apocalyptic Earth, but not in the traditional Skynet style of decimation we’re used to. Instead, we meet our four heroes as they are sitting in a mundane, interminably boring classroom, safe in a sanctuary that looks like your everyday American high school. They’ve been selected, hand-picked even, thanks to their special traits, to train, practice and prepare for the return of the despotic AI and its minions, This quite conveniently happens just in time for the start of the game.</p>

<p>This is a classic beat ‘em up of the highest order, with four-player co-op giving you control of one of the four unique characters. They’re headed by Aris, a cheerleader who dual-wields Uzi-like machine guns, while my personal favourite Vee is the tank character, brutally pushing enemies back with her massive energy shield and chunky blows. Meanwhile, you’ve got Ren, a super-fast samurai, and last, but not least, Saida, a cyborg with sass. They’re described as ninja space cheerleaders and, broadly speaking, they are. They’re undoubtedly a cool and engaging group that you’ll want to take on an adventure smashing up robots.</p>


<p>And you get to smash plenty of robots. Ra Ra Boom brings the traditional batch of light and heavy attacks, as well as an Ultimate that you charge by successfully landing blows on those badniks. On top of that, each character has a ranged attack, guns and missiles destroying everything in their path, and giving you a great way to continue attacking while you close the distance to smash them up some more. Punches and kicks feel suitably swift, though I’d like to feel a little more weight to each blow.</p>


<p>The enemy are aggressive. These robots are hell-bent on putting you down, and even when you’ve taken many of the metal monsters out, they’ll resurrect, rushing at you with flailing limbs in a last attempt to deal you damage. It means you have to be ever watchful, and I’d definitely like to see some kind of finisher move to stop them from getting back up again. This is quality fisticuffs action though, and I really enjoyed the old-school thrills of walking left to right, hitting everything in my path.</p>
<p>It helps that Ra Ra Boom looks great. There’s a real America’s Best Comics vibe to the visuals, and each of the main characters is unique and vibrantly designed. I love some of the robot designs seen in the demo – particularly the massive single-eyed robotic boss character – and I can hope that the full game will showcase even more interesting designs and epic encounters.</p>

<p>My only current worry is that Ra Ra Boom is pretty tough, and some of that doesn’t always feel fair. Enemies can nab you a little too easily at times when you’re not expecting it, and there’s a running section where it’s nigh-on impossible to avoid the high-speed full-lane attacks that come your way, even though the path of the attack is laid out on the ground.</p>
<p>Ra Ra Boom has bags of potential, and as a fan of co-op action and classic beat ‘em ups, it’s definitely grabbed my attention. We won’t have to wait too long to see the whole game in action, as It’s set to launch for PC, PS5, XSX|S and Linux this August.</p>

		<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has been announced been confirmed for PS5, and that it will be coming later this year. If the Xbox Series XS had a year’s exclusivity, then that release will be on or after November 20th. The PS5 version of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl will use the DualSense features like haptic feedback and the adaptive triggers. GSC Game World has also said that it will be developing PS5 Pro enhancements for the game, but has not detailed what these will be.</p>
<p><iframe title="STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl – Official PS5 Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2qFxNZksiSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Since its launch, STALKER 2 has received quite substantial updates bringing a couple of thousand fixes to the game. Recently, update 1.5 was released with this adding the Three-Line Rifle and Kora Pistol. In addition, the update brought in mutant parts trading allowing you sell parts from monsters, which can be a lucrative trade to be in. The world has also been made more immersive with all characters in the zone having their own simulated lives, even when they are not in the player’s view.</p>

<p>In our STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl review, Miguel said, <em>“STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</em><br>

			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is making the jump to PS5 sometime in late 2025, developer GSC Game World has announced. </p>



<p>The news was announced with a post on the official STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl X account, and with a short teaser trailer published through IGN, featuring characters in the game playing STALKER 2 on what looks like a STALKER-looking version of a PlayStation controller. </p>



<p>"<em>The Perimeter expands - STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is officially announced for PlayStation 5</em>," the <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1942932316466065731">studio wrote in its post</a>. It's currently available to wish list on the PlayStation Store for those who want to ensure they get a notification when pre-orders go live and the release date is announced. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl – Official PS5 Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2qFxNZksiSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>STALKER 2 launched towards the end of 2024 on PC and as a console-exclusive for Xbox Series X/S devices, though the fact that every other STALKER game is available on PlayStation was at least a tip that those with nothing but a PS5 at home just had to be patient if they wanted to dive into the latest entry in the long-running series. </p>



<p>When it first launched, it arrived in a touch of controversy, with a number of outlets reviewing a version of the game that was decidedly broken prior to launch, only for a significant portion of those issues to be fixed with a patch that arrived just in time for launch. It still wasn't perfect, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo noted in his review</a>, but even with all the bugs, he still marked it as "<em>a worthy successor of the original in every regard."</em> Even with all its issues, earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-surpassed-6-million-players-says-gsc/">STALKER 2 surpassed 6 million players worldwide</a>.</p>



<p>GSC Game World has continued to patch the game and release fixes, the most recent of which arrived just <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-big-1-5-patch-fixing-a-life-and-adding-mod-tools/">last month with a significant patch that added modding tools for PC players.</a> By the time it makes it onto PS5, there's a solid chance that PS5 and PS5 Pro players will get the best console experience from day-one, simply because they'll get to play a version that, hopefully, isn't as riddled with bugs as the game was when it launched on Xbox Series X/S. </p>

The devs confirmed the sci-fi shooter “will fully utilize DualSense controller features, including haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for deeper player immersion,” on Sony’s platform. A PS5 Pro update is also in the works, though it’s unclear if that will be ready in time for the PS5 launch. </p><p>  <em>Stalker 2</em> earned fresh fans and won over older ones with its dedication to plunking players down in a mysterious and hostile environment where every bullet and health pack is precious and the mere act of seeing what’s down a road requires a minor act of in-game courage. It does not pander or hand-hold, and with more time spent and less jank (and an earlier release date) it might have entered more GOTY-contender conversations. </p><p>Unfortunately, the bugs at launch on PC and Xbox Series X/S were hard to completely ignore, even if they were entirely par for the course with a complex sandbox game and in keeping with <em>Stalke</em>r’s messy history. While there have been a healthy number of updates and patches in the months since its release, some players have lost patience, and<em> Stalker 2</em>'s ratings on both Steam and Xbox have only gotten spottier. “I’ve been defending <em>Stalker 2</em> since release, but I feel like I am starting to give up a bit,”<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1l95ryh/ive_been_defending_stalker_2_since_release_but_i/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1l95ryh/ive_been_defending_stalker_2_since_release_but_i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> wrote one fan</a></span> on the subreddit last month in a thread explaining their frustrations.</p><p>I imagine porting the game to another set of hardware will only complicate things further.

When we asked Piscatella for comment, he noted that Elden Ring: Nightreign and the original Elden Ring weren't really comparable sales-wise, due to being very different games sold at very different prices. "That being said, Nightreign launch unit sales did not reach the same neighborhood as those of Elden Ring."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was followed closely by debut game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> at No. 2, which is also now the 16th best-selling game of 2025. As with Nightreign, The Dark Ages didn't hit the sales heights of its predecessor, Doom: Eternal, but according to Piscatella, "this is more timing than anything. Doom Eternal launched in March 2020... and nothing is going to ever comp well to any new game that launched in March of 2020."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New games F1 25 and Capcom Fighting Collection 2 debuted at No. 15 and No. 19, respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, spending on video game content was up 2% year-over-year to $3.7 billion, largely driven by subscription spending on non-mobile platforms, according to analysis by Circana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hardware spending dropped by 13% year-over-year in May, to $172 million, with Nintendo Switch dollar sales dropping 44%, Xbox Series dropping 30%, and PlayStation growing 3%. The PlayStation 5 was the best-selling hardware in both unit sales and dollars. Next month's charts for June will show the impact of the Nintendo Switch 2's release on this landscape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, video game spending was up 1% year-over-year to $4.1 billion.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">May 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Elden Ring: Nightreign (NEW)</li><li>Doom: The Dark Ages (NEW)</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>MLB: The Show 25*</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</li><li>Star Wars: Battlefront II</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>F1 25 (NEW)</li><li>Helldivers II</li><li>The Last of Us: Part II</li><li>WWE 2K25</li><li>Capcom Fighting Collection 2 (NEW)</li><li>PGA Tour 2K25</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Continuing development is not sustainable..."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The live service bloodbath continues — this time the casualty is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a>, the mech shooter game from the people behind World of Tanks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Steel Hunters launched on April 2 in early access form on Steam. Some had hoped for Titanfall vibes from this free-to-play, PvPvE shooter, but it fell completely flat. And just three months later, developer Wargaming has announced plans to sunset the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post addressing Steel Hunter’s community, Wargaming said the game’s servers will live on for another three months before the game goes dark permanently from October 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Today we share difficult news: we've made the decision to sunset Steel Hunters,” Wargaming’s statement began. “You've given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we've come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable. We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what went wrong? Amid the difficulties so many live service games have endured in recent times,  Steel Hunters failed to capture an audience. It launched on Steam with a peak of 4,479 concurrent players and a ‘mixed’ user review rating, and it was downhill from there. At the time of this article’s publication, the 24-hour peak was 97, with just 52 concurrent players — that’s devastating for any free-to-play game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/rakura/recommended/1691340/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top user review on Steam</a>, from a player with over 300 hours on Steel Hunters including its various pre-launch forms, lamented the potential of the game, and praised its mech design and maps. However, they critisized Wargaming's lack of a roadmap, slow pace of updates, and various bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Early access should have never happened," they said. "We should have never left beta. Time and time again the players have been vocal about changes or fixes that were needed and have come to the table with very helpful solutions only to be met with 'we are moving forward' only to then react with 'why did it go south?'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Live service video games are enduring a tough time right now, with a number of titles falling by the wayside or finding themselves canceled before launch. Sony’s Concord is perhaps the highest-profile example of that, a PlayStation disaster that cost the gaming business hundreds of millions of dollars. But only last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say">Microsoft canceled an unannounced MMORPG from the developer of The Elder Scrolls Online</a>, resulting in hundreds of layoffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
