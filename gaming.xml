Whether it's his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/random-takaya-imamura-wants-to-see-star-fox-assault-on-switch-2">wishes for a Star Fox revitalisation</a> or his dreams of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/random-takaya-imamura-ponders-the-possibility-of-star-fox-zero-on-switch-2">future movie adaptations</a>, the former Nintendo dev is always on hand to give us something to think about. But today, all that's on our minds is how inadequate our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> design capabilities are.</p>
<p>You see, in the past 24 hours, Imamura-san has shared a couple of pictures from his New Horizons pad, flexing the iconic movie posters that he has recreated in staggering detail via the in-game Custom Designs app. To start, there were just three. Now, there are seven. And, simply put, they put our best efforts to shame.</p><div><figure data-videoid="HpG4hedNmz8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytHpG4hedNmz8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0b5ivmkuj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>At the time of writing, we've seen recreations of <strong>E.T.</strong>, <strong>Back to the Future</strong>, <strong>Star Wars</strong>, <strong>The Terminator</strong>, and more, and every one of them is more accurate than we could ever hope to muster with our humble skills. What's more, Imamura-san claims that he "rushed" the second batch — now come on, that's just showing off.</p>

<p>Of course, this is the man behind some of Nintendo's most iconic artwork, having designed for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_fox">Star Fox</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora's Mask</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/f-zero">F-Zero</a>. We really shouldn't be all that surprised that he's a dab hand at Animal Crossing custom designs too, but here we are. So, when's he dropping the patterns, eh?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kindle Paperwhite Drops to Record Low, E-Reader Now Cheaper Than Buying a Few Physical Books]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/kindle-paperwhite-drops-to-record-low-e-reader-now-cheaper-than-buying-a-few-physical-books-2000648434</link>
            <guid>1367629</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kindle e-readers have evolved into reading experiences that rival physical books through <strong>e-ink displays mimicking printed paper and provides instant access to over 15 million titles that would fill entire libraries</strong>. The convenience proves transformative through lightweight portability replacing heavy books in bags, immediate downloads eliminating bookstore trips, and adjustable lighting enabling reading anywhere regardless of ambient conditions.</p>
<p>The newest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6054/">Kindle Paperwhite with 16GB storage (and ads) costs $124 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $159</a>, and hits a record-low price where Amazon removes profit margins completely on their own hardware. The ad-supported version saves money through occasional lock-screen advertisements, though <strong>spending an extra $20 for the ad-free model proves worthwhile</strong> if promotional content bothers you.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6054/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The fastest page turns that are like real books</h2>
<p>The next-generation processor makes <strong>page turns 25% faster than older Paperwhite models</strong>: This gets rid of the short lag that made earlier e-readers feel slow compared to flipping through real pages. The speed boost is especially noticeable in scenes with a lot of dialogue or action, where quick page turning keeps the story moving instead of making fake pauses that break the immersion.</p>



<p>The <strong>7-inch glare-free screen gives you a lot of reading space</strong> in a small package: It can fit more text on the screen while still being portable which is something that bigger tablets give up. The anti-glare coating makes it possible to read in direct sunlight where phone and tablet screens wash out completely which means that you can read at the beach, in an outdoor cafe, or at a sunny window seat without having to squint or move around like you would with reflective screens.</p>
<p>The <strong>adjustable color temperature changes from bright white light for reading during the day to warm amber tones for reading at night</strong>: This lowers blue light exposure, which can affect sleep quality. The warm light lets you read before bed without the blue light that phone and tablet screens give off, which keeps your natural sleep patterns going instead of messing them up.</p>



<p>The<strong> IPX8 waterproof rating</strong> means that the device can be submerged in water for up to two meters for 60 minutes. This means you can read by the pool, relax in the bathtub, or spend time at the beach without worrying about your electronics getting wet. The device won’t break if it falls into a pool, gets splashed by waves, or gets rained on, so you don’t have to be as careful with it when it’s wet, like you do with most expensive electronics.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery lasts for 12 weeks on a single charge</strong> so you don’t have to charge your phone or tablet every night, which can make them feel like they need constant care. Read every day for months without needing to charge, take vacations without bringing chargers, or keep reading without worrying about the battery running out like you do with devices that need daily power. The USB-C charging makes it easier to charge when needed because it doesn’t need special cables like older Kindles did.</p>
<p>The<strong> 16GB of storage can hold thousands of books</strong> which is much more than what most readers read before they upgrade their devices. The storage is especially useful when traveling internationally, when buying books can be difficult.</p>
<p>If you’ve thought about getting an e-reader but were put off by the usual prices, this is the perfect time to make the switch from physical books.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lenovo Idea Tab Hits an All-Time Low, Now the Cheapest Android Tablet With Pencil and Case Included]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/get-a-headstart-on-your-2025-holiday-tech-shopping-with-the-ai-powered-lenovo-idea-tab-2000636961</link>
            <guid>1367626</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The digital device in pretty much every student’s backpack doesn’t absolutely have to be an expensive laptop computer. The apps and tech that make digital note-taking, research, and AI-assisted writing and coursework has filtered down not just to high-end tablets, but also some of the more affordable models as well. That’s where the Lenovo Idea Tab sits — an 11-inch Android tablet armed with everything a student needs, including Lenovo AI Notes, but without the hefty price tag that comes with a laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">It’s on Black Friday sale right now at Amazon for just $180 (-25%).</a></p>
<p>Odds are the Lenovo Idea Tab is going to outperform most if not all other $180 tablets for academic and productivity purposes. It comes with the Lenovo Tab Pen and a folio case, both of which are almost always added expenses with tablets. Google’s Circle to Search feature is built in as well, along with Lenovo’s AI Notes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Clear Picture</h2>
<p>The Lenovo Idea Tab comes with four apps that are tailor-made for academic performance: Squid, the powerful paper-replacing Android app for handwritten notes, PDF markups, and other tasks; MyScript Notes (formerly Nebo), a great freehand-sketching app; MyScript Calculator, which can solve your handwritten numerical equations; and Lenovo AI Note, which transforms your handwritten notes into AI-generated quizzes, and can also use AI to expand on your notes with greater insight.</p>
<p>Whether you’re working or playing, the 11-inch 2.5K screen on the Lenovo Idea Pad isn’t going to let you down. The MediaTek Dimensity 6300 octa-core processor ensures that the images on that screen come through smoothly, and the seemingly inexhaustible battery is good for up to 12 hours of video playback.</p>



<h2>All the Tablet, Without the Price</h2>
<p>Everything else you would ask of the tablets in the higher price brackets — fast internet, smooth streaming, quality built-in camera and Dolby Atmos quad speakers for video calls, and total portability (just 6.5 x 10 x 0.28 inches in size and 1.05 pounds in weight) — are here with the Lenovo Idea Pad, and don’t forget the included-in-price Lenovo Tab Pen and folio case.</p>
<p>The Lenovo Idea Pad might be considered to be an “entry-level” tablet by some, and to be fair, we wouldn’t throw it in the ring against the latest iPad Pro or Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra. But you’re certainly not getting anywhere near either of those heavyweights for $210, and the differences between them and the Lenovo Idea Pad probably don’t quantify the $1,000-plus price difference. Long story short, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">you’re getting far more tablet than you would expect for $180 from the Lenovo Idea Pad, so this Amazon Black Friday deal is a solid thumbs-up.</a></p>

<p>Build a rocket, boy</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_rocket_lab">Little Rocket Lab</a> is a sweet pixel art automation game from No More Robots and Teenage Astronauts. It arrived on Steam and Xbox last month, and we have been wondering when a Switch release would follow ever since. Well, it's coming real soon. What's more, there's a Switch 2 Edition in tow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-rocket-lab-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Little Rocket Lab - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, and its Switch 1 counterpart, will be available on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Little-Rocket-Lab-2955324.html">eShop</a> from 10th December for <strong>£15.99 / $19.99</strong> (or as a free upgrade for those who make the jump between systems down the road), and it boasts some pretty slick performance on the new hardware. Alongside the promise of boosted resolution, Teenage Astronauts have also got things running at a sweet 120fps — so you know those conveyor belts are going to be looking smooth as anything.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily the kind of game that we can imagine being drastically impacted by a triple-figure frame rate, but S2 Editions hitting those upper reaches are always a welcome sight.</p>
<p>For those curious, this is a chilled little factory-building game, where you set out to transform your rundown family home into a prime site for rocket construction. To do so, you'll have to lay down transport, delegate machinery, and make the most of your surrounding resources, all while keeping the locals happy.</p>
<p>You'll find a brief rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Clever Contraptions:</strong> Use drills, furnaces, automated bots, cranes, complex assemblers and far more to help the town’s struggling locals!<br>
<strong>The Heart of Community:</strong> Build lifelong friendships with townsfolk, learn the depths of their lives, and become the heart of the community<br>
<strong>Invent, Invent, Invent!:</strong> Devise and formulate new machinery, energy sources and mechanical pals to help you on your journey to the stars<br>
<strong>Cozy Organisation:</strong> Lose yourself in the comforting hum of well-oiled machines, made by your hands, and working just as intended<br>
<strong>Build a Rocket Ship:</strong> Support a struggling town while building a rocket ship!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first half of December is looking particularly rammed at the moment, but if you're after something to kick back with between the stresses of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, this might just end up fitting the bill.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fatshark-presents-darktide-new-hive-scum-class-confirms-no-pvp-plans/</link>
            <guid>1367614</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Fatshark's 10 Years of Tide celebration includes not only Warhammer: Vermintide 2 (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-currently-free-to-keep-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recently given away for free</a> and also got a new map), but also Warhammer 40K: Darktide. The studio's most recent game is about to receive a new paid DLC, the Hive Scum class, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/darktide-arbites-dlc-was-a-success-boasts-fatshark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful launch of the Arbites class</a>. In a press presentation attended by Wccftech, Fatshark introduced the Hive Scum as a gang of native criminals from Tertium's Hive City who are begrudgingly joining forces with the inquisitorial warband to fight the forces of chaos. This new class brings a very different style and attitude to gameplay, emphasizing a more aggressive and playstyle compared to other classes available in Darktide.</p>



<p>The developers have prepared extensive customization options for the Hive Scum, including new faces, hairstyles, full-body tattoos, and a unique system called face paints. Players can represent different cartels within the Hive, adding an extra layer of identity and personality to their Hive Scum characters.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hive-Scum-Screenshot-4-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>This class focuses on rapid dual-wielding pistols for ranged combat and dual-wielding shivs (daggers) for melee combat. The dual-wielding pistols can be fired in an alternate, frenzied mode with the left trigger but can also be fired more accurately with 'brace mode', which is enabled with the right trigger. Similarly, when using the dual blades, Hive Scum players can switch between blunt and pointed grip, which changes the attack chains and effects. In either case, it's a fast-paced playstyle designed to highlight the street-gang vibe of the Hive Scum, which is reflected in their animations as well. </p>



<p>The class features several abilities and ultimate moves that align with its reckless gangster theme, such as unlimited ammo and invincibility during a Desperado ultimate. Another ultimate, Rampage, buffs melee attacks, enhancing attack power, and can be refreshed by hitting targets. Lastly, Stimm Supply places a crate on the ground that buffs the whole group. The type of buff is derived from the Stimm Lab, arguably the class's most significant innovation. It is a new, class‑specific progression system that lets Hive Scum players craft a custom 'Cartel Special' stimm. For every character level, you gain one point to spend in the Lab, selecting different bonuses that are baked into this personal Stimm, which then replaces regular Stimms found in missions if you opt in. The Cartel Special automatically recharges on a cooldown, and that cooldown grows longer the more points you invest and the more powerful the combined effects become. Using the Stimm Lab is optional, by the way: if you don't take any upgrades there, your Hive Scum simply uses the same normal stimms as other classes.</p>



<p>The Hive Scum class also introduces a new damage type to Darktide called toxins, which deal damage over time and weaken enemies. When it comes to Blitz abilities, Blinder/Blackout is a fast‑throw concussive grenade for knocking enemies down and creating openings; Boom Bringer is a disposable missile launcher for deleting elites and monsters; and Chem Grenade creates lingering toxic zones and chain reactions. The talent trees are designed around three core playstyles: a gunslinger Desperado, a melee-focused Ruffian, and a Chemist specializing in the aforementioned toxin damage.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/No-Mans-Land-Screeshot-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>While the Hive Scum class is a premium DLC (available starting December 2 on all platforms for $11.99 in the Standard Edition and $18.99 for the Premium Edition), all Warhammer 40K: Darktide players are getting a new three-mission story arc as part of a free update. It includes trench warfare-style combat through a 'No Man's Land' area as players escort a tank to reclaim a stronghold held by a cult faction. The mission features outdoor combat areas with classic Warhammer 40K-inspired ruined cityscape and bunkers. It branched out from previously released content but includes new voice-overs, story elements, and narrative developments. It requires players to unlock part of the main campaign before access, but can also be joined in co-op with players who have unlocked it.</p>



<p>In the presentation's Q&amp;A segment, we learned from Fatshark that developing a new class like the Hive Scum usually takes them between six and twelve months, with teams ranging from 10 to 25 members involved. The studio promised further ongoing support for Darktide, including additional missions, factions, and gameplay features.</p>



<p>I asked whether the studio was evaluating the addition of PvP modes <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-gets-versus-mode-with-4v4-battles-and-several-characters-to-choose-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like in Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a>, and the reply was that this is not currently planned, but may be considered later. Don't hold your breath, though, as it sounded like this possibility has barely been evaluated thus far. It took many years before Vermintide 2 got its own PvP, and the same may apply to Darktide.</p>

			<p>Though Black Friday deals usually start ahead of the actual date, there are always still deals that only appear on the day itself, which is why it's still worth keeping your eye out for deals and waiting for the actual day. Well, anyone who was patient enough to wait for it to actually be Black Friday in order to take advantage of deals on video games has been rewarded, because there's a slew of games, all of which were released in 2025, that you can grab for $40 or less on Amazon.</p>



<p>Of course, you can find older games for cheap as well, and some other 2025 releases on sale for more than $40, but no one is able to grab everything they want in a given year right at launch, so there's likely a few games in this list of 20 titles released in 2025 that you can pick up for cheap now.</p>



<p>Starting from the top-end of the pricing, with games that you can pick up for $40 that were released in 2025:</p>



<ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/top-all-your-essentials-in-one-go-with-the-3-port-65w-anker-usb-c-charger-for-just-24-2000648212</link>
            <guid>1367599</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday has arrived in all its glory, slashing rates across a wide range of categories right, left, and center. We’re spotting tons of items hitting their lowest ever prices, and even some of the latest releases getting surprise discounts. It’s basically a great time to pick everything you’ve had your eyes on for less, whether it’s a MacBook, a pair of premium Bose headphones, or even an air fryer to finally start eating healthy.</p>
<p>If you rely on multiple devices to get through the day and are done dealing with cord clutter, a multiport charger is the way out. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/">Right now, you can snag the 3-port 65W Anker USB-C charger for $24, after a whopping 40% off its usual price of $40 at Amazon.</a> And as if that wasn’t enough, the retailer is also throwing in 2 free months of Audible with your purchase to sweeten the deal even more. Both Prime and non-Prime members can grab it, but subscribers will enjoy free shipping, so they’re saving a few bucks on that front, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>High-Speed Charging for All Your Devices</h2>
<p>This compact charger is roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case, and the plugs fold in for easy portability. The smooth, scratchproof surface handles everyday wear and tear well, making it easy to take it with you on the go without worry.</p>
<p>There are three ports (two USB-C and one USB-A) to charge up to three devices at the same time, whether it’s your smartphone, tablet, or even a laptop. 65W ultra-fast charging is enough to juice a 14-inch MacBook Pro to 50% in just 35 minutes, or a Google Pixelbook to about half in a little over 40. You’ll get maximum power when using a single port, but when multiple devices are plugged in, the charger automatically spreads the output intelligently. For instance, when topping three devices up at the same time, the top USB-C port can output 40W, while the second USB-C port and USB-A port can deliver 12W each. You can connect your power-hungry devices to a USB-C port, while other essentials to the rest.</p>



<p>Despite this power, the charger stays calm and cool while it works. GaN II technology makes for higher energy efficiency and upgraded heat dissipation in a compact frame that is around 53% smaller than your regular, everyday blocks. The box comes with the Anker 735 Charger, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/">To wrap it up, you’re saving a massive 40% or $16 on this compact, but powerful charger that’s easy to use and makes any workspace more efficient.</a> It plays nicely with a range of devices, so you can use it to top up your earbuds, smartwatches, smartphones, tablet, laptop, and even consoles.&nbsp;You’re also getting a free 60-day Audible trial on top of that, which typically costs $15 a month. Audible gets you access to a huge library of podcasts, audiobooks, and Audible Originals that include documentaries, comedy shows, and more. You can purchase titles, enjoy on-demand streaming, and even enjoy offline access to your favorites!</p>
<p>Both the offers, however, are expected to expire soon, so it’s best to get your orders in quickly. Once these are gone, there’s no guarantee they’ll be back. This is also a great time to grab other tech gadgets for less. We’re covering the top deals here at Kotaku, so don’t forget to check back for the latest drops and some exclusive offers.</p>

Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819903/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-console-ship-date-november-18">recently released</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/822849/analogue-3d-review-n64">Analogue 3D</a>, it will play N64 games in 4K through the use of an FPGA. ModRetro — the company founded by the controversial figure Palmer Luckey who’s also behind a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/798821/anduril-eagleeye-palmer-luckey-mark-zuckerberg-meta-military-mr">defense contractor that makes military tech</a> — has been <a href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1901796093396222233?">teasing details about the console</a> on social media over the past few months, but today it finally revealed the console’s design, and an accompanying remake of the N64’s unique three-pronged controller.</p><p>Similar to the recently-launched Analogue 3D, the M64’s design is inspired by Nintendo’s original hardware with a gently curved top panel, cartridge slot on top, and four ports on the front compatible with the N64’s original wired gamepads. On the front corner of the top panel you’ll find a power button, while the other corner features a dial labeled “Menu.” Aside from presumably navigating on-screen menus we don’t yet know if the dial will have additional functionality. On the back of the M64 is an HDMI port, three USB-C ports, and a microSD card slot.</p><p>The new images of the M64 show the console with a translucent housing in green, purple, and white color options, as well as three color-matched controllers. The Analogue 3D is also compatible with the Nintendo 64’s original gamepads, but the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825309/8bitdo-64-wireless-bluetooth-controller-analogue-3d-retro-gray-color">worked with 8BitDo to create a modernized version</a> with a similar button layout and thumbstick design. ModRetro has instead gone for authenticity. The M64’s controllers look nearly identical to the original with a three pronged design featuring the thumbstick on top of the middle grip and a trigger button beneath it.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1993115525153436057">post on X earlier this week</a>, Luckey also announced that while the M64 was priced at $199 (the same launch price as the N64 in 1996) for those who signed up for the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmodretro.com%2Fpages%2Fm64" rel="sponsored">waitlist on ModRetro’s website</a> after the M64 was announced, the introductory pricing is being extended to everyone — at least for now.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/831498/modretro-m64-console-4k-fpga-nintendo-64-clone]]></content:encoded>

Of steel is my spirit, of thunder my bones. I am the hawk's justice, the quadrapedal crucible of oil and atrocity in which the future is forged. BEHOLD, ye <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> simulation enthusiasts. Behold my unabashed phallic symbolism menacing the gates of heaven, while my hissing hydraulics uncipher the coordinates of my prey.</p>
<p>Many are my supplicants, strangers from near and far who seek to beguile me and aim my blessed ordnance, but mine is the judgement, and mine the tactile gratifications of levers and gears and dials. You were getting bored of turrets in war games? Fools! You have never experienced one from the inside. Come, surrender yourself to the dieselpunk folds and surprisingly jaunty background music of my ironclad majesty. (Here's a trailer.)

<p>
"A brutal dieselpunk heavy-artillery experience where you dominate the battlefield through a colossal war machine," roars <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2950790/IRON_NEST_Heavy_Turret_Simulator/">the Steam page for Iron Nest: Heavy Turret Simulator</a>, like a minotaur with a marketing degree. "Every lever, every dial and every shot is under your control. High Command may send cryptic orders, but you alone pull the trigger. Obey or defy, in this nest you are the god of steel and fire. Beware, each blast tears the silence!" ARGH. I just saluted inadvertently and jammed a pencil in my ear.
</p><p>
There's a slightly less bellowy characterisation of the game at the bottom of that Steam page. This is "a unique blend of tactical problem-solving, war machine management, and strategic customization" in which you "translate cryptic reports into coordinates, determine where to strike, and set the turret accordingly". It features "a card-based requisition system that keeps every mission fresh", and is apparently the work of just two developers with about 20 years of experience between them. 
</p>
<p>
Iron Nest takes heavy inspiration from (deep breath)  <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pvkk-planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant">PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</a>, which is kind of bizarre because PVKK isn't even out yet. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2950790/view/707754276831626328?l=english">a post</a> about the experience of going moderately viral on Tiktok, the devs stress that Iron Nest and PVKK are quite different once you disregard the theme of honking massive manually operated cannons. It's about "ground-based artillery, which brings a completely different setup, mechanics, and challenges compared to an orbital gun!" 
</p>
<p>
Potato, potarto, I'm tempted to say, but I'm already imagining the whistle of vengeful shells. You can expect a demo in a few months, and the full release in mid-2026.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-expensive-oled-tvs-4k-fire-tv-on-black-friday-sale-does-the-job-for-97-of-people-2000648430</link>
            <guid>1367569</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon sells Insignia-branded TVs despite the brand being owned by competitor Best Buy and creates the unusual situation where Amazon’s platform promotes a rival’s house brand.&nbsp;Several popular sizes including <strong>55-inch and 75-inch variants have already sold out</strong> completely, but remaining models like this 50-inch version offer exceptional value that doesn’t justify spending significantly more on competing brands.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/">55-inch TV costs $169 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $299, and hits a record-low 43% discount</a> that makes 4K smart TVs cost less than many soundbars or streaming devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fire TV integration</h2>
<p>The <strong>4K Ultra HD resolution at 2160p has four times as many pixels as 1080p Full HD</strong>. This makes images sharper with text that is still readable, faces that show detail, and faraway objects that stay clear instead of becoming blurry copies. HDR10 support improves dynamic range by using metadata to adjust brightness and color on a scene-by-scene basis, and this lets you see more detail in shadows in dark scenes while keeping bright highlight information.</p>



<p>The wide color gamut shows more colors than standard dynamic range and makes images that are more colorful and realistic like what we see in real life, instead of the flat colors that SDR content has. The upscaling engine looks at content with lower resolution and smartly adds detail to make it look like 4K quality.</p>
<p>The <strong>60Hz refresh rate works well with regular TV and movie content</strong> because it has native frame rate support that stops the judder from happening on displays with different refresh rates. The refresh rate is good enough for almost all types of content, including streaming services, cable TV, and DVDs and Blu-rays, which never go above 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>You don’t need any extra streaming sticks or boxes to <strong>use the built-in Fire TV operating system to get to streaming services</strong> like Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and thousands of other apps right away. The all-in-one design gets rid of the HDMI port, the need to switch between remotes, and the mess of cables that come with separate streaming devices.</p>



<p>With the <strong>smart home hub</strong>, you can watch camera feeds from compatible video doorbells and security cameras directly on the TV in picture-in-picture or full-screen mode. You can use voice commands to control Alexa-compatible lights, thermostats, and smart plugs through the TV remote. This makes it easier to manage your smart home without needing separate Echo devices or phone apps.</p>
<p>Insignia’s 50-inch 4K Fire TV is now the cheapest on Black Friday at $169: It <strong>costs less than many 32-inch TVs but has a much bigger screen and all the smart features you could want</strong>. This deal makes 4K smart TVs available at prices that have never been seen before so you can get big-screen entertainment without losing any of the important features.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/crucial-x10-1tb-ssd-now-costs-less-than-a-dime-per-gb-actually-only-0-08-while-black-friday-supplies-last-2000647763</link>
            <guid>1367566</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cruising Amazon for the best Black Friday deals is a hunting expedition for those red digits next to the price — the negative numbers with the percentage sign that guide you to the biggest price drops. It was -13% that led us to the deal on the Crucial X10 1TB Portable SSD, but it was the Crucial name and the features of this awesome drive that led us to click “buy now.”</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6043/">The new $85 Black Friday price on the Crucial X10 is well worth jumping on.</a> The 1TB capacity of this model of the X10 is enough to serve as a secure backup for tens of thousands of irreplaceable files. It’s compatible with Windows, Mac, Android, and many gaming consoles. The Crucial X10 transfers data at a fast 2,100MB/s, and it has advanced dust, water, and drop resistance built in. Crucial might not have as recognizable a name as SanDisk or Samsung or some of the other big tech companies, but the reputation and the performance are impeccable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6043/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiny Yet Enormous</h2>
<p>When you click over to Amazon to check out the Crucial X10 the first thing you’ll notice is how much smaller it is than most other portable SSDs. Just 2.55 by 1.96 inches square and a truly remarkable 0.39 inches thick, it’s probably the most pocket-sized 4TB drive on the market. Even so, you don’t have to treat it with kid gloves — the Crucial X10 has IP65 dust and water resistance ratings, and drop resistance of nearly 10 feet.</p>
<p>With that kind of rugged construction combined with the 1TB capacity and outstanding speed of data transfer make the Crucial X10 a prime candidate for anything you would use a portable SSD for. Add 1TB of storage to your gaming console — it works with PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox — and bring the extra games with you on the road. It’s a perfect Time Machine drive for automatic Mac backups, and as storage or transport for huge files like hi-res photo and video files, it’s a massive amount of space in a tiny package, and it can move the files back and forth to your editing station with great speed.</p>
<h2>Ditch the Thumb Drive</h2>
<p>Students, remote workers, and frequent business travelers have mostly relied on USB thumb drives for ferrying their files. They’re pocket-sized, plug-and-play, and inexpensive, so that tracks. But the Crucial X10? Pocket-sized, plug-and-play, and for a exceptionally fast, nearly universally compatible, massive-capacity drive, inexpensive. And unlike those thumb drives, the Crucial X10 can take a little bit of abuse, and isn’t going to glitch out on you like those cheap thumb drives. It’s a worthy investment in keeping your irreplaceable files safe and secure, especially during this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6043/">Amazon Black Friday sale with the fat 13% price drop that makes the Crucial X10 one of the best portable SSD buys of the day at just $230.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Team Cherry is Thinking of Making a New Game Instead of Hollow Knight 3]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-3-team-cherry/</link>
            <guid>1367560</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new interview, Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson sat down with Jason Schreier to discuss the studio’s success and what could be next for Team Cherry, and it might not be Hollow Knight 3.</p>



<p>During the interview (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>), Schreier asked Gibson what’s next for Team Cherry after they complete Silksong: Hollow Knight’s DLC content, to which Gibson said that “we do have other games that we plan to make”, citing that their only concern is the time that it now takes to make games.</p>







<p>“The only time concern really is — and we’ve talked about this before — death. It’s not that far off if you spend seven years per project, and potentially add another two. So it’d be nice to do a few more games,” he said.</p>



<p>Schreier immediately jumped on the comment, asking if Team Cherry intends to create more games within the same universe or go somewhere else entirely. </p>



<p>Gibson replied, “We have said we’ll go elsewhere as well. Although we’ve also said those experiences will still be about exploring big worlds full of weird characters and giant bosses and whatnot. So there would be a through line there that people will be familiar with. That’s not to say we won’t return to these&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>&nbsp;worlds. We do have ideas around what forms those would take. But we also don’t want to be exclusively people that make&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>.”</p>



<p>Gibson then said that it doesn’t mean he would necessarily be annoyed at making another Silksong, and that he just thinks it will be ”&nbsp;interesting for us to explore the same things we’re interested in but maybe in a slightly different genre, slightly different theme, and how that affects the stories we come up with.”</p>







<p>As for now, though, it seems like Team Cherry doesn’t really have something concretely set up for their next project, and if anything, it’ll probably be another 4-5 years until we find out what they are working on.</p>



<p>What do you think Team Cherry should do next? Would you welcome a Hollow Knight 3? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>Team Cherry has confirmed it's still working on new content for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, but won't say when it's coming out.</p>
<p>The long-awaited adventure was finally released in September to huge fanfare. And it would seem the developers aren't done with it yet.</p>
<p>"We didn't plan seven years for Silksong," Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>. "Not that we expect to take an excessive amount of time, but we still are pursuing the same development philosophy, which sometimes can expand our timeframe."</p>

<p>Silksong, infamously, began life as DLC for the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> game before ballooning into a full standalone game.</p>
<p>It's unclear exactly what the studio is working on, and if that too has the potential to balloon in size.</p>
<p>Bloomberg has speculated a DLC focused on Steel Assassin Sharpe may be in the works. This character was teased in a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/happy-hollowmas">studio blog post years ago</a>, but wasn't included in the final game.</p>
<p>"Just waiting in the wings," said Gibson of the character. "Waiting to arrive is probably the best way to say it. One of those enemies, a little suite of Sharpe and their companions, they got tucked away for a while because the game had so much in it. And all of these pieces need polish, and polish takes time. We're excited to reintroduce Sharpe. We just have to get to them."</p><p>Gibson added: "We will make sure to deliver on all of our obligations. One, because they're going to be very fun to do. But even alongside those tasks we had our own ideas for extra things that could be added to the world. We're trying to juggle when that could potentially be."</p>
<p>Bloomberg also asked Team Cherry if they wish to shorten the time for their next game.</p>
<p>"At the start of Silksong, and at the start of Hollow Knight, we had no conception it would take as long as it did for either game," said co-founder William Pellen. "We started to work on the basic idea of it, and allowed it to grow as much as we wanted it to. We could've stopped that from growing if we'd wanted to. I imagine we'll go on to the next game, again with that core idea and begin exploring it and start to suss out what the boundaries will end up being."</p>
<p>Gibson added: "We're clearly not concerned if it ends up taking a long period of time."</p>
<p>For now, the pair are "certainly happy with where [Silksong] is sitting right now, and we're not planning anything dramatic at this point," said Gibson, following multiple balance tweaks and updates.</p>
<p>He continued: "We're also quite happy where technically it's sitting, noting that we will continue to do small fixes of course. And we are looking at what else can we do, what else can be brought to the experience and how that world can expand. I don't know how much we can really speak about it. We're playing a little coy again. But that's also because this stuff is in flux."</p>
<p>The pair are considering different sizes of updates too, similar to the smaller Lifeblood or larger Godmaster and Grimm Troupe from Hollow Knight.</p>
<p>Said Pellen: "We were talking about the next project in general. We're not thinking about the size. We just started making new stuff and working on bits and pieces. We're still in this world, thinking about stuff to present to people."</p>
<p>Information will come "soon", but the pair wouldn't be drawn to a timeframe and said they'll have a more frequent cadence of communication as there's more to discuss.</p>
<p>Gibson surmised: "Yes, we're continuing to work on the game, we're pursuing the things that excite us."</p>
<p>This will certainly be exciting news for Silksong fans, too. "Pretty and charmingly mean-spirited, this is a game filled with revelations and genuine personality," reads our five star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Hollow Knight: Silksong review</a>.</p>
<p>In the same interview, the pair also discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-hollow-knight-silksong-is-totally-fine-say-team-cherry-but-studio-is-largely-happy-with-difficulty-balance">Silksong's imposing challenge and the use of mods to alter the difficulty</a>.</p>

			<p>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide already enlisted the dregs of the grimdark future’s society to fight back against the forces of Chaos, but the Hive Scum goes a step further by getting into bed with organised crime. It’s honestly a bit like a classic film noir set-up, with the gangsters of Tertium choosing to team up with the law and order of the Inquisitorial Warband to fight back against Chaos. And why? Just because the growing war has been really bad for business.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Hive Scum Class Reveal | Cinematic Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZetaKE7KQo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Put any images I’ve just conjured of Tommy guns, zoot suits and spats out of your mind, because the crime cartels of the 41st Millennium are much more punk rock than that. Literally, they look like old British punk rockers, slathered with full-body tattoos, with mohawks and spiked hair or… uh, just some really long sideburns, and uncomfortable-looking spiked leather outfits.</p>


<p>Darktide captures this look and feel perfectly, and there’s a bunch of new customisation options in the character creator to accommodate this. There’s new Hive Scum exclusive hairstyles, and you can dye hair different colours too, new tattoos, face paint and more besides. You also get to choose from four gangs to be aligned with –&nbsp;the Water Cartel, Iron Riders, Show, and Tread Lightlies. Necromunda fans will have a field day with all of this, or they would if they knew what a field was.</p>


<p>For as distinctive as the Hive Scum are compared to the rest of the Inquisitor’s gang, they play even more differently. It starts with the weaponry, and in true gang runner fashion, there’s absolutely no common sense applied to always running around with twinned blades and twinned automatic pistols. Heck, they even blast away with the guns in side grip half the time. This is very much the rule of cool, and plays into the indiscriminate firing style that the Hive Scum is really all about. It’s spray and pray more than precise aiming, and should be good for dealing with hordes of more basic enemies. For the melee side of things, you can also swap to a vicious looking bone saw, or a crowbar, which you can flip in hand to go from blunt-sided enemy-staggering sweeps to pointy end stabby stuff.</p>
<p>There’s a new Toxins damage type that comes with the Hive Scum. Alongside a concussive grenade and missile launcher, you can pick the chem grenade that is able to make a toxic gas cloud, and there’s also the needle pistol as a main gun option, which has been realised to deal this special type of damage. This actually bleeds through armour to affect tougher enemies, which is a really interesting twist, but it also acts a bit like the classic Virus Outbreak stratagem card from the 2nd Edition Warhammer 40K era. While it won’t be quite so devastating, the Toxin effect is able to spread between enemies, dealing damage over time throughout an onrushing horde.</p>

<p>As with all the other classes in the game, there’s a lengthy skill tree to work through as you level up, building up to playstyle defining ultimate abilities. the Desperado goes all in on Gun Fu-inspired shenanigans, making you impossible to hit with ranged attacks throughout and giving you unlimited ammo. The effect is prolonged by killing marked enemies, so you can keep it going for a good long time, though this time boost diminishes. On the other side is Rampage, which ramps up your melee damage, again prolonging the effect by hitting and killing enemies, making you a bit of a glass cannon.</p>
<p>The most interesting one, though, is the Stimm Supply ability, dropping a box that will spew out a cloud of enhancing drugs for you and your teammates –&nbsp;either a strong effect when within the cloud or to “Huff and Go”a bit reduced but sticking with people who’ve left the smog. This ties in with the Hive Scum’s second talent tree, which can be used to cook up their own custom stimms.</p>
<p>Essentially, this takes all the possibilities from the stimms other characters can find and use and turns them into a mix-and-match skill tree of their own. You add different components and buffs, and can either go all in on one effect category or blend them together. The most powerful aspects are that this is on a cooldown, making it as integral to the character as their weapons and ultimates, and that it’s instantly used right in the middle of the fray, just by hitting the button. The only thing you really need to balance is how strong to make the stimm, because the more powerful the effect, the longer the cooldown will be.</p>
<p>Hive Scum feels like it will be a really fun addition to explore through Darktide, and there’s great potential for this criminal class to interact with some of the more reputable parts of the Inquisitorial Warband when on missions together.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, Hive Scum will launch alongside a free update to Darktide that brings a new mission and narrative arc to the game. The No Man’s Land operation will show how this war against Chaos is evolving yet again, spilling out to the outskirts of the hive city, letting you see the dim grey skies and visit a sprawling trench network. Lovely.</p>
<p>Your mission here is to escort the tank of Knight Commander Dragor through to breach some stronghold walls as you battle down in the trenches. These are really wide and open trenches compared to WWI, but do lead to a rather linear feeling level thanks to the sharp 90º corners. One thing that old 40K fans will appreciate is the scenery around the main channel of battle, as you might see some iconic 3rd Edition plastic ruins rendered in all their polygonal glory in the periphery.</p>

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide looks to be going from strength to strength, with Fatshark having settled into a practised groove for producing new characters and meaningfully continuing the narrative of this co-op shooter through new levels and story arcs. As they arrive next week on 2nd December, Hive Scum and No Man’s Land are just the latest examples of this, both great visual and thematic changes of pace that I’m keen to see evolve further.</p>

<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips">LinusTechTips</a> has built a gaming PC featuring specs similar to Valve's upcoming system, providing a good preview of the performance the system is expected to offer (which is speculated to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-rely-amd-fsr-4k-60/">heavily rely on AMD FSR to deliver 4K resolution at 60 FPS gameplay</a>). Building this system with off-the-shelf parts (some of which offered nice-to-have features that didn't significantly impact performance), purchased at their lowest historical price, resulted in a total cost of $602.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Component Type</strong></td><td><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)">Componen</strong><strong>t</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)"> Name</strong></td><td><strong>Historical Lower Price</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>AMD Ryzen 5 8400F</td><td>$84</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Motherboard</strong></td><td>Asrock B650M-H M.2+</td><td>$100</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>Crucial (2x8) 16 GB 5600MT/s CL46</td><td>$44</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Case</strong></td><td>Player's Choice</td><td>$50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PSU</strong></td><td>Seasnoic GX-550 550W</td><td>$55</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>Asrock Challenger Radeon RX 6600</td><td>$175</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SSD</strong></td><td>Kingston NV3 500 GB</td><td>$38</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Controller</strong></td><td>Gamesir Cyclone 2</td><td>$56</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>On the other hand, if this system were to be built today under current market conditions, which are severely impacted by<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/memory-markets-have-entered-a-panic-buying-phase/"> memory shortages</a> that are already forcing companies such as <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpowerpc-announces-price-changes-for-its-gaming-pcs-due-to-higher-ram-and-ssd-prices/">CyberPowerPC to increase the prices of their gaming PC</a>s, the cost would rise to $900. Going for cheaper parts that would keep the system's performance as is, the cost would be $813.</p>



<p>However, since Valve benefits from a direct-to-consumer model that lets them retain both brand and retailer margins, the total cost of the system (unlikely to be below $600–$650) will ultimately be decided by the markup Valve targets</p>



<p>If market conditions don't change further, Linus estimates that the system may cost $699.99, as this price is above the company's current cost. As the Steam Machine will be on sale for years, there will be plenty of opportunities for the company to improve its margins.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The STEAM Machine Won't Cost What You Think" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iHkBcqW-ExY?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Although Linus' estimate sounds reasonable, based on the analysis, it's challenging to predict the Steam Machine's price accurately at this point. Valve has yet to confirm it, but has already stated that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/">it will be really competitive, and in line with the cost of building a PC with similar specs</a>, and that <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/">the system won't be subsidized</a>, meaning that the company is not going to sell it at a loss at launch - something other console makers like Sony and Microsoft have done in the past thanks to the 30% cut on games sales from their own digital stores, a cut Valve also takes from every game sold on Steam.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roborock Dumps 22,000Pa Robot Vacuum at Zero-Profit, Self-Emptying Tech Now at All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-dumps-22000pa-robot-vacuum-at-zero-profit-self-emptying-tech-now-at-all-time-low-2000648426</link>
            <guid>1367527</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cheap robot vacuums that bump randomly around rooms, miss entire areas and get stuck constantly serve no purpose beyond cluttering the market and disappointing <strong>buyers who conclude that robot vacuums fundamentally don’t work</strong>. These failures damage the category’s reputation while advanced models demonstrate what’s actually possible when engineering takes priority over cost-cutting that creates barely functional products.</p>
<p>The <strong>Roborock Saros 10R</strong> represents ultra-premium robot vacuum technology that handles everything, and it is now available at <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/">$999 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $1,599</a>. The $600 reduction brings this flagship model to pricing closer to Roborock’s mid-tier offerings before this sale, and makes the best autonomous cleaning accessible without the usual four-figure investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>3.14-Inch Ultra-Slim Design That Fits Everywhere</h2>
<p>The <strong>new slim 3.14-inch profile gets rid of the raised LiDAR towers</strong> that stop regular robot vacuums from getting under furniture with low clearance, where dust builds up without being disturbed. Cleaning beds, sofas, cabinets, and coffee tables is now possible instead of having to manually vacuum or let dust build up all the time.</p>



<p>The <strong>22,000Pa suction gives it cleaning power that rivals high-end upright vacuums</strong>&nbsp;and the robot itself is small and can move around on its own. This powerful suction pulls out pet hair that is stuck deep in carpet fibers that weaker robots can’t reach, lifts dirt that has been ground into tile grout lines, and picks up fine dust from hardwood floors in one pass without needing to clean again. The <em>DuoDivide</em> main brush and <em>FlexiArm</em> <em>Riser</em> side brush don’t get tangled up so they can handle hair up to 40 cm long without the problems that other robots have.</p>
<p>The <em>FlexiArm Riser</em> technology is the first of its kind in the industry: It lets <strong>both the side brush and the mop automatically reach corners and edges</strong> that fixed-position cleaning heads can’t get to. Watch the arm swing out when it gets close to baseboards. It cleans all the way up to the walls instead of leaving the one-inch dirt lines that regular robots leave along the edges.</p>



<p>The <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis has wheels that can be <strong>adjusted independently and can climb over things up to 4 cm high</strong> like door thresholds, thick rugs, and cable runs that stop regular robots from working without help. The system changes the height of each wheel based on the terrain, keeping the robot stable as it goes over obstacles that would tip or beach standard robots with fixed chassis heights.</p>
<p>The dock does all of the maintenance work such as removing the mop automatically for vacuum-only modes, washing the mop with 176°F hot water to get rid of tough stains, drying it with 131°F hot air to stop mildew, c<strong>ollecting dust automatically every 60 days</strong>, refilling the tank automatically, dispensing detergent automatically, and cleaning the hot water dock itself.</p>
<p>Roborock’s best technology costs $999 on Black Friday which is the lowest price ever and it saves you $600. Their mid-range models don’t have the ultra-slim design, <em>FlexiArm</em> extension, <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis, or full dock automation that their best models do. If you want to really get rid of manual floor cleaning with technology that works, this is the deal for you.</p>

              <p>Amazon is on a mission to make streaming easy for everyone with its compact, feature-packed devices, and the retailer is now letting you bring one home without paying the full price.</p>
<p>Black Friday kicks off tomorrow, but Amazon is already offering up to 50% off its top-rated entertainment gadgets, smart home devices, TVs, and more.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/"> The sale also brings the price of Amazon’s fastest-ever streaming media player — the Fire TV Cube — down to just $90.</a> That’s after a whopping 36% drop on the retail price of $140. Best of all, using the code ALEXAPLUS10 at checkout nets you another $10 discount in Amazon Credit with your purchase.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you have an older Fire TV device lying around, you can trade it in to get an additional 20% off your total, plus an Amazon gift card, making the purchase even sweeter. But just note that such offers tend to wrap up fast, so you don’t have a lot of time left to bag the discounts. If you have been looking to give your entertainment experience a boost, now is the time to make that happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Hands-Free Streaming</h2>
<p>The cube, in a way, blends the functionality of both a streaming stick and an Echo. It comes with a built-in HDMI input and features additional ports for you to connect other entertainment devices for a fuller setup.</p>
<p>The new octa-core 2.0 GHz processor at the center makes it twice as fast as the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, letting you launch apps and browse content within seconds. Support for Wi-Fi 6E translates into smoother 4K streaming with faster speeds, more bandwidth, and low latency, meaning you can search your favorite content fast, plus enjoy an uninterrupted, cinema-like viewing experience right from your couch. Visuals and sound don’t take a hit, either. 4K Ultra HD keeps picture quality lifelike, while Dolby Atmos Audio support puts the sound all around for a 3D experience. Super Resolution Upscaling makes it easy to convert an HD picture to 4K for better detail, so all your favorite classics are going to come to life, as well.</p>



<p>Navigating around is made easy with voice control. Not in the mood to press some buttons? Just ask Alexa to do it for you. You can find movies by actor, plot, and even iconic quotes. Just say something like “Alexa, show me the latest Christmas movies” or “Alexa, show me crime thrillers with unexpected endings”, and it’s going to pull every relevant title up in no time. Entertainment options come built right in, as well. The cube lets you stream more than 1.8 million movies and TV episodes. You’ll have all your favorite streaming platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more) in a single place. It even doubles as a speaker when you’re in the mood to listen to some songs in the background as you finish house chores.</p>
<p>Setting everything up couldn’t be easier. Simply connect the Fire TV Cube to your TV’s HDMI port, and then your WiFi. Follow the on-screen prompts to finish the process; as simple as that. If you have speakers around, it’s recommended to place the cube at least 1 to 2 feet away from them to avoid interference. The device also comes with early access to Alexa+, which is an advanced, more sophisticated version of the OG Alexa. It communicates better, understands context well, and can remember information from previous parts of a conversation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Thanks to Black Friday, the Fire TV Cube is now sitting at just $90, plus there are additional offers you can take advantage of to maximize your savings.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Anti-Cheat Has Blocked 2.4 Million Cheat Attempts]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-million-attempts/</link>
            <guid>1367518</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent article published by the Electronic Arts teams behind Battlefield 6, it was revealed that a staggering 2.4 <strong>million </strong>cheat attempts have been blocked by EA’s Javelin anti-cheat system since the game came out on October 10. It was additionally noted that, in the week after launch, <strong>98% of matches </strong>were ‘fair and free of cheater impacts.’</p>



<p>This is only just the beginning for Javelin. It was stressed that Electronic Arts is shaping up to deal with this ‘war on cheating’ in an evolutionary way, and has several steps lined up to combat wrongdoers.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-anti-cheat-is-making-waves">Battlefield 6’s Anti-Cheat is Making Waves</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, it was revealed that <strong>2.4 million cheat attempts </strong>were actively blocked by EA’s Javelin engine, an anti-cheat solution that keeps Battlefield 6 free from abusive operators. To put some numbers into perspective, it was also noted that, during the open beta alone, a whopping <strong>1.2 million </strong>cheat attempts were closed down.</p>



<p>People just won’t give up.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1994436727516107251">team wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are presently aware of, and have multiple detections for, <strong>190 cheat related programs, hardware, vendors, and resellers and their communities</strong>. Since launch <strong>183 of them (96.3%) have announced feature failures, detection notices, downtime, and/or taken their cheats offline entirely</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This phenomenal effort by Electronic Arts is set to expand with several key initiatives being lined up:</p>



<ul>
<li>Explore Additional OS Security Features</li>



<li>Enforce Against Cheating Hardware</li>



<li>Improving Reporting Flows</li>



<li>Improving Internal Operations Tools</li>



<li>‘Classified’</li>
</ul>



<p>That final note is legitimately taken from the document. Some things are being kept under wraps to avoid ‘tipping off’ the cheat manufacturers as to what’s coming next:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have multiple teams working on various new anti-cheat features and detections across our multi-layered suite of tools across Javelin, the game client, server, and beyond coming online as fast as we can get them ready. As soon as any of these new ways of delivering ban hammers are fully tested and ready we’ll share more but for now we don’t want to tip our hand to any bad-actors looking to ruin your game experience.</p>
</blockquote>

            <guid>1367515</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">30 years ago, LEGO made its tentative first step beyond physical toys with the launch of Fun to Build, a Japanese-only game for the largely forgotten Sega Pico console. Three decades later, the mighty LEGO brand's video game ambitions are now a diverse empire all of its own, a set of digital experiences designed to cater to diverse and tastes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for good reason — because as anyone who follows video games knows, the industry's growth has also come alongside massive change, including an ongoing shift in how players access and own games — and a generational difference in why they're so important.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For many, the idea of a LEGO video game is something still synonymous with the prolific output of TT Games, the British development studio behind dozens of licensed titles featuring blockbuster franchises like Star Wars, Batman, and Harry Potter. But the LEGO brand now adorns numerous other experiences from other established creators, such as the recent Annapurna-published LEGO Voyagers, or the Nintendo-like LEGO Party. And then there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-fortnite-odyssey">LEGO Fortnite</a> — but more on that in a moment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to the bosses of LEGO's sprawling gaming portfolio, the company's new SVP of LEGO Game, Fredrik Löving, and its veteran Head of Product, Kari Vinther Nielsen, its clear the company knows the world of video games has already changed — and will continue to do so, as a younger generation raised on the likes of Minecraft, Roblox and Fortnite — LEGO's key audience demographic — seeks connected social experiences on a wider range of platforms. At the same time, however, the brand knows it must still cater to more traditional gamers as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Really understanding today's kids is just always the most important thing," Löving says. "There's been a big shift in gaming and we all know it, we have all seen it. Games mean something different for the generation growing up today than it did for me. When I grew up on my Amiga 500, I was escaping into a world, I was escaping into a screen and I was playing these games with a very set objective. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The primary objective today for kids growing up is to find an activity to do in a social space together with their friends. Secondarily, it's whatever the activity actually is around it." It's an observation that rings especially true following the huge spike in players this summer for games such as Grow a Garden and Steal the Brainrot, experiences that helped smash engagement records on Roblox — a social gaming platform that LEGO has so far steered clear of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The gamers are very fundamentally different," Löving continues. So, where does that leave LEGO?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">We Build LEGO Star Wars Gingerbread AT-AT</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was very lucky to work on LEGO Worlds," Nielsen recalls, a LEGO-y sandbox game that let players build intricate models using digital blocks. While successful enough, it was a product of its time — and despite the LEGO branding, it never seemed to trouble the already-dominant Minecraft, the game it was frequently most compared to. Still, its ambitions were clear. "That for me was a testament of what the physical brick was in a digital space," Nielsen continues. "We had fans creating models, creating worlds, creating stories, and I think that's really the power of digital play where you can create and share in different ways versus what you can in the physical world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After working at LEGO for over a decade, Nielsen said the conversations she had working on the idea for Worlds remain "the same stories and the same things we talk about" today. "We need to mix IPs, we need to figure out what's the digital version of the physical expression. What's the real true game version of that? I don't think the conversations have changed a lot," she continued. "It's more about actually adapting to how kids play today and being open-minded about how you diversify play, how you become inclusive so that you make the right type of play for kids in the world they live in. I think that's where we've moved a lot through the last couple of years actually.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Kids really use video games as a way to stay social and a place where can they meet up with their friends," Nielsen continues, echoing Löving's earlier words. "Of course we want to show up in safe and positive ways, but I think that just speaks to the type of games and the type of play we really need to serve as the LEGO brand. It's not about only having one version that fits for gamers, it's about having a diverse portfolio, for different play needs and different moments."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an approach that LEGO has demonstrated over the past few months, launching the Mario Party-esque LEGO Party to foster cross-generational multiplayer, the same month as indie puzzle platformer LEGO Voyagers. "LEGO Party, that's really where I want to play with my friends or with my family," Nielsen notes. "LEGO Voyagers meanwhile, was a test of my relationship, I'm not going to lie. There was a little bit of 'go away, this is me playing now.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's LEGO Fortnite, which continues to evolve week by week. Its hard to gauge the current level of its overall success versus expectations, especially when comparing it to something like Grow a Garden's viral popularity. But its most substantial offering, LEGO Fortnite Odyssey, remains an evergreen hit and will soon receive its next big update (which fans expect will add characters from the hugely popular Ninjago franchise). Role-playing sim option LEGO Brick Life, meanwhile, enjoys a smaller audience, though is currently hosting a big The Simpsons takeover. And a core attraction for LEGO here remains the ability for players to build and make their own mini-games — something which should only become easier to do and more advanced in potential over time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">LEGO Fortnite</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"My daughter loves the universe, the characters, the stories, the narrative," Nielsen says of LEGO Fortnite's modes. "We're starting to really grow and expand the opportunity for creators to make their favorite LEGO game, to tell their stories through gaming. It's still early days actually in that space," she continues. "It's not that we haven't had digital building or digital creation in our portfolio for the past 30 years, but the world around it has changed, as has the platforms and the pace of creation. When Fred joined, we had this sort of [joke] like, 'You've been used to making a game and it takes five years, I can do what you do and do that in four hours instead.'" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While that may not be true — yet — of something that looks as polished as TT Games' upcoming LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, some of LEGO's earlier output could certainly be recreated in Fortnite today, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-island">LEGO Island</a>, the brand's second video game (and its first real digital hit). "It's just a different reality of making experiences and testing new things and trying them out in a way faster engine with the right partner, with the right creators," Nielsen says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And going back to what I mentioned around really understanding gamers of today," Löving adds. "Co-creation, agency, all the things that you just mentioned. They are becoming very quickly, if not already, table stakes for a lot of experiences out there, especially the big platforms."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that said, LEGO's more traditional gaming experiences are also not fully going away — as next year's arival of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight proves. It was one of this year's biggest and best-received gaming reveals, and was recently shown to a hugely positive reception during Gamescom 2025. For LEGO, experiences like it is set to provide also remain a cruical part of its brand offering. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I passed down Star Wars to my son through a Lego game, Skywalker saga," Löving said. "That is a lot for a dad, to actually have that experience together with your son — not just playing together but passing down a fandom, enabled through the fact that it's a LEGO game. Even before I joined the company, I was just inspired to see, 'how do we even dial that up? How can we do that and really make it intergenerational play?'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our brand stands for a lot of things and I think in some moments you're really diving in and you're immersing yourself in like a six-hour session," Nielsen affirms. "I play legacy board games, I know it's going to take a long time. I'm invested, and it's even better if I can actually play along or couch co-op with some of my friends or family members. That's fantastic and I think that's what TT Games does so well."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Cosmetics</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As LEGO enters its fourth decade in the digital space, the company clearly has ambitions that range beyond simple, static plastic. Ever since it dipped its toe into the world of simple robotics with MindStorms, through to its much more recently interactivitiy melded into LEGO Super Mario bricks, its clear the company is keen to experiment with what's possible with play. LEGO Dimensions, the brand's experiment in the toys-to-life category, was another example of that — and with its focus on IP mashups and adventure, could be seen as a precursor to LEGO Fortnite today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the day, though, Nielsen says it's all about finding the right kind of play for the right audience. "Sometimes there's a time for a game and then you can almost take that game and bring it into the now — or to the future with different flavors and twists," she says. "It's no different than what is our LEGO version of Darth Vader or Batman. I think there's something generational to it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Sylux will save you some time.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a long wait, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is finally coming to Switch 1 and Switch 2 on December 4. Nintendo recently revealed exactly what each of its Metroid Prime amiibo figures will allow you to do in the game — ranging from customizing Samus’s new ride to letting you unlock a secret movie without having to 100% the in-game collectables.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is releasing three new amiibo figures for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond — namely Samus Aran herself, Samus riding the Vi-O-La motorbike, and bounty hunter antagonist Sylux. According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/hardware/amiibo/game/bgw5a_2/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>announcement</u></a> on Nintendo’s official Japanese website, the three Metroid Prime 4 amiibos will let you do different things with the game — with Sylux’s greatly lowering the threshold for what you need to do to unlock a secret movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Basically, the Sylux amiibo will allow players to view a special movie straight after beating the game’s main story. The movie will apparently be an edited-together cutscene of fragmented clips featuring the bounty hunter that play during your journey through Metroid Prime 4: Beyond’s story. It seems that watching the special movie will likely help players further understand Sylux’s motivations. Sylux has always been a bit of a mysterious antagonist and hopefully Metroid Prime 4 will shed more light on Sylux’s backstory and his apparent hatred of the Galactic Federation and Samus. As an added bonus, Sylux will say a random line of his dialogue each time you touch his amiibo to your Switch console.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t fancy forking out the money for the Sylux amiibo ($29.99) or would much rather put in the hard work yourself, then the special movie can also be unlocked by achieving a 100% scan rate and finding every single item in the game (so get ready to have guides and checklists on hand).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Metroid Prime 4 Samus and Vi-O-La amiibo features the tough protagonist astride her brand-new, high-tech motorbike, Vi-O-La. Making its debut in Metroid Prime 4, Vi-O-La will allow Samus to speedily travel around the vast planet of Viewros. Therefore it comes as no surprise that the amiibo gives you several Vi-O-La related benefits. The Samus and Vi-O-La amiibo lets you quickly replenish your bike’s boost energy once per day, as well as allowing you to change the motorbike’s color. Touching the amiibo will tell you the distance you have travelled on the Vi-O-La.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Metroid Prime 4 Samus amiibo lets you do a couple of things. Once a day, you can activate a handy shield that will not only restore Samus’s life but also blocks up to 99 damage. As an added bonus, you can use the Samus amiibo to change the music when riding the Vi-O-La across Sol Valley, Viewros’ vast desert. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/28/81ygnbuotrl-ac-sl1500-1764345325988.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo Sylux for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you happen to have any older Metroid-related amiibo lying around, you can also use these with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Although not as exciting as Sylux’s movie unlock, the following Super Smash Bros. amiibo will play a random sound from Metroid Prime 4 when touched: Samus, Zero Suit Samus, Dark Samus, and Ridley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Metroid Prime got a remake in 2023, Metroid Prime 4 is the first new numbered entry in the Prime series of Metroid FPS’s since Metroid Prime 3: Corruption on the Wii back in 2016. Players will step into the boots of Samus Aran — this time responding to a distress call from the Galactic Federation, which will see her explore the mysterious and unknown planet of Viewros.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Snap these games up before the deals disappear for good.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new batch of discounted games has just landed in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-black-friday-2025-best-deals">PlayStation's 2025 Black Friday sale</a>. Now these newbies are pure-breed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-sales-2025-best-deals">Black Friday</a>, cream of the crop, proper pick em' up before they never appear again kind of deals. Honestly, they remind me of Black Friday sales from five years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To make sense of the chaos, the deals are split into two buckets: the fresh 2025 heavy hitters and the rest of the essential PS5 releases from the console's almost five-year run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, my top picks are from the 2025 bin, with <a href="https://zdcs.link/921V1e?object_uuid=319bf7fb-a587-4d4a-b2e5-bf23732439e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Borderlands 4</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKqw0E?object_uuid=319bf7fb-a587-4d4a-b2e5-bf23732439e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Battlefield 6 dropping to just $35</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbMEOE?object_uuid=319bf7fb-a587-4d4a-b2e5-bf23732439e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> hitting $30. Let's see what else is up for grabs as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2025 PS5 Games on Sale for Black Friday</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">For the uninitiated, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday deals</a> tend to go live a week early these days, so while Black Friday isn't until Nov. 28, we've already got all the best discounts on PS5 games to check out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I mentioned, there's also my top picks in the sale like MGS Snake Eater remake for just $30. That's $20 better than its sale price from last week, and a similar tune is being sung for both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-black-friday-deal-2025-updated">Battlefield 6</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-black-friday-deal-2025">Borderlands 4</a> as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other standout offers include more of my personal favorites from 2025, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-just-got-its-first-big-discount-for-black-friday">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds </a>and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-just-hit-a-new-low-price-in-amazon-black-friday-deals">Assassin's Creed Shadows for just $30</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these were previously discounted in "the sales", but have since dropped even further to what can only be described as <em>proper Black Friday </em>deals. Non of that 5% off nonsense, try 50% off on <strong>new PS5 games. </strong>Now that's more like it!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More PS5 Game Deals for Black Friday</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first party PlayStation cuts are actually worth paying attention to this year, especially the newer releases. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9ZMJWn?object_uuid=319bf7fb-a587-4d4a-b2e5-bf23732439e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Astro Bot</a>, the reigning Game of the Year 2024 winner, is sitting at $39.99 and absolutely justifies it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If youre after more, Helldivers 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-ps5-deal-black-friday-2025">Spider-Man 2</a>, and both The Last of Us games are locked in at $29.99. Stellar Blade sits at $39.99, and Horizon Forbidden West hits a frankly ridiculous $19.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walmart has also lobbed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-is-under-20-again-and-nightreign-has-a-big-discount-too-for-black-friday">Elden Ring</a> and Star Wars Outlaws into the mix at $15 a pop in a fresh round of discounts that just landed. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">PS5 Digital Game Deals and More</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I've barely scratched the surface across the sales as well, as there's even more games to check out between now and Black Friday, including a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history">2025 Game of the Year</a> nominee, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6DxVj?object_uuid=319bf7fb-a587-4d4a-b2e5-bf23732439e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Death Stranding 2, for $49.69</a>. That's $20 off, and matches the best deal on the game so far this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, Battlefield 6 is a significally better deal when buying a physical copy ($35 vs $59.49), while where as some games like Death Stranding 2 are just a tiny bit cheaper digitally ($49.69 vs $49.99). So, sometimes it comes in handy to have a <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXVG0R?object_uuid=319bf7fb-a587-4d4a-b2e5-bf23732439e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">disc drive</a> (I'm looking at you, PS5 Pro owners).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other heavy hitters in the PlayStation 2025 Black Friday sale include <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8WMY?object_uuid=319bf7fb-a587-4d4a-b2e5-bf23732439e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$100 off PS5 consoles</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8Omr?object_uuid=319bf7fb-a587-4d4a-b2e5-bf23732439e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation VR2 bundles</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxx1gx?object_uuid=319bf7fb-a587-4d4a-b2e5-bf23732439e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$20 off DualSense controllers</a> and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGrn48?object_uuid=319bf7fb-a587-4d4a-b2e5-bf23732439e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Portal</a>, and up to 33 percent off PlayStation Plus memberships.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And thats barely scratching the surface. There are loads more PS5 games discounted that didnt make the shortlist here, so it’s worth digging through the full sales pages at retailers like <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJro0q?object_uuid=319bf7fb-a587-4d4a-b2e5-bf23732439e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> if you want the complete picture.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You might have already seen my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-best-games-under-20-dollars-2025">$20 or less roundup</a>, which is still packed with heavy hitters from the last few years and perfect if you want maximum bang for your buck.
