            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-gta-lead-everywhere-beta<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>lead Leslie Benzies and his studio Build a Rocket Boys have announced an&nbsp;<em>Everywhere&nbsp;</em>beta test, potentially giving you a chance to test out the hugely ambitious sandbox project.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://everywhere.game/news/welcome-builders-beta" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Everywhere&nbsp;</em>website, the beta will begin on June 18th and will revolve around ARCADIA, which is&nbsp;<em>Everywhere</em>'s system for building and publishing games (and not the malevolent AI overmind it sounds like).</p>
<p>According to Build a Rocket Boys, you'll be able to create everything from "a massive boss fight" through to "a level complete with enemies and puzzles" and share it via ARCADIA without needing any coding knowledge.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/everywhere-beta-test-builder.jpg?itok=oON8SAXE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/everywhere-beta-test-builder.jpg?itok=MkEXeY8Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Everywhere&nbsp;</em>promises to let you build your own games with no coding knowledge.</figcaption></figure><p>While the so-called Builders Beta will let you loose on ARCADIA, there are certain things it won't offer a chance to look at, like Biomes and "a few locations in Utropia".</p>
<p>According to the devs, this is in order to focus on testing&nbsp;<em>Everywhere</em>'s no-code-required tools for building games and making them ready for future testing phases.</p>
<p>The devs also say they've made a number of improvements to&nbsp;<em>Everywhere&nbsp;</em>since its alpha test in November, which took place following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everywhere-gameplay-footage">first "gameplay" footage</a> of the sandbox tool being released.</p>
<p>These improvements include new ARCADIA tools and tips, "significantly reduced" loading times between launch and play, and an improved first-time user experience, so if you did take part in the alpha, you'll likely still find a transformed experience this time around.</p>

<p>If you want to gain access to the&nbsp;<em>Everywhere&nbsp;</em>beta, you'll need to create a Build a Rocket Boys account for yourself, which <a href="https://account.buildarocketboy.com/create-account" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can do here</a>. Build a Rocket Boys says it recommends "completing the 'Where do you Like to Build' form" that appears towards the end of account creation.</p>
<p>The devs say you'll have a much nicer experience with the game if you can meet the following PC specs (it's not a requirement, but Build a Rocket Boys says it "cannot guarantee a smooth session" otherwise).</p>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-12700 or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 or AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
<li>50GB SSD space</li>
</ul><p>Bear in mind that these specs are intended to target 1080p resolution and a 30fps frame rate, so if you want to get higher than that, you'll need a pretty beefy machine.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Everywhere&nbsp;</em>beta starts on PC on June 18th. Applicants will be invited in waves, so if you don't immediately get invited, don't lose hope; you may still get a chance to try the "game" out.</p>

Layoffs, studio closures, and Xbox exclusives coming to PS5 had fans worried about the future of the platform, but Sunday’s showcase put many of those fears to rest.</p><p>Xbox chief Phil Spencer kicked off the show with <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> —&nbsp;cementing that Xbox is now the home of <em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;— before moving on to new reveals and gameplay. Three titles stood out for me personally: <em>Perfect Dark</em>; <em>Fable</em>; and <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>.</p><p>Last week, I revealed most of the first-party games that would be part of this showcase, but one I didn’t name was <em>Perfect Dark</em>. Reports had suggested it was in “rough shape.” I hadn’t heard about a potential release window, so I wasn’t sure exactly what would be presented during the showcase. The surprise three-minute <em>Perfect Dark</em> trailer didn’t hold back on gameplay, showing movement and visuals that looked super polished and far from rough. Sure, it was just a trailer, and we still don’t have a release date or a release window after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168766/perfect-dark-microsoft-the-initiative-game-reveal">nearly four years</a>. But it certainly looks like the game is shaping up well.</p><p>In last week’s <em>Notepad</em>, I also said I was expecting to see more of <em>Fable </em>and a 2025 release window, and Microsoft delivered exactly that. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173655/xbox-fable-game-release-date-2025-trailer">latest <em>Fable</em> trailer</a> included Matt King, more widely recognized as Super Hans from one of the best British comedy shows of all time: <em>Peep Show</em>. King plays the hero Humphry, who will be forced out of retirement to take on a mysterious enemy.</p><p>King’s appearance had me smiling from the start, alongside the subtle sarcasm and British humor throughout. <em>Fable</em>’s developer, Playground Games, is best known for the <em>Forza Horizon </em>series that always pushes the visual limits of the Xbox hardware, and it looks like it’s going to do the same here. Sources tell me Microsoft is currently targeting <em>Fable</em> to release between...</p><div>

  <p id="Q2SJ3X">In the season premiere of <em>The Boys </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23984773/the-boys-season-4-trailer-2024-prime-video-release">season 4</a>, The Seven have some choices to make. After the events of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23150171/the-boys-season-3-review-amazon">season 3</a>, there are <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23200353/the-boys-season-3-ending-finale-explained">openings on the team</a>, and a whole lot of candidates to choose from.</p>
<p id="Tt8Pe2">As Homelander, A-Train, The Deep, and (replacement) Black Noir look on, Vought’s Ashley Barrett presents 25 options for them to choose from. Ultimately, the team goes with two new original characters for the show — Sister Sage and Firecracker. </p>

<p id="7FlVYF">We’re not going to go too much into them, because you’ll meet them this season. Instead, let’s meet the rejects.</p>
<p id="ZJRF6G">A few have slides pulled onto the screen with (occasionally quite funny) details, like past credits on Vought TV shows and movies, but the rest of the 25 candidates are just listed by name. We’ve dug into the comics a bit to give you more info on those, since their names being mentioned on the show confirms their existence in the show’s universe. We’ve organized them by in-universe team affiliation, since some are listed.</p>

She has “retractable carbon steel nail plates,” and her other listed skills are “lock picking,” “acrobatics” (which she likely picked up in her training at the Cirque du Vought Academy), and “1/8 Navajo.” She appeared in Tek Knight’s <em>Heat of the Knight</em>, and a bunch of pilots that weren’t ordered: <em>Claws of Justice</em>, <em>Talon: Night Huntress</em>, <em>C.L.A.W.S.</em>, and <em>Claw Force</em>.</p>

<p id="uhYTlC">Runner-up on season 15 of <em>Vought’s Next Top Supermodel </em>and runner-up (to Homelander) for Sexiest Supe Alive, Hyperion is rejected by Ashley for being a “slutty cumrag.” (Her words! Don’t shoot the messenger.) Her resume boasts appearances on <em>2 Hot 2 Handle</em>, <em>Street Heat</em>, <em>Dirty Diaries: Reno</em>, and <em>Dirty Diaries: Mazatlan</em>. Her special skills are super intuition, divine femininity, and fireproof hair.</p>
<p id="lV30CS">As far as I can tell, she is an original character for the show and does not appear in the comics, but the show does identify her as a member of the Teenage Kix, a parody of youth-focused teams like the Teen Titans and Young Avengers that A-Train previously belonged to.</p>

<p id="SDTJkW">A dog-themed parody of Beast Boy, the decidedly human Dogknott looks very different from the version of him in the comics, who is more of a dog-human hybrid. </p>
<p id="PdewOo">Ashley’s slide notes Dogknott, from Portland, can summon “feral canines” to his aid. Are these random feral canines in the area, or feral canines he can create? Your guess is as good as mine. But his other skills include canine telepathy, cancer detection, super hearing, night vision, and, of course, “hates fireworks.”</p>
<p id="QuEzYD">His past credits include the reality series <em>Poundtown with Dogknott</em>, the <em>Doggie’s Home </em>Voughtkids movie franchise, the <em>Voughtland Animal Stunt Show</em>, and a cable access series called <em>Animal Husbandry for Fun and Profit</em>. He was also trained at Julius Rome’s Obedience School.</p>
<p id="1nUvjL">A-Train objects to this one, saying “Hold up, I thought he ate a dog.” The Deep, himself no stranger to bestiality, solemnly replies, “He ate <em>out </em>a dog. It’s a big difference.”</p>
<p id="fkYaEC">In the comics, he is also a member of the Teenage Kix.</p>

<p id="Y8DuZ5">We briefly see Ashley’s slide for this “Texas nutjob,” as she calls him, but it’s out of focus so the text is illegible. Ashley also notes Vought’s San Antonio office had to cover up “those migrant murders” for him. This character seems to be an original to the show.</p>
<p id="2i8eOC">From here on out, we’re just going off of the names on the long list, but some have appeared in the show.</p>

I walked away with a mix of positive and negative reactions, but my perspective on the game has only soured with time. One thing’s for sure, the game that launched on September 6, 2023 is not the <em>Starfield</em> experience I probably want to have again. But using this enormous galaxy as a giant sci-fi exploration sandbox? Well, that might just be tempting enough for me to invest another run of evenings.

<p data-characters="485" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Given that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-destiny-2-raids-in-release-order-listed/"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s Raids are its pinnacle-level content</a>, featuring both mechanical and statistical difficulties, it is fairly self-evident that Raid bosses, too, ought to be equally impressive in more ways than not. Challenging, imposing, and memorable, Raid bosses are supposed to serve as the final obstacle to loot and other assorted goodies, but is that always the case? Or have&nbsp;<em>some</em> Raid bosses become overhyped Strike targets rather than top-end world-ending threats?</p> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">While we don’t aim to make any of the following&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em> Raid bosses seem like outright pushovers, one could easily argue that that’s precisely what some of them are. Which ones are actually, genuinely compelling, though? Which ones can be taken down by less than a full fireteam of Guardians? Let’s try and rank them all based on how hard they are to take down!</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Grading Final Destiny 2 Raid bosses based on how difficult they are</h2> <figure id="attachment_403370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-403370" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-403370">Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">#14: Argos, Planetary Core</h3> <p data-characters="588" data-current-count="970" data-injectable="true">Though Argos was, at its core, an oversized Vex Hydra, it was a fun and lightweight boss encounter at the end of the Eater of Worlds Raid Lair. The boss fight consisted of two main phases: the one where Argos is shielded behind Arc, Solar, and Void crystals, and the one where it actively engaged the Guardians in combat. Though the fight certainly was challenging on day one, by the time the&nbsp;<em>Forsaken</em> DLC rolled in, Guardians were already well-equipped to handle Argos easily, and its simple mechanics meant that it couldn’t pose much of a challenge compared to other Raid bosses.</p>
 <figure id="attachment_403372" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-403372" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-403372">Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">#13: Emperor Calus</h3> <p data-characters="495" data-current-count="495" data-injectable="true">The very first full-fledged&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em> Raid boss was the dethroned Cabal emperor, Calus. Or, rather, a robotic replica of Calus. Much like Argos, this boss was a pushover in practice, but it was a bit more difficult due to the encounter forcing players into two teams with disparate mechanics: one team had to read symbols, while others had to activate them in a wholly different dimension, where Calus’s mental projection tried to take them down. Fun stuff, but not very difficult at all!</p>
 <figure id="attachment_403374" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-403374" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-403374">Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">#12: Taniks, the Abomination</h3> <p data-characters="554" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">A legendary figure in the&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em> universe, it was perhaps inevitable that Taniks would end up a Raid boss in his own right. Having rejigged a massive Eliksni Shank into a nuclear hover tank platform – which, yes, does sound suspiciously akin to an actual Metal Gear machine – Taniks will quickly punish inexperienced Raid teams with a wipe if things go awry. Yet, the Abomination is a fun and engaging encounter where everyone gets a role and does something to help their team, which is more than could be said about some other Raid bosses.</p>
 <figure id="attachment_403376" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-403376" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-403376">Image via Tobias Kwan</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">#11: Nezarec, Final God of Pain</h3> <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">Once your Raid team gets to the bottom of his mechanics, Nezarec ends up one of&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s easiest Raid bosses by far. The boss fight itself was only ever challenging while Challenge Mode was active, to begin with, and it’s entirely possible for just three players to wrap the encounter up without too much hassle. This means Nezarec can’t really hold a candle to some of&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s more imposing Raid bosses, but it’s still a fun and engaging encounter, even if there aren’t enough mechanics for everyone to get wrapped up in.</p>
 <figure id="attachment_403377" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-403377" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-403377">Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">#10: Atheon, Time’s Conflux</h3> <p data-characters="617" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">The infamous final boss of the Vault of Glass&nbsp;raid returns anew in&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, and it’s not as much of a weakling as some might’ve expected it to be! Atheon is a tough, punishing boss that becomes delightfully easy as soon as your Raid team figures out all the right callouts and combat roles. Due to the randomized nature of Atheon’s main fight mechanic – the temporal teleportation – each member of your fireteam needs to have a handle on every part of the encounter, but it’s still not a big deal to come to grips with it all. Until that happens, mind, it’s wipe-o-clock.</p>
  <figure id="attachment_403385" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-403385" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-403385">Image via Roderick Weise</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">#9: Insurrection Prime, Kell’s Scourge</h3> <p data-characters="684" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">The final encounter of the now-sunset Scourge of the Past raid was Insurrection Prime, a Brig/Servitor hybrid equipped with Black Armory weaponry. Its end goal was even loftier still, lore-wise, as it was supposed to activate a nuclear bomb within the walls of the Last City. Its boss fight was appropriately epic, with players needing to spawn in actual tanks to whittle the mech down so that it could be properly damaged. The fight was the most challenging part of Scourge itself, as its many interlocking mechanics meant everyone had something to do at any given point during the encounter, but since the whole raid was fairly quick and easy, that’s not saying all that much.</p>
 <figure id="attachment_403386" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-403386" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-403386">Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">#8: Oryx, the Taken King</h3> <p data-characters="536" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">The Taken King is no slouch in&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, as it turns out. The Hive god’s massive size in the raid underlines his importance as a foe, and though he does come with a number of gameplay mechanics that players must figure out to be able to damage him, Oryx is far from the game’s toughest Raid boss. Instead, players will discover that the fight itself is reasonably fun and challenging, and as soon as the fireteam members settle into their roles and learn the proper callouts, the whole encounter becomes a bit of a breeze.</p>
 <figure id="attachment_403368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-403368" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-403368">Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">#7: Crota, Son of Oryx</h3> <p data-characters="505" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">The legendary and revered Son of Oryx returns triumphantly as one of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s more difficult and compelling boss encounters. With Crota’s End back in the active Raid rotation, Guardians must contend with a rather hard-hitting boss with a substantial health pool. In other words, the margin for error is small when dealing with Crota, and the boss fight is a tad punishing until all members of the active fireteam know precisely what to do and how to avoid his attacks and the wipe mechanic.</p>
 <figure id="attachment_403387" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-403387" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-403387">Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">#6: Val Ca’uor</h3> <p data-characters="617" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">Though the Spire of Stars Raid Lair has now been sunset, veteran&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em> players may recall just how strangely complex the Val Ca’uor boss fight was back in the day. This may well be the most mechanics-heavy Raid boss&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s ever had, with players having to go through seven different gameplay stages before finally opening Ca’uor up to take damage. Relying on gameplay mechanics to such an extent was quite novel back during&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s first year of content, which meant that Val Ca’uor blindsided many players who expected to see something along the lines of Argos, instead.</p>
 <figure id="attachment_403389" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-403389" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-403389">Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">#5: Gahlran, the Sorrow-Bearer</h3> <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true">Gahlran was one of the most difficult Raid bosses in&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em> due to the players needing to juggle several different buffs and debuffs during the fight. On top of that, juggling status effects wasn’t enough on its own, but players had to carefully time their switches so that everyone could pull their weight during the fight. Gahlran could also spawn Deceptions that players had to take down before damaging the monster itself, adding extra layers to a challenging fight.</p>
 <figure id="attachment_403390" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-403390" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-403390">Image via Tobias Kwan</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">#4: Rhulk, Disciple of the Witness</h3> <p data-characters="521" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">Rhulk is, to this day, one of the best Raid boss fights&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s ever had. Dynamic, engaging, and tense in all the right ways, the Rhulk fight stands out from most others simply because it features a boss that moves around the arena and will easily one-shot players silly enough not to evade his attacks. The mechanics of the encounter aren’t overly complex, granted, but the grand finale of the Vow of the Disciple Raid will quickly wipe out a fireteam that doesn’t take the fight seriously enough.</p>
 <figure id="attachment_525579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-525579" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-525579">Screenshot via Destiny 2 YouTube</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">#3: The Witness</h3> <p data-characters="831" data-current-count="831" data-injectable="true">It <em>finally</em> happened: the Guardians have taken the Witness down for good through not one, not two, but <em>three</em> final encounters with the creature. First, you damage the Witness in the campaign, then you damage it <em>more</em> as part of the final Raid encounter, and then you kill it proper through the unique post-Raid 12-man matchmade Excision game mode. Great fun, that! The second-to-last fight with the Witness as part of the Salvation’s Edge Raid is no less impressive, though, and though it’s not necessarily the <em>hardest</em> fight in the entire franchise’s Raid history, it is definitely going to keep you on your toes. Especially during the damage phase, mind: conceptually the fight is similar to that with Rhulk, but way, <em>way</em> more aggressively paced and somewhat time-constrained. The Witness deserved no less, I feel!</p>
 <figure id="attachment_403391" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-403391" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-403391">Image via Lawrence Rusty Durbin</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">#2: Riven of a Thousand Voices</h3> <p data-characters="693" data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true">Some would argue that the Guardians’ clash with Riven is <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s most difficult Raid boss fight, and the curious bit is that they wouldn’t necessarily be wrong. The fight itself – as Bungie designed it – leaves virtually no room for error when the going gets tough, and the legendary wish dragon will easily rampage through the fireteam if the opportunity shows. It’s great fun, too, and may be one of Bungie’s best boss fights&nbsp;<em>ever</em>. What scuttles Riven from spot #1 to spot #2 is that the vast majority of fireteams will cheese the fight in its entirety, ignoring key gameplay mechanics by simply targeting Riven’s legs with melee weapons.</p>
 <figure id="attachment_403392" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-403392" data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-403392">Image via Roderick Weise</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">#1: The Sanctified Mind</h3> <p data-characters="653" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">The Sanctified Mind of the Garden of Salvation Raid is, therefore, #1 difficulty-wise. The bit that elevates it beyond any other Raid final boss is that its mechanics are relatively complicated and remarkably fiddly, making it all too easy to mess up an entire damage phase’s worth of progression by being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Every single player needs to understand what’s going on with the Sanctified Mind at a given point in the encounter, and a misstep is more than enough to ruin the encounter. The complexity of the tether mechanics also lends itself to excessive bugs, making the whole thing that much more difficult.</p>
 <p data-characters="757" data-current-count="757" data-injectable="false">That summarizes all of&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s Raid boss encounters at the time of writing! Bungie’s got plenty more to offer over the coming months and years, of course, which means there’ll be more Raids and Raid bosses for us to rank against all the ones already featured on the list. To that end, you can expect consistent updates to this article as more&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em> content emerges. The next big Raid is expected to launch <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/new-destiny-2-interview-addresses-old-conspiracies-and-hopes-for-the-final-shape/">alongside the <em>Final Shape</em> DLC</a>, for example, early in 2024. It’s possible that The Witness will be the final Raid boss at the time, and if that ends up being the case, it’s going to be interesting to see whether the big bad of the Light and Dark saga will be more difficult than, say, Riven of a Thousand Voices!</p>

<p data-characters="243" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Fortnite</em> patches often add new and exciting content for players to enjoy, but they’ve been known to take things away too. Following the June 13 update, fans are wondering if Party Royale has been removed, and we’ve got the answer. </p> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-30-10-patch-notes-metallica-new-weapons-loot-island/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fortnite</em>‘s 30.10</a> update definitely introduced a lot of stuff, from the massive Metallica collaboration, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-ride-the-lightning-mythic-item-in-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ride the Lightning Mythic item</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-make-the-totem-of-return-in-lego-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new modes to <em>LEGO Fortnite</em></a>. Epic definitely gives, but they also take away, and that has been the case with the latest patch. </p> <figure data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Party Royale was chill. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-did-epic-remove-party-royale" data-injectable="false">Did Epic remove Party Royale?</h2> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false"><strong>Yes, Epic Games has removed Party Royale from <em>Fortnite</em>.</strong> The mode had been in the game since April 2020, but four years on, it is no more. As for why it’s gone, unfortunately, we don’t know that either. Epic didn’t even announce that the mode was gone, and we had to jump on for ourselves to check. </p> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">Worst of all, we don’t know if this is Epic removing it with a plan to update and improve it, or if it’s gone for good, never to be seen again. Epic says that anything they place in the vault always has a chance of returning, but just ask fans of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-players-are-begging-epic-to-bring-back-among-us-inspired-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Among Us-esque Impostors</a> mode how that’s gone. </p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Party Royale was a special place in <em>Fortnite</em>, ideal for those who found the battle royale mode a little too stressful. Here, players could hang out without the threat of elimination, watch movies or concerts by musical artists, and take part in fun mini-games with friends. The experimental space would change and evolve as seasons went by and had a dedicated fanbase who loved it. </p> <p data-characters="62" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="false">All we can do now is hope that Epic has plans for its return. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/13/direct-ps5-discord-integration-is-rolling-out-in-the-coming-weeks/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Popular online chat platform <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/discord">Discord</a> is being more closely integrated into the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> system software, allowing users to join Discord voice chats directly from their consoles without relying on mobile of PC apps. The functionality is being rolled out region-by-region in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The rollout is starting with Japan/Asia, followed by Europe, Australia/New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally the Americas. You will need to have the latest PS5 system software installed, and also link your PSN and Discord accounts together.</p>


<p>Once enabled, Discord will be found within the Game Base area of the PS5 system software, where you’ll see established voice chat channels on servers that you are joined up to, letting you hop straight in. You’ll also be able to have direct voice chats person-to-person.</p>
<p><iframe title="Join Discord voice chat directly on PlayStation 5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wJQehypOr5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a huge simplification over the previous process which requires users to join a voice chat by sending it to the console from your smartphone or PC app. That form of PS5 Discord integration was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/08/ps5-system-update-is-rolling-out-with-discord-chat-1440p-vrr-more/">available since last March</a>.</p>

<p>All of this means that PS5 gamers will be on a part with Xbox gamers, who have had direct Discord access <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/16/discord-voice-now-works-directly-on-your-xbox-without-a-phone/">since late 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Discord in general has become a go-to chat platform for gamers, and it’s a massive boon to have it integrated across all platforms to cater to cross-platform online gaming in particular. Of course, you can also just use it to hang out and chat with friends while playing different games or just relaxing and reading a book.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-review-bomb-relaunch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon's MMO&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>is being review bombed on Steam after a major relaunch for the game, which will also see it arriving on consoles, was announced last week.</p>
<p>One of the trailers we got to see <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-summer-game-fest-2024-announcement">during last week's Summer Game Fest showcase</a> was for&nbsp;<em>New World: Aeternum</em>, a relaunch of the original 2021 MMO that will also be arriving on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in October.</p>
<p><em>Aeternum&nbsp;</em>will offer a new raid and a new PvP zone, as well as a number of gameplay improvements including an increased gear score cap, combat tweaks, and "new cinematic storytelling".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/new-world-review-bomb-relaunch-pyramid.jpg?itok=P6mhNuAt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/new-world-review-bomb-relaunch-pyramid.jpg?itok=ufZJ-hxZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Aeternum&nbsp;</em>represents a significant relaunch for&nbsp;<em>New World</em>, but original PC players aren't happy.</figcaption></figure><p>If&nbsp;<em>New World</em>'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent reviews on Steam</a> are anything to go by, however, the game's community isn't happy with this relaunch announcement.</p>
<p>The game has garnered an Overwhelmingly Negative rating across 3,543 recent reviews at time of writing, although the overall review score is sitting at "Mixed".</p>
<p>Many recent reviews point to what players consider a neglectful attitude on the part of&nbsp;<em>New World</em>'s developers. One reviewer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198149652137/recommended/1063730/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">calls the game "abandonware"</a>, while another suggests Amazon was <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013117179/recommended/1063730/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">merely using PC players as alpha testers</a> for the console release.</p>
<p>Other players point to Amazon <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/dieeineurl/recommended/1063730/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">telling them to wait</a> until June for a big&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ggpenner/recommended/1063730/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>, only for that announcement to fall flat, and still more reviewers suggest the relationship between Amazon and its player base is a fractured one.</p>

<p>Others point to the fact that, as confirmed in <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/new-world-aeternum-community-qa" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a community Q&amp;A post</a>, players will need to buy&nbsp;<em>New World</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Angry Earth&nbsp;</em>expansion to "fully experience everything&nbsp;<em>New World: Aeternum&nbsp;</em>has to offer".</p>
<p>Some features, however, will be available to&nbsp;<em>New World&nbsp;</em>players who don't buy the expansion, including the revamped main questing experience, certain Expeditions, and quality-of-life updates.</p>
<p><em>New World&nbsp;</em>launched back in 2021, and to call its launch "rocky" would be an understatement. The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-breaking-new-world-invincibility-exploit-discovered">plagued</a> with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-hatchet-bug-gives-huge-damage-boost-to-players">several</a> game-breaking <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-gold-dupe-exploit-new-world-trading-disabled">glitches</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-bug-prevents-players-from-moving">bugs</a> for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-trading-disabled-another-economy-breaking-bug">weeks</a> after its launch, and that's all after the launch of the game was beset by huge <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-launch-500k-players-queue-times">queue times</a>; this isn't even&nbsp;<em>New World</em>'s first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-server-limit-causes-steam-review-bomb">Steam review bomb</a>.</p>
<p>For many, it seems that the fractious relationship between Amazon and its player base that formed during those uneasy early weeks was never fixed or resolved.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if the actual release of&nbsp;<em>Aeternum</em>&nbsp;changes anyone's minds, but it's not looking likely right now. Our very own Robert Scarpinito got to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/new-world-aeternum-preview-its-still-mmo">sit down with a preview build of the relaunch</a>, so make sure to check out his thoughts if you want to know what's what.</p>

                <p>THQ Nordic will be at Gamescom 2024 and have two currently unannounced games at the showcase, along with Gothic remake, Titan Quest II, and Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed. Fans think that one of the two unannounced games is a new Red Faction.</p><p>THQ Nordic gave clues as to what the two games are by providing the number of letters in their titles. While the first game is hard to decipher, the second one has five words and 23 letters in total:</p><ul><li>Unannounced game 1: _ _ _ _ _ _</li><li>Unannounced game 2: _ _ _ [space] _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [space] _ _ _ _ [space] _ _ [space] _ _ _ _ _ _ _</li></ul><p>The first word has three letters, and the second one has seven letters. Fans quickly began to realize that "Red" and "Faction" fit. The remaining words are what the subtitle might be.</p><p>The Red Faction series made its debut in 2001 and its last mainline entry was Red Faction: Armageddon in 2011. Unfortunately, THQ Nordic at the time said that it'd be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-faction-series-suppressed/1100-6325830/" data-ref-id="1100-6325830">dropping the series due to poor sales</a> of Armageddon. However, THQ Nordic revisited the series in 2018 by remastering 2009's Red Faction: Guerrilla, titled Red Faction: Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered. The series is famous for its destruction mechanics, and it has shifted from being a first-person shooter to a third-person one.</p><p>Back in 2019, an <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-faction-evolution-may-have-just-leaked-via-the-nvidia-ansel-website/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nvidia leak</a> indicated that a new entry, called Red Faction Evolution, was reportedly in development. However, nothing since has materialized. However, many unannounced games that were revealed through Nvidia leaks eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nvidia-games-leak-gets-more-intriguing-following-kingdom-hearts-4-announcement/1100-6502356/" data-ref-id="1100-6502356">turned out to be true</a>. Of course, there's also the possibility that the second unannounced game is not Red Faction at all. Gamescom will take place from August 21-25 this year in Cologne, Germany.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-we-want-to-exhaust-every-option-without-having-to-pull-the-trigger-on-a-strike<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>It's now been eight months since SAG-AFTRA members <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-members-authorise-video-game-strike">voted in favour of a strike authorisation</a> in the games industry due to stalling negotiations over the Interactive Media Agreement.</p>
<p>The bargaining has been ongoing since October 2022 with companies including Activision, EA, Epic Games, Insomniac, WB Games, and more – all firms working with actors on voice and motion performances for video games.</p>
<p>While SAG-AFTRA has not moved forward with its strike as of yet, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-talks-with-game-companies-fail-to-reach-an-agreement">dialogue reached a bit of a dead end</a> soon after the authorisation was approved, and the parties have still not reached an agreement. Despite progress elsewhere – <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-and-replica-studios-pen-ai-voice-agreement">for instance, with Replica Studios over ethical use of AI voice work</a> – negotiations over the Interactive Media Agreement feel like they're almost at a standstill despite several rounds of bargaining.</p>
<p>"The line is drawn very clearly in the sand around AI as an issue," says Sarah Elmaleh, voice actor (Anthem, Where the Water Tastes Like Wine), and chair of the Interactive Media Agreement negotiating committee at SAG-AFTRA. "We both brought a number of proposals to this package, and we resolved those over many months of bargaining, and things have really narrowed, focused, and scoped to the issue of AI, and whether the bargaining group is willing to extend protections comprehensively to all members and performers within SAG-AFTRA."</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland tells us there's been proposals back and forth in the past couple of months between the union and the companies, in particular regarding AI.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Sarah Elmaleh, voice actor and SAG-AFTRA's chair of the Interactive Media Agreement negotiating committee</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"But unfortunately, as Sarah alluded to, the core issue hasn't been resolved," he continues. "And that core issue, if you really boil it down to its essence, is that, as a union, our expectation and our demand is that all of our members be protected with respect to AI. There are fundamental protections that we expect to see in all of our collective bargaining agreements, with all of our employers, and that need to protect all of our members."</p>
<p>While the companies have agreed to "many, if not all, of those protections," Crabtree-Ireland explains that some "have refused to extend them to all of [SAG-AFTRA] members who are working under those contracts."</p>
<p>"And as a union, we're not leaving any of our members behind in the process of negotiating these kinds of protections. And frankly, these protections shouldn't be that difficult to agree to. They're basic."</p>
<p>He points to the long road SAG-AFTRA had to travel to reach similar agreements with film studios and streaming companies last year, with a five-month strike eventually leading to setting guidelines around AI use, among many other things.</p>
<p>"Since that time, we've negotiated these types of protections with the major record labels without having to go on strike, we've negotiated them with the TV animation companies without having to go on strike, we've achieved them in other agreements like the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/member-message-regarding-new-replica-studios-agreement">Replica Studios agreement [around] video game voice replication</a>, and we've embedded them in the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/member-message-regarding-new-tiered-budget-independent-interactive-media-agreement">new tiered Interactive Media Agreement</a>. And since that time a number of companies have signed to those agreements.</p>
<p>"So it continues to mystify me why there is such sort of aggressive resistance to providing just basic protection, respect, and comfort to people so that, when they go to work, they're not putting themselves out of a job by enabling a company to use them to compete with themselves for the next job. It shouldn't be so difficult."</p>
<p>When trying to understand why SAG-AFTRA is met with such resistance from game studios, Crabtree-Ireland says some might have a "philosophical mindset about AI."</p>
<p>"They want to make a battle maybe because they're scared about what the future of AI brings for their own companies and they don't want to commit to something," he says. "I understand that, especially in the generative AI area.</p>

</figure>
<p>"For example, one of the areas we've been challenged in bargaining over is the question of limitations on inputs for training data and AI models. But that's not what we're fighting over in this negotiation. So let's be clear, we're not talking about their ability to remain competitive with other AI companies that are outside of this bargaining group, because that's not what we're talking about. What's at issue with this negotiation is not inputs into training data. What's an issue in this negotiation is the idea that when a performer is engaged to work for these companies, that there should be limits on the use of that work without consent, without fair compensation, by the use of AI in subsequent projects and things like that.</p>
<p>"It's a very specific kind of protection that's unique to performers in a lot of ways and is entirely consistent with what we've sought and achieved with these other big companies – ironically several of which are owned by the same parents as studios and streamers who've agreed to those very provisions in film and television work."</p>
<p>Crabtree-Ireland mentions that the principles SAG-AFTRA has been fighting for have had a lot of public support, including "from people who normally don't like unions at all," he laughs.</p>
<p>He mentions the recent issue between Scarlett Johansson and OpenAI, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4o#:~:text=Scarlett%20Johansson%20controversy%5Bedit%5D">company allegedly stealing the likeness of her voice for use in ChatGPT</a>. While the firm refuted the accusations, the actress revealed that she had repeatedly been approached by the company to lend her voice to the chatbot, but declined. Crabtree-Ireland points to the fact that the actress had an immediate outpouring of public support, adding: "I think companies are running a real risk if they underestimate how the public will react to them not treating workers fairly in the context of AI."</p>
<p>Elmaleh emphasises that Johansson's plight highlights a less-discussed risk that AI presents for performers.</p>
<p>"There's this scenario where you go to work and are actively providing material that could potentially be used to replace yourself, which is terrifying. So that scenario must be accounted for, again, for all performers, and some partial coverage has been gained so far there, but it's a question of not leaving anyone behind.</p>
<p>"However, the other potential [aspect] that needs to be accounted for, and that we have in our proposals that has been repeatedly rebuffed, is around that scenario where, in this case they ask – it was really less of an offer than a threat – Scarlett and be like, 'Hi, we'd like to hire you to do this' and she said no, and then [they] turn around and simply get something approximate out of a generative AI system, without her ever having provided those materials in the course of her work with them.</p>
<p>"And so the question of prompting a system and asking it to invoke a performer based on a character that they're known for, or based on their name itself in a way that's really recognisable and obvious inspiration, that scenario also really needs to be accounted for. And that one we are still looking for really significant movement on."</p>
<p>With AI protection for all SAG-AFTRA members being the primary delay to the negotiations, we ask the pair whether a strike is getting more and more likely.</p>
<p>"There may be a point soon, if not where we're at now, where those proposals are looking similar coming back and forth, or the changes or the progress is looking slimmer and more marginal, at which point you're questioning: are we moving towards a deal or not?" Elmaleh says.</p>
<blockquote>"The question of prompting a system and asking it to invoke a performer... really needs to be accounted for"<cite>Sarah Elmaleh</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>"And then at that point further pressure needs to be applied. The pressure applied by the strike authorisation yielded more results, and so we've been working with that, and then building other strategies… But when productivity kind of runs out in that process, then further pressure needs to be applied."</p>
<p>Crabtree-Ireland says he finds it hard to see how SAG-AFTRA would compromise on protection for all its members, which is what could eventually could lead to a strike.</p>
<p>"What needs to happen in order for this to move forward and us not to end up on strike against these companies is for them to revisit their resistance and their insistence on sort of splitting off our members and protecting some and not others – that's how this ultimately gets resolved," he says.</p>
<p>"So at this point, I would say there is a really real possibility that's trending towards probability that we will be on strike against them in the next 30 to 45 to 60 days. We want to exhaust every opportunity to try and resolve these things without having to actually pull that trigger on a strike."</p>
<p>Unionisation has historically been lagging behind in games, with workers in the industry slowly catching up with protections that are more standard in film. When we mention that reality and ask what needs to change for games to reap similar benefits, Elmaleh says she's interested to see what will come out of the current situation.</p>
<blockquote>"There is a real possibility that's trending towards probability that we will be on strike in the next 30 to 45 to 60 days"<cite>Duncan Crabtree-Ireland</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>"The truth of any sort of basis of a union is that you have to resist," she says. "Corporations don't give things. Employers don't give things without resistance. To come into that awareness as a worker that you have something that they need, and that it is leverage that can be applied effectively – and has been proven to be applied effectively through collective action throughout history – is an awareness you need to step into and really take ownership of it. It takes a fight.</p>
<p>"But what precipitates a willingness to fight is the kind of situation that we're in now. The layoffs have been absolutely brutal. That sense that sustainability isn't a priority for some of these folks… that the people who are currently deciding how things are run may no longer be acting in your interest, or that it will take a certain degree of frustration, disillusionment with the system that exists currently, and a willingness to build a new system… Unfortunately for some people, I think it takes a really dark, difficult moment like this to be like, 'You know what? I'm ready to try and really fight to make this look different for everyone's benefit'."</p>

</figure>
<p>Crabtree-Ireland adds that a lot of employers have an outdated view of what it means to work with unions, and that it's not about disrupting business operations.</p>
<p>"It's the contrary," he says. "We want that to happen. We just want it to happen under terms that are fair, equitable, and respectful to the creative talent that's essential to their success."</p>
<p>Another outdated view is the idea that workers raise issues because they don't care about their work. Here again, it's the opposite.</p>
<p>"For anyone who's still labouring under that: it's not true," Elmaleh says. "It's just that companies may not have the mandate of individual worker career sustainability and longevity in mind. That's not part of their goal set. If you love this work, you want to do it for a long time, you want it to be sustainable, and it is therefore required, just out of the forces of nature, for a counter force to advocate for that, and to really stand firm with that perspective in mind… So I think for folks who are looking at this as a big nasty fight: it's really just about setting a boundary."</p>
<blockquote>"For folks who are looking at this as a big nasty fight: it's really just about setting a boundary"<cite>Sarah Elmaleh</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking ahead, both hope for an agreement to be reached, via a strike if needs be. Crabtree-Ireland leaves us with a thought on what could lie beyond that agreement, especially when thinking about the future of AI.</p>
<p>"We can all see that AI is going to continue to evolve," he points out. "And that means that our contract, terms, and provisions that relate to AI are also going to continue to evolve.</p>
<p>"And in fact, with the pace of evolution of AI, we've seen the evolution of our agreements actually happen quickly, even since last November, when we finalised the deal with the studios and streamers. Once this contract issue is resolved, my vision is that the companies realise that the best way for us to deal with that evolution is a continual process of collaboration and working together to find that path that is appropriate, respectful, protective, and human-centred, as far as AI evolution goes.</p>
<p>"And that, as challenging and as difficult as this particular negotiation process has been, that it doesn't have to be replicated going forward because we can see how there is a path into the future where we work together."</p>

<p>In a press release, Singer and Liu say that each institution will receive a copy of the game and a poster signed by both of them. The intent, according to said press release, is to "ignite the imaginations of future leaders" by making the story of legendary pirate Cheng Shih more accessible.</p>
<p>The academic institutions in question aren't named, so we don't know where these free copies are going, but I'm sure that these 50 schools and universities will be thrilled to get a chance to check out&nbsp;<em>The Pirate Queen</em>.</p>

<p>She goes on to say that&nbsp;<em>The Pirate Queen&nbsp;</em>is a "powerful educational tool" thanks to its "historical accuracy", which applies not only to its characters but also to its "objects, place names, locations, language, and historical context".</p>
<p>For her part, Liu says that "being able to immerse yourself in an experience is the best way to learn anything", and it's hard to disagree on that front.</p>

<p>It tells the story of Cheng Shih, a legendary pirate who led a confederation in the early 19th century. You can also see a fictionalized version of her in 2022's unfortunate&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who&nbsp;</em>episode "Legend of the Sea Devils".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/teamfight-tactics-turns-5-stepping-out-from-league%E2%80%99s-shadow.900501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24176416/teamfight-tactics-tft-teams-5-year-anniversary-design-popularity<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9iulc7">There have been many game modes in <em>League of Legends</em>, and few of them survive long-term. A lucky few get entered into a rotation, showing up as short events for a bit of fun before being removed again. One game mode has been lucky enough to escape that fate; it’s now a stand-alone project that’s stepped out from <em>League</em>’s shadow. <em>Teamfight Tactics</em> turns 5, and the game mode continues to be one of Riot’s best bets so far.</p>
<p id="7p874J"><em>Teamfight Tactics</em> pits eight players against each other in a technically competitive but extremely chill battle. Players are offered units, which allow them to build basic teams that auto-battle it out — first against computer-controlled bots, and then against each other. As the matches progress, players have access to a shop and the occasional carousel of more units.</p>
<p id="vhJzFo">“<em>Teamfight Tactics</em>, when it launched as a game mode with a relatively small team, saw incredible reception from our players,” said Peter Whalen, game director for <em>Teamfight Tactics</em>, in a call with Polygon. “There were so many people that tried out <em>TFT </em>and then continued to stick with it.” Today, <em>Teamfight Tactics</em> has a monthly player count of approximately 33 million — not as high as parent game <em>League</em>, but certainly a respectable fan base.</p>
<p id="PGS1ir">For a totally new player who isn’t familiar with the genre or <em>League</em> itself, <em>Teamfight Tactics</em> can be confusing to pick up. There’s a high learning curve if you want to master all the intricacies, and if you’re not familiar with <em>League</em>’s vast cast of characters, it can be hard to recognize the potential strengths of the characters assembled at the carousel  But there are a few key aspects of the game that are very easy to understand — if you get three of the same unit, it gets upgraded to tier 2. If you get nine units, that champion becomes tier 3, which makes them a game-changing presence in each battle. </p>

<p id="cZUpxb">It doesn’t take a lot of know-how to take advantage of that stuff, but doing it feels great — and the matches are short enough that a loss rarely feels bad. “The game is structured so there’s lots of little victories,” said Whalen. “There’s lots of moments where you get a small win: You win a fight, you’ve got a three-star champion, you’re getting the perfect items, the perfect Augment, something amazing happens on the carousel. And those feel really good.”</p>
<p id="UdP6z7">The <em>Teamfight Tactics</em> developers change up the game’s roster and mechanics regularly with “sets” that rotate every four months. Each season has a specific theme. Dragonlands, for instance, has a host of dragon-related characters to pull from skins like Dragon Trainer Tristana, Dragon Guardian Galio, and Dragon Master Swain. Each new theme is an excuse to try a whole new set of mechanics built on the core game’s foundation.</p>
<p id="hHnuTK">“Each season is a new puzzle to solve,” said Whalen. “It really creates a novel and unique experience that has been one of the most successful things that we’ve seen with our players. People have really latched on to solving the new puzzles that <em>TFT </em>presents.”</p>
<p id="ZSTK9V">I personally played, and enjoyed, <em>Teamfight Tactics</em> at launch. I eventually wandered away, switching to <em>Hearthstone</em>’s Battlegrounds mode for a bit before dropping my autobattler habit altogether. Years later, I absently clicked a <em>Teamfight Tactics</em> cinematic in my Twitter feed. It was so slickly produced that it was stunning, especially considering how goofy it was. </p>

<p id="ZJQkrb"><em>League</em> has been silly before, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mT9D4fdgQ">the Pentakill music video where Mordekaiser punts Teemo</a>, or if you want to go way back, the old-school Journal of Justice that shared in-universe articles written about the robot Blitzcrank’s dating service, or Veigar stealing a blimp at the Bandle City Fair.<em> </em>But Riot Games has also been building an entire multifaceted media ecosystem off the back of <em>League of Legends</em>, including <em>Legends of Runeterra </em>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24079440/2xko-project-l-name-reveal-league-of-legends-fighting-game"><em>2XKO</em></a>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24090199/riot-forge-league-of-legends-universe-lore">Riot Forge, which was sadly shut down earlier this year</a>, delivered a variety of indie games set in the world of <em>League</em>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24175597/arcane-season-2-trailer-jinx-vi-ambessa-ekko">The second season of <em>Arcane</em></a> is set to be released in November. Riot Games also has a whole music scene, debuting virtual bands like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/28/21536910/league-of-legends-k-pop-kda-music-video-debut-more">K/DA</a>, True Damage, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23921202/league-of-legends-boy-band-heartsteel-skins-paranoia-single">Heartsteel</a>. <em>Teamfight Tactics </em>is able to pull from all of that material and maintain its downright ridiculous tone — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22812087/arcane-silco-riot-teamfight-tactics-gizmos-gadgets">it can even add <em>Arcane</em> bad guy Silco</a>, or a charming fellow like red fox brewmaster Kobuko.</p>
<p id="d3bV23">Altogether, it’s a much friendlier and more welcoming environment than <em>League of Legends</em>, and it’s cultivated a community to match. The general vibe the team is going for is fanfiction, says Whalen. Silly little mascots like Choncc and Pengu are positioned around popular <em>League</em> characters, giving the vibe that when the <em>League</em> matches are over, the kayfabe drops and all the champions could be friends off set. <em>Teamfight Tactics</em> is able to liberally borrow from <em>League</em>’s expanding library of content, and that has led to the one-time novelty game mode splitting off into a project that truly stands on its own under the Riot umbrella. </p>

If you felt <em>Octopath Traveler 2</em> was too easy for your tastes, you’ll want to open your save file one more time to give these encounters a spin.</p><p>Here’s everything you need to know about these new battles.</p><h2 id="h106319"><a id=""></a>What are the prerequisites to unlock the Extra Battles in <em>Octopath Traveler II</em>?</h2><p>According to the 1.1.0 patch notes, the Extra Battles option will become available on the main menu after you clear the main story. However, given the structure of <em>Octopath Traveler 2</em>, that prerequisite can sound a little confusing. <strong>Clearing the main story consists of completing all eight characters’ main storylines, clearing the Crossed Paths story, and finishing the Extra Stories that pits your travelers against the game’s true final boss</strong>. Make sure to save your game after clearing the final battle, and watch the Epilogue to see the credits roll.</p><figure id="" data-id="73b4d9cb7f8a68dbae39f4fe36782083" data-recommend-id="image://73b4d9cb7f8a68dbae39f4fe36782083" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Octopath Traveler II menu listing possible opponents under the Extra Battles option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Octopath Traveler II menu listing possible opponents under the Extra Battles option." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="73b4d9cb7f8a68dbae39f4fe36782083" data-recommend-id="image://73b4d9cb7f8a68dbae39f4fe36782083" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Octopath Traveler II menu listing possible opponents under the Extra Battles option." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With these requirements out of the way, the “???” option on the main menu should turn into “Extra Battles.” While you’ll want to clear side quests to power up your party, those otherwise aren’t required to access this option. <strong>Completing the secret “A Gate Between Worlds” battle is <em>not </em>required to unlock Extra Battles</strong>.</p><p>If done right, you should be able to load your save file after selecting the Extra Battles option on the main menu. Otherwise, you may get an error message such as “Cannot load saved data. You must clear the extra stories.” Again, in this instance, make sure you save the game after defeating the true final boss.</p><h2 id="h106320"><a id=""></a>Who do you fight in the Extra Battles?</h2><p>The first two sets of battles pit you against the protagonists of <em>Octopath Traveler</em>. The <strong>Majestic Mysterious Travelers </strong>consists of <strong>Ophilia</strong>, <strong>Alfyn</strong>, <strong>Tressa</strong>, and <strong>Olberic</strong>. Meanwhile, the <strong>Mastery Mysterious Travelers </strong>makes you face off against <strong>Primrose</strong>, <strong>Therion</strong>, <strong>H’aanit</strong>, and <strong>Cyrus</strong>. </p><figure id="" data-id="784512f3d81d6223ebe4acaecd8dfe10" data-recommend-id="image://784512f3d81d6223ebe4acaecd8dfe10" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Octopath Traveler II battle screen showing party members from the second game fighting four characters from the first game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Octopath Traveler II battle screen showing party members from the second game fighting four characters from the first game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="784512f3d81d6223ebe4acaecd8dfe10" data-recommend-id="image://784512f3d81d6223ebe4acaecd8dfe10" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Octopath Traveler II battle screen showing party members from the second game fighting four characters from the first game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>They were so close to ordering the protagonists so the first letters of their names spell out “Octopath.” I guess “Oatopthc” is close enough.<br></p><p>The other two Extra Battles are super-powered versions of the true final boss’ two phases. While this is a continuous encounter in the main story, here you have to beat phase one to unlock the second phase as a standalone battle (it’ll show up as “???” in the menu before you do). This is just as well: The One Who Denies The Dawn packs a serious punch, and it can take over half an hour to clear both of these fights. Make sure you power up all eight of your travelers and equip them with your best gear. You’re going to need it.</p><h2 id="h106321"><a id=""></a>What is your reward for clearing the Extra Battles?</h2><p>These four extra boss battles are just here for bragging rights. There are no achievements tied to completing them, and there’s no reward or secret cutscene to unlock either. If these fights are too difficult for your tastes, you’re under no obligation to clear them.</p><figure id="" data-id="772bed5f84bbcfc5ec13f7721d17d4b3" data-recommend-id="image://772bed5f84bbcfc5ec13f7721d17d4b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Octopath Traveler II battle screen showing party members from the second game fighting four characters from the first game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Octopath Traveler II battle screen showing party members from the second game fighting four characters from the first game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="772bed5f84bbcfc5ec13f7721d17d4b3" data-recommend-id="image://772bed5f84bbcfc5ec13f7721d17d4b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Octopath Traveler II battle screen showing party members from the second game fighting four characters from the first game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That said, I recommend at least dipping your toes into the fights against <em>Octopath Traveler</em>’s protagonists. There are some neat mechanics that you’ll see here, and there are even newly voiced lines from the original cast. It’s really cool, especially for the unceremonious way this update was released. But if you do put in the time to complete all four of these battles, feel free to celebrate your accomplishment. You’ll have absolutely earned it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Everywhere, the expansive upcoming game from former Rockstar North President and GTA producer Leslie Benzies’ Build A Rocket Boy, is getting a closed beta starting next week.</p>



<p>This closed beta, what Build A Rocket Boy is <a href="https://everywhere.game/news/welcome-builders-beta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calling the “Builders Beta”</a>, launches June 18 on PC and focuses on the game’s ARCADIA building tools and publishing system. The tools players have access to are the “same tools Build A Rocket Boy use to create content” in the game.</p>



<p>“Everywhere is a haven for limitless creativity,” the studio says. “We credit everyone’s contribution, so each game will have a full list of users who made it possible through the elements they created independently or together.”</p>



<p>The game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everywhere-first-details-revealed-by-build-a-rocket-boy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similar in nature</a> to Media Molecule’s Dreams, in which players can go in and create their own games, experiences, or help expand other players’ creations.</p>



<p>“Everywhere is designed to share the joy of not just playing games, but also creating them with no coding experience required,” they said. “By combining ARCADIA, our powerful building tools, self-publishing system, and library of assets, with the diverse creativity of our players, we hope to serve all interests delivering high quality gameplay, from the niche to mainstream.”</p>

ZERO [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO</a></em> showcasing the game modes “Episode Battle” and “Custom Battle,” as well as limited split-screen multiplayer battling. <span id="more-892058"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of each mode, via producer Jun Furutani:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Episode Battle</strong></p><p>“In this single-player mode, you can take the point of view of eight different characters, including Goku and Vegeta, and enjoy famous battles from the anime. For each stage, you’ll be playing through an introduction before heading into some of the most iconic fights in <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> and <em>Dragon Ball Super</em>. The number of stages and battles vary by character. For example, Goku has the largest number of stages, beginning from when he fights Raditz up to and including his fights in the Tournament of Power Saga. Our goal for this as a mode is to allow players the satisfying challenge faced by characters and their friends. Additionally, certain cutscenes allow players to experience parts of the story form a first-person perspective, which we hope will allow players to further immerse themselves in the characters’ experiences. On certain stages, depending on your <a title="Genres > Action [1,929 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s and choices,  players will be able to change the outcome of the story that differ from the anime series. Play as a character to experience these new and different episodes!”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dragon-Ball-Sparking-ZERO_2024_06-13-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dragon-Ball-Sparking-ZERO_2024_06-13-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><!-- AD: content -->

Within the Custom Battle, there is Bonus Battles, a mode where we’ve prepared several original battle situations developed for you to enjoy. In this mode, some battles will have different victory conditions, and some might have event cutscenes pop up mid-way, so you’ll be able to enjoy battles different from the norm. In Edi Mode, you’ll be able to freely set the characters to be played, as well as the pre-battle and post-battle cutscenes to make your own original battle. What you’ve made will be able to be uploaded and viewed online for the whole world to play, so hope you enjoy sharing the battles and situations you’ve thought up! You will also be able to edit exiting content along with Bonus Battles to use as a base, so try your hand at making a whole variety of battles!”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dragon-Ball-Sparking-ZERO_2024_06-13-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dragon-Ball-Sparking-ZERO_2024_06-13-24_006.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Local <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [338 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a> Battling</strong></p><p>“Our focus for this game was seeing how far we could get players to really become <em>Dragon Ball</em> series characters. We wanted to show effects like the wind blasting around and the weather changing, just by charging your Ki, and rocks and buildings being dynamically destroyed by the force of battle, and take advantage of the power of the latest generation of consoles. With that in mind, it was difficult to implement local split-screen multiplayer while retaining those core elements, so we developed this game with online multiplayer and an offline single-player mode in mind. However, we have always wanted for as many people as possible to enjoy the game in various situations. After careful consideration, we have decided to implement the split-screen multiplayer mode exclusively within the ‘Hyperbolic Time Chamber’ stage. As character selection was originally designed with single-player gameplay in mind, there will unfortunately be a slight inconvenience during character selection before a split-screen battle. However, we hope this mode will allow players to enjoy local matches with friends and family.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dragon-Ball-Sparking-ZERO_2024_06-13-24_007.jpg"></a></figure></blockquote><p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

That claim </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/the-worlds-biggest-strategy-game-is-probably-not-what-youd-expect/">came from Riot president of esports</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> John Needham in 2022, and it's one that game director Peter Whalen repeated in a conversation with Game Developer in advance of the game's five-year anniversary.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's one of the common misconceptions about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Teamfight Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">," he said, in reference to the idea that it's one of Riot Games' less-played titles. Because of that misconception, he said the team enjoys working "under the radar" in ways that let them experiment with unique mechanics.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Experimentation is the name of the game for Riot's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-themed autobattler. The game originally debuted in June 2019, months after the release of the DOTA Auto Chess mod for Valve's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>DOTA 2. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Because of its strong game design foundations and its relationship to Riot's fictional world of Runeterra, its development team has been able to pursue "novelty" as a major means of acquiring and retaining players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the last half-decade, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Teamfight Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has thrived by completely cycling out its "sets" of units and traits while keeping the core mechanics exactly the same. Its upcoming anniversary will allow players to play with every single set developed over the game's lifetime in a game mode called "Pengu's Party Mode."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mode shines a spotlight on the game's novelty to date—and according to Whalen and lead event producer Christiana Jiang, novelty across sets and events will be what makes the game last another five years.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Novelty&quot; focused design helps with long-term player retention">"Novelty" focused design helps with long-term player retention</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's a neat knock-on effect of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Teamfight Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' set release strategy. Its primary goal isn't just to keep hardcore players engaged and spending. It's also a tool that helps players cycle in and out of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whalen explained that the team's goal is to ensure when players put down </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Teamfight Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after weeks or months of play that they have "good memories" of it as they go off to other games. Though the game sports traditional retention strategies and in-app purchases that drive other free-to-play games, it's rare that we hear such developers express comfort at players taking time away.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But letting players flow in and out of the game while steadily outputting new "sets" has a natural flow. Jiang said that the team is working in parallel on three sets that roll out every year, and each set can be modified through patches to serve the needs of the community.</span></p><p>Image via Riot Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance if the esports season wraps up and the next set is up on the public test realm, the team can drop patches that make the set's traits fun and wacky instead of strictly competitive. Players who want either the competitive or wacky types of gameplay can ramp-on and ramp-off as they see fit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, when the new set drops, its novelty can attract lapsed players back in. That's why in-game events are often structured around the "average" player, Jiang said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thankfully, average players are extremely responsive to unconventional ideas.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-preview-%E2%80%93-old-world-new-perspectives.900465/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/13/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-preview-old-world-new-perspectives/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s very often worth looking at things from both sides, whether it’s a simple misunderstanding between yourself and another, or a deep analysis of historical events. The original Greedfall presented a fantasy world with clear-as-day allegories to the European settlement of the Americas, and, as it heads into Early Access later this year, Greedfall 2: The Dying World will give a fresh view of this clash of cultures from the perspective of the natives.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall 2 | Doneigada Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C4rSMcO95Zs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set 100 years before the original, there’s a much more tentative balance between the native tribes of Teer Fradee and the colonists that have come to the island. The exploitative tendencies of those from the Old Continent have yet to be fully understood by the clans, but the impact is already being felt and this is explored through the game’s opening.</p>


<p>As a native of this island, you will eventually be ripped away and taken back to Gacane, but the game’s opening hours first show you Teer Fradee and let you explore how it’s being changed. You’re in the final stages of becoming a Doneigada – a sage that helps to safeguard the Yecht Fradí and lands alike – tasked with exploring the surroundings to the small village in an attempt to discover what’s behind a mysterious sickness, unusual injuries afflicting hunters and animals alike, and generally why the once abundant life and nature around them is being corrupted.</p>


<p>It doesn’t take long to see the issues. The colonisers that struck bargains with the natives for things like hunting rights and mining rights are exploiting these privileges for all they’re worth, and massively impacting the native populace in the process. The trapper camp, for example, has covered the surrounding area with big bear traps that the unaware are haplessly getting caught and injuring or even killing them.</p>
<p>Naturally, there’s a multitude of ways that you can try to resolve this, but the trappers seem immediately standoffish and resistant to any kind of moral reason. So, the question is, do you try to fight them? Or can you try to force them to move elsewhere by other means? Thankfully not all of the Old Worlders are quite so unreasonable and are willing to learn and become that little bit more enlightened.</p>
<p>Of course, given how obnoxious the trappers were, I would have been very tempted to give them a good seeing to. One of the biggest and most controversial changes from the original is a shift from an action-heavy hack and slash combat system to a more considered real-time with pause (RTWP) RPG combat style. This is a very big shift for those who liked the first game to contemplate, and it completely upends the pacing and style of the adventure outside of the main storytelling elements, but it’s also Spiders seeing an area where they can add more depth and nuance to their game, while also following a relatively recent trend.</p>

<p>Simply put, the traditional CRPG is well and truly back, and it has been for a good few years. Even if it’s Baldur’s Gate 3 that has stolen the spotlight in recent years, there’s been fantastic examples of it sprinkled through the last decade or so, some fully embracing turn-based combat and others leaning on real-time with pause.</p>
<p>What it means for Greedfall is that you’ll feel a lot more hands-off in combat, dishing out orders instead of having direct control over any of the characters. Different characters will naturally have contrasting and complimentary abilities, so one party member was a bruising frontline fighter, while another was intended for the backlines (and somewhat inevitably ended up taking a lot of damage in more chaotic fights).</p>
<p>At this very early stage in the game, I felt I could just wait for my party of characters to rinse and repeat their standard attack animations until the bad guys keeled over, but get even a smidgeon deeper and, as a Doneigada, you’ll be able to tap into and draw up powers from nature to attack your enemies. It won’t be long before you’ll be pulling on special abilities and attacks in quick succession, making use of the RTWP more and more extensively to cue your party’s actions.</p>
<p>There’s some great touches alongside this. I enjoyed the camera’s flexibility to zoom from almost over-the-shoulder to a more birds-eye view –&nbsp;a trick that Baldur’s Gate 3 also pulls very well –&nbsp;which does a surprising amount to shift how the game feels to play, there’s the fully voiced fictional language of the Yecht Fradí once again, and more.</p>

<p>Our hands on time was purely set within Teer Fradee, as opposed to visiting Gacane, but there’s plenty of time for that to be unveiled and built upon as Spiders take Greedfall 2 into Steam Early Access. It’s a strange move financially for a game with a publisher like Nacon attached to do this, but from the perspective of making the best possible game, it gives the team a chance to really battle test their ideas and get feedback from the community – and it worked very well for Baldurs Gate 3. There’s been an upward trend to the studio’s output over the past decade, and this gives the best chance for that to continue.</p>
<p>There’s a real opportunity for Greedfall 2: The Dying World to be a special game, taking the distinctive elements from the original, exploring them from another direction and building a stronger game within that world.</p>

            <p>
Everywhere, the next project from ex-GTA producer Leslie Benzies, is getting a closed beta next week.
</p>
<p>
It's a "zero-code toolset" for aspiring game developers to build experiences, or remix other people's, and share them with the community - a bit like Media Molecule's Dreams.
</p>
<p>
The Builders Beta will launch on PC on 18th June and includes plenty for players to use, play and remix from a number of studios. 
</p>

<p>

The free-to-play toolset powering the project is called Arcadia, which includes building tools, a self-publishing system, and library of assets.
</p>
<p>
Virtual items, be they small props, enemies, puzzles, or even entire levels, are known as Stamps, which can be shared with others to be edited and reshaped and take on new purpose.
</p>
<p>
"You do not have to be a professional programmer to create something amazing in Everywhere," said Benzies. "With the introduction of the Stamp system to the building experience, we have eliminated the 'blank canvas' problem and allow you to select, reuse, and even remix the best content from the community, accelerating the prototyping process. 
</p>
<p>
"In the digital age, an explosion of technology and content platforms, including social media, has democratised the art of remixing. The tools and resources necessary for crafting derivative works are now within reach of anyone, a concept that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago and one that is now made possible in video games. We're redefining what's achievable and are excited to see what our community will build."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Tom Phillips visited developer Build a Rocket Boy last year to find out more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-producers-not-crypto-project-everywhere-is-part-episodic-blockbuster-part-roblox-rival">what exactly Everywhere is</a>, confirming it's definitely not a crypto project.

</p>
<p>
That preview includes details of MindsEye, an episodic AAA game the developers are creating within Everywhere. There's no mention of this being part of the beta, though presumably it will be available for the project's launch - which is still without a release date, but likely edging closer after the beta.
</p>
<p>

<p>
You can sign up for the invite-only beta on the <a href="https://www.everywhere.game/">Everywhere website</a>. It's available on PC only.
</p>
<p>
Despite not yet releasing the project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-hit-gta-producers-everywhere-studio">Build a Rocket Boy did suffer layoffs</a> earlier this year "in order to become a more agile studio and to meet the requirements that our projects demand".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24176995/when-delicious-in-dungeon-season-2-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="JU5RfC">It’s safe to say that Studio Trigger’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24025746/delicious-in-dungeon-netflix-finally-some-good-food"><em>Delicious in Dungeon</em></a>, adapted from the manga by Ryoko Kui and simulcast on Netflix, found its audience. Bridging the (not terrifically wide in the first place) gap <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24146605/delicious-in-dungeon-video-game-inspirations">between anime fans and TTRPG fans</a>, the show arrived just in time for a community invigorated by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23837019/baldurs-gate-3-review-dungeons-dragons">hit new CRPGs</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24162697/wizardry-remaster-final-fantasy-dragon-quest-demons-souls">returning classics</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24052123/best-actual-play-2024-dungeons-dragons-critical-role-dimension-20-acquisitions-inc">a soaring liveplay scene</a> to realize this one was for them. </p>
<p id="epSpXX">But <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em>’s first wave of episodes have all been released, and now that audience must now face that dreaded question: When are we getting the rest of the story? </p>
<h2 id="nvauQe"><strong>Will there be a Delicious in Dungeon season 2?</strong></h2>
<p id="MWbLQt">Studio Trigger has confirmed that season 2 is currently in production! </p>

<p id="I296Zl">With seasons of anime generally organized into blocks of 12 episodes called cours, <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> has technically already had two “seasons,” so you may see the show’s return referred to as <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> season 2 or 3, depending on how the person is counting. </p>
<h2 id="tqWzzF"><strong>When will Delicious in Dungeon season 2 be released? </strong></h2>
<p id="pjHVXq">That’s still an unknown — it all depends on Studio Trigger’s production schedule. </p>
<h2 id="7yDhON"><strong>How much of the manga is left to adapt? </strong></h2>
<p id="ZdiA8S">Kui’s original manga ran for 97 chapters, concluding in September of 2023, and Trigger’s anime has been very faithful to the manga’s pacing, averaging two chapters per episode. With episode 24, the anime has left off right at the end of chapter 52 — so there’s lots more to discover about our heroes’ quest to rescue Falin and defeat the mad sorcerer.</p>
<h2 id="gKZEAk"><strong>But I want to know what happens now!</strong></h2>

      <p>When young adventurer Laios and his company are attacked and soundly thrashed by a dragon deep in a dungeon, the party loses all its money and provisions... and a member! They’re eager to go back and save her, but there is just one problem: If they set out with no food or coin to speak of, they’re sure to starve on the way! But Laios comes up with a brilliant idea: “Let’s eat the monsters!” Slimes, basilisks, and even dragons... none are safe from the appetites of these dungeon-crawling gourmands!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177632/dc-plastic-man-death-2024-comic-christopher-cantwell-alex-lins<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="aFV4rH">Plastic Man has never been A-team DC character like Batman or Superman, despite his elastic potential. He came close; before and after <em>The Matrix</em>, the Wachowskis <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/10/keanu-reeves-superhero-movie-wachowskis">toiled away on a movie</a> for the character, calling it “the closest script to a comedy we’ll write,” but it never got made. Maybe James Gunn’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23579802/james-gunn-dc-slate-movies-tv-animation-gaming-explained">rebooted DC cinematic universe</a> will give Patrick “Eel” O’Brian his mainstream breakthrough, but in the meantime, a new pair of creatives are doing the Lord’s work in the pages of DC Comics proper. </p>
<p id="32xioH">On Thursday, DC announced <em>Plastic Man No More!</em>, a new four-issue DC Black Label series launching in September from the Eisner-nominated creative team of Christopher Cantwell (<em>Halt and Catch Fire, Batman: The Brave and The Bold</em>, <em>Iron Man</em>) and Alex Lins (<em>Immortal Hulk, Monarch</em>). </p>
<p id="PcxSLL">“I don’t know about you, but when I think about Plastic Man, I immediately think of David Cronenberg,” said Cantwell in a statement. “There is an element of body horror to his story that I have always found fascinating. And I also found myself wondering recently — <em>How would Plastic Man actually die? What would that look like? Is he immortal?</em> And then I thought of the long and particularly nasty way real plastics and petroleum products break down when and if they finally do. That’s how I learned about depolymerization and the chemical process of ‘unzipping’ — from a particularly morose afternoon on the ol’ Internet, picturing what might happen to Eel if his entire cellular structure started to give way.”</p>

<p id="0U0Dun">Cantwell says <em>Plastic Man No More! </em>will grapple with Eel’s past as a crook-turned-hero, and find the member of the Justice League coming to terms with a “profound fear of aging” and what death for a boneless, stretchable superperson even looks like. </p>
<p id="kNMhP1">“So quite catastrophically, [<em>Plastic Man</em>] suddenly finds himself desperate, asking <em>WHAT NOW? HOW DO I FIX THIS?</em> ‘THIS’ being his very body, his very cells, as well his connections to the people he loves. And just WAIT until you see how horrifically and hilariously Alex Lins and Jacob Edgar [supplying additional interior art] have rendered this referendum on our vanguard ultra-bendable former-criminal-turned-hero-guy,’ Cantwell said.</p>
<p id="e4AIPy"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/22824986/best-marvel-comic-2021-immortal-hulk"><em>Immortal Hulk</em></a> for Plastic Man? One can only hope. <em>Plastic Man No More!</em> #1 is written by Cantwell with art and main cover by Lins, additional art by Edgar, color by Marcelo Maiolo, lettering by Becca Carey, and tons of variant covers by Michael Allred, Chris Samnee, and Tyler Boss. Before it debuts in local comic book shops on September 4, 2024, here’s a preview.</p>

After seeing some of the game’s early hour, fans are terrified they may have discovered why: people think Varric is gonna die in <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>The theory is mostly based off the last segment shown in the 20-minute gameplay reveal BioWare put out on June 11. In it, Varric is shown talking to Solas, the <em>Inquisition</em> party-member-turned-villain at the center of <em>The Veilguard</em>. Varric attempts to talk Solas down from his plan to save the elves by destroying everything else. The talk doesn’t seem to be going well, and Solas even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-varric-bianca-solas-1851533383&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-varric-bianca-solas-1851533383">destroys Varric’s iconic crossbow Bianca</a></span>. The final shots of this whole scene seem to be edited pretty heavily, so it’s not entirely clear how Varric and Solas’ talk ends, but the dwarf is definitely in danger.</p><p>Even before Varric goes to talk to Solas, the man is raising death flags left and right. He tells Rook, the new protagonist in <em>The Veilguard</em>, to “take care of the team” for him. That’s the kind of shit you only say if you don’t think you’re coming back. Fans are, to put it lightly, stressed.</p><p>BioWare is no stranger to traumatic character deaths. Just look at <em>Mass Effect 3</em> and you can list a dozen scenes in which the studio snuffed out a beloved party member in the most vicious way possible. <em>Dragon Age</em>, meanwhile, has had some pretty heinous party member fatalities. The Iron Bull betrayal scene in <em>Trespasser </em>is still a gut punch. But a lot of those were consequences of decisions and relationships. We need awful shit you can’t stop in <em>The Veilguard </em>that hurts so good it devastates us for years to come, and if BioWare wants to put the murder knife in the back of its longtime fans, there’s not a better character to do that with than Varric.</p><p>BioWare please leave Dorian Pavus alone. Don’t even look at him.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-tenkaichi-4-local-splitscreen-1851537589<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans have been waiting 17 years for a sequel to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-super-budokai-tenkaichi-4-xenoverse-1850192200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-super-budokai-tenkaichi-4-xenoverse-1850192200"><em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3</em></a></span>, a PS2 and Wii-era arena fighter that celebrated the beloved anime with a story mode that retold all of its biggest moments, a massive roster full of iconic characters and deep cuts alike, and spectacle-fueled showdowns that leaned into the series’ hyper-violent pomp and pageantry. <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em>looks, sounds, and feels like <em>Budokai Tenkaichi 4</em> in all but name, and despite some small caveats and concerns, it seems well on its way to being the next-gen revival that diehard fans have been desperate for. </p><p>I got chills when publisher Bandai Namco started a recent presentation for the game at Summer Game Fest with a sizzle reel of in-game fight moments set to “Rock the Dragon,” the metal intro song for the Funimation dub of <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> that’s been ingrained in millions of millennials’ heads since the first time they heard it. I still remember the exact day when I watched my first episode. My parents were furiously cleaning the house for a summer barbeque with friends and family. </p><p>Flipping through our eight broadcast channels, I was stunned to see a cartoon on one of them during a time usually reserved for Sunday morning political talk shows. In the span of 30 minutes, a guy named Raditz with cool armor and a mane of jet-black hair revealed that Goku was actually his brother and they were aliens from another planet, beat the shit out of him by kicking him into the side of Master Roshi’s house, and then abducted his son. It was<em> Game of Thrones </em>for cartoons and it hit my 9-year-old brain like a special beam cannon. </p><p>I know you are here to find out what I thought of <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em>and how it plays, but this brief detour down memory lane is crucial for trying to convey exactly why <em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3</em> remains so important to so many people. Just like the anime it’s based on, itself adapted from the late Akira Toriyama’s long-running manga, <em>Budokai Tenkaichi 3 </em>captured fans imaginations with its unflinching embrace of everything that made <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> cool, violent, and silly as hell. While there have been tons of video game adaptations, especially in the fighting genre, none manifested moments of pure fandom-addled exhilaration the way <em>Budokai Tenkaichi 3 </em>did.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="a1945c5db17b805e899ceec7cda1e46d" data-recommend-id="image://a1945c5db17b805e899ceec7cda1e46d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Goku fights Raditz.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Which is why it’s so important that <em>Budokai Tenkaichi 4</em>, officially titled <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, manages to do the same, and why I’m relieved to say that, based on my brief time with the upcoming PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC game, it seems like developer Spike Chunsoft has pulled off the previously unthinkable. Made in Unreal Engine 5 and out October 11, <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em>covers the necessities—meaty story mode (with a first-person camera mode during cutscenes), massive roster, beautiful, heart-stopping fights—and also hits plenty of other important notes. For example, “what if” returns to story mode, letting players diverge from canon to explore alternate fights. Edit mode, meanwhile, is a completely new addition that lets players craft their own custom battles, tweaking difficulty, battle settings, and other unique modifiers, and then share them online for friends and strangers to try. </p><p>My hands-on time with the game only included versus mode. While it was restricted to teams of three against AI opponents, five-character squads will be there for the finished version, Bandai Namco confirmed. Getting back on the sticks felt wonky at first, which wasn’t surprising since<em> Budokai Tenkaichi </em>has long been one of the more confusing and obtuse control schemes in all of fighting games (unless you were a freak like me and played with motion controls on Wii). Omnidirectional movement on the battlefield, paired with long lists of combos, specials, follow-ups, and unique abilities, has often been both the rush of playing <em>Budokai Tenkaichi </em>and its Achilles’ heel. </p><p>I’m happy to say that this time around there are two control schemes—classic and standard—which attempt to address some of the barrier to entry. While longtime fans will feel at home with classic, the standard control scheme tries to streamline things with actions mapped to single buttons that you swap between based on whether you’re holding down one of the triggers or not. I’ll need a lot more time with the complete game to figure out the pros and cons of each, but in my short time with the demo I quickly got comfortable with both. </p><p>More importantly, homing felt crisp and accurate. This is the game’s way of pulling you toward your opponent when rapidly flying around the battlefield, and while in games past it has often been wonky, with players rushing past one another or getting stuck punching and kicking below or above them, I found limited issues this time around with <em>Sparking Zero</em>. Targeting for other attacks also felt like they hit a good balance of requiring you to plan and predict opponents’ movements while also giving you a helping hand to get attacks on target. </p><figure id="" data-id="37d899f5061506207c34643f152c197a" data-recommend-id="image://37d899f5061506207c34643f152c197a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gogeta blows up Broly.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>My only real disappointments coming out of the demo were two-fold. The first had to do with environmental destructions, a huge part of the previous games where the battlefield gets ripped to shreds as fights play out. While almost everything is bigger and prettier than before, crumbling mountains and falling bridges in cities didn’t look quite as good. They occasionally seemed to lack the full suite of visual effects, including dust clouds and other debris, to make them feel authentic and tactile. Hopefully that’s something that comes together more in the finished game.<br></p><p>The bigger issue, however, is split-screen multiplayer. Anyone who has ever played previous <em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em> games has tons of memories of nearly ending friendships over intense fights full of dramatic moments and accusations of cheap shots or sloppy game bugs. Fans were previously worried that <em>Sparking Zero</em> might not include any local multiplayer since it wasn’t initially listed on the game’s store pages. Bandai Namco confirmed during the presentation that while the game was originally designed strictly with online multiplayer in mind, local split-screen was later added. </p><p>Unfortunately, producer Jun Furutani <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-split-screen-multiplayer-is-only-playable-on-one-map/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-split-screen-multiplayer-is-only-playable-on-one-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told<em> Gamesradar</em></a></span>&nbsp;that mode is only available on a single stage: the Hyperbolic Timechamber. It’s a map that features limited environmental effects, destructibility, and transformations—all of the things that help make great <em>Budokai Tenkaichi</em> fights so iconic. It’s unclear whether that restriction is in place because the game is also on Xbox Series S, a console that has faced split-screen issues in other games as well, or because in 2024 it’s just not a priority considering all of the other things teams can pour resources into during development. <em>Super Sparking</em> is the kind of game that fans will be taking off work for and having their friends over to play the day it comes out, so the restrictions are frustrating.</p><p>Still, everything else I saw from <em>Sparking</em> <em>Zero </em>made me hopeful the finished game will otherwise be the return to explosive Super Saiyan arena showdowns players have long wanted and that the anime deserves. There’s still plenty that could go wrong—fan-favorites left off the final roster, a story mode that doesn’t run as deep in order to cover more ground with <em>Dragon Ball Super</em>, netcode that makes online multiplayer a headache—but for now,<em> Sparking Zero</em>’s first foot forward was a solid one and I can’t wait to see more. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With the introduction of a brand-new season in The Finals, it’s also time to score an all-new Premium Battle Pass, which features unique cosmetics and other items to unlock, such as gadgets and Multibucks, to help you get more out of the game. If you’re a fan of the competitive shooter, it’s a no-brainer. But how much is The Finals Battle Pass exactly?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-the-finals-premium-battle-pass-cost">How Much Does The Finals Premium Battle Pass Cost?</h2>



<p>If you’d like to buy The Finals Battle Pass, expect to pay <strong>$9.99 or 1,150 Multibucks</strong>. Alternatively, you can purchase the more expensive Battle Pass, which includes 20 tier skips, for <strong>2,500 Multibucks or $19.99</strong>. It dramatically reduces the number of levels you must unlock to complete the entire Battle Pass and earn each reward. It’s a little more expensive, but it’s valuable for those with less time to grind.</p>



<p>Of course, if you want to purchase the more expensive Battle Pass, the Multibucks you’ll earn throughout the season will not entirely cover the expense. You’ll have to buy Multibucks using real currency to make up the difference.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/finals-season-3-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new content in Season 3</a>, and the Battle Pass is only one small part of that!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-included-in-the-finals-season-3-battle-pass">What’s Included in The Finals Season 3 Battle Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>In all, the Season 3 Battle Pass features:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>96 Rewards</strong></li>



<li><strong>26 Free Rewards</strong></li>



<li><strong>1575 Multibucks</strong></li>



<li><strong>Two Bonus Pages</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll earn enough Multibucks to purchase next season’s Battle Pass and a few other cosmetics to deck out your favorite class in new gear. That’s on top of the various rewards you’ll earn by completing challenges in-game. It’s worthwhile and, as far as Battle Passes go, rather rewarding.</p>

<p>The latest PlayStation 5 <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system update</a> will adjust Child account settings, and “start or join a Discord voice chat directly from your PS5.”</p>



<p>Just today, PlayStation confirmed that direct Discord chat would finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come to the PlayStation 5</a>. It will remove the need to manually transfer calls, so the update will be far more convenient.</p>



<p>The new system update page explains that “you can now start or join a Discord voice chat directly from your PS5.” Players can simply open Game Base in their control center, and use the Discord tab to “access your servers and direct calls.”</p>



<p>Surprisingly, the new system update will allow Child accounts to link to third-party services and apps, such as the anticipated Discord voice chat feature. That also includes “music streaming via Apple Music and Spotify, and broadcasting and sharing gameplay via YouTube and Twitch.”</p>



<p>Accordingly, the update also introduces more parental controls, which can manage Child account links to third-party additions. </p>



<p>The new PlayStation 5 system update will also improve various UI, stability, and software. That includes fixes for PULSE Elite devices, as well as “system software performance.”</p>



<p>Many fans are also looking forward to the PlayStation 5 Pro. Last March, Insider Gaming reported exclusive details on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-more-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system’s upcoming specs</a> and compared it to the standard PlayStation 5 console.</p>



<p>PlayStation also recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-project-q/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Project Q</a>, its next handheld device that uses remote play over WiFi.</p>

                <p>With Horizon Lego Adventures coming to not only PS5 and PC, but also Switch, that means main protagonist Aloy is in a game for Nintendo Switch. Some believe this could open up the possibility for her to join Nintendo's all-star ensemble series, Super Smash Bros.</p><p>In an interview with developer Guerrilla Games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lego-adventures-hands-on-ps5-nintendo-switch-1851535713" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> asked if PlayStation and Nintendo's new partnership meant that Aloy could eventually come to the next Super Smash Bros. entry. Franchise development lead producer Tim Symons said, "That'd be nice. If you speak to Nintendo and they want to invite us let me know." However, no new Smash Bros. games have been announced but are expected given how <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">successful the series</a> is.</p><p>While that's far from a confirmation, at least there's interest. The Super Smash Bros. series has added plenty of third-party characters over the years, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Cloud from Final Fantasy VII, Snake from Metal Gear Solid, and Sora from Kingdom Hearts. So it's definitely not out of the ordinary to include Aloy from the Horizon series, whether it'd be her regular self or her family-friendly Lego Adventures version.</p><p>PlayStation also has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-marks-a-new-beginning-for-playstations-burgeoning-mascot/1100-6524178/" data-ref-id="1100-6524178">Astro from Astro Bot</a> for its newest family-friendly mascot for younger audiences. So Astro definitely could be a viable alternative for a PlayStation representative in Super Smash Bros.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-isnt-your-typical-lego-game/1100-6524180/" data-ref-id="1100-6524180">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> launches in Winter 2024 for PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-explains-how-to-play-as-a-ghoul-in-fallout-76-ahead-of-next-year%E2%80%99s-update.900426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/bethesda-explains-how-to-play-as-a-ghoul-in-fallout-76-ahead-of-next-years-update/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bethesda-explains-how-to-play-as-a-ghoul-in-fallout-76-ahead-of-next-years-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="475" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I don’t think anyone was expecting <em>Fallout 5</em> to make an appearance at the recent <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, but Bethesda did give fans the next best thing: <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-76-skyline-valley-expansion-explores-the-shenandoah-region-on-june-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more content for <em>Fallout 76</em></a>. Perhaps the most exciting new addition is the option to play as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-are-ghouls-in-fallout-and-how-do-they-live-so-long/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Ghoul</a>, aka the mutated humans that roam the post-nuclear wastelands. This update won’t be coming till 2025, but Bethesda has already explained how playable Ghouls will work and the steps you need to take to become one.</p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/play-as-a-ghoul" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>, producer Bill LaCoste revealed that the process for turning into a Ghoul is remarkably simple. All you need to do is complete a special quest that unlocks when you hit level 50. Presumably, any players who’ve already surpassed that level will immediately unlock the quest once the update goes live, so it’s not as if you’ll need to build a brand-new character from scratch.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bethesda Game Studios</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="867" data-injectable="true">LaCoste obviously refrained from sharing any exact details about the quest’s storyline or what it entails, but he did confirm that the Ghoul transformation isn’t permanent if you decide you don’t enjoy playing as one. There will be an option to swap back to being a regular human but, again, LaCoste didn’t reveal how this will be done. It’s good to know players can reverse their decision since becoming a Ghoul will affect gameplay too, granting access to unique abilities and perks. Plus, NPCs will react to your presence differently.</p>
 <p data-characters="647" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">You’d think the inclusion of playable Ghouls was thanks to the success of the <em>Fallout</em> TV show, which featured a Ghoul named Cooper, played by Walter Goggins, as one of its main characters. However, LaCoste said fans had wanted to play as Ghouls already, and the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fallout-characters-in-the-amazon-series-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popularity of Goggins’ character</a> only vindicated the team’s decision to make that a reality: “We were talking about it before it became a big deal, before people saw Cooper in the TV show. … We had this in mind, making this a playable thing in the future, and when the TV show hit and people loved The Ghoul, we knew we’d made the right decision.”</p>
 <p data-characters="556" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true">It’s a shame that the update for playable Ghouls feels so far away. Sure, it’ll be out in 2025, but Bethesda has yet to narrow its release date down any further, meaning it could not arrive until near the end of 2025. Fortunately,<em> Fallout 76</em> players have a new content update to sink their teeth into at the moment, with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-76-skyline-valley-expansion-explores-the-shenandoah-region-on-june-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Skyline Valley</em> expansion</a> arriving just yesterday on June 12. You can <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-76-skyline-valley-patch-notes-map-expansion-vault-63-secrets-and-new-public-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read the full patch notes for yourself</a>, but its main additions include a new region to explore, a new questline, and a new Ghoul type called the Lost.</p>
 <p data-characters="747" data-current-count="747" data-injectable="false">Bethesda will likely need to rely on <em>Fallout 76</em> for a good while longer since the series has enjoyed a surge in popularity thanks to the TV show. In fact, <em>Fallout 76</em> achieved <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/unsurprisingly-some-of-the-fallout-games-are-hitting-new-concurrent-player-peaks/">a new concurrent player record on Steam</a> shortly after the show’s premiere. Unfortunately for Bethesda and Microsoft, they don’t have a brand-new <em>Fallout</em> game ready to go to take further advantage of its expanded audience. <em>Fallout 5</em> is no doubt <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-fallout-5-confirmed-heres-everything-bethesda-has-said-about-the-next-fallout-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still in pre-production</a>, and isn’t expected to release till after <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>… and that game doesn’t have a release date either. As an ongoing online game, Bethesda can keep supporting <em>Fallout 76</em> with updates and new content to keep fans satiated until it does have a new game to sell them.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-is-the-best-syndicate-to-focus-on-in-warframe.900423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/what-is-the-best-syndicate-in-warframe/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-is-the-best-syndicate-in-warframe<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="369" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Syndicates are a surprisingly large part of <em>Warframe</em>. They don’t mean much early on, but they’re a particularly great source of various <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-fused-reservoir-mod-in-warframe/">augment mods</a> for frames and certain <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-cinta-bow-warframe/">weapons meant for Mastery</a>. With six different Syndicates to choose from, it can be tough to decide which one to put effort into. Here’s the best Syndicate to focus on in <em>Warframe</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-who-is-the-best-syndicate-to-farm-standing-with-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">Who is the best Syndicate to farm standing with in Warframe</h2> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">The Syndicate you choose <strong>depends heavily on what it offer</strong>s, who supports that Syndicate, and which Syndicates are enemies of that Syndicate. Each Syndicate will have one Allied, one Opposed, and one Enemy to reflect this. All Syndicates, and their standings with each other, can be found below:</p> <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="834" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th>Syndicate</th><th>Allied Syndicate (+50% Rep)</th><th>Opposed Syndicate (-50% Rep)</th><th>Enemy Syndicate (-100% Rep)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Steel Meridian</td><td>Red Veil</td><td>New Loka</td><td>The Perrin Sequence</td></tr><tr><td>Arbiters of Hexis</td><td>Cephalon Suda</td><td>The Perrin Sequence</td><td>Red Veil</td></tr><tr><td>Cephalon Suda</td><td>Arbiters of Hexis</td><td>Red Veil</td><td>New Loka</td></tr><tr><td>The Perrin Sequence</td><td>New Loka</td><td>Arbiters of Hexis</td><td>Steel Meridian</td></tr><tr><td>Red Veil</td><td>Steel Meridian</td><td>Cephalon Suda</td><td>Arbiters of Hexis</td></tr><tr><td>New Loka</td><td>The Perrin Sequence</td><td>Steel Meridian</td><td>Cephalon Suda</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">It’s worth noting that any Syndicate not listed for a particular Syndicate <strong>gains and loses no Rep when doing work for them</strong>. For example, Steel Meridian is completely neutral with the Arbiters of Hexis and Cephalon Suda. As such, you can generally focus on three Syndicates and be fine.</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true">Each Syndicate also offers a range of augment mods for specific frames that other Syndicates don’t. For example, I’m aligned with the <strong>Red Veil</strong> since they sell augment mods for frames like <strong>Khora, Mesa, Nekros, and Saryn,</strong> which are all frames I use actively.</p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="false">All in all, the best Syndicate comes down to <strong>what you need down the line</strong>. You should look at the mods that each Syndicate offers, then gauge it based on the frames that you currently play and the ones you plan to play. Listing one Syndicate and saying “this is the best one” would be both false and prove pointless once you’ve leveled them up and realize you don’t want their gear.</p>
