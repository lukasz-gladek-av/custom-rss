			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/">is officially out if you haven't noticed</a>, and frankly, if you didn't, no one could blame you since this has felt like one of the most muted launches from Activision in years. Muted or not, however, it's still a new Call of Duty, which means that sales should already be skyrocketing, right? Well, at least right now, that doesn't seem to be the case. According to the latest weekly GSD Sales Data report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european">The Game Business,</a> while Black Ops 7 was at the top of the charts for the week of November 10-16, it's far behind last year's Black Ops 6 launch numbers, and far behind Battlefield 6's launch numbers for EU sales.</p>



<p>According to GSD Data, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's launch week sales in the EU fell short of Battlefield 6's first week EU launch sales by 63%, and according The Game Business's estimates, it fell short of last year's Black Ops 6 first week launch sales by over 50%. </p>



<p>So even though it still made it to the top of the sales charts for premium game sales in the EU for its launch week, which means it was able to sell quite a lot of copies, potentially in the millions, by Call of Duty standards, this launch missed the mark.</p>



<p>Other notable entries on the chart include Anno 117: Pax Romana, which launched just two days ahead of Black Ops 7, and, according to The Game Business, more than doubled the launch numbers for the last major Anno game, Anno 1800.</p>



<p>Football Manager 26 remains in the top-10 list for revenue earned, though it dropped from the copies sold list. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/football-manager-26-knocks-battlefield-6-out-of-eu-sales-charts-top-spot-with-the-biggest-launch-in-gsd-weekly-charts-history/">it had an incredibly impressive first week</a>, it seems that the game's technical issues at launch and the poor word of mouth around that are impacting its sales.</p>



<p>And speaking of Battlefield 6, it remains in both the revenue top 10 and copies sold top 10. It's behind fellow EA title EA Sports FC 26 in both lists, but it is still in the top five. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is another title that was able to keep its spot in the top 10 for both the revenue earned and copies sold list as it continues to ride the wave of momentum from <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/">the release of its third and final DLC, lined up alongside a free trial weekend and major discount to the game on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Per The Game Business, here's the list of the top 10 games in the EU by copies sold for the week of November 10-16:</p>



<ol>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Anno 117: Pax Romana</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Pokemon Legends Z-A</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>

Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Deals on Sony’s PlayStation 5 are much more common than those on its <strong>PlayStation Portal</strong>, the handheld that can remotely stream games from the console via Wi-Fi. But for Black Friday, the Portal just got its first major discount to around $178.99 ($21 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJT5DJ16?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-Portal-Remote-Player-for-PS5-Console%2F5060699568" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsony-interactive-entertainment-playstation-portal-remote-player-midnight-black%2FJXHQ3C2H3K%2Fsku%2F6614840" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. Additionally, you can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/824326">save up to $100</a> on every configuration of the PlayStation 5, including the more powerful PlayStation 5 Pro.</p><p>The PlayStation Portal launched to relatively tepid reviews back in 2023, with <em>The Verge</em>’s Antonio G. Di Benedetto ultimately concluding the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">device is flawed, but fun</a> if you have fast internet. However, Sony has made strides to improve the experience over recent months, highlighted by a recent update that adds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814078/playstation-portal-ps5-cloud-streaming">cloud streaming</a>. The feature allows PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers to stream select PlayStation 5 games, including <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year">Astro Bot</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23642938/resident-evil-4-remake-review-xbox-ps5-steam">Resident Evil 4</a></em>, directly from the cloud instead of from their consoles over Wi-Fi. Additionally, PlayStation Portal users can stream select titles from their own library without needing to connect to their PS5 console.</p><p>In terms of hardware, the PlayStation Portal is essentially a standard DualSense controller split in half with a crisp eight-inch 1080p display in the middle. It supports DualSense haptics, too, so you get the full experience of the adaptive triggers and tilt controls in games that support the features. It’s great for playing PS5 games around the house; however, the overall experience is dependent on the quality of your Wi-Fi. If you plan to stream games from your PS5, we highly recommend connecting the console to ethernet.</p><p>While Sony has improved the overall experience of the PlayStation Portal, it still has some notable limitations. For instance, it only supports the wireless Pulse Explore earbuds and Pulse Elite headset. That means you can’t just connect any Bluetooth headphones you have lying around. It does, however, feature a 3.5mm headphone jack, allowing you to easily connect wired headphones.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/825985/sony-playstation-portal-black-friday-deal-sale-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/oneplus-13-reaches-record-low-amazon-turns-it-into-serious-iphone-17-rival-this-black-friday-2000646239</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oneplus-13-reaches-record-low-amazon-turns-it-into-serious-iphone-17-rival-this-black-friday.1361179/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Flagship iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones rule the premium space, but OnePlus challenges both with specs that match, if not outpace, most of their offerings at significantly lower costs. OnePlus 13 has a real shot at going head-to-head with the iPhone 17 and Galaxy S25 and offers flagship performance without that flagship price tag.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5808/">dropped the 256GB model to $699 for Black Friday, down from its usual $899</a>, which is <strong>an all-time low</strong> that makes this Samsung and Apple rival affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5808/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Industry-Leading Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite is Qualcomm’s high-end chipset, fabricated on a 3nm node</strong>. It strikes an excellent balance between high performance and energy efficiency. It handles demanding tasks from 4K video editing to high-end gaming without any thermal throttling or slowdown. Benchmarks peg it above Apple’s A18 Pro in multi-core operations and somewhere around Apple in single-core tasks. In reality, apps open instantly, multitasking remains fluid even with several dozen apps open, and games run smoothly at the highest settings available with stable frame rates.</p>
<p>The 12GB RAM makes sure everything runs smoothly from casual use to pro workflows. You can switch between apps without reloading them, keep extensive browser sessions running, and open demanding apps together with no performance degradation. This amount of RAM is more than what the majority of its competitors offer in this price bracket, not to mention that Samsung demands a much higher price for the same amount of RAM in its S25 series.</p>



<p>The <strong>80W SUPERVOOC fast charging</strong> fills the battery from empty to full in about 30 minutes, eliminating the anxiety of low battery during busy days. You plug in during a quick break and gain hours of usage. This is much faster than the iPhone 17’s 27W and Galaxy S25’s 45W, giving the OnePlus a substantial practical advantage. The 50W AIRVOOC wireless charging brings fast charging convenience without cables, matching what flagship phones typically offer through wired connections.</p>
<p>The <strong>Hasselblad camera partnership works with color science and image processing</strong> to ensure pictures appear natural instead of oversaturated social media-ready. The primary sensor takes vivid photos in bright daylight or challenging low-light situations. The camera system features ultrawide and telephoto lenses that maintain consistent quality across focal lengths. Hasselblad’s involvement shows in the nuanced color reproduction and dynamic range that gives photos a more refined look compared to typical Android processing.</p>



<p>The<strong> 6.82-inch AMOLED display features a refresh rate of 120Hz</strong> which smooths out scrolling and makes touches super responsive. The screen brightness goes as high as 4500 nits under very particular conditions, well enough that it’s readable in direct sunlight when other phones would wash out. It supports HDR10+ for better contrast while watching compatible video content.</p>
<p><strong>OxygenOS offers a clean Android experience (our favorite)</strong> with some very useful customizations that don’t bloat the interface. It also comes with three years of major Android updates and four years of security patches, keeping your phone current and secure. Additional features include game mode, parallel apps that allow running multiple accounts, and expansive gesture controls to enhance daily usability.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life reaches a full day of heavy use</strong> with screen-on time exceeding 7 hours for most users. With the combination of efficient processor and large battery capacity, you are not hunting for chargers in the middle of the day. The phone handles heavy tasks such as navigation, video streaming, and gaming without frequent power management.</p>
<p>You get here flagship spec with Snapdragon 8 Elite and 80W charging at $699 which is $200 less than Samsung’s equivalent S25 and $300+ below the iPhone 17. Leading performance meets extremely fast charging and Hasselblad camera processing for true value that makes the traditional flagship pricing from Apple and Samsung increasingly hard to justify.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-shows-off-new-ai-powered-fps-and-hopes-you%E2%80%99ve-forgotten-about-its-failed-nfts.1361176/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite the fact that many gamers seem to dislike or even outright hate AI-generated content in games, Ubisoft is pushing forward with it and now playtesting a shooter experiment built around AI-powered NPCs that can react to voice commands in real-time. Will it help the publisher regain some stability as it continues to struggle? I’m not sure. <a href="https://kotaku.com/we-live-in-hell-and-this-ubisoft-nft-that-requires-you-1848202326">All I can think about is the last time Ubisoft jumped on a tech fad with NFTs</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3mWlITIuWuu0MoVuR6o8ps/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-an-ai-experiment-to-change-the-game">On November 21,</a> after <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161">a delayed earnings call</a>, Ubisoft revealed <em>Teammates</em>, which the company refers to as its “first playable generative AI research project.” Built in the Snowdrop Engine, the same tech that powers games like <em>The Division 2</em> and<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Teammates</em> is a first-person shooter that includes an AI assistant named Jaspar and two AI-powered squadmates called Pablo and Sofia. Players can command these two to help them solve puzzles or engage in combat using “natural” voice commands.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Jaspar can help track missions, offer advice, and provide guidance when needed.</p>

 <p><em>Teammates</em> is built by the same team behind <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs">Ubisoft’s Neo NPCs</a>, which the company showed off in 2024 at GDC. The main goal of those AI-powered NPCs was to provide characters who can “dynamically” react to players in real-time, but within guidelines established by Ubisoft designers. The company said that it had guardrails in place to help stop the AI companions from hallucinating, being overly toxic, or going completely off script. But even Ubisoft admitted <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-s-first-playable-generative-ai-experience-is-an-r-d-experiment-called-teammates-">in an interview with <em>Game Developer</em></a> that <em>Teammates</em> and its tech were still rough around the edges.</p>

 <p>In interviews about <em>Teammates</em>, Ubisoft tries to make the case that this tech won’t remove the human element from video game development. I find that hard to believe, considering that over the last two years or so, the studio has <a href="https://www.blog.udonis.co/mobile-marketing/mobile-games/ubisoft-layoffs">laid off over 600 employees</a> as it cuts costs and struggles to ship games people get excited about. I’m not sure NPCs that sort of listen to you when you tell them to do something is going to turn things around for Ubisoft, but it could potentially let them gut even more of the company while pivoting to AI moonshots at a time when the company’s future has never been more uncertain.</p>

 <p>“Games of tomorrow will listen, understand, and react to players far more than today, and our research gives a glimpse of what adaptive, generative play could add on top of proven game systems,”<a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/ubisoft-generative-ai-game-teammates-neo-npc-developers-1236588038/"> Ubisoft director of GenAI gameplay Xavier Manzanares told <em>Variety</em>.</a> “It’s the first time we’ve shared an experiment this early with players, but our goal is to pave the way with a strong technology layer so our creators can start imagining the value it could bring to their project and players.”</p> <p>And who even knows if Ubisoft will still be developing AI-powered content and tools in a few years? Remember, it wasn’t that long ago that Ubisoft was all in on NFTs and the metaverse. Sure, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-captain-laserhawk-the-game-nft-crypto-1851726108">Ubisoft technically hasn’t</a> completely <a href="https://x.com/EdenOnline_exe/status/1989025366669701411">given up on either</a>. But it’s pretty clear now that the company is moving on to AI as the next big thing that it hopes can convince investors that it is on the cutting edge of the future and deserving of more money, please.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Oscar Isaac, star of Guillermo del Toro’s </span><i><span>Frankenstein </span></i><span>film, signs a lot of autographs. Prior to his role as the titular doctor in del Toro’s take on the Gothic horror classic, he was Poe Dameron in </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span>, Duke Leto Atreides in </span><i><span>Dune</span></i><span>, and one of the alternate Spider-Men in</span><i><span> Across the Spider-Verse</span></i><span>. This man has been made into a Funko Pop several times over, and he clearly feels some type of way about them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>He can probably spot an autograph reseller a mile away, too. That may be what happened when someone approached him outside of the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles yesterday and asked him to sign some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/funko-pop-starnger-things-bitty-bankrupt-2000642395"><span>Funko Pops</span></a><span>, to which Isaac replied, “Nah, man, I’m not doing those Funkos.” </span></p>

 <p><span>The POV recording, from the perspective of the Funko Pop wielder, showed the stranger holding out a </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2099</span></i><span> Funko Pop after Isaac signs a </span><i><span>Frankenstein </span></i><span>poster from the back of a truck, then stepping away, slightly dejected after the denial.</span></p>

 <div><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique/video/7574866863277100319" data-video-id="7574866863277100319" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@eladiioenrrique" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique?refer=embed">@eladiioenrrique</a>  <p>11/16/2025 – On Sunday, I got a last minute tip that Oscar Isaac was going to be at the Egyptian Theatre, (I know I told you this through DM but thank you again!), (you know who you are lol), so I tried to get him to sign my Spider-Man 2099 Funko Pops along with a Moon Knight Funko and a Spider-Man 2099 mini poster for my sister, of course in the video you only see the pops, but unfortunately Oscar stopped for the kid Grapher to sign Frankenstein items but he didn’t want to sign Marvel items. It was great to see him in person and honestly I don’t blame him at all, it was a long shot especially after hearing that he isn’t on good terms with Disney after that whole Kimmel incident but I was hoping he would sign the merch at least because imo he is still the most badass Miguel O’Hara and Moon Knight out there, he makes both characters, I’m sorry lol. I’m definitely going to get backlash for that lol. But anyways, thought I would share my interaction with him, and if Oscar sees this somehow, Oscar I understand and hopefully one day I can still get your autograph on the Spider-Man 2099 as well as my sister’s mini poster&nbsp;! Oh and if Disney sees this, please fix things with Oscar, we need him back in marvel, there is no Moon Knight or Spider-Man 2099 without him. <a title="spiderman2099" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/spiderman2099?refer=embed">#spiderman2099</a>  <a title="oscarisaac" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/oscarisaac?refer=embed">#OscarIsaac</a>  <a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp?refer=embed">#fyp</a>  <a title="disney" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/disney?refer=embed">#Disney</a>  <a title="frankenstein" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/frankenstein?refer=embed">#Frankenstein</a> </p> <p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - eladiioenrrique" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7574866731131292447?refer=embed">♬ original sound – eladiioenrrique</a> </p></section> </blockquote></div>   <p><span>The Funko Pop collector, known as </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique?lang=en"><span>EladiioEnrrique on TikTok</span></a><span>, alleged in the caption of his video that Isaac “didn’t want to sign Marvel items.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was a long shot, especially after hearing that he isn’t on good terms with Disney after that whole Kimmel incident,” he wrote, referring to Isaac’s recent </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XciB_FC2fzs"><i><span>GQ</span></i><span> interview</span></a><span> in which he said he’d consider reprising his role as Poe in </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span> only “if they can kinda figure out [how], you know, not [to] succumb to fascism.” He was referring to ABC and Disney’s brief suspension of their late-night show host back in September after Jimmy Kimmel joked about the Trump administration’s reaction to the assassination of Charlie Kirk.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s not clear if Isaac was refusing to sign Marvel merch specifically or if he was just refusing to sign Funko Pops in general, as they’re incredibly popular on the autograph reseller market. There are nearly 100,000 results for “signed Funko Pop” on eBay, with many of them going for a few hundred dollars. It’s now not uncommon for people like the owner of the aforementioned TikTok channel to follow celebrities around with several pieces of their respective merch in hand and ask for autographs, only to later try to flip them online for thousands of dollars.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eladiioenrrique/video/7570077334158511390?lang=en"><span>different video from EladiioEnrrique’s account</span></a><span> shows a horde of people waiting for pop star Miley Cyrus to sign autographs. One person has all of her vinyls taped together in a vertical stack, while another has several items hung from a hangar, all to make a mass-signing as quick and painless as possible.</span></p>

 <p><span>Most of EladiioEnrrique’s channel is just first-person POV videos of him getting celebrities to sign records, CDs, and, of course, Funko Pops. His latest video says that he got a “last-minute tip” that Isaac would be at the Egyptian Theater before rushing over to get the signatures. But he’s not a reseller. “I am a collector,” he told <em>Kotaku</em> via TikTok DM. “I don’t resell my signed items simply because I don’t see it as right.”</span></p> <p>“It’s definitely not my job, I know a lot of the graphers do actually do this for a living and go to eBay immediately to sell it,” he said when asked if he did this for a living. “I know this because I’ve seen their posts at times, but I can’t do it for a living, hell no.”</p> <p><span>After Isaac refused to sign his toys, EladiioEnrrique stepped away politely and wrote a very understanding but hopeful caption for his video.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“If Oscar sees this somehow, Oscar I understand and hopefully one day I can still get your autograph on the Spider-Man 2099 as well as my sister’s mini poster! Oh and if Disney sees this, please fix things with Oscar, we need him back in Marvel, there is no Moon Knight or Spider-Man 2099 without him.” it read.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>May all superfans be this well-adjusted.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new AI-driven research project from Ubisoft, called Teammates, has been revealed. The news comes after the company’s earnings call earlier today, which bolstered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-hits-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong numbers for Assassin’s Creed: Mirage</a>.</p>







<p>AI in video games isn’t anything new, though the way it’s being used is. In the past, AI would play the role of NPCs, doing commands by code and filling the screen. Now, the process can replace art design, voice acting, and even entire games. Still, it does further exacerbates the lack of human touch to a project, which is never a good thing. Now, it seems Ubisoft is keen on getting in on the AI bubble with a new research project, aptly called Teammates.</p>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-s-teammates-uses-an-ai-voice-assistant-self-programmable-npcs">Ubisoft’s Teammates Uses an AI Voice Assistant, Self-Programmable NPCs</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today we’re unveiling Teammates, an AI-driven research project exploring how new tech can deepen the player experience.</p><p>More than just talk, this brand-new experiment adds depth to gameplay by going beyond AI chatbots and turning NPCs into real teammates. Find out more:… <a href="https://t.co/SyISwjJ5af">pic.twitter.com/SyISwjJ5af</a></p></div>— Ubisoft (@Ubisoft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1991930899252810021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3mWlITIuWuu0MoVuR6o8ps/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-an-ai-experiment-to-change-the-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>, as well as Twitter/X, Ubisoft shared a look at the AI-driven Teammates. While we don’t know how it’ll play, we do get some insight into the project. Framed as an FPS, Teammates has you and two AI NPCs go to an enemy base and save five members of your resistance. To aid you, you’ll have Jaspar, an AI voice assistant who provides tips on gameplay, story, and can tamper with settings with a simple voice command. </p>



<p>The blog goes a bit into detail on the gameplay and your AI NPCs, Pablo and Sofia. Via voice commands, you can tell them where to go, who to shoot, and build the narrative. Teammates’ Narrative Director, Virginie Mosser, spoke on the NPCs in the blog, saying,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>We hope players will feel like they’re shaping the story themselves, not just following it,</strong>” states Mosser. “<strong>When I talk to [my AI squad mate] Sofia, she reacts to what I tell her and it changes my experience. For me, this is a real breakthrough and allows players to experience the story in their own way.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As of now, there are no plans to do anything with the public just yet. An explainer video is set to come soon, but no date as to when. Playtests did happen earlier this year and more will come soon. The team stresses throughout the piece that human creativity and ingenuity is at the heart of Teammates. Whether or not that statement is accurate does tip a bit to the side given the abundant usage of AI and chatbots. </p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Insider Gaming did release a story on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-multiplayer-shooter-project-scout-rumor-2025/">Project Scout</a>, an in-the-works multiplayer shooter at Ubisoft. From the looks of the screenshots and UI, Teammates could be the basis for the leaked title. Should Project Scout come to be, perhaps you’ll be fighting alongside programmable AI and not your friends.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6 clash was always going to be a fun narrative at the end of 2025. The player count for both games could determine their long-term success, and tell us which game is ‘winning.’</p>



<p>There’s a point to be made that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-names-battlefield-6-best-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> was going to have the edge with it being the first new release in several years. Then again, Call of Duty is a never-ending behemoth that continues to conquer the gaming world. The Black Ops 7 hype wasn’t great, but again, it’s Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Let’s break down their player count stats and see how each game is faring.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-people-are-playing-battlefield-6">How Many People Are Playing Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A big battle. Credit to EA and Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 is currently averaging 150,000 to 200,000 players daily, almost two months after its launch.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, Battlefield 6 hit a peak of <strong>747,440</strong> players (according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>) early on. This is when the hype for the game was otherworldly. Games always drop off as time goes on, but retaining well over 150K players daily is impressive.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s 24-hour peak—on November 21—was <strong>215,985</strong>, showing how much the community is still invested in the shooter. Also, if you didn’t know, SteamDB is considered the leading metric for player counts on PC, and there’s no software to accurately track console data.</p>



<p>With Season 1 launching, following up the RedSec addition, there’s plenty for Battlefield 6 players to enjoy and look forward to. The game will likely get another huge player bump around Christmas as many are inevitably gifted the FPS for the holiday season.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-breaks-franchise-sales-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 has broken franchise sales records</a>, and positive player count numbers will probably carry on.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-people-are-playing-black-ops-7">How Many People Are Playing Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s much harder to track Black Ops 7’s player count data, but we know for a fact that it’s not averaging more than roughly 70,000 players daily, and this figure is likely far fewer.</strong></p>



<p>Individual CoD games are not tracked on SteamDB. Instead, it tracks ‘Call of Duty,’ and multiple CoD titles fall under this banner. This means that even though Steam shows a daily figure for Call of Duty, this is adding up several games: Black Ops 7, Black Ops 6, Modern Warfare 3, etc.</p>



<p>On November 14—Black Ops 7’s launch—SteamDB reported a 24-hour peak of <strong>84,319</strong>. Don’t forget that this stat counts other recent Call of Duty games as well. Meaning the Black Ops 7 player count was probably closer to 70K or 60K at launch—maybe lower! </p>



<p>One week after launch, its 24-hour peak was already down to <strong>72,886</strong> players. Like Battlefield 6, the player count could easily rise over Christmas, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Season 1</a> hasn’t launched yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-people-playing-battlefield-6-or-black-ops-7-more">Are People Playing Battlefield 6 Or Black Ops 7 More?</h2>



<p><strong>Right now, people are declaratively playing Battlefield 6 more than Black Ops 7.</strong></p>



<p>Using the data above, you can see that even with seven weeks extra on the clock, Battlefield likely has between two and four times the player base Black Ops 7 does on Steam. Figures could be different on PlayStation and Xbox, but with reports that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sales-are-down-50-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Sales Are Down 50% In Europe</a>, the story might be a similar one.</p>



<p>Are you playing Black Ops 7 or Battlefield 6? Could this be a wake-up call for Activision? The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is where you can let the world know your thoughts.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Multiplayer Review - Strong Map Design Makes Multiplayer A Blast</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In the patch notes, Treyarch says the studio "slightly overshot" its target balance, and a small tuning change is made to reduce this aim-assist penalty from 35% to 25%.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal for this new mechanic and our other aim-assist range changes is to provide the most competitive experience for all players and inputs," the developer says. "Aim Assist is one of the most integral components of gameplay feel, so it's crucial for us to settle on tuning that both feels great to play with and hits our balance goals."</p><p dir="ltr">To help provide better balance with Black Ops 7's assault rifles and submachine guns, Treyarch has included a damage range buff across all submachine guns in the game, and all of the assault rifles will feature slightly increased flinch.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says this is just the beginning of the weapon tuning players can expect in the coming weeks.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the game's powerful Drone Pod field upgrade is now nerfed with the following changes:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Increased Drone Pod charge time from 2.5 to 3 minutes</li><li dir="ltr">Reduced Drone Pod active drone duration from 10 to 8 seconds</li><li dir="ltr">Reduced Drone Pod damage from 60 to 50 damage</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The update includes Zombies changes meant to improve the main Ashes of the Damned Easter egg experience for all players, including adjustments to the difficulty of the boss fight. The boss fight's Hoard Husk will now regenerate after a minute of collection and give 25% more health, and the boss's missile barrage has reduced effectiveness. It also reduces damage to passengers riding in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-zombies-how-to-repair-and-upgrade-ol-tessie/1100-6536336/" data-ref-id="1100-6536336">Ol' Tessie</a> and removes the repair cooldown.</p><p dir="ltr">To improve the Zombies quest for solo players, Zursa the zombie bear will no longer spawn in solo boss fights before round 100 and will have reduced speed.</p><p dir="ltr">This new update also unlocks the campaign's Endgame mode for all Black Ops 7 players to enjoy. Those who unlocked Endgame naturally by beating the campaign will receive a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-endgame-will-soon-be-playable-for-everyone-right-away/1100-6536359/">variety of Black Ops 7 rewards</a>. Black Ops 7 features double level XP, weapon XP, and GobbleGum earn rates from now until November 24.</p><p dir="ltr">The full Black Ops 7 patch notes can be found below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-season-1-content-new-maps-and-holiday-events-confirmed/1100-6535666/">Season 1 of Black Ops 7</a> begins in December, which will add the game's first battle pass, Warzone integration, additional multiplayer maps, and a brand-new Zombies map. Season 1's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-slay-zombies-in-space-thanks-to-new-cod-black-ops-7-zombies-map/1100-6536434/" data-ref-id="1100-6536434">Astra Malorum Zombies map trailer</a> reveals the fight against the undead is headed into space.</p><h2>BLACK OPS 7 GLOBAL</h2><h3>Aim Assist</h3><p>We intentionally took a big swing with our Aim Assist changes between Beta and Launch. Now that we've had time to collect data and player feedback, we're making a slight adjustment as we do with all aspects of gameplay over time to hit our targets and address the wide range of feedback.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launched with a new right-stick aiming requirement for achieving maximum Rotational Aim Assist strength. When the right-stick isn’t used, or isn’t tracking a target effectively, players now experience a minimum Rotational Aim Assist strength. At launch, the minimum Rotational Aim Assist was a 35% reduction from the Beta. Our goal for this new mechanic and our other Aim Assist range changes is to provide the most competitive experience for all players and inputs. This slightly overshot our balance target, so we’re making a small tuning adjustment to the minimum Rotational Aim Assist.</p><p>Aim Assist is one of the most integral components of gameplay feel, so it’s crucial for us to settle on tuning that both feels great to play with and hits our balance goals. As always, we'll continue to closely examine game data and player feedback.</p><ul><li>Minimum Rotational Aim Assist penalty reduced from 35% to 25%.</li></ul><h3>Weapons</h3><p>We are pushing an early round of weapon tuning that aims at addressing some of the common pieces of feedback we have been seeing at launch. The main area of feedback has been SMG balance, particularly in relation to Assault Rifles. Most of our changes today aim to reduce the versatility of our highest performing ARs, and improve the mid-range performance of SMGs. You can find more details below. Aside from the SMGs, we have a handful of other individual weapon and prestige attachment adjustments. In general we really like the class variety we have been seeing so far.</p><p>This is just the beginning for weapon tuning in the opening weeks of Black Ops 7. We’ll be continuing to dial things in across weapons, prestige attachments, and the general attachment portfolio as we roll into our first season.</p><h4>Assault Rifles</h4><p>Assault Rifles are receiving a small flinch nerf so that they flinch harder than SMGs. This is not a huge adjustment, as we also don’t want to introduce lucky headshots into our full-auto gunfights. This flinch increase is small enough that it may affect players aiming for headshots and not well centered, but still not force most torso shots into headshots unintentionally.</p><p>Weapon Class Adjustment</p><ul><li>Received Flinch increased from .15N to .18N.</li></ul><h4>SMGs</h4><p>SMGs are receiving a similar list of buffs across the board. Baseline, they are all receiving an improvement to their final damage range to add a handful of meters to some of their mid-range power. In addition, multiple attachments are receiving substantial improvements to their damage range traits. Our goal here is to help SMGs to contend with ARs more effectively out into medium ranges, but also require some build investment to do so especially well. We still want players to make some choices between creating ultra-fast SMG builds and those that have higher range capabilities, but Gunfighter shouldn’t feel like a requirement.</p><p>Similarly, the Rear Grip attachments that improve recoil are seeing a buff. There’s a tough handling tradeoff when taking recoil in that node, so we felt there was room to push these further. A few of the SMGs are receiving additional, baseline improvements to recoil as well.</p><p>Overall, we think this will give SMGs a more solid footing in Black Ops 7. We’ll continue to fine tune to make sure both SMGs and ARs have a role to play across our map portfolio.</p><p><strong>Weapon Class Adjustment</strong></p><ul><li>Received Flinch reduced from 0.17N to 0.12N.</li></ul><h4>Marksman Rifles</h4><p>The Warden 308 and M34 Novaline are both very high-power, precision weapons that we see doing very well so far in Black Ops 7. Our sentiment here is the same as the X9 Maverick, in that we are excited to have Marksman Rifles in the mix and want to keep it that way. For now we want to make sure there’s some counterplay to these weapons, and that playing aggressively with them requires attachment investment. Upping the flinch they receive and hitting the handling and mobility is the approach we’re taking for that.</p><h2>MULTIPLAYER</h2><h3>UI</h3><ul><li>Increased viewable minimap area an additional 10% on top of previous 15% increase.</li></ul><h3>Field Upgrades</h3><ul><li>Drone Pod  <ul><li>Increased Drone Pod charge time from 2.5 to 3 minutes.</li><li>Reduced Drone Pod active drone duration from 10 to 8 seconds.</li><li>Reduced Drone Pod damage from 60 to 50 damage.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Scorestreaks</h3><ul><li>Hand Cannon  <ul><li>Increased ammo for the Hand Cannon Akimbo Overlock from 5 to 7 rounds per gun; reduced hipfire spread by 44%.</li><li>Reduced ammo for the Hand Cannon Extended Mag Overclock from 12 to 10 rounds.</li></ul></li><li>LDBR  <ul><li>Increased missile count for the LDBR Second Strike Overclock from 9 to 13 missiles per target.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Modes</h3><ul><li>Adjusted FFA spawn influencer size for all maps to address bad spawn issues.</li></ul><h3>Challenges</h3><ul><li>Changed the following camo challenge requirement:  <ul><li>“Kill enemies affected by your Tactical Equipment” to “Kill enemies affected by your Tactical or non-lethal Scorestreak”.</li></ul></li><li>Fixed an issue where the Popcorn Medal wasn’t being awarded when getting 2 or more kills with the Needle Drone or Semtex Lethal Equipment.</li></ul><h3>Stability</h3><ul><li>Various crash and stability updates.</li></ul><h2><b>ZOMBIES</b></h2><h3>Maps</h3><ul><li><b>Ashes of the Damned</b><ul><li>Reduced difficulty for the Boss fight in Ashes of the Damned.  <ul><li>Hoard Husk will regenerate after a minute of collection and give 25% more health.</li><li>Missiles have reduced effectiveness and will no longer fire while a Beam Attack is charging.</li><li>Interrupting the Beam Attack no longer reduces its cooldown before round 100.</li><li>Reduced damage to passengers riding in Ol' Tessie and removed repair cooldown.</li><li>Increased cooldown on the boss ramming Ol' Tessie in its immune phase.</li><li>Zursa will no longer spawn in Solo before round 100 and has reduced speed.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to stand on a light fixture at Vandorn Farm.</li><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to block zombie pathing with Ol' Tessie.</li></ul><h3>UI</h3><ul><li>Addressed a rare issue when entering Ol’ Tessie that could cause the HUD to refresh or the boss to spawn without a health bar.</li></ul><h3>Challenges</h3><ul><li>Increased the amount of Dead Wire Ammo kills required to unlock the Pathfinder Camo for the DS20 Mirage from 5 to 300.</li><li>Changed the following camo challenge requirement:  <ul><li>“Get Kills shortly after using a Field Upgrade” to "Get Kills while a Field Upgrade is active”.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Stability</h3><ul><li>Various crash and stability updates.</li></ul><h2>CO-OP CAMPAIGN / ENDGAME</h2><h3>General</h3><ul><li>Endgame is now available for all players who own Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</li></ul><h3>Loadouts</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where some attachments on weapon builds would not be present after loading into a match.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii has been designing games for upwards of 40 years, and though he's 71 today, he still remains heavily involved in the development of the long-running RPG franchise that began in 1986. During our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">cover story </a>trip to Tokyo, Japan, to play <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>, <em>Game Informer </em>had the opportunity to interview Horii for 90 minutes and asked him about the differences between game development in the 1980s and in 2025.</p><p>He says the entire landscape is completely different.&nbsp;</p><p>"You know, the development landscape is just completely different compared to back then," Horii tells <em>Game Informer</em>. "On the original Dragon Quest, we had a team of less than 10 people, but now we have a team of 300 to 400 spending years and years making one game; not to mention the rising development cost, too. So it's just completely different."&nbsp;</p><p>Horii says back in the early years of Dragon Quest, he recalls doing the programming, some of the art – "I would just do everything by myself," he recalls, reminiscing on his early development days leading up to Dragon Quest.&nbsp;</p><p>"People would just do that, and that [game] actually got sold as a finished product back then – just one person working on a single game," he adds. "That's just not something that can happen today."&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, games developed by just one person release all the time, and there's an argument to be made that the growth within the indie scene proves it's not only possible, but easier than ever. But Horii is likely thinking within the Dragon Quest franchise, and in that regard, he's right – making something like Dragon Quest XI or the in-development Dragon Quest XII as a solo developer sounds like a much more challenging, if not impossible, task compared to the 1980s.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined launches on February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet to access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/21/yuji-horii-on-early-days-in-game-dev-i-would-just-do-everything]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-era-100-falls-to-new-record-low-now-cheaper-than-speakers-with-mediocre-sound-quality-2000646231</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonos-era-100-falls-to-new-record-low-now-cheaper-than-speakers-with-mediocre-sound-quality.1361137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For years, Sonos made its name with WiFi streaming alone, avoiding Bluetooth at all costs to keep audio quality high. It finally relented with portable speakers, realizing convenience does matter for some use cases without invalidating the core WiFi basis of what makes Sonos so great. The <strong>Era 100</strong> competes directly with Bose and Sony’s premium offerings while it currently sells for mid-range pricing that makes no sense given its capabilities. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/">dropped this to $169 for Black Friday, down from $199, which is a record low</a> that puts exceptional audio within reach of anyone looking for Bluetooth speakers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>47% Faster Processor Powers Dual-Tweeter Architecture</h2>
<p>The next-generation processor handles more complex audio processing in real time and enables features that previous Sonos speakers couldn’t support. Dual tweeters create genuine stereo separation from a single speaker, placing instruments and vocals in distinct left and right positions. This architecture produces a soundstage that fills rooms rather than feeling like sound emanates from a single point. The <strong>25% larger midwoofer extends bass response deeper than the previous generation</strong>, and gives kick drums and bass lines actual impact without needing a separate subwoofer for most music.</p>
<p>This compact design fits easily on bookshelves, kitchen counters, desks and nightstands. You place the speaker wherever you really spend time, rather than arranging furniture around audio equipment. <strong>The size makes it truly portable inside your home</strong>&nbsp;and moves from room to room as the day progresses with you. It weighs enough to feel substantial yet remains light enough to carry easily in one hand.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi streaming provides lossless audio quality from the likes of Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music. The connection also remains stable throughout a home without the dropouts that plague Bluetooth in larger spaces. You control playback through the Sonos app which aggregates all of your streaming services into one interface. AirPlay 2 support adds another streaming option for Apple users who want to send audio directly from their devices.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth connectivity handles quick pairing with phones</strong>, tablets, and laptops when you want simple wireless playback. You press a button on the back of the speaker, and instantly, your device finds it. This mode is great for playing podcasts, audiobooks, or music from apps that aren’t integrated into the Sonos ecosystem. The implementation of Bluetooth maintains decent quality, though Wi-Fi streaming sounds noticeably better when that option is available.</p>
<p>The Line-In Adapter includes <strong>a 3.5mm auxiliary input to connect turntables</strong>, CD players, or other analog sources. This adapter is available separately but turns the Era 100 into a powered speaker for vinyl setups or legacy audio equipment. It combines digital streaming with analog input flexibility that pure Bluetooth speakers simply can’t compete with.</p>



<p>Trueplay tuning uses your iPhone’s microphone to <strong>analyze room acoustics and then automatically adjust the speaker’s EQ</strong>. You wave your phone around the listening area for about a minute, and it makes a custom sound profile optimized for your particular space. This calibration compensates for room characteristics, such as hard surfaces that create reflections or soft furnishings that absorb sound. The difference between tuned and untuned sound is immediately noticeable, with vocals becoming clearer and bass tightening up.</p>
<p><strong>Alexa integration enables voice control</strong> for music playback, smart home commands, and general queries. The built-in microphones pick up voice commands clearly even when music plays at moderate volumes. You can add the Era 100 to multi-room setups with other Sonos speakers, creating a whole-home audio system that plays synchronized music everywhere or different content in each room. This ecosystem approach means starting with one speaker and expanding over time as budget allows.</p>
<p>For $169, you’re getting Sonos premium audio engineering, with both WiFi and Bluetooth for less than mid-range speakers elsewhere that can’t compete on sound quality. Similarly priced Bose and Sony speakers rely exclusively on Bluetooth and don’t have the multi-room capabilities that make Sonos special.</p>

                <p>For years, Sony focused almost exclusively on releasing its games for PlayStation platforms, and while the company's focus remains in the console market, it has expanded to PC in recent years. A new report says Sony is having plenty of success with these efforts, with its PC releases thus far collectively bringing in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.</p><p>A <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-selling-playstation-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from Alinea Analytics</a> put forth this number, based on its own research. The best-selling PlayStation game on PC is Helldivers 2, the report said, selling more than 12.7 million copies.</p><p>In total, the report said Sony's five top-selling PC releases on Steam have passed 43 million copies sold collectively. The gross revenue from these sales reportedly amounted to $1.5 billion. This includes $1.2 billion for Sony and Valve's cut of $350 million or more.

			<p>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord is now more than three years removed from its 1.0 release in October 2022 (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-early-access-preview/">five years removed from its early access launch</a>), and developer TaleWorlds Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-gameplay-trailer/">is set to release the game's biggest expansion so far.</a> War Sails adds naval combat to the game for the first time, brings back a beloved faction with the return of the Nords from the original Mount and Blade, adds a whole new biome to explore, new skills for players to master, and a slew of tweaks and changes to the base game with a free update.</p>



<p>Ahead of its launch, I got the chance to play some of the coming expansion and hear from the developers about everything coming in War Sails. I also got the chance to speak to Falk Engel, senior producer at TaleWorlds Entertainment on Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord and Gökçen Karaağaç, the team lead on the game's design team.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>Firstly, I'd like to hear about the key upgrades to ship combat in War Sails, and the impact it has on the rest of the game.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>I mean, the biggest, I guess, would be the ram [ramming ships] and the balistas, because they kind of open up new ways of ship destruction</em>, <em>but the primary method of ship destruction, as you can see in the gameplay, is fire. The other things that end up being more impactful are the campaign upgrades that get you to carry more troops or for your troops to have higher morale or your ship having a higher sea burton so you can handle the storms or simply travel faster, those upgrades end up having a bigger impact on your gameplay overall.</em> <em>Also, the other note to that is not all ships have access to all upgrades. Some ships are more customizable or more all-rounder ships, while others are more purpose-built. They make up for that [lack of customization] by being really specialized ships. They are really good at what they try to do.</em></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>To add to that, there's also the option to increase your cargo holds, so that you can be more oriented in your upgrades towards travel and trade or more combat oriented.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is it possible to do coordinated land and sea attacks from two different armies?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>Not in the way you're asking, no.</em> <em>We don't have a hybrid combat system, where you can have some troops at sea</em> <em>and some troops at land interact, but we do have methods to land in the naval</em>, <em>especially when you are trying to conquer towns, especially coastal towns, you need to be ready for both naval and land battles, as the defenders might attack you on both sides, so there is that, but no hybrid missions.</em></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>In terms of the campaign side of this, there is no way for you to directly tell another party or army to go somewhere and do something at that exact moment, but of course, as a player, you have the ability to observe what the other army is doing, and then coordinate with that action</em>. </p>



<p><strong>Will the skills of troops affect the ship that they're on during combat or is it only the captain's skill that matters?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>It's only the captain's skill that matters;</em> troops use their own skills. Apart from if they are a Mariner or not,<em> if they are not, they kind of get hampered in their combat abilities, but their skills do not affect the ship's stats or abilities</em>.</p>



<p><strong>The three new skills that are being added, Mariner, Boatswain, and Shipmaster, are those replacing the old skills, or do players get an additional attribute?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>You don't get additional attributes, but each of the skills kind of corresponds to two different attributes. I'm not certain at the moment, but it's like Vigor and Control is the Mariner, for example. Previously, each attribute, each skill was combined to a single attribute, but these new naval skills are touching two of the other ones. So, if you're already a good tactician and a decent warrior, if you use those attributes, you will be a good Mariner anyway. Not right away, but it will be easy for you to be a good Mariner.</em></p>



<p><strong>What does the new Nord faction add to the game? Why did you want to bring the Nords back in?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>I mean, there's definitely nostalgia. It is one of those factions, as a culture, that's easy to justify</em> <em>coming in. 'Oh, they were always up there, and now they've started to pick up their ships and come here.' So, story-wise it makes more sense</em> <em>to bring them back. That is one part of it; the other one is what they are bringing to the table, land battle-wise. They also give us room and reason to put more effort into infantry combat. They are bringing the heaviest and highest-tier level</em> <em>infantry in the game</em>, <em>which kind of crushes through almost every infantry, and whatever it can't crush it trades quite well into. Beyond that, of course, whatever the other factions get naval-wise, Nords can do it better, in almost every aspect. Except trade, they're kind of okay-ish in that one, so that's their gimmick.</em></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>Aside from this - trade is a nice keyword - they do produce some trade items that you can engage with. When you go to their lands, they'll have different environments, biomes, architecture, etc. So there's just more to explore; they look quite interesting. When you go into their towns, you'll see that their housing is inspired by ships. They have this kind of unique layout on the map, where there's Nordvik, the large portion that is kind of interacting down with Sturgia, and then you have towards Vineland, this island area, where there's another town, and that's not something that we had before.</em></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>One unique aspect to them is that they're a lot less town-focused, but they have a lot more castles, so they have like four well-supplied towns, but most of their lords are just ruling over castles, so their economy is a bit more military focused in a sense and less...not as powerful as Aserai for example, but also not as fragile. They have a more safe economy, compared to other factions</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Will the politics of the game get any big changes with this new expansion?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>We already introduced some in the Beta branch and in the base game update, and we are going to improve upon it. We're going to improve on the alliances and how we conduct them, but inner kingdom-wise, there are new policies that are both naval-related, for the base game as well, that inspire some</em> <em>different roleplaying opportunities as well as some new strategies</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>And maybe even beyond this, I mean, war is an extension of politics</em>. <em>The design team, Gökçen</em> <em>and others, have spent quite a bit of effort on improving the way in which factions consider wars, whether they're making progress, if this war is sensible,</em> <em>distance, the exposure in terms of the settlements and so forth, so even if that's not an outright addition, it changes the politics.</em></p>



<p><strong>While this expansion and naval combat are single-player only,</strong> <strong>there's also a big update releasing alongside War Sails for all players. Are there any multiplayer improvements coming in this new update?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>There are some improvements that are included, they are not the focus, and I think we should be clear on that to not mislead anyone.</em> <em>You've seen, as part of the beta, significant visual improvements that we've done through the atmosphere, and I think that's something that we're looking to take to the multiplayer as well. We're also looking at potentially including a new multiplayer team. With regards to what the future holds, that's something we're not discussing at the moment.</em></p>



<p><strong>So, no word on future DLC plans beyond War Sails?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>Yes, that as well. Essentially, our approach tends to be that we want to be very sure about what we're doing before we bring it to players, because we don't see the benefit in creating false hope.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is cross-play functionality potentially on the horizon for Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>I don't want to say something wrong, I mean, I think I can say that there's no active work on that right now. We have to consider some aspects of it, like there are some aspects of it that are internal, the challenges associated with such a change. But there's also just the simple, 'would it actually add to the player experience to have cross-play</em>,' <em>'is it fun to play the game on controller versus someone who's on a mouse and keyboard.</em> <em>Especially with our multiplayer community, which is extremely, I mean, - </em></p>



<p><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>Dedicated [laughs]</em></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>Dedicated, yeah [laughs], I mean, I can't beat them. I don't think I would do better with a controller.</em></p>



<p><strong>I noticed in the notes about the big update coming for all players alongside War Sails' release includes "<em>expanded modding capabilities," </em>can you go into what that means? Is there anything modders should look out for in this update?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>There is a long list of things <a href="https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/e1-6-0-v1-3-1-modding-changes.443896/">that are part of the patch notes</a></em>. <em>I think one of the most buzzword-y things related to modding is the ability to crouch and use weapons at the same time. You know, anything with muskets, those kinds of mods, [modders] are really excited about, and I think are already interacting with as part of the beta. The [live] release itself, I don't think we'll see substantial additions there because we've already shared the vast majority of what we have done in the beta. Our modding community tends to engage with that early on so that their mods are ready when we push it live. When it comes to War Sails in and of itself, of course the support for naval gameplay, for pathfinding across the sea on the world map, for using ships. I think there are probably already some mods that have some level of seafaring, but if they have an interest in the DLC, I think that will both expand the capabilities that they have in that regard, as well as the existing content that they can co-opt or utilize in their mods as well.</em></p>



<p><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>Part of this effort on our end for modding capabilities is kind of to compensate for the changes coming into the base game. For example, even the way the water is rendered is changed, and we want to make sure that it is an easy effort for people who make their own world map to switch to the new system. So, some of these efforts also coincide with the new work we are kind of creating for our modders, to build up and continue supporting their creations.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is there still work being done on the Claimants that were shown a few years ago?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>So, we can't comment on the Claimants themselves at this point, but we can maybe say that there are some features that relate to them that we are still working on. I think we might have mentioned some of them previously. They do relate to other topics people care about such as making trades</em> <em>or valuables, but we don't want to talk about features that may still take quite a bit of time, because the moment that we make them more tangible, people tend to get very excited and then potentially very disappointed that it takes that amount of time before they get the answers.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is support for DLSS Frame Generation still on its way?</strong> <strong>Can you provide an update on when it might arrive?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>I can't give you an update now, I will check with the engine team and get back to you.</em></p>



<p><strong>Switching to consoles, are there any plans to take advantage of the more powerful hardware in PS5 Pro?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>We don't have anything specific to mention on that currently. We can say, of course, that the work on the DLC has seen a lot of optimization in terms of memory, in terms of performance and so forth, which will also benefit consoles, both in the base game as well as the DLC.</em></p>



<p><strong>Do you have anything else you'd like to say to the community?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>As always, our heartfelt gratitude for the long journey we've walked together and the support that people have given us over the years. It's awesome to see that people are still very excited. Personally, I come from the community, so it's always kind of fun to still have that engagement for a lot of our developers. It's great to see people talk about the DLC, talk about the game, give us feedback, and share their excitement for what's coming, and it will be very cool to see how they enjoy the DLC.</em></p>



<p><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>Have fun, enjoy the game, do not sail a ship that you can't afford to lose.</em></p>



<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/save-a-massive-350-on-the-16-inch-asus-tuf-gaming-laptop-at-amazon-today-2000645816</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-tuf-f16-gaming-laptop-rtx-4050-takes-a-black-friday-price-hit-that-makes-zero-sense.1361110/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s no shortage of laptops in the market, but not every powerful laptop is a gaming laptop. Standard laptops (made for everyday work and casual use) prioritize features like battery life, decent display, and lower costs. Gaming machines, on the other hand, pack high-performance components that can let you game and work on creative projects without slowing down. These options typically have stronger dedicated GPUs and CPUs, faster RAMs, and a bigger storage capacity, but as you’d expect, they can cost a pretty penny.</p>
<p>Most solid options out there with all this and more sit well over $1,500, but that changes today. Amazon has kick-started its Black Friday and Cyber Monday celebrations already with some impressive early deals across a range of categories.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/"> As part of that, the retailer has also dropped the price of the 16-inch ASUS TUF gaming laptop by 32%.</a> On a regular day, it would run you around $1,100, but you can snap it up for just $750 today. Honestly, that’s what most entry-level machines cost nowadays, which makes this offer no less than a steal. Of course, the stock is selling out fast, so there’s not much time left to save. If you have been wanting to upgrade your gaming experience for less, today is the day to make the move. In fact, this laptop can also be a great Christmas gift for a player in your life!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful GPU, Immersive Visuals</h2>
<p>There’s nothing too crazy going on with the design. The laptop looks and feels sturdy, plus comes with a subtle embossed TUF logo on its cover. The brand has thoroughly tested it to meet Military Grade testing standards, so you can expect it to handle everyday wear and tear well. Harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures, high humidity, and dirt won’t affect its performance one bit. But despite the sturdy, don’t-mess-with-me build, it’s lightweight enough to carry around easily. Take it to your office, nearby cafe, and even on some adventures without a worry.</p>
<p>Open it up and you’re greeted with a 16-inch Full HD display, which pushes immersive, detailed visuals. The 90% screen-to-body ratio gives you plenty of space to work and play. Color accuracy is excellent in all lighting conditions, making the content appear lifelike. The display also supports a 144Hz refresh rate to keep everything running smoothly, while the Adaptive-Sync technology actively reduces lag and minimizes stuttering for ultra-smooth gameplay.</p>



<p>Power is handled by an Intel Core i5 210H processor that’s paired with the underrated NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050. The GPU offers a significant performance boost over its predecessor and is a great entry-level option for those on a budget. Then there’s a modest 16GB RAM for increased efficiency. It’s not massive, but does a good job of handling everyday multitasking and most modern titles without throwing a fit. You will also be able to store all your favorite games and creative programs without feeling limited, thanks to the massive 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD. And since SSDs offer much faster system boot and load times, you won’t have to wait long to get on with your day.</p>
<p>Best of all, despite powerful performance, the laptop does not overheat. ASUS has packed it with Arc Flow Fans, 4 exhaust vents, 5 dedicated heat pipes, and an anti-dust filter; all of which come together to keep things cool and quiet in the background as you teach some bad guys a lesson. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/">There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially now that it’s going for just $750. The discount won’t be around forever, so it’s best to get your orders in fast.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sales-are-down-50-in-europe/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It appears that the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 hasn’t been one to write home about for Microsoft and Activision. According to a new report from The Game Business, Black Ops 7 sales numbers are down compared to both Battlefield 6 and last year’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>In data <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">provided to the outlet</a> by GSD, Black Ops 7 sales—both physical and digital—are down 63% compared to Battlefield 6. Obviously, it’s important to note that Battlefield 6 isn’t available on any subscription service, meaning that people need to buy the game if they want to play. So, while the sales numbers for Battlefield 6 are higher, it’s still probably that the overall player count for Call of Duty is actually higher.</p>







<h2 id="h-sales-are-down-compared-to-last-year">Sales Are Down Compared To Last Year</h2>



<p>Where things get a little dicey is when you look at the comparison to last year’s release, Black Ops 6. According to the report, physical and digital sales are down over 50% compared to last year. Again, many can, and will, point the game being available on Xbox Game Pass for Ultimate and PC subscribers. But so was Black Ops 6. </p>



<p>Despite all the numbers being down, Black Ops 7 was still the best-selling game in terms of units and revenue in Europe for the week ending November 16 (its launch week). Battlefield 6, it’s main competition right now, came in fourth in both units sold and overall revenue.</p>







<p>At the end of the day, it’s not like Call of Duty is a dwindling franchise as it’s still generating revenue for its developers and publishers. Still, it’s interesting to see how far sales have fallen and if it’s simply a case of more people playing on Xbox Game Pass, or is there a real drop off in actual interest in the 22-year-old franchise.</p>

<p>On the surface, this looks like a bartop arcade cabinet, but in reality, it's a cradle for your Switch console that allows you to use authentic arcade-style controls with games that benefit from digital input – such as old-school titles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-shmups">shmups</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-fighting-games">fighting games</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067htjsgl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>The iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro doesn't come preassembled, but putting it together (and taking it apart) is a straightforward process. Two caddy sections are included, one for the original Switch / Switch OLED, and one for the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Ensuring compatibility with both generations is a nice touch, but this really feels like it was designed for the newer variant; the cut-out for the screen is designed with Switch 2's larger display in mind, so the original Switch ends up looking like a toddler in a teenager's clothing.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Mini Arcade Pro's arcade-style controls are excellent regardless of which system you own. The clicky stick and buttons are smaller than you'd find on your typical bartop arcade cabinet, but they're a joy to use; within moments of booting up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, I was pulling off special moves with the minimum of effort.</p>
<p>Shmups also benefit massively from this accessory — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_delta_hd_boosted">R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</a> is a particular joy to play — and I also enjoyed romping my way through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a85ebc9a58b26"><a title="Review: iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a85ebc9a58b26/review-imp-gaming-mini-arcade-pro-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>There's space on the rear of the unit for 12 Switch Game Cards and 12(!) MicroSD cards — <em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The central panel has all of the usual inputs (including a Home button which wakes your console from its sleep mode), as well as a switch which allows you to toggle the functionality of the stick – you can choose between the D-pad, left analogue stick, and right analogue stick. There's a 'C' button to bring up GameChat, but no 'Capture' button, oddly.</p>
<p>Spin it around, and there's space for you to clip in 12 Switch game cards and 12 MicroSD cards – a nice touch if you want to keep your software close at hand. My only reservation with this system is that the Game Card slots don't seem to grip all that well, and it doesn't take much to knock them out of the slots by accident.</p>
<p>My other major issue with the iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro is the artwork that has been printed onto the marquee, side panels, and the main control panel. The lettering is a <em>little</em> too childish for my liking, and while I'm not entirely sure, I think I detect the use of Generative AI to create the art itself. This obviously has no impact on the controller's performance, but it makes it look a little cheap, in my opinion.</p>

<p>The Switch's recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/poll-is-your-third-party-switch-2-dock-still-working-after-this-weeks-system-update">firmware update</a> actually broke the Mini Arcade Pro's ability to wake the console via the Home button and the functionality of the 'C' button, but, in a move which hopefully shows how committed the manufacturer is to making this device a success, it has <a href="https://impgaming.uk/v21/">received a firmware update</a> to fix the problem.</p>
<p>While I think the iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro's cheap-looking artwork counts against it, I can't fault the controller when it comes to delivering that old-school arcade experience. At £45, it's not likely to break the bank, either (although it's $90 in the US).</p>

						<h5>ARC Raiders</h5><p><span>October 30th, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Get in, get loot, get out, and don't get shot. Those are the core tenets that extraction shooters live and die by. If the gameplay loop is solid and you can bring along friends for the journey, that's a recipe for success. Embark Studios is no stranger to unique takes on familiar competitive genres, with The Finals having been released nearly two years prior. The team is back with a new spin on the extraction shooter genre, one where antagonistic and automated robots have taken over the landscape, and players can only survive above ground for thirty minutes at a time before an unstoppable threat rolls in. This is ARC Raiders.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Few extraction shooters have frustrated me in the same way as ARC Raiders, and perhaps that can be a testament to its distinctive yet disruptive nature in the market. Dying on a run results in losing everything you brought with you, minus the one or two items you might have squirreled away in your prison pocket; the safe space is determined by whichever combat augment you've equipped. The poverty loadout that players can opt to start a run with doesn't have the luxury, so you're at the mercy of other players and ARC bots not to put a bullet in your back as you're trying to extract from the surface safely.</p>



<p>Another downside to jumping into the free loadout is the poor quality of the starting weapons. Of the variety of cheap beginner weapons, only the Ferro (single-shot rifle) and Stitcher (short-range SMG) felt like they were enough to keep me alive in a firefight, while the others felt like the developers were trolling me with how ineffective they could be. With these loadouts, you get one stack of ammo for your weapon, bandages, and one shield recharger. If you survive and make it back home, you can cash in that freebie for a proper augment with a safe pocket, although you might want to sell the gun and craft something more useful.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>ARC Raiders' gunplay remains what could be the tipping point for whether it draws in or turns players away. Again, the beginner rank weapons are such a handicap when going out to scavenge, and it isn't until the next tier of weapons that players might actually find a gun that's enjoyable to use (unless you feel like using the ammo-sink Kettle). Once I could craft the Anvil pistol or Il Toro shotgun, those remained a part of my loadout whenever I felt like actually hunting down bots (and players) and not just being a sneaky scav using the free loadout to loot and scoot.</p>



<p>Compared to the armored shells on the ARC enemies scattered about, raiders themselves feel like they're wearing paper rather than a shield meant to take a hit. Getting ambushed by one of the small rolling Pops can completely shred through the basic shield and take a player down to half health. Many of the flying ARC bots can also harass and chase down players just trying to escape with a modest collection of loot.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The ARC is supposed to be the main threat, not the players, but that doesn't always hold true. Players should be wary any time they hear the sound of a nearby raider trying to breach and search a locked container or the telltale sounds of gunfire that might be closer than expected. Run into another player and you're at the mercy of their temperament and whether they even consider you a threat. If you're not a fan of hopping on voice chat and announcing your presence, there's a handy emote wheel where a callout asking the other player not to shoot will be one of the most commonly used phrases during your entire time playing through ARC Raiders. Of course, just because someone declares a truce doesn't prevent them from putting two in your back when you least expect it. Throughout most of my runs, the ones that ended in deadly gunfights were in squads of three; playing solo usually resulted in playing with like-minded players who just wanted to explore or complete the quests they had in their log.</p>



<p>To incentivize players to want to go topside into Toledo, there's a plethora of loot to fill your pockets with of various rarities, not all of which is simply fodder to recycle into base materials or sell for a little extra pocket change. Part of the problem is knowing exactly what is worth taking back and when. Depending on where you are in developing/upgrading the various crafting stations, you might need to seek out and gather different parts. A random cat bed you come across might not seem like much now, but it is one of the crucial components you'll need to bestow upon your rooster companion so that they can passively gather raw materials on your behalf. Each potential upgrade or craftable can be added to your wishlist, so I've tended to include every single crafting station and the usual assortment of Anvil handgun, tier 2 shields and loadouts, and other items I try to bring with me on every run of ARC Raiders so that if I find these materials out in the wild, I'll know to stash those away and save any extra pocket space for rare blueprints or other garbage I can simply sell to expand my storage chest back home.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As I was writing this, I wanted to wait until Stella Montis opened up for players as the latest zone to explore and bring the roster of explorable locales up to five. Embark Studios has had to make some emergency updates and nerf a particular skill at the end of one skill tree, which allowed players to breach and loot security lockers for rare gear (it's since been toned down to reduce the typical rarity of scrap discovered). Stella Montis is a massive enclosed complex with a variety of ARC threats (some unique to the map as well) scattered throughout, but players should also be wary of other players because I've routinely found myself with a bullet to the back after greeting and passing by a fellow raider.</p>



<p>After a brief introductory tutorial mission that results in the player getting shot in the back, the few remnants of the story left to ARC Raiders are told by way of quests and brief interactions with NPCs who never leave their respective shops. If you're looking for some grand story about why the world is constantly besieged by the ARC threat, you'll be left out in the cold. These NPCs also speak with an inhuman, robotic tone that expresses itself with inflections at unnatural times and a cadence that doesn't match what an actual human actor would portray. This is because of Embark Studios' usage of generative AI for these NPC interactions and perhaps all of the vocal callouts out in the world as well. While the NPCs might have been trained off of real human actors, it nevertheless mars what would otherwise be a really solid audio presentation. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Audio is also one of the highlights of ARC Raiders that should get recognized all on its own, minus the aforementioned disgust with the generative AI vocals above. Each weapon sounds distinctively different from afar, and each threat or point of interest has its own audible hum or trill that the player will instinctively pick up over time. Pick up the subtle clicking of a clock off somewhere unseen? The 3D audio on PlayStation 5 will help guide you to its exact location as you turn and run towards a buried raider cache full of useful loot. Sometimes I can even tell what sort of ARC threat I'm about to encounter topside just by the mechanical sounds scattered throughout. The vocal callouts can be adjusted to be either a subtle or loud callout (or you can just leave it on automatic), depending on whether you want to alert any other players in the immediate vicinity to your discovery. The classic Don't Shoot callout will always be shouted out to prevent players from perhaps hearing the message before bullets start flying.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders is also a graphical powerhouse on PlayStation 5 Pro, leveraging the power of Unreal Engine 5 to great effect and better than other games that might use the standard UE5 featureset. It does target a solid 60 FPS and achieves it almost all of the time, thanks in part to a dynamic resolution scaling that Embark Studios themselves have confirmed as ranging between 720p and 2160p on the PlayStation 5 Pro to help sustain that 60 FPS target. Below is a little bit of what players should anticipate for performance:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PS5: Scalability settings</strong>&nbsp;– High Quality; Dynamic Resolution range – 720p-1600p</li>



<li><strong>PS5 Pro: Scalability settings</strong>&nbsp;– Epic Quality; Dynamic Resolution range – 720p-2160p
<ul>
<li>Scalability settings affect rendering quality in aspects such as Global Illumination, Shadows, Reflections, Post Processing, Texture resolution and filtering, VFX, View Distance, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>, which is a game about, er, navigating a tricky post-colonial climate, is making its way to consoles next month, developer DoubleBee and publisher rokaplay have announced.</p>

<p>The game, which has been available on PC since February, will be launching on current-gen machines (and Nintendo Switch, although not the Switch 2, apparently) on December 9th.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why <i>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</i>is getting a console release, it's probably because the indie hit managed to rack up 250,000 sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-250k" rel="nofollow">inside its first week</a>, so it stands to reason DoubleBee and rokaplay would want to expand its audience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-console-pit.jpg?itok=-60Hu0ZV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-console-pit.jpg?itok=ogsfsPov 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is coming to consoles soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Since then, rokaplay says&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>'s audience has expanded to encapsulate more than 1.2 million players, describing it as an "unassuming indie title" that will be stepping "onto the biggest stages in gaming" next month.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's a game about digging a hole, funnily enough. You have a spade, and you must dig a hole in your back garden, beneath which you'll find all manner of secrets and other things buried.</p>

<p>Over the course of your time digging your hole, you'll be able to upgrade your equipment and sell the resources you gather. As rokaplay and DoubleBee say, "there's no rush, no pressure, just the pure joy of discovery as you dig deeper and deeper".</p>

<p>That'll be reflected in&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>'s price point; the game retails for just $5 on PC, which, as the two studios point out, is "less than a takeaway coffee". Hopefully, the console price point will reflect that as well.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's launching on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10015382/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/a-game-about-digging-a-hole/9NGLST31DG26" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on December 9th.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bring-party-home-with-the-beats-pill-speaker-for-just-100-ahead-of-black-friday-2000645859</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-goes-hard-on-beats-pill-its-most-heavily-discounted-bluetooth-speaker-this-black-friday.1361056/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good music can instantly lift your mood and bring life to gatherings. If you host often or like to enjoy your favorite tracks with a rich, room-filling sound, having a solid speaker is a must. The best ones out there offer a mix of portability, reliable battery life, and, of course, deep sound.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to grab such an option without paying the full price, we come bearing good news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5797/">Thanks to an early Black Friday deal, the top-rated Beats Pill speaker, which typically goes for $150, is currently available for just $100.</a> That’s after a nice 33% discount, and it applies to all color options. Like your audio gear basic? Consider the black option. Need something a bit more cheerful? The red pill (quite literally) is going to look stunning! Note that this deal gets you just the speaker. If you’re looking to pair it with a handy USB-C charging cable, the bundle is going for $110 (down from $168); just ten bucks more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5797/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Both deals are open to both Prime and non-Prime members. There are no complicated steps to take care of to score the discount, either. We highly recommend jumping on the offer fast, as it could wrap up any moment now. Considering how this is one of the lowest prices we have seen the speaker drop to ever, we’re also not expecting it to stay in stock for long.</p>

<h2>Powerful, Room-Filling Sound</h2>
<p>The speaker is truly portable. It’s shaped like a pill and is quite lightweight. There’s a removable lanyard that makes it easy to carry around. Take it off when you want a cleaner look, or don’t want it to get the way during outdoor activities. The overall material is quite durable as well, meaning the Pill can handle everyday wear and tear like a champ.</p>
<p>When it comes to performance, Beats has packed the speaker with a bigger, bespoke racetrack woofer that can displace 90% more air volume to deliver fuller bass. The redesigned tweeter takes care of all the highs and lows in your favorite tracks to offer better clarity. Expect minimal distortion even when you are listening to songs at high volume. Vibing to the latest Taylor Swift song or trying to keep your child entertained with a lullaby, the Beats Pill fills the room with high-quality audio that pulls you in.</p>



<p>There’s also support for lossless audio, which you can enjoy by connecting your speaker to your laptop or other compatible devices via the USB-C cable. This mode retains all the data from the source recording to preserve full, original quality. It basically gets you higher-quality audio, so you can enjoy tracks to the fullest. Want an even bigger experience? Pair two of these together to listen in the Amplify mode or Stereo mode.</p>
<p>It’s IP67-rated for dust and water resistance. Take it to the beach or by the pool without a worry. And even though Beats is owned by Apple, the speaker plays nicely with both Apple and Android devices. Pairing literally takes a few minutes, and once you have it connected to your phone or laptop, you can even take calls directly through it!</p>
<p>A single charge gets you up to 24 hours of battery life, which is more than enough to get the party going all day and all night. Even better, it doubles as a power bank when needed. Plug your device in via USB-C cable and juice it up without stepping away from the dance floor.</p>
<p>All things considered, the Beats Pill speaker is a great option to consider if you’re looking for a powerful, yet portable Bluetooth speaker.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5797/"> It’s now down to $100, which is basically nothing considering the features it packs.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/im-still-excited-for-half-life-3-and-you-should-be-too-2000646204</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>January 30, 2014. Over a decade ago now. I sat down and <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/profile/halomaste19/blog/i-m-still-excited-for-half-life-3/104703/">wrote up a blog on my personal <em>Giant Bomb</em> account</a> about <em>Half-Life 3</em> and why, after seven years of waiting, I was still excited. Now, 17 years after the launch of<em> Half-Life 2: Episode</em> 2 and five years after <em>Half-Life Alyx,</em> I find myself still waiting for Valve to announce <em>Half-Life 3.</em> And while some might not care anymore or may even find it all tiring, I’m still excited, damn it.</p> <p>For the last few weeks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-timeline-hype-leaks-clues-explained-release-date-november-trailer-2000645448">hype has been building around <em>Half-Life 3</em></a>, despite Valve never announcing or even teasing it. Doesn’t matter. Since late 2021, something has been building in the community. <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/?moveToWidget=3458764648489439347&amp;cot=14">Dataminers have continued to extract and share pieces of code</a> from other Valve games that seem to indicate that the company is working on a new <em>Half-Life</em> game, reportedly codenamed HLX. Then, earlier this month, Valve announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">three (lol) new pieces of gaming hardware</a>, but didn’t announce a new game to go with any of it. That struck some as odd and got many wondering if that datamined <em>Half-Life</em> project was set to be a Steam Machine launch game in 2026.</p>

 <p>Sprinkle on to this situation some insiders teasing another big reveal, extra security being spotted at Valve during the hands-on with the new hardware, and what appears to be a new Valve game waiting to be revealed on Steam, and you end up with what we have now: A lot of people freaking out about <em>Half-Life 3</em> possibly being announced very soon. And you know what? I’m one of those people, and I think more people should be hyped.</p>

 <h2>Why you should care about <em>Half-Life 3</em></h2> <p><em>Half-Life 2: Episode 2′</em>s ending was an infamous cliffhanger that killed off a major character and raised the stakes in a big way. And for 13 years, that cliffhanger remained unchanged and had many <em>Half-Life</em> fans like me desperate to find out what happens next. We finally found out in <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, which is a VR prequel whose ending makes a big change to the cliffhanger, undoing that shocking death and replacing it with a mysterious new situation, one which only Gordon Freeman seems capable of solving. Five years later I’m still waiting, and I’m still super excited to see what happens next.</p>

 <p>The thought of Gordon Freeman and his iconic crowbar going after the G-Man and possibly wrapping up the storyline that started in<em> Half-Life</em> back in 1998 is a tantalizing one. This is a world and narrative I’ve thought about a lot for…well, most of my life. And the idea that it might finally be wrapping up in the near(ish) future has me bouncing off the walls. But maybe <em>you</em> don’t care about the world of <em>Half-Life.</em> That’s fair. There’s still plenty of reason to be excited to see what Valve does next.</p>

  <p>I’m really fascinated to see the next big video game from Valve. This is a studio with a nearly flawless track record that prides itself on creating incredible experiences that push technology and game design forward. And <em>Half-Life</em> is the studio’s flagship franchise. The thing that made everything else possible. So it makes sense that a lot of money, care, and time are being put into making HLX, or <em>Half-Life 3</em>, something very special.</p>

 <p><em>HLX</em> also, based on datamined leaks, will be the studio’s first non-VR, full-length single-player video game release since 2011’s <em>Portal 2</em>.&nbsp; Valve just hasn’t made a game like this in a long, long time, and that alone has me intrigued.</p>

 <p>What does a big AAA <em>Half-Life</em> sequel look like in 2025 or, more likely, 2026? Valve often uses the <em>Half-Life</em> franchise to push game technology forward while trying out new ideas like VR, HDR, advanced physics, and the gravity gun. What will be the cool new “thing” in <em>Half-Life 3</em>? Data mining points to some impressive-sounding simulation tech that can accurately recreate how wet an object is or how flammable a surface might be, which could lead to some wild puzzles. Or maybe it will make combat more dynamic?</p> <p>Until whatever game using this tech is <em>actually</em> released, we won’t know for sure how it will be used, but I have to imagine that the next <em>Half-Life</em> game from Valve won’t just be six or seven levels that play mostly like <em>Half-Life 2</em> but with a shiny coat of paint slapped on top. Valve isn’t that kind of studio. That’s now how they make games. And that has me really excited to see what the team has been cooking up for the last five years or so.</p> <h2>A big game not burdened by stockholders or trends</h2> <p>Another big reason to be excited: Unlike most other game studios and publishers, Valve answers to nobody. It has all the money it needs and can make whatever it wants, essentially. So <em>Half-Life 3</em> won’t need to include microtransactions, AI generation tools, battle passes, cosmetic stores, free-to-play elements, crossover content, ads, or anything else that most players find annoying. <em>Half-Life 3</em> doesn’t have to chase trends. <em>Half-Life 3</em> doesn’t have to be an extraction shooter because the publisher demands it. Instead, Valve can spend many years and a shit-ton of money building something it wants to make, and that sounds very refreshing.</p>

 <p>In a time when every game seems to be from one of three genres or is a remake, Valve’s next <em>Half-Life</em> sequel could be something very different. It could be a AAA, modern single-player action-shooter developed by one of the best studios around, with no strings attached and powered by advanced simulation tech. Yes please!</p> <p>While I’m fairly confident that Valve is working on a<em> Half-Life</em> game that might end up being <em>Half-Life 3<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --></em>there’s just too much damn data out there to say otherwise<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->there’s no guarantee it will see the light of day anytime soon, or ever. Valve is a weird company that isn’t publicly traded and, as mentioned, has an infinite money machine called Steam funding its activities. It has no financial reason to release something unless it wants to, and it can take as long as it wants to make anything.</p> <p>So maybe <em>Half-Life 3</em> gets announced tomorrow. Maybe in 2026. Maybe years from now. Regardless, I’m still excited, and I think anyone who cares about games should be, too.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Twitch Added To Australia’s Social Media Ban]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-australia-social-media-ban/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-added-to-australia%E2%80%99s-social-media-ban.1361050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Twitch is now the latest platform to be added to Australia’s upcoming social media ban. Just weeks after it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/australia-to-ban-kick-and-reddit-for-children-under-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that Kick</a> would be added, news has come out from Australian media about its main rival being put on the list as well.</p>



<p>First reported by the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-21/twitch-included-in-under-16s-social-media-ban/106036398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)</a>, Twitch’s addition comes less than three weeks before the ban is set to go into effect. For those unfamiliar, the Australian government is enacting legislation that will ban anyone under the age of 16 from having accounts on a number of social media platforms. </p>







<p>Those platforms include TikTok, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram, Threads, Facebook, YouTube, Kick, and, now, Twitch.</p>



<p><strong>“eSafety has informed Twitch it is considered an age-restricted social media platform required to take reasonable steps to prevent under 16s from having accounts, in accordance with Australia’s Social Media Minimum Age legislation,”</strong> a <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/newsroom/media-releases/twitch-assessed-as-age-restricted-social-media-platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement on Australia’s eSafety website reads</a>.<strong> “Following Twitch’s own self-assessment, eSafety assessed Twitch as meeting the criteria for ‘age-restricted social media platform’, because it has the sole or significant purpose of online social interaction with features designed to encourage user interaction, including through livestreaming content.”</strong></p>



<p>Starting December 10, Twitch will block the signups from those under 16 and will start deactivating the accounts of current users who aren’t old enough.</p>



<p>According to the office of Australian Communications Minister Anika Wells, there aren’t any more evaluations planned before December 10. That means that the platforms listed above will be the ones that must comply with the new order. That said, this ban is “dynamic”, and that more can be added, or removed, if it need be.</p>







<p>“Our historic law simply aims to provide Australian children with a reprieve from the persuasive pull of platforms,” a spokesperson told ABC. “We are not chasing perfection, we are chasing a meaningful difference in the lives of young Australians.”</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on the growing social media ban for those under 16 in Australia? Should the government really get involved like this, or should the platforms a kid uses be regulated by their parents and guardians?

<section><p>Pokemon Legends: Z-A might have found a new way to battle, but it likely won't inspire a larger competitive scene.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">To longtime fans, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-legends-z-a-review-a-battle-revolution/1900-6418423/" data-ref-id="1900-6418423">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> represents the next evolution of a beloved franchise. Instead of using Pokemon's traditional turn-based combat, this new game embraces more frenetic, real-time combat. This approach feels bold and transformative, as it seems to reimagine Pokemon as a light action game. However, not all fans are on board with this decision, which breaks with the series' decades-long tradition of using turn-based combat in core console releases.</p><p dir="ltr">At times, it seems like the mainline Pokemon games struggle to innovate. Leadership at The Pokemon Company often relegate new gameplay experiences to neglected spin-off series or mobile games like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon or Pokemon Go. So getting what many fans see as a "mainline" console game with a new gameplay gimmick has been welcomed by fans begging the series to reinvent itself. However, new changes bring risks. Although Pokemon Legends: Z-A might have found a new way to battle, it still lacks the rigor of the mainline games and likely won't inspire a larger competitive scene around it, even if the bones are good.</p><p dir="ltr">The developers at Game Freak and The Pokemon Company have added several key features to Legends: Z-A that, on the surface, make the game seem streamlined for competitive play. Unlike its predecessor, Pokemon Legends: Arceus, Legends: Z-A allows players to battle online and progress up a ladder. These battles toss four trainers in a space together, in which they run around and fight each other. The more Pokemon you defeat, the more points you get, which ultimately elevates your trainer rank when the fight is done.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608549-img_0603.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608549" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608549-img_0603.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608549"></a><figcaption>A look at Pokemon Legends: Z-A's online multiplayer mode.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608549-img_0603.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This way of battling can result in chaotic and fun antics. Having four people run around all at once feels like a free for all with your friends. You can target someone who already has low health with a well-timed attack or switch at the right moment to avoid a big attack from an opponent. However, as good and fun this can be, it might not be enough to inspire a lasting competitive community around the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Among those who are more skeptical of this pivot is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JoeUX9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JoeUX9</a>, a Pokémon coach and two-time regional champion. JoeUX9 explained why turn-based battles work better for the competitive scene than the gameplay in Legends: Z-A.</p><p dir="ltr">“[Turn-based battling] suits a one-vs-one, turn-based play style, where you can't ‘dodge’ attacks and it's more of a chess style of play. It leans more into the strategic and calculated style of Pokemon, whereas the battle royale ranked battles in ZA reward a reaction-based method where you aren't going through things turn by turn, but rather consistent action for four minutes.”</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@skrawvgc">Skraw</a>, a competitive Pokemon player and YouTuber, told GameSpot that he thinks the Legends: Z-A battle system could lead to a larger competitive scene, but not in its "current iteration."</p><p dir="ltr">"It has a lot of elements of a good real-time game," Skraw said. "For example, I think using switching and Mega evolution as a way to get immunity frames to dodge attacks feels very rewarding. But I think the way your agency sort of vanishes to pre-programmed pathing and jank would make it frustrating to play with any real stakes on the line. I'd say the system has good bones, but needs to be polished."</p><p dir="ltr">Key ways of strategizing present in the turn-based games, like using status effects, buffs, and debuffs to your advantage, are adapted in somewhat bizarre ways; oftentimes, their implementation feels awkward. In my own experience using the teams I have built based on recommendations online, it's better to wham on your opponents with the strongest and quickest attacks possible. You don't really need to think about setting up a larger strategy and often, that feels like cheesing. Additionally, key aspects of the turn-based games, like Pokemon abilities, aren't present in Legends: Z-A.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheUziGunner">TheUziGunner</a>, a competitive player and veteran of the Pokemon Draft League, told GameSpot that a solid battle system requires a "mix of strategy and creativity."</p><p dir="ltr">"Incentivisation for teambuilding and proper lines of sequence akin to chess and long-term planning which get rewarded with the battle system," TheUziGunner said. "That is what best works for the existing turn-based combat players including myself as there is nothing more satisfying in seeing a substantial payoff in having hours of serious effort pertaining to teambuilding and paying off through outplaying our opponent. If these aspects can be retained in real-time combat, then I absolutely see it cultivating a serious competitive scene!"</p><p dir="ltr">He told GameSpot he appreciates certain aspects of battling, like positioning and cooldowns for certain moves, but this way of battling can still feel unbalanced at points.</p><p dir="ltr">""It still feels rather unbalanced as you can see Xerneas moving like a Nascar after [using] Geomancy. I also believe the lack of abilities in the game is an inherent negative rather than a positive as it prevents the scope of complexity and more creativity as far as the battle system goes."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608550-img_0599.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608550" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608550-img_0599.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608550"></a><figcaption>A Pokemon trainer poses next to their Krookodile.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608550-img_0599.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The vast majority of people playing Legends: Z-A aren't going to be doing so competitively. However, competitive players can speak to the depth and consistency of mechanics, and thus the overall likelihood that this game will inspire a competitive scene.</p><p dir="ltr">Competitive Pokemon and live events are becoming a larger part of the fandom. Whether or not a game like Legends: Z-A is competition-worthy is the difference between being a game people complete and put down, and the mainline games where people continue to tinker with different combinations of teams for years to come. It's one key way for a fandom to develop around a game and sustain continued engagement with it, whether it's events tied to it or new content exploring the meta as players continue to tinker with the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite gaps in the current battle system, both Skraw and TheUziGunner emphasized that the new system has good bones. Whether or not this new way of battling can become a larger phenomena will depend on if The Pokemon Company and Game Freak continue to sharpen the battle system in Pokemon Legends: Z-A and future games, and plan events supporting a competitive scene tied to the series.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the day, if Legends: Z-A can get more people excited about playing Pokemon, then it can still help the competitive community. The Pokemon Company plans to release Pokemon Champions, a game that will focus on battling and serve as the software for the official Pokemon world tournament, in 2026. Legends: Z-A could get new players through the door that then try Pokemon Champions out, which could in turn convert people into competitive players.</p><p dir="ltr">"Pokemon's competitive scene needs two things to grow in my opinion and that's attention and lower barriers to entry," Skraw said. "We've seen, especially after this year's worlds, that The Pokemon Company International is putting more of a spotlight on the competitive aspect of the game, with coverage of events getting more thorough, commentary following storylines of trainers, more matches getting streamed etc. I think we're already on the trajectory for Pokemon's various competitive scenes to get larger and larger."</p>

<section><p>After a rocky launch, Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus is making a comeback with a major update that adds new challenges and gameplay updates.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Last year, indie game publisher Humble Games went through what it called a restructuring, a process that resulted in mass layoffs. Not only were various staff members affected, but also several games under the publisher, including Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus. Developed by the small team at Squid Shock Studios, the colorful platformer inspired by Japanese folklore would turn out to be the final title published by the in-house team at Humble Games.</p><p dir="ltr">Fast-forward to November 2025, and Squid Shock Games is still hard at work on Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus. The team has just released the free Tanuki Kabuki update for the game, a major content drop that adds new post-game challenges, gameplay options, and collectibles to the game, with one of the highlights being a Kabuki-style Boss Rush mode where players battle in front of an audience that reacts to each clash. A new Gauntlet Mode has also been added, and this is a curated selection of challenges that also features customizable difficulty options.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting here wasn't easy for Squid Shock Games, as following the restructuring of Humble, the team had to fill multiple roles that the publisher had previously handled. We spoke to creative director Chris Stair about how the studio bounced back, was forced to adapt at the 11th hour, and the lessons learned from this ordeal.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4Xd91I3jjs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d4Xd91I3jjs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"Honestly, the main thing was it left me--and my whole team at Squid Shock--feeling completely confused, abandoned, and lost right after launching our very first game. Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus was the first title Squid Shock ever released and the first game I'd ever worked on in my life. We had launched literally five days before Humble's restructuring hit," Stair said. "My team and I were on an absolute high. We were at Bit Summit in Kyoto, Japan, meeting devs we'd idolized for years, throwing an incredible launch party, soaking in all the love from the community. And then, overnight, it felt like the ground just vanished beneath us. Even just recollecting it right now makes my cortisol spike."</p><p dir="ltr">Stair added that it was a disheartening experience to see the news about Humble Games and receive emails from former employees at the publisher, many of whom he'd worked with on marketing the game. In a more practical sense, however, Stair now had to confront the fact that all the previously arranged post-launch publisher support had been dramatically altered. "No matter what anyone else might say, our launch was absolutely sullied by this. Not just the practical stuff, but my entire emotional and psychological state. So much mental bandwidth got eaten up by pure insecurity about what the hell was going to happen next that the studio and I went straight into survival mode. Resources and energy that should have gone into nurturing the game in its critical first weeks instead went into just keeping our heads above water," Stair said.</p><p dir="ltr">Following its departure from Humble Games, Squid Shock had to adapt and fill multiple behind-the-scenes roles--like marketing, press, creator outreach, gathering storefront feedback and sentiment, QA coordination, localization fixes, and more--quickly, but the single biggest "nightmare" for the studio were the console patches.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608483-6-bo_pathoftheteallotus-officialscreenshot-bomoon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608483" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608483-6-bo_pathoftheteallotus-officialscreenshot-bomoon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608483"></a><figcaption>Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus  </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608483-6-bo_pathoftheteallotus-officialscreenshot-bomoon.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Stair explained that Humble had been their middleman with console companies like Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft. When the publisher restructured, their connections to the big three were greatly impacted, ultimately resulting in an inability to release vital updates. "It really sucked reading player feedback about bugs and performance issues on certain platforms and knowing we literally couldn't do anything about it for months," Stair said. "I think this really irreparably damaged our reputation on certain platforms, especially Xbox, which had some nasty crashes on launch."</p><p dir="ltr">While sales of Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus were "moderately successful," they didn't meet the expectations that Squid Shock had for the game. "We were given a conservative estimate of how many copies we would sell in the first year and we really fell short of that," Stair added. "Is that because of the issues we had with Humble? There's no way to actually prove it, but obviously that whole situation only hurt our ability to deliver a better product over time."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608484-atrailermaster.00_00_38_15.still007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608484" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608484-atrailermaster.00_00_38_15.still007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608484"></a><figcaption>Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608484-atrailermaster.00_00_38_15.still007.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The tragedy here is that Squid Shock had a good working relationship with Humble before its sudden closure. Stair says that while they weren't perfect, the publisher knew what it was doing and it "provided incredible support throughout development" that would not have been there if the studio had gone down the self-publishing route. As Stair explained, publishers do far more than just help get a video game out the door, as a good company can help with QA, localization, production timelines, porting, trailers, subscription deals, and so much more. All essential factors in a game finding success in a crowded and very competitive market.</p><p dir="ltr">Squid Shock is now working with Good Games Group,a publishing group founded by former Humble employees. If you're interested in seeing Bo: Path Of The Teal Lotus in action, it'll be featured in a Games Done Quick livestream this weekend.</p>
