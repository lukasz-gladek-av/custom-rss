            <p>I have to write at least 250 words for a news post. Rock Paper Shotgun’s CMS (content management system) even has a built-in widget that shouts at me if I don’t write at least 250 words. "Page 1 body content is quite short" it says if I go under. How cute is that "quite"? I love being fooled into getting charmed by automated systems via colloquial British understatement. Anyway, I bring this up because I honestly don’t have anything to add about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blippo+">Blippo+</a>. I just wanted to inform you all of its existence. It's a "casual" "FMV" "Cinematic" "Pixel Graphics" "1980s" digital product from developers <em>also</em> named Blippo+, as well as publishers Panic, who've previously unleashed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/untitled-goose-game">the horrible goose</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thank-goodness-youre-here">Thank Goodness You’re Here!</a> on the world.

<p>I mean, yeah, I’m down. Panic haven’t steered me wrong before. On the wishlist it goes. How you doing, anyway? Got presents sorted yet? My mum doesn’t read the site so I can safely say that me and my siblings all pitched in to get her a Quest headset. I’m really excited. She still uses the PS4 VR to play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beat-saber">Beat Saber</a> so I reckon this’ll be a lot less hassle. There’s not much I can give my mum that captures that feeling of like, actually being a 'toy', you know? But this is like, something she can play with rather than just appreciate the utility of another Le Creuset pot or whatever. So I reckon she’ll be chuffed. You got any good ones lined up? 275 words. Nice.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2026-rumored-to-include-omnimovement-wall-running-and-remastered-mw3-maps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty insider TheGhostofHope has <a href="https://x.com/theghostofhope/status/1867024363054305591?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> a few tidbits he heard about the 2026 game. According to his sources, that entry will feature both omnimovement and wall running.</p>
<p>Omnimovement is a feature introduced this year in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 by Treyarch. It allows players to perform actions in any direction for the first time in the series. If they want to shoot left and right while sprinting, they can; the same goes for running forward or backward. Also, they can do all these things while sprinting, sliding to avoid fire, sliding under an obstacle, or diving through a window. The only thing they can't do in all directions is Tactical Sprint, as Operators can only perform Tactical Sprint while moving forward.</p>
<p>In Wccftech's review of Black Ops 6, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>While jumping forward and diving is nothing new for the series, dolphin diving only really worked to evade forwards. What Omnimovement brings to the table is the same expanded movement, but in any direction, like playing out the good bits of a John Woo action scene. In proper multiplayer, expect to deal with many folks diving sideways through doors or sliding right into your shins when you least expect.</em></p>
<p>While omnimovement has encountered a generally positive reception among fans, the return of wall running from far less beloved Call of Duty games like Black Ops 3 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review-single-is-better-than-multi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infinite Warfare</a> may not sit well with most fans. Moreover, TheGhostofHope's mention of remastered maps from 2011's Modern Warfare 3 may be met with similar disdain, as those aren't exactly fan favorites, either.</p>
<p>Of course, there's a long time between now and 2026. Before Infinity Ward's next Call of Duty installment, it will be Sledgehammer's turn, the studio behind the underwhelming Vanguard and Modern Warfare III. So far, the only concrete rumor about 2025's CoD is that it might have wall running, too.</p>

The confirmation comes <a href="https://assettocorsa.gg/open-world-map-coming-in-summer-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via Kunos' official website</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Kunos, the map will make its way into Assetto Corsa EVO in mid-2025, at an unspecified point during summer in the Northern Hemisphere. The open world will be released in stages, and will eventually cover 1600 square kilometers. New features and content will be added as the map expands. Kunos explains the map is fully laser-scanned, and will boast "unmatched detail."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Local businesses based around the Nürburgring are also set to feature, so players will be able to rent cars and upgrade and customise their vehicles at actual outets. As part of today's news, Kunos has opened an invitation to all local businesses in the vicinity of the Nürburgring to contact the studio for the opportunity to be featured in Assetto Corsa EVO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assetto Corsa EVO will initially become available on PC in Early Access from January 16, 2025. Console versions are also expected eventually, but not until the game exits its Early Access period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

It’s acknowledgement of what could be a bombshell moment for entertainment fans everywhere, but until a deal is finalized, it is probably best to keep expectations for a potential buyout at a minimum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is true that we have made an initial statement of intent,” Sony said regarding its interest in Kadokawa (translated via DeepL). “We would appreciate it if you would allow us to refrain from further comment.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/14/elden-ring-story-trailer-1647298141811.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sony confirms interest in aquiring FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/report-sony-in-talks-to-buy-kadokawa-owner-of-elden-ring-and-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware"><u>Rumors that Sony may soon acquire Kadokawa</u></a> first emerged from a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reuters</u></a> report last month. It stated that talks between the two companies were ongoing, with one of its sources adding that, should negotiations proceed in a positive direction, a deal could be signed soon. Today’s confirmation from Sony suggests that talks remain active, though it’s unclear where things sit now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa oversees a number of entities that could no doubt benefit Sony in the long run. One that many gaming fans have their eye on is FromSoftware, which helped launch gaming into the 2010s with its critically acclaimed Dark Souls series. The developer also found tremendous success with 2022’s George R. R. Martin collaboration project, Elden Ring, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-of-the-erdtree-the-first-and-last-elden-ring-dlc-fromsoftware-boss-hidetaka-miyazaki-confirms">its follow-up DLC</a>, Shadow of the Erdtree, launching earlier this year. Kadokawa also owns other gaming studios such as Spike Chunsoft (Danganronpa), Acquire (Octopath Traveler), Gotcha Gotcha Games (RPG Maker), and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some experts believe that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-may-find-it-hard-to-buy-all-of-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-financial-report-claims"><u>bringing the media company under Sony’s wing may prove to be difficult</u></a>, Ampere Analysis research director Piers Harding-Rolls previously explained to IGN that news of the company’s interest shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. It already owns about 14% of FromSoftware thanks to a deal made in 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At the time, Sony mentioned a broader interest in cross-media development of anime and games IP to support its other media businesses,” Harding-Rolls said. “So, in that sense any deal for the parent company Kadokawa, which also operates extensively in manga and anime, is a natural extension of this earlier deal. These other areas align nicely with Sony’s anime businesses.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no telling when or if the deal will proceed for now.

As explained by Valve:</p><div><blockquote><p>For games you recently played, Steam will download game updates shortly after they are released. For games that you haven’t played in a while, Steam might wait a few days to bundle multiple updates together or choose to download the update while you are asleep.</p></blockquote></div><p>This new default option to wait to download an update gives players more control; as Valve points out, it means that users can hold an updating a massive game until they actually want to play it, which could be a relief for people with bandwidth caps.</p><p>You’ll find the new option in the beta Steam client settings under the Downloads section. “You can set the default to: let Steam decide when to update the game (based on factors like when you last played the game, bandwidth availability, etc.) or wait to update until the game is launched,” Valve says.</p><p>You can still set per-game download settings in a game’s Properties that override the global setting, but those options have “cleaned up descriptions,” according to Valve. And with the beta, you can also manage the per-game overrides in the overall Steam client Downloads settings.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Steam client Updates settings with “cleaned up descriptions.”</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Valve</cite></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>The Mercenary is one of the new classes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> but it's already become a fan-favorite. Mercenaries are another ranged class, but they have the ability to hit much harder than the standard Ranger. With the right gear, skills, and gameplay loop, enemies and bosses become trivial to the Mercenary.</p><p>However, to get to that point, you need a proper build guide for the Mercenary in Path of Exile 2. Fortunately, we have a complete build guide below, including the best skills, Support and Spirit Gems, and Ascendancy to use for the Mercenary.</p><h2>Mercenary Overview in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>As we said before, the Mercenary is a ranged class in Path of Exile 2 but utilizes a different skillset compared to the Ranger. Instead of a bow and arrow, you use a crossbow in the primary slot, which is what most of your top skills will be based around.</p><p>Mercenaries use the crossbow to wield a plentiful amount of ammunition types. You can switch to each of these ammo types the same way you cast different skills on another class, such as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-best-sorceress-build-guide/1100-6528354/" data-ref-id="1100-6528354">Sorceress</a>. While this switching back and forth to different ammo might feel clunky at first, you'll understand what ammo to use for certain situations as you continue leveling with the Mercenary.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414041-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.00.57.72.png" data-ref-id="1300-4414041" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414041-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.00.57.72.png" data-ref-id="1300-4414041"></a><figcaption>A crossbow is the Mercenary's best friend.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414041-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.00.57.72.png"></figure><p>With your crossbow, you can primarily deal two kinds of elemental damage, fire and frost. Other skills allow for regular crossbow bolts and armor-piercing rounds, though, so you're not limited to just elemental damage. Luckily, the Mercenary doesn't have to rely on a single elemental damage type for any build, so you're free to use any skill that deals the most damage.</p><p>Your main attribute as a Mercenary will be Dexterity, as this improves the accuracy of your shots. However, since the Mercenary is a well-rounded class, some of your gear could require extra points in Intelligence or Strength. For the most part, though, your skills are based around Dexterity and Strength, so that's where you'll want to put a majority of your attribute points.</p><h2>Best Mercenary Skills in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Now that you have a basic understanding of the Mercenary, it's time to equip the class with its best skills. The Mercenary doesn't necessarily rely on super late-game skills, as the early skills you can unlock deal a ton of damage right out of the gate.</p><p>The best skills for the Mercenary are a mixture of different elemental damage plus other types of rounds that can be fired quickly or have more ammo before needing to be reloaded. Most of your elemental ammo must be reloaded after a single shot. While these skills tend to deal more damage, reloading during the middle of a fight isn't prudent at all times. As such, having access to skills that can be shot quicker or for longer are always good to have in your back pocket.</p><p>Here are the skills we recommend for the Mercenary in Path of Exile 2:</p><ul><li>Armor Piercing Rounds</li><li>Permafrost Bolts</li><li>Flash Grenade</li><li>Explosive Shot</li><li>Gas Grenade, then Oil Grenade, then Cluster Grenade</li><li>Ripwire Ballista</li><li>Galvanic Shards</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414045-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.01.51.19.png" data-ref-id="1300-4414045" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414045-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.01.51.19.png" data-ref-id="1300-4414045"></a><figcaption>The available skills for the Mercenary in Path of Exile 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414045-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.01.51.19.png"></figure><p>In addition to all these skills, you can also slot in the basic "Crossbow Shot," which comes from equipping any type of crossbow. This is the most basic attack possible, but it's nice to have for weaker enemies and consistent damage against bosses.</p><p>Cluster Grenade is the one skill on the list that you'll have to wait to use, as you likely won't unlock it until you reach Cruel difficulty. You'll also see we initially have Gas and Oil Grenade slotted in for Cluster Grenade, as they are unlocked a smidge earlier. The rest of the skills are at Level 12 or below, so they can be used mid-way through the campaign. You have a wide range of ammo types available with these skills, including multiple kinds of elemental damage and rounds with more shots and higher fire rates.</p><h2>Best Mercenary Support and Spirit Gems</h2><p>After equipping some of the skills above, you can move on to slotting in the recommended Support Gems for those skills. Also, you don't want to forget about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-spirit-gems/1100-6528331/" data-ref-id="1100-6528331">Spirit Gems</a>, as the Mercenary has access to some great persistent buffs.</p><p>Here are some Support Gems we recommend for a few skills, as well as the best Spirit Gems to use:</p><p><strong>Support Gems</strong></p><ul><li>Second Wind (Flash Grenade)</li><li>Glaciation (Permafrost Bolts)</li><li>Persistence (Oil/Cluster Grenade)</li><li>Magnified Effect</li><li>Lockdown (Ripwire Ballista)</li><li>Ingenuity (Flash Grenade)</li><li>Wildfire (Explosive Shot)</li><li>Lightning Infusion (Galvanic Shards)</li><li>Double Barrel (Armor Piercing Rounds)</li></ul><p><strong>Spirit Gems</strong></p><ul><li>Shard Scavenger</li><li>Attrition</li></ul><h2>Best Mercenary Passive Skills</h2><p>Moving on, you'll want to follow several key paths on the Mercenary's Passive Ability skill tree. For the most part, sticking with increases to projectile damage, reload speed, AoE effects, and attribute buffs for Strength and Dexterity is the best route. However, if you want a more defensive-minded Mercenary, boosting armor and evasion rating are also viable options.</p><p>Here are some Passive Abilities we suggest for the Mercenary:</p><ul><li>Remorseless</li><li>Instant Reload</li><li>Reusable Ammunition</li><li>Volatile Catalyst</li><li>Cluster Bombs</li><li>Adrenaline Rush</li><li>Repeating Explosives</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414048-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.01.13.89.png" data-ref-id="1300-4414048" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414048-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.01.13.89.png" data-ref-id="1300-4414048"></a><figcaption>The Passive Ability skill tree for the Mercenary</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414048-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.01.13.89.png"></figure><h2>Best Mercenary Ascendancy in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Finally, after leveling the Mercenary, you can select an Ascendancy for it. There are two options available for the Mercenary in early access: Witch Hunter and Gemling Legionnaire.</p><p>Witch Hunter is where you want to go in most cases, as it has the best damage-boosting abilities and it's much simpler overall. The Ascendancy also has great explosion properties, allowing you to make your explosions longer, deal more damage, and even interrupt enemies during casting.</p><p>That does it for our Mercenary build in Path of Exile 2. If you're looking to run another class, we recommend the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-best-monk-build-guide/1100-6528322/" data-ref-id="1100-6528322">Monk</a>, which has a spectacular and balanced build.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft is expanding its suite of cloud gaming features by introducing the ability for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to stream a "select" number of their owned games to Xbox Series X/S or Xbox One consoles, without needing to install them first. It's available to Xbox Insiders now, and will launch for all users at a later date. 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has been touting the ability to stream owned games since 2019, with the feature initially expected to launch alongside its Xbox Cloud Gaming platform the following year. Unfortunately, it missed that target by quite some margin, and then failed to hit its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-let-game-pass-subscribers-bring-their-own-games-to-xbox-cloud-gaming-later-in-2022">revised launch of 2022</a>. In the end, it took another two years for the feature to finally arrive, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-now-stream-select-games-from-their-own-library-via-cloud-gaming">since November this year</a>, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers have been able to stream their owned games - and not just those available on Game Pass - to a limited number of platforms.
</p>
<p>
Initially, it was only possible to stream games through TVs and via browsers on supported devices such as tablets, smartphones, and Meta Quest headsets. At the time, Microsoft said it would be bringing the feature to Xbox consoles and the Xbox app on Windows, but not until next year. So it's a pleasant surprise to see that, earlier than expected, the console rollout is now here - albeit only for Xbox Insiders at the moment.

Starting today, Xbox Insiders in the Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha rings can - provided they also have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription - <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/12/11/xbox-insiders-with-game-pass-ultimate-stream-your-own-game-on-xbox-consoles/">preview the ability</a> to stream their owned games to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles. Users that meet both criteria can start exploring the feature by going to My games &amp; apps &gt; Full library &gt; Owned Games on their console, then looking for (or filtering for) the cloud badge on compatible games. After that, it's simply a case of selecting a game then choosing 'Play with Cloud Gaming'.

The catalogue of supported titles does, however, remain extremely limited, with only around 50 games currently compatible. The good news is it's a fairly strong line-up, mixing new and old blockbuster titles with acclaimed indie games. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Warhammer 4K: Space Marine 2, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, Balatro, Hades, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>, Dredge, Phasmophobia, and The Plucky Squire are some of the more notable games on the list - and Microsoft previously promised its "library of cloud-playable titles will continue to grow, as we work with our partners around the world".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breaker-set-to-release-in-early-access-come-january/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Heart Machine revealed that Hyper Light Breaker, the 3D follow-up to Hyper Light Drifter, will be released in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early Access on Steam</a> on January 14, 2025. This news came during the Day of the Devs: The Game Awards Edition, where a trailer was released to reveal the official Early Access date for the game. For those interested, Hyper Light Breaker will cost $29.99 during the Early Access period, with the price subject to change depending on content added to the game and changes made to the title.</p>
<p>This game is published by Arc Games, which has also published games like Torchlight, Neverwinter, and Remnant 2. For those who are unfamiliar with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breaker-gameplay-trailer-stylish-action-no-mans-sky/">Hyper Light universe</a>, Hyper Light Breaker is a co-op open-world roguelike where players get to assume the role of a "Breaker," with multiple different Breakers to choose from. Breakers are warriors who are tasked with rebuilding a civilization that was ruined due to a cataclysmic war. To do so, you get to explore a vast and ever-changing world in a procedurally generated world that is known as the Overgrowth.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyper Light Breaker | Release Date Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VijrcUbspqU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>During the exploration, you'll get to come across secrets hidden in nooks and crannies while battling against the Crowns, which are bosses controlled by the Abyss King.</p>
<p>While this game is a follow-up game to Hyper Light Drifter, it isn't in terms of story. It's set in the universe like their previous game, but Hyper Light Breaker takes place several decades before the events that happened in the first game. Luckily, to play Hyper Light Breaker, it isn't required for the player to have played Hyper Light Drifter, as the game is set to be a stand-alone experience.</p>
<p>Much like many other roguelikes, Hyper Light Breaker will have intense and difficult combat, where players have to use the loot that they have on them to upgrade their gear and become more powerful with each new run. Every time the player dies, the Overgrowth regenerates but will never be the exact same as the world you experienced previously. While this is a common feature in many different roguelikes, this is a first for the Hyper Light universe and gives it a similar feeling to that of Risk of Rain 2, a game that shares a lot of similarities with this upcoming title.</p>
<p>Heart Machine has stated that Hyper Light Breaker will continue to receive support and updates beyond the Early Access launch, with the developers planning on adding new Breakers to choose from, new bosses to fight and weapons to utilize, to keep the game fresh.</p>

            <p>Creation is an act of kindness. One person sloughs off a piece of themselves, shapes it, wraps it, and sends it out into the world in the hope that it might mean something to someone else. Other people do this for us all the time and mostly we don't even notice. The work is unseen and unremarked upon even as, through repetition, we come to depend upon it. Until, one day, that light that they shine can't be seen. Maybe you left home, or maybe they did, but now it's your turn to perform such acts of kindness. To carry the tradition forward for others - and for yourself.
</p>
<p>Friends, it's time to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skeal">Skeal</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Playing Skeal at Christmas is an annual RPS tradition, created by Alice O and written about by her in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skeal-free-skiing-game">2017</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skeal-comedy-skiing-game">2018</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-is-your-annual-reminder-to-play-skeal-this-christmas">2019</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/merry-christmas-its-time-to-play-skeal">2020</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-not-christmas-until-youve-played-skeal">2021</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skeal-reflects-the-power-pleasure-and-pain-of-all-our-christmasses">2022</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-we-go-ho-ho-its-time-for-your-annual-play-of-skeal">2023</a>. Alice <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alice0-is-leaving-rps-come-and-celebrate-her-work-and-make-lamentation">departed RPS back in April</a>, so I am continuing it in her stead.
</p>
<p>Skeal is a short, free joke created by Nick Cummings which you can <a href="https://whymog.itch.io/skeal-webgl-version">play in your browser</a>. It'll take you five minutes. Go do it now.
</p>
<p>Ah, that's fun, isn't it. A bit of silly wordplay blown up and out in a way that causes the delight to stack and multiply. Every year I forget the details of it, and every year I smile the first time I miss a gate and the "Pain" counter appears in the top left. 
</p><p>We play Skeal every year and invite you to do the same as a little marker in the closing season. I play every year, but in many ways the tradition begins for me long before I actually head over to Itch to find the game. It begins early in December when I first recall the tradition and start to sing around my kitchen. The mere thought of Skeal has become a prompt for reflection on where I've been and where I am. Briefly put? RPS, you remain my power, my pleasure, my pain.
</p>
<p>The nature of traditions is that we get to choose which we continue and which we don't. Alice O also played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rock-around-the-christmas-tree-with-dracula-cha-cha-and-christmas-pain-in-christmas-town">Dracula Cha Cha and Christmas Pain in Christmas Town</a> each December - fine traditions! - but I have let them go, for this year at least. 
</p>
<p>Of course, we likewise get to create new traditions of our own, should we want to. Who knows what Nic, Edwin, James and Ed might cook up in the months and years to come? That is for them to decide. For me, for now, I Skeal.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are no respawns until the next round and between rounds, you buy guns and equipment with money you earn from kills and winning.</p><p> That probably sounds a lot like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dust-2-new-crate-boost-update-counter-strike-2-valve-1851602614?_gl=1*1luxzsp*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk1MjM5NC45Ni4xLjE3MzM5NTQ2OTMuMTQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dust-2-new-crate-boost-update-counter-strike-2-valve-1851602614?_gl=1*1luxzsp*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk1MjM5NC45Ni4xLjE3MzM5NTQ2OTMuMTQuMC4w"><em>Counter-Strike</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>and that’s because, yeah, <em>Ballistic </em>is basically <em>Fortnite</em>’s<em> </em>version of Valve’s popular FPS. </p><p>Before I played a few matches, I was curious how well FPS gameplay would work in <em>Fortnite</em>. After a few matches of <em>Ballistic</em>, I came away impressed. Epic has done the work to make animations and movement feel and look good in the first-person perspective. Sprinting, climbing, aiming down sights, reloading, and all that feels snappy and responsive, like you’d expect from a well-made first-person shooter. </p><p>I do have some quibbles with the controls. I really want a button that lets me swap between my rifle and pistol. I’d love to be able to map my grenade and gadgets to specific buttons, too, instead of using <em>Fortnite</em>’s default inventory and hotbar system. But these are minor issues that could be fixed in future updates. For now, what’s here is a solid FPS that just happens to live in <em>Fortnite </em>and uses all the character and weapon skins you already own. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-goku-fortnite-vegeta-anime-update-dbz-1849420484?_gl=1*14um7a4*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk0NzY1My4xMTQuMS4xNzMzOTQ3ODg5LjQyLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-goku-fortnite-vegeta-anime-update-dbz-1849420484?_gl=1*14um7a4*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzk0NzY1My4xMTQuMS4xNzMzOTQ3ODg5LjQyLjAuMA..">Yes, that means Darth Vader can snipe Goku</a></span> while Leatherface helps Snoop Dogg plant the bomb at location A.

However, I experienced some issues with menus not loading properly, random sound effects happening for no reason, long waits between matches, and janky post-game victory screens. While I had a good time taking out <em>Fortnite </em>kiddies who have never played a game like <em>Counter-Strike</em>, I understand why Epic labeled this an “Early Access” experiment. It’s enjoyable, but far from finished or stable.</p><p>Still, even in this janky, early access form, Epic’s latest mode is a promising first step toward the developer adding more FPS modes and games into <em>Fortnite</em>. </p><p>Epic has also, with the launch of <em>Ballistic</em>, given the community the ability to start publicly uploading games using the company’s FPS tools.  I expect that in the coming days and weeks, we’ll see people recreating famous <em>Counter-Strike</em> maps and more. That sounds exciting, though if I was someone working on a first-person shooter that wasn’t <em>Call of Duty</em>, I’d be nervous. </p><p>If Epic can build upon <em>Ballistic </em>and add more modes, games, and options, it might be able to bring a whole new audience into its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-lego-fortnite-brick-life-roleplay-ps5-xbox-pc-1851716667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-lego-fortnite-brick-life-roleplay-ps5-xbox-pc-1851716667">ever-growing ecosystem</a></span>, and it might get even tougher than it already is to launch a multiplayer shooter. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

director, Miles Leslie, spoke about the balance between fun and realism.</p><p dir="ltr">"Fun always comes first for us," Leslie said. "Of course, we want to stay grounded in the DNA that makes a Black Ops game unique when it comes to core gameplay, but we also like to break the rules if it's going to maximize fun for players."</p><p dir="ltr">"When it comes to cosmetics, the Black Ops series naturally lends itself to some pretty outlandish themes when you consider we're the birthplace of Call of Duty Zombies and all of the crazy mindf**kery that comes with the storytelling in our games, so we like to have fun there too."</p><p dir="ltr">However, it's worth noting that Treyarch's mindset is slightly different when it comes to designing campaigns, which the developer explained remains focused on keeping the story as detailed and accurate as possible. "The Campaign has a tightly-defined cast of characters with an era-specific look to them that fits the story that we and our friends at Raven Software are telling,” Leslie explained.</p><p dir="ltr">When discussing the game's postseason narrative, the developer said the story is still taken seriously, but that "doesn't mean we can't have some fun with cosmetics along the way.”</p><p dir="ltr">This means players can likely expect plenty more of those wacky operator bundles hitting the shop for future seasons of Black Ops 6. Activision already teased an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-teases-squid-game-collab-for-black-ops-6-and-warzone/1100-6528158/">upcoming Squid Game collaboration</a> for January, so expect those bright pink suits to start showing up in Black Ops 6 and Warzone sometime in the new year.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1 Reloaded recently added more multiplayer maps, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-merry-mayhem-all-event-rewards/2900-6018/">Merry Mayhem holiday event</a>, and new DLC weapons.</p>

                <p>The distinctive "plumbob" icons from The Sims appear to be featured in a new movie, set to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. The film is called Twinless and concerns two friends who meet in a counseling group for bereaved twins.</p><p>Twinless will debut as part of Sundance's "U.S. Dramatic Competition," but was billed as a "dark comedy" by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/02/dylan-obrien-twinless-paramount-1235826958/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>.

Sweeney previously wrote, starred in, and directed the romantic comedy Straight Up.</p><p>In The Sims, the plumbob is a green crystal shape which indicates the Sim currently under the player's control. It is also a symbol for the franchise writ large, usually incorporated into the games' logos. The significance of the plumbob in Twinless is unknown, though it could be featured as part of the pair's Halloween costumes or the like.</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to EA for comment and has not received a response by time of publishing.</p><p>In other Sims news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-movie-moving-forward-at-amazon-mgm-apparently/1100-6523607/" data-ref-id="1100-6523607">a movie adaptation is on the way</a> from producer Margot Robbie and director Kate Herron (Loki).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/aetherdrift-brings-wacky-races-and-new-name-for-old-plane-to-magic-gathering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has revealed their first new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set of 2025. The latest set, <em>Aetherdrift, </em>brings a unique spin to the popular card game: a massive fantasy racing grand prix spread across three different planes. One of those planes is an old favorite with a changed name.</p>

<h2>The <em>Aetherdrift</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/planeswalkers-guide-to-aetherdrift-part-1" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast lets players know what they can expect in <em>Aetherdrift</em>. The set will revolve around ten racing teams competing in The Ghirapur Grand Prix, the most high-stakes racing competition in the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> multiverse.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aetherdrift-streets-artwork.jpg?itok=PrClPASp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aetherdrift-streets-artwork.jpg?itok=2oMbWLgw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The race will go through three different planes: Avishkar, Amonkhet, and Muraganda. Furthermore, the ten teams featured are as diverse as the premise suggests. They include The Speed Demons, whose vehicles are powered by demonic spirits, the Mad Max-coded Endriders, the chaotic Goblin Rocketeers, and the shark-people group known as The Keelhaulers.</p>

<p>As for the grand prize waiting the lucky winner, it is an artifact of power known as the Aetherspark, which can potentially grant the user the power of a Planeswalker.</p>

<p>But among all of this worldbuilding and lore is that one of the planes isn't a new one, but an older one under a different name: Avishkar. It was originally known as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/magic-the-gathering-kaladesh-spoilers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kaladesh</a>, the Indian fantasy-themed setting from <em>Magic's</em> history.</p>

<p>So why the change? The in-universe explanation is the plane was named after the Avishkar Assembly, a newly appointed democratic governing body which rose to prominence after overthrowing its monarchal Consulate government which the Phyrexian Invasion weakened<em>. </em>This ties the world to the events of an earlier set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/march-of-machine-battles-and-more-cards-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">M</a><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/march-of-machine-battles-and-more-cards-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>arch of the Machine</em></a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aetherdrift-avishkar-artwork.jpg?itok=Bd_anwEV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aetherdrift-avishkar-artwork.jpg?itok=Z2UeNbsO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The real world explanation is a bit more complicated. In a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/avishkar-why-we-changed-the-name-of-a-plane" rel="nofollow">separate blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast explains that the name Kaladesh carried unfortunate connotations in some Hindi dialects. Given that the setting is heavily inspired by India, it was an issue that had to be addressed.</p>

<p>According to their consultants, the name Kaladesh can be read as "kala-" meaning "tomorrow" or "art"&nbsp; and "-desh" meaning "home" or "country." On paper, this sounds fine. But, "kala-" can also be associated with the meaning "black" which carries colorist and racist connotations.</p>

<p>The new name, Avishkar, was also the result of this consultation. It comes from the Hindi word, "aavishkar" which means "invention." All earlier cards from earlier Kaladesh sets will still be referred to as such, but all cards released in the future will be called Avishkar.</p>

<p><em>Aetherdrift</em> will be available worldwide February 14, 2025.</p>

            <p>Infamous evolutionary flop <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spore">Spore</a>, for all its flaws, still had a lot of magic to it. It was fun to design your weird creatures, to watch them try to walk, and - in principle - to turn your humble creations into a spacefaring species.
</p>
<p>Curiosmos is a very different game, but it has a little of the same appeal. It's a galactic playground in which you smash meteors together to make planets, then tinker with the ecosystems of those planets to make life and watch that life evolve. All while a hungry black hole lingers nearby, eager to consume everything you have created. There's an explanatory video below.

<p>I drew comparisons with Spore, a game which tried to do everything, so I should stress that it doesn't look like you're directly creating the life that can wander about your planets. Instead, you seem to interact with the physics and elements of the solar system. For example, you can drag a cloud around to spread rainwater across the surface of a planet, perhaps turning it into an ocean world or simply making flowers grow.
</p>
<p>There's a playfulness to every interaction which I really enjoy. Don't like one of those flowers? Pluck it from the ground and toss it into deep space.
</p>
<p>It looks like a delightful playground, but there does seem to be some objectives and story to it. You're guided, somewhat, by a satellite called Curio, who apparently has some plan for dealing with the black hole that wants to devour everything. 
</p>
<p>There's no release date yet - and a lot of the footage used in the Day Of The Devs video comes from trailers released earlier this year - but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585710/Curiosmos/">follow the game on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Finals was released in December 2023, shadowdropped to an audience that was all too eager to receive it, and for a while, it turned heads. It wasn’t long before the free-to-play, live-service shooter dwindled a little, but it remains relatively innovative and fresh, boasting solid destructive mechanics, an entertaining gameplay loop, and a unique aesthetic.</p>



<p>Recently, Embark Studios revealed that an esports scene is on the way and that in 2025, a $100,000 Major will take place. That’s all the information the company parted ways with, but right now, <strong>not</strong> <strong>one organisation </strong>has invested in The Finals, which leaves us wondering who’s going to compete.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-who-will-play-at-the-finals-major">Who Will Play At The Finals Major?</h2>



<p>The Finals Major 2025 is a $100,000 tournament with an undetermined format, structure, and schedule. Nobody knows what it’ll look like, where it’ll be played, or which organisations will field a squad.</p>



<p>The Finals has been around for an entire year, and in that time, it has retained a decent core following.</p>



<p>If we use Steam as a representative example, we can see that the game peaked at 242,000 players when it came out, and right now, it floats around an average of about 14,000 – which <strong>isn’t bad</strong>. It’s a brand-new shooter that had absolutely no following when it dropped, so for it to still be securing those numbers on <strong>one platform </strong>is great.</p>



<p>On social media, Embark Studios posted a short teaser trailer promoting the impending $100,000 Major, but it could be several months before it takes shape.</p>



<p>What organisations do you want to see surface in The Finals? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has announced its ambition to bring all PC games with Xbox features into the Xbox app, and those plans continue today with the addition of over 400 games.</p><p>Xbox's Chris Charla <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/12/updates-to-the-xbox-app/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared the announcement</a> that games like Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove, Jackbox Party Pack, The Invincible, and "dozens of games from veteran Japanese studios Kemco and Kairosoft" are among the new additions to the Xbox app. Charla also noted that 100 of these titles support Xbox Play Anywhere, which means players who buy the Xbox console version can also play their games on PC as well.</p><p>Charla stated that universal Xbox ownership, universal cloud saves, and cross-play between Xbox games on console and PC are among the benefits of this arrangement. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> notes that this is part of a larger initiative for Microsoft to lure developers from rival digital storefronts, which includes the company dramatically lowering its cut from sales to just 12%. Charla promised that additional news will be announced at Game Developers Conference 2025, which will take place next March.</p><p>Although Xbox's direct-to-cloud controllers weren't mentioned by Charla, a previous report indicated that those are in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-planning-for-direct-to-cloud-controllers-and-higher-quality-streams-report/1100-6527246/" data-ref-id="1100-6527246">a testing and development phase</a>. The same report indicated that Microsoft is trying to improve the visual quality of its streams to make it possible to play Xbox games without a console that can perform at the same level as the Xbox Series X|S. Earlier this week, Microsoft also revealed that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members can take part in a test pilot program <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-adds-a-nice-new-feature-but-only-for-testers-right-now/1100-6528390/" data-ref-id="1100-6528390">to stream some games they own</a> on Xbox consoles.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a> is a prequel to the excellent topdown action-RPG from 2016, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>. The differences are myriad, given that Breaker is also 3D, open world, co-op and a roguelite. It also now has a release date for its launch into Steam Early Access: January 14th, 2025.

<p>The "Breakers" of the title are an organisation of warriors and explorers attempting to save the world after a war. What those Breakers do, and where its similar to its predecessor, is explore a world full of strange, abandoned buildings, with a plentiful sense of mystery. You'll also scavenge items that you can use to create your character build and change how you approach combat, and that combat is a mixture of ranged and melee with combos and parries.
</p>
<p>I loved Hyper Light Drifter, but it's always a worry when a game makes the leap to a new medium - and 3D, in many ways, is a different medium than 2D. Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/solar-ash">didn't love Heart Machine's last third-person action game Solar Ash</a>, and Edwin was not reassured <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breakers-3d-reworking-of-drifters-combat-is-promising-but-a-little-raw">by his Hyper Light Breaker hands-on</a> from back in March.
</p><p>"In general, I found my character to be unwieldy and a little unresponsive," wrote Edwin. "Equipped with dual knives and a pistol, they're one of several classes you'll be able to choose from in Breaker's final form, so perhaps I simply drew the short straw this time round. However, while the conspicuous recovery times of your attack and damage animations nudges you to memorise the inputs and avoid over-committing, Breaker's delays feel a little too drawn-out versus the overall floridity and fluidity of its presentation."
</p>
<p>I have hope in my heart (machine) all the same. It'll have had nearly another year of development by the time it launches, and it'll still be Early Access even at that. Plus, if Risk Of Rain can successfully leap into the third dimension, anything can.
