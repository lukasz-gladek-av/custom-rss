            <p>Surgent Studios founder Abubakar Salim has detailed more on the studio's next game, Dead Take, and its exploration of Hollywood, which stars Neil Newbon and Ben Starr as its two leads.</p>
<p>Newbon is perhaps best known as Astarion from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, among other roles, while Ben Starr starred as Clive in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and, most recently, as Verso in the well-received <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>
<p>Salim, himself an actor known for playing Bayek in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, described Dead Take to Eurogamer as "a reverse escape room" set in a Hollywood mansion. It's a psychological horror game that blurs the boundaries between film and game as it explores the theme of success.</p>

<p>"How far will you go for success?" asked Salim. "What are you willing to give for that? Can you separate the art from the artist?"</p>
<p>The fresh teaser trailer, above, hints at what we can expect from both gameplay and the actors' performances.</p>
<p>Salim explained players will be exploring the mansion to solve puzzles by finding live-action clips containing solutions that can be spliced together. It all sounds very Alan Wake meets <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/her-story">Her Story</a> to me, with Salim admitting both were influences.</p>
<p>Indeed, the use of live-action footage will reflect the game's themes and the focus on the acting profession. "You're going to be watching Ben and Neil do their work on screen as actors," said Salim. "And the reason why is because I didn't want them to hide behind animated characters, or 3D characters. I wanted to show you <em>them</em>. That's essentially something that I really wanted to hammer in as well, while using these guys, is because we're so used to seeing them behind Astarion or Clive. What are they as actors when you see them in the flesh?"</p>
<p>As such, the game's blurring of boundaries is a reflection of Salim's own career, balancing game development with working as an actor himself, most recently in Game of Thrones spin-off House of the Dragon.</p>
<p>The studio's previous game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a> was a personal project for Salim, influenced by his own experience of grief after the passing of his father. Dead Take, initially at least, is a highly contrasting follow-up, but it's no less personal.</p>
<p>"Within Hollywood and acting, I've experienced and seen and heard a lot of stories of people who would do and give anything for stardom and are quite openly very comfortable with that," he said. "It's quite frightening."</p>
<p>Salim explained how the game will explore abuse of power and the toxicity of fame, which he, Starr, and Newbon have all witnessed in their careers. "I grew up with these guys," said Salim, who's worked together with both actors in the past. "Now we're in the games industry together, and yet the stories are always the same. That is essentially what I really wanted to depict and play with here, pulling from very raw and honest, truthful spaces."</p>
<p>He added: "The reason why it's with friends is because it deals with such raw and honest topics that are based on reality, and the only people you can really do that with, or explore that with, are people that you trust and rely on and are incredibly professional. It's very revealing."</p>

</figure>
<p>Still, the horror tone of Dead Take is in stark contrast to Tales of Kenzera. "People have an idea in regards to 'oh, this is the kind of game that you'll always make as a studio'," said Salim. "With Dead Take, this is us saying 'we're storytellers first and foremost' and that's really what's key for this.</p>
<p>"People would have obviously expected a similar element or ilk of Zau with it, but actually what we want to show is that we are diverse in regards to the stories that we can tell and the genres and the spaces and the places we can play in."</p>
<p>He continued: "It's coming from a place of what's the story we want to tell, what's the best medium for it, and what's also the best genre or take on it? And what better way of exploring how far you will go than putting you in a first-person psychological horror game where you're playing an actor who literally is always living on the edge of 'I don't know when my next paycheck is coming through'? How do I secure a legacy? How do I secure that my sense of self is important and valid? That is the journey of an actor, constantly."</p>
<p>Essentially, Dead Take will peel back the layers on Salim's own work as an actor. "The more you succeed, or the deeper down you go, the darker it gets, the weirder it gets, the more behind the curtains you see," he said of the game. "It's very different playing a day part of a film than playing the lead role in something. The lead role, you're so much more involved, you see more of how the cogs are working. That's the journey I want to take you on here."</p>
<p>The personal experience of Salim, Newbon, and Starr will only add to the game's authenticity, again paralleling Tales of Kenzera and its Afrofuturist aesthetic inspired by the Bantu Tales. "In truth," said Salim,"for us the only thing we can do is speak from that authenticity. And this game made sense for that."</p>
<p>Dead Take will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-maker-pocketpair-to-publish-tales-of-kenzera-studios-next-game">published by Palworld maker Pocketpair</a>. "It's really lovely when you meet someone who's aligned in regards to the vision of where they want to see the industry go," said Salim of the collaboration. "It's like fireworks, it just made sense."</p>
<p>Dead Take doesn't yet have a release date, but will launch later this year on PC (Steam). The studio also has another game in development, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">Afrofuturist gothic-horror RPG currently known as Project Uso</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-newbon-and-ben-starr-lead-surgent-studios-new-live-action-psychological-horror-blurring-film-and-game-boundaries]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/can-donkey-kong-bananzas-smash-happy-platforming-make-the-switch-2-sing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/can-donkey-kong-bananza%E2%80%99s-smash-happy-platforming-make-the-switch-2-sing.1232700/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the surprises just revealed about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is that the game comes from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/01/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-confirmed-as-super-mario-odyssey-team/">the team behind Super Mario Odyssey at Nintendo EPD Tokyo</a> – the director and designers have not been confirmed by Nintendo, but that this project is from the same studio will absolutely raise expectations – and having spent a few hours playing the game, I can see some of that freewheeling design ethos shining through. Yes, this is a game where you can mindlessly smash stuff, but there’s also a lot of clever design around this core gameplay hook to provide more structure, bring delight through different gameplay ideas and abilities, and fill the world with challenges and diversions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza –&nbsp;Smashing platforming that makes the Switch 2 sing" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YI0hPqY5O-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At the core of any 3D platformer is how you get around, and Donkey Kong Bananza is a delight in that regard. In contrast to the carefully measured jumping distances and heights of a Mario game, DK can barrel his way through the worlds. There’s a real heft and weight to his running, jumping and forward tumbling, but he can also grab onto and clamber up most vertical surfaces in a way that is so immediate and empowering. There’s obviously a route planned for you to follow, some prescribed paths and goals to reach, but you’re also deeply rewarded for using DK’s movement abilities to get off the beaten path.</p>


<p>You can also just reshape the world. There’s three buttons dedicated to punching – one each for forward, upward and downward punching – and DK’s strength is such that he can just obliterate chunks of the world, carving out tunnels through the rock with his bare fists. Depending on the softness of the terrain, that will be quicker or slower, and things like concrete cannot be punched through, but instead need you to find the exploding purple rock known as Boom Bombs to chuck at it. This also feeds into the combat, with many enemies having skeletal bodies that have been encased in rock for you to smash through first.</p>


<p>What digging really allows for, though, is uncovering secrets hidden below the surface. It feels like there’s a never-ending string of surprises and delights to find by smashing holes in the world. There’s a whole bunch of Banandium Gem bananas to find, with every fifth gem that DK gobbles up netting you a skill point to unlock and augment his abilities – things like jumping off a held rock to hop further, a spinning attack, or extended range for his sonar-like ground slaps. There’s also chests that can be spawned in as dynamic rewards, giving a nice bundle of gold or maps to some of the collectables hidden elsewhere – like fossils which are needed for buying new costumes and hair colours. And heck, there can also just be entire caverns or rooms hidden away for you to find when you smash through their walls!</p>
<p>As was revealed during last week’s Nintendo Direct, the purple crystalline buddy that was featured in DK Bananza’s initial reveal is actually Pauline. This is a younger version of the character that is yet to become mayor of New Donk City, where her one true aspiration is to become a famous singer – and a powerful singer, at that. The pair of them have to adventure deep to the centre of this world where legend has it that they’ll be rewarded with their dreams coming true. Each world you play through might as well be being bathed in daylight, even if its supposedly miles underground. It’s a very Disney Channel, kid-friendly rendition of Pauline’s character that I instinctively fear will start to grate through the story, but it’s also a good way of giving DK a new adventuring companion and bridging some of the divide between Donkey Kong Country and the Mario series.</p>
<p>Pauline’s singing, though, is the key to continuing their adventure. Certain parts of the world have been blocked off by a shimmery purple goop, which can only be removed by reaching the point from which it’s spread and having Pauline sing to break through the tape blocking it, unleashing DK’s movement abilities on these areas once more.</p>

<p>And then there’s the various Bananza transformations that her voice can trigger. Kong Bananza transforms DK into a bare-buttocked giant of himself, able to smash even through concrete with a little bit of wind up, greatly helping with certain fights and challenges. It’s pretty much what you’d expect, the only limit being how long the transformation lasts before you need to collect gold and recharge. The second transformation is Ostrich Bananza, lending DK the ability to flap and then glide through the air, even dropping explosive eggs from up high – they’re trickier to aim than you might like, and there’s more to come beyond that.</p>
<p>We got to play with DK’s Ostrich form in a level deeper into the game where there’s vine-link tree trunks to clamber around on, lower platforms sit amidst poisonous water, and ostrich peoples to meet. It was really just a glimpse of what’s to come, and this area where we could experience Ostrich Bananza wasn’t really the best use of this form, just scratching the surface of what it could offer in terms of gameplay. These Bananza transformations are what I’m most curious to see explored through the full game.</p>
<p>You’ll also get to use these transformations on plenty of occasions through the challenge stages that you can find dotted around the world. Teleporting you to different arenas, they can be straight up timer battles, side-scrolling stages, or something a bit more puzzling – like having Kong Bananza and needing to completely demolish a house in the most effective way possible. It’s like the Shrines from Breath of the Wild…. but you’re DK instead.</p>

<p>Having Pauline along for the adventure opens up the option of co-op gameplay for Donkey Kong Bananza, in a fashion very much in keeping with Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Odyssey. It’s the same style of lopsided co-op where one person plays as the main character and the other can add a bit of chaotic help to the action, though there’s some really neat tricks that feed off the world deformation and materials as well. Simply put, Pauline can sing and shout ranged attacks, which are targeted by player 2, making great use of motion control pointing or the mouse mode –&nbsp;it was this latter option that we tried, and it naturally works great for aiming.</p>
<p>What’s very cool is that Pauline’s shouts can absorb materials from the world and then send word-shaped blocks flying – it defaults back to stone if nothing has been absorbed. This even includes the Boom Bombs rock, which is great for battles where you need to smash through rocky outer shells, but it also allows you to pick up softer earth and create in-game sculptures in a much simpler fashion than just playing as DK. The only limit is that Pauline only has so many charges of a material before needing to recharge.</p>

<p>While this kind of co-op is far from essential, it’s still great to have for family gaming. That there’s also support for GameShare support for both Switch 2 and Switch 1 locally, and via GameChat is also fantastic.</p>
<p>I was a little unsure of Donkey Kong Bananza from my first hands on at the Switch 2 reveal event, but while some elements like just how chaotic and frenzied the screen can get while digging with complete abandon still feel a little unlike Nintendo, playing for longer reveals a lot more of what this team are trying to do and how the inventiveness that’s been a core part of this studio’s games for so long can really shine through.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/technology/reviews/backbone-pro-review-controller-that-wants-to-be-controller-you-take-to-every</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/backbone-pro-review-a-controller-that-wants-to-be-the-controller-you-take-to-every-device.1232694/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's impossible to ignore mobile gaming, and in a household where the TV is shared, having a Switch or a game on my phone to play has always been important. Over the past month, I've been rigorously putting the Backbone Pro to the test to see if it's not just a daily driver for a mobile controller, but also worth being a controller for my PC, TV, or tablet.</p>

<p>To give a rough overview of the form factor and layout, the Backbone Pro features Xbox face buttons, two asymmetrical control sticks, and all of the other buttons you'd expect, including a screenshot button and a Backbone button used to sometimes bring you back to the home app.</p>

<h2>Not Just For Mobile Phones</h2>

<p>There's also the titular 'backbone,' the rigid flat bar connecting the left half of the controller with the right, and a USB-C port on the right interior. One of the major benefits of the Backbone Pro though, is that it isn't just intended to be a controller for your phone, but with some nice Quality of Life options in the app easily pairs with your computer, TV, or any other Bluetooth-enabled device.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-expanded.jpg?itok=Sju3QfYY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-expanded.jpg?itok=vlqnTzTs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What the Backbone Pro looks like expanded, with the help of my phone case</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd expect of the Backbone, its primary purpose is--or maybe more correctly now, was--to serve as a premium controller to plug into your phone. Whether you're playing games locally on your phone like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f8851e33-5ece-492a-ad7d-497b40971808" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/high-stakes-how-balatro-confronts-addiction-and-roguelikes" rel="nofollow"><em>Balatro </em></a>or<em> <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ff64fef-2548-48f1-b672-70a927042f07" href="https://techraptor.net/games/infinity-nikki" rel="nofollow">Infinity Nikki</a></em>, or streaming the latest games through Xbox Gamepass or Nvidia GeForce Now, this controller is meant to give you a Nintendo Switch-like gaming experience.</p>

<p>One unfortunate part of the Backbone Pro is that there isn't any kind of "expand and lock" feature. Every time I wanted to get my phone into the device, I have to do a clumsy kind of expanding motion with one hand holding it open, while fumbling with the other hand to align the phone with the USB-C port.</p>

<p>Once it's in, it's extremely snug, but it's a bit of a fight against the controller until then.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-xbox-controller-comparison.jpg?itok=WFswRusK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-xbox-controller-comparison.jpg?itok=WKBm9FWt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>About the same width, but very different shape</figcaption></figure><p>While it is a mobile controller, it's certainly not a cramped controller (which is excellent for someone with larger hands like me). When not connected to a phone it cinches up to be approximately the same width as a standard Xbox Series X|S controller, the major difference being that the buttons for the Xbox controller are closer together, with the grips making an upside-down V shape, whereas the Backbone controls are more parallel to one another.</p>

<p>Another nice touch, especially as mobile phones are losing their headphone port, is that at the base of the left grip there is a headphone port.</p>

<h2>Expanded or Unexpanded?</h2>

<p>The parallel controls led to an interesting situation for me. While playing with a phone plugged in the spread of the controller made the straight-on halves of the Backbone Pro extremely comfortable to play with. It was easy to nestle the full controller into the palm of my hand. Conversely, the times that I played using the controller as a standalone Bluetooth device, connected to my PC or TV, in its unexpanded form, led to having to have my wrists at an odd angle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-nicer-close-up.jpg?itok=ciyDzedT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-nicer-close-up.jpg?itok=rkq5Ammw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>USB-C passthrough, along with a sync button and headphone jack can be seen under the controller</figcaption></figure><p>I'd compare this experience to someone using Joy-Cons mounted in the Joy-Con grip. It will certainly work, but it doesn't feel quite as nice as a traditional controller.</p>

<p>The face buttons have more space to breathe from one another, but not so much that you can't get at all of them with a well-placed rolling thumb. While all the buttons have a more squishy feel as opposed to a click, the D-pad suffers from this squishiness the most. If you like that fast feedback on your D-pad for fighting games or retro platformers then unfortunately this controller won't be for you.</p>

<h2>The Backbone Software</h2>

<p>One of the most impressive aspects of the Backbone Pro was the software in the Backbone app to back it up. Once connected to your phone you can launch the Backbone app. This serves as a hub not only recognizing what games you have on your phone, but also what streaming service libraries have to offer.</p>

It was pretty impressive to see on initial boot <em>Balatro</em>, which I had most recently played, as well as links to the Xbox app and Steam Remote Play.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there were a number of 'Touch-Only' games that did appear in my library, like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="97fd06ae-7da1-41c2-ae4a-97eca3bf5b59" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/how-to-play-pokemon-tcg-like-pro" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em></a> and the <em>New York Times Games</em> app, but other games like <em>Set </em>and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="31c4e687-3a88-4358-8d59-776dca35c4b9" href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-go" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Go</em></a> that didn't appear at all.</p>

<p>For these games that don't officially support controllers, Backbone has a feature called TouchSync. This lets you map button presses to portions of the screen. For a game with a mobile-only interface you can make it so that pressing the A button will touch the button on the screen creating a bridge between a mobile game that's touch only, and a mobile game that supports controllers.</p>

<p>I expect that for games like <em>Pokemon Go</em>, that don't show up in the app at all, there's a fear that TouchSync could be detected as a cheating tool so the Backbone app errs on the side of caution.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-pairing-screen.jpg?itok=u-BIKn0g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-pairing-screen.jpg?itok=K89UeoNI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Monitor phone and controller stats, while quickly pivoting between devices​​​​​</figcaption></figure><p>The other fantastic feature of the Backbone Pro controller, when connected to your phone, is that you can swap what device it is paired with by bringing up the controller's settings. Even to this day I've got a separate Xbox controller for my Xbox, one for my Steam Link, and one for the PC just so that I don't need to spend the few second unpairing and repairing.</p>

<p>With this app functionality, you can toggle between any of these devices with the tap of a button. I was genuinely impressed with just how easy this was. The only downside of this is that you need to have your phone physically connected to the device to access these options.</p>

<p>This also made it incredibly easy to be playing through a game like <em>South of Midnight</em> on my phone while on the couch, and then when the TV became free I could swap inputs from my phone to my TV and pick up immediately where I left off. The combination of Backbone Pro and Xbox Gamepass honestly felt like the future of gaming that services like Google Stadia were trying to achieve, maybe ahead of their time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/backbone-pro-back-buttons.jpg?itok=hdomUNAO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/backbone-pro-back-buttons.jpg?itok=XzxP9yWp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Back buttons future proof the Backbone Pro</figcaption></figure><h2>Backbone Pro Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's clear that the Backbone's strength, and main focus is still in being a mobile first controller. With the Backbone app you can easily turn your touchscreen phone into a controller-first experience, including the ability to 'convert' some games from touch to controller interface.</p>

<p>That being said, as more and more devices become controller compatible, especially with the advent of Xbox's "This is an Xbox" campaign Backbone seems incredibly ahead of the curve creating a controller that not only syncs up with all Bluetooth devices, but also allows for easy swapping between them all.</p>

<p>If you've been waiting for a controller for your phone, this is going to be the one you want to buy. There's enough smart engineering in here and forethought for the landscape that mobile and cloud gaming is heading in that it's going to be a pricier purchase now that will pay off time and time again.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-take-neil-newbon-ben-starr</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surgent-studios-dead-take-will-star-baldurs-gate-3-and-clair-obscur-icons.1232691/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent Studios has revealed the two main stars of its upcoming psychological horror game&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>, and they'll be familiar to you if you're a big RPG fan.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the first big name joining the cast of&nbsp;<em>Dead Take&nbsp;</em>is Ben Starr. If you don't know the name, perhaps you'll know him from what are likely his most iconic roles, namely&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a>'s Clive Rosfield and&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s Verso.</p>

<p>Joining Starr as&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s co-lead is Neil Newbon, whose voice you'll likely recognize as that of perennially horny party member&nbsp;Astarion in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>. He's also played roles in the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/detroit-become-human" rel="nofollow"><em>Detroit: Become Human</em></a>, to name but a few items on his resume.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-neil-newbon-ben-starr-door.jpg?itok=aZJtTeiJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-neil-newbon-ben-starr-door.jpg?itok=8yo53AVW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Spooky psychological horror game&nbsp;<em>Dead Take&nbsp;</em>will have two very recognizable leads.</figcaption></figure><p>Starr will play Vinny Monroe, while Newbon will take the role of Chase Lowry. In a new teaser trailer, both Monroe and Lowry's names are linked to another character called "Willie"; I presume they're both actors playing this role, and in true horror fashion, it's all going to get a little bit&nbsp;<em>Black Swan</em>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/surgent-pocketpair-dead-take" rel="nofollow">first announced earlier this month</a>, and it's the next major project from&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent Studios. It'll also serve as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-developer-to-publish-horror-game-by-tales-of-kenzera-zau-devs" rel="nofollow">first big publishing effort</a> for&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair.</p>

<p>The game will take place in a "luxurious yet secluded Hollywood Hills mansion", according to a press release, and will see players taking the role of an actor searching for their missing friend.</p>

<p>You shouldn't expect too much high-octane combat from this one; instead, you'll be solving "escape room-style puzzles" and splicing together live-action videos&nbsp;<em>Immortality</em>-style, hence the presence of Starr and Newbon.</p>




<p><em>Dead Take&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but it's slated to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> later this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Bit of an odd one in businessworld. Ubisoft have handed the job of selling their upcoming fantasy strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era">Heroes Of Might And Magic: Olden Era</a> to another publisher. Hooded Horse are taking on that task, a crowd you might know as the purveyor of other strategical capers like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norland">Norland</a> and the like. Experienced tactics barons and ostensibly the right bunch for the job. The question that's bugging me is: why? The answer is probably: money.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are thrilled to welcome Hooded Horse aboard to support the next chapter of Heroes of Might and Magic," said Alain Corre, Ubi's chief publishing officer. "Their passion for the franchise and strong connection with strategy communities make them the perfect complement to Unfrozen’s creative talent."</p>
<p>Unfrozen are the studio who're actually making the game, and who likewise say they are "very excited" to be casting their spells under the watchful gaze of Tim Bender, the CEO of Hooded Horse, whose steadily growing payload of strategy games grows ever more threatening to the western world. </p>
<p>"This is a unique relationship," said a representative from Hooded Horse, who clarified that the strategy specialists will be taking over the "day-to-day operations of publishing" the game, and will be listed alongside Ubi on the Steam page.</p>
<p>"Hooded Horse will serve as publisher like it does for all of its other titles, but Ubisoft remains in the picture as well, supporting where needed, and it also remains the owner of the Heroes IP."</p>
<p>It's hard to know the exact reasons for offloading such a game to another publisher, but it's possibly a result of Ubisoft's ongoing internal fidgeting - a decision that benefits some spreadsheet somewhere in the blue-lit bowels of the accounting department. Press releases like the one quoted above don't normally enlighten anyone as to the real logic behind the slow and inscrutable movements of large companies. 

</p><p>For their part, Unfrozen say publishing with Hooded Horse "means more marketing support, better visibility, and helps extend our reach to more regions." But it's hard to understand why a giant like Ubisoft couldn't provide such things themselves. We've asked them for comment.</p>
<p>Earlier this year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Ubisoft split into two separate entities</a>, like some freaky dungeon slime. One big Tencent-flavoured subsidiary carved off Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six , and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> games, while other games (your Princes of Persia, your Raymans) remained more firmly on the French behemoth's plate. Since then Ubisoft have warned of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-push-back-some-of-our-biggest-games-and-announce-further-cost-cutting-after-a-challenging-year">delays and cost-cutting</a>. This deal with Hooded Horse might simply be one of those cost-cutting measures. </p>
<p>As for the game itself, Heroes Of Might And Magic: Olden Era was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-announce-new-back-to-roots-heroes-of-might-magic-game-with-the-iratus-devs-in-charge">announced last year</a> and its early access release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3105440/view/585018505747763751?snr=1_5_9_">has been delayed until later this year</a>, say the developers. It's a turn-based strategy prequel that wants to go back to the series roots. You'd have to get some mucky hands to find those roots - they're buried back in 1995. I'll probably sit it out, for fear of 30 years of lore. </p>
<p><em>Disclosure: I worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cataclismo">Cataclismo</a> as a writer, which was eventually published by Hooded Horse.</em></p>

Naturally, seeing these two square off in a wrestling match gets your imagination flowing—what other sports rivals would be great to see in the ring? From the past to the present, there are a ton of hypothetical matchups that would not only be awesome to watch but fun to play for yourself in <em>WWE 2K</em>.</p><p>And then there are the storylines and personas that these athletes could have as professional wrestlers. The subtext to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8glzO2QHRA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8glzO2QHRA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brunson and Haliburton facing off in the ring last year</a></span> (and what subsequently happened in the playoffs this year) makes this DLC truly rewarding for basketball fans.</p><p>So imagine taking some of the best trash talkers and personalities from other sports and bringing their rivalries to the ring—the storylines for these fights would be incredible.</p></div></div><div><p> Let’s start off with a no-brainer, as this rivalry already has a bit of pro wrestling to it, courtesy of John Cena’s “you can’t see me” taunt. One of the most contentious feuds in The W right now dates back to Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark’s college days, and there’s always chirping and physicality when these two face off. Stripping away all the culture wars and B.S. that surrounds them, this would be a perfect match to bring into the ring—especially with some potentially wild finishing moves. CC could leap off the top rope, or even a steel cage for extra distance, to mimic her signature logo 3s. And Angel’s physicality is tailor-made for wrestling—think Jade Cargill, who shook up the entire WWE when she debuted. Her finisher would naturally involve tossing someone into the ropes and slamming them on the rebound. </p></div><div><p>More of a figurative rivalry, this one pits the old (read: current, for LeBron fans) face of the league against one of the many young stars trying to take over. We chose Ant because his personality isn’t just great for the NBA, it would make him a must-watch WWE superstar. His walkout would ooze swagger, and his pre-match trash talk would be second to none. Not to mention, he’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN-Qw1vO3e8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN-Qw1vO3e8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fierce competitor who thinks he can dominate any sport</a></span>, so he’d eagerly jump into the ring without hesitation.</p><p>LeBron is a certified GOAT, but he’s also one of sports’ greatest “what if he played another sport” athletes. His size and strength, combined with his speed and agility, make him an ideal fit for wrestling. Add in his goofy personality and intense competitiveness, and the lead-up to this match would be an all-time classic.</p></div><div><p>Similar to LeBron and Ant, this is more of a figurative rivalry—one based on position and stature rather than direct animosity. Of course, the media would play up the ex-teammates angle, and honestly, that makes for a perfect WWE backstory. It would go something like this: Judge and Soto were a dominant tag team duo, coming so close winning a belt, only for Soto to turn heel and join their rival tag team. </p><p>These two would also make incredible wrestlers. You’ve got the Yankees captain—a towering figure in his sport—who would dominate the ring, throwing people over the top rope for fun, just like he smashes baseballs with ease. Then there’s the New York turncoat: a young, generational talent who’d be simply good at everything. He’s got strength, agility, bravado, and his signature shuffle would be the perfect in-ring taunt. This would be a marquee matchup for a SummerSlam-type event, with hype levels through the roof.</p></div><div><p> NFL rivalries more often thrive between teams, not players. It’s tough to get two players to constantly match up against one another because of the size of the rosters and the timing of the schedule. However, recently, we’ve gotten to witness a recurring matchup between Pat Mahomes and Josh Allen in the playoffs. Mahomes dominates the matchup in real life, but that’s all the more reason to give Chiefs and Bills fans the chance to fight this one out in the ring. </p><p>The three-time Super Bowl champion would be a pesky wrestler, always escaping defeat—whether it was by some unbelievable “how did he do that??” move or with a little help from the referees. He’d be the champion most wrestling fans love to hate, even though they couldn’t deny his immense talent. His Buffalo Bills rival, on the other hand, would be a really physical wrestler. He’d be extremely tough, often fighting through injuries, and while he wouldn’t have a perfect record in title matches, he’d continuously make his presence felt in the ring, denying anyone who would count him out. </p></div><div><p> One of the greatest rivalries of the modern era, these two soccer GOATs would be an amazing fight in the ring. Ronaldo, a physical specimen, would be ruthless, taunting his opponents long before the match even began, all while showing off his opulent lifestyle, filled with money, women, and crazed fans. Messi is a humble fighter who’d be arguably the hardest to pin down, submit, or even catch with his quickness. Think prime Ric Flair, if he were more chiseled, vs. pre-heel John Cena, if he were more athletic.</p><p>Their storylines leading into the fight would be amazing—a true spectacle, as polar opposites entering the ring. Similar to real life, rabid fans would endlessly play and replay this fight, only adding another championship to their storied careers, stoking the debate further between these two legends. </p></div><div><p> We’ve seen glimpses of this fight already in the NBA, but c’mon, we gotta see the whole thing. These two Western Conference heels would be right at home in a WWE ring, trying to take home the belt for the most annoying superstar. Honestly, I think Green would win this matchup easily. He’d clearly use any and all dirty moves to win. But at that point, it should just turn into a Gauntlet match, with the four-time NBA champion facing all of his victims over the years: Sabonis, Nurkic, Poole—the list goes on. </p><p>And honestly, all of those guys would make for hilarious wrestlers. Just imagine Jordan Poole flying into the ring, trying to pull off a Ricochet-esque move, while Steph Curry’s enforcer just punches him mid-air. That’d be must-watch TV. </p></div><div><p> Another recent rivalry from The W, these two power forwards have been sparring for the past few years with championships on the line. A’ja, the best player in the league, versus Stewie, who’s got an all-time great collection of championship trophies and awards, would be a must-watch title fight—a Bianca Belair vs. Charlotte Flair-level matchup. </p><p>This would honestly be a great WWE rivalry that would span multiple years and title fights. Depending on the year, either one of these champs could come out on top, and their legacies would be forever connected. Bring in Sabrina Ionescu and Chelsea Gray for tag-team matches, and we’d truly get some iconic moments. </p></div><div><p>If you want trash talk, drama, and Hall-of-Fame basketball players facing off in the ring, then this rivalry would be a must-watch. KG’s infamous taunting of Carmelo one night in The Garden is a legendary tale in the NBA world, and getting to play this fight out would be pure comedy. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10144935-video-carmelo-anthony-reveals-kevin-garnett-said-wild-s--t-before-2013-fight&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10144935-video-carmelo-anthony-reveals-kevin-garnett-said-wild-s--t-before-2013-fight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We’ve learned that the rumored “Honey Nut Cheerios” taunt wasn’t actually real</a></span>, but in the WWE, it definitely could be. There was also the confrontation at the team bus after the game, which is a classic WWE plot device, with many iconic wrestling moments going down in parking garages.</p><p>But just imagine the actual fight—the Knicks legend already in the ring, staring at the entrance, as The Big Ticket comes out to his hype song, with that huge grin on his face, just stuffing Honey Nut Cheerios in his mouth. The energy in the arena would be electric. And if KG pulls off the upset with Melo, he’d have to hit the crowd with an “Anything is Possibleeee” scream.</p></div><div><p> Another fight that we got a chance to see play out in real life, Joey Bats vs. Odor was an instant classic in the baseball world. But with only one good punch thrown, we clearly need the chance to play out the full fight in the ring. This fight would have a great storyline, too, with Bautista dropping his famous bat-flip celebration on one of Odor’s allies—just for the former second baseman for the Texas Rangers to sucker punch him in the ring and challenge him to a title fight. Embarrassed, Bautista would have to accept, and these two would fight tooth and nail to win. If they each brought a few teammates along, this could make for a thrilling TLC match as well. </p></div><div><p>We all know the classic Bird vs. Magic rivalry, but honestly, there’s an opportunity for <em>WWE 2K</em> fans to run a Triple Threat match and include another all-time great—Dr. J—in the mix. The question is, would any of these superstars form a temporary truce to win? Ask someone from that generation, and it would probably make them short-circuit just to contemplate this matchup. This fight would be amazing not only for the storylines between the three superstars entering the ring but also for the differences in their wrestling styles.</p><p>The Lakers legend would have some of the slickest moves the WWE has ever seen, making every win look effortless. The Celtics great would just outwork his opponents, never submitting and never backing down. And Julius, with his unmatched athleticism, would fly off the ropes every chance he got with an acrobatic finisher.</p></div><div><p>In a Women’s Royal Rumble, we’d need the WNBA’s GOAT to go up against the insane talent she faced over the course of her career. As the first entrant, The White Mamba would have to start against one of her closest friends, but also fiercest rivals, Sue Bird. From there, the other superstars the retired 20-year veteran had to battle over her historic career would slowly stream in: Candace Parker, Maya Moore, A’ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart, Caitlin Clark, and Skylar Diggins. There would be no shortage of talent in the ring during this Rumble.</p><p>Taurasi would make for an incredible wrestler, too, with her skills on the mic almost matching her greatness in the ring. She’s equal parts funny and acerbic, and you’d never know if she was just toying with you or actually clowning you out of the arena.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/wwe-2k-dlc-tyrese-haliburton-jalen-brunson-rivalry-1851785376]]></content:encoded>

Following EA's announcement, the NBA 2K account <a href="https://x.com/NBA2K/status/1939805441468342727" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a cryptic message</a> that suggested college basketball might be in the works for the NBA 2K series.</p><p>"The campus has been quiet for too long," the post said.</p><p>A spokesperson for 2K, meanwhile, told GameSpot, "2K is the undisputed home of basketball gaming. We have a strong history with college hoops and are exploring exciting new ways to bring athletes and schools to life. Class is in session."</p><p>2K Sports previously published the College Hoops 2K series, featuring real schools from NCAA universities. 2K shut down the series after College Hoops 2K8, which was released in 2007. EA's own NCAA Basketball series was discontinued after 2009's NCAA Basketball 2010.</p><p>On June 30, EA announced it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-college-basketball-game-16-years-after-the-last-one/1100-6532831/" data-ref-id="1100-6532831">making a new college basketball game</a>. It also came to light that the Collegiate Licensing Corporation sought bidders to make a new college basketball game, with multiple parties submitting bids, though none were named outright. The CLC's proposal called for women's basketball teams to be included alongside men's teams.</p><p>From the wording of the NBA 2K social media post, and the fact that it came from the NBA 2K account, it sounds like this won't be a new College Hoops game but instead a college mode within NBA 2K--which is something fans have been asking for. However, that's not confirmed at this stage.</p><p>There is a lot of money in college sports video games, as EA's recent College Football 25 made more than <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$1 billion in revenue</a> and was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">2024's No. 2 best-selling game overall in the US. </a> Any new college basketball games or modes likely won't be made in partnership with the NCAA, which broke off with video game publishers years ago due to a variety of legal and financial reasons.</p><p>EA's new college basketball game isn't expected to arrive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-college-basketball-game-16-years-after-the-last-one/1100-6532831/" data-ref-id="1100-6532831">until 2028</a>, while the next NBA 2K title is due out this year.

            <p>
Last week, Riot Games announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">pulling the plug on promising Minecraft-like sandbox game Hytale</a> after over a decade of development. Since then, several notable names have been linked to possible revival efforts as fans search for a way the project could be saved, but now one of those name - Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone - has distanced himself from reports he could help resurrect Hytale.
</p>
<p>
Hytale, to give you the potted history, started development in 2015, and was an attempt by developer Hypixel to combine the mini-games found on its hugely popular eponymous Minecraft server with its own RPG-like, Minecraft-style sandbox experience, built from the ground up. It generated enough buzz that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games heavily invested in the project before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">acquiring Hypixel in 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last week, however, Riot announced it was ending development on the still-unreleased project as it "became clear we couldn't bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise." At the time, there was suggestion Hypixel had unsuccessfully attempted to shop the game around to "investors or acquirers who could continue to help carry Hytale forward", leading to employee layoffs and the studio's imminent closure.
</p>
<p>
Fans, however, weren't quite ready to give up after a ten year wait for Hytale, and took to social media in a bid to convince industry figures they should pitch in to help save the project. Stardew Valley creator Eric Barone, for instance, was <a href="https://x.com/not_mynes/status/1938700223511159281">accosted on Discord</a> by a fan eager to save Hytale. After receiving the sales pitch - "I assume this investment would pay out for you too" - Barone responded noncommittally, "Possibly, but I would have to hear more about what the plan is, why it failed initially (behind the scenes), etc."
</p>
<p>
With fans perhaps reading more into that "possibly" than was ever intended, Barone has now released a follow-up statement clarifying his position. Noting that his widely shared original comment was "not a public message [he] was trying to convey", Barone <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">told Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, "I'm not actively doing anything to make this happen. If something were presented to me, I would be open to entertaining the idea, that's all. It's not something I am thinking about too much, since I'm focused on working on my next game."
</p>
<p>
Barone is currently developing spooky chocolate-making life sim Haunted Chocolatier, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">announced in 2021</a>. Work paused temporarily while his attention shifted back to Stardew Valley and its unexpectedly massive 1.6 update, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-hes-back-working-on-next-project-haunted-chocolatier">development resumed last December</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while Barone's focus is currently elsewhere, there's perhaps still some hope for Hytale fans. Original Hypixel founder Simon Collins-Laflamme - who departed the company following its acquisition by Riot - has also become embroiled in the community's Save Hytale campaign, telling fans he's willing to "reach out" to Riot with a possible $25m investment proposal. This, he explained, could potentially allow for a "very early access release with temporarily removed features", as development with a "relatively small" team was spun up again.
</p>
<p>
"Keep your expectations extremely low," he <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1938944710334148817">cautioned on social media</a>, "because usually when large companies shutdown a project like this the chances of revival are next to impossible. Yes, I made the decision, I will give my best to save Hytale... It's the least I can do to the same community that gave me the opportunity to be where I am today... It will take months to get answers and months to get done. I will share as much as possible as I go through the process."

            <p>Borderlands 4 includes a slider that lets you mute Claptrap.</p>
<p>Claptrap, for those unaware, is Gearbox's talkative robot companion who is often considered to be the Borderlands series' mascot. He first popped up in the original Borderlands game, and was most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-black-joins-borderlands-movie-cast-as-claptrap">voiced by Jack Black in the Borderlands film adaptation</a>.</p>
<p>While Claptrap can be a source of comic relief, some players have found him a tad annoying, and now Gearbox has come up with a solution to quite literally dial him down a touch: that aforementioned Borderlands 4 slider.</p>

<p>This slider will allow players to adjust Claptrap's volume, from 100 percent to mute. Teasing the feature, Borderlands 4 narrative director <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1939780570365796763">Sam Winkler said</a>: "I wrote some lines just for this feature and it includes maybe the dumbest most niche reference to a certain terrible accent in a certain classic immersive sim."</p>
<p>In a subsequent response to one social media user who suggested Gearbox shouldn't have "caved" to those less keen on Claptrap's vocals, <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/with_replies">Winkler joked</a>: "I pitched that you should be able to put him from zero percent to 200 percent but I think the government said no."</p>
<p>So, will you be muting Claptrap on Borderlands 4's release, or turning the volume up as high as your tech will allow?</p>
