			<p>There's a chance BioWare might release the Dragon Age: The Veilguard character creator ahead of launch, as other roleplaying games have done before (CAPCOM's Dragon's Dogma 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-character-creation-tool-is-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes to mind</a>). Game Director Corinne Busche said as much during a roundtable Q&amp;A at the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preview event</a>:</p>
<p><em>It's a much-requested feature. We're TBD on that, but it would be pretty cool.</em></p>
<p>The character creator crafted by the developer for the game has received unanimous praise so far. In his hands-on, Kai wrote:</p>
<p><em>BioWare has invested a great amount of time into the character creation suite of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. For the player's own iteration of the Rook, players can change everything from the body type and pronouns down to freckles and hair growth. A player could easily spend a solid hour trying to come up with the perfect character, only to change their minds midway through the adventure. To remedy this, there is a magic mirror inside the main base of operations that serves as aesthetician and barber all in one.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>During the aforementioned Dragon Age: The Veilguard roundtable Q&amp;A, Corinne Busche also said about the character creator:</p>
<p><em>One of the things I might also add is of our three core design pillars, be who you want to be was the first, that was the starting point. We wanted everyone to feel like they belonged in this game to the best of our ability, we wanted that you could relate to the characters, so that meant sclera color. It meant cataracts. It meant vitiligo. Freckles. Respectful skin tones that react to light properly. I'm tremendously proud of the team and everything they put together to make sure that all of the players can feel seen, too.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launches on October 31 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-apparently-revealed.986991/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is, of course, published by Nintendo, but the Japanese gaming giant has been characteristically quiet about who's developing it. Luckily, it looks like some&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>fans have uncovered the truth.</p>
<p>As noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-seemingly-confirmed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by Eurogamer</a>, players who have pre-ordered&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>ahead of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced">its release next week</a>&nbsp;have spotted what appears to be the game's developer contained within the <a href="https://x.com/naetoru60/status/1836743459262116136" rel="noopener" target="_blank">copyright information</a> in the game's eShop listing.</p>
<p>Honestly, the developer behind&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>probably shouldn't come as a surprise; it looks like it's Grezzo, the studio responsible for the 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening"><em>Link's Awakening&nbsp;</em>remake</a>. The two games have virtually identical visual styles, after all.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-desert.jpg?itok=1-cXiBGz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-desert.jpg?itok=AVp6SiE2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is being developed by Grezzo.</figcaption></figure><p>Nowadays, Nintendo is notoriously secretive about who's developing its games.&nbsp;<em>Princess Peach: Showtime!</em>, which was released earlier this year, was developed by&nbsp;<em>Yoshi's Crafted World&nbsp;</em>studio Good-Feel, but Nintendo wasn't exactly enthusiastic to reveal that information.</p>
<p>Similarly, we still don't know exactly who's going to be developing the upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, which was revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-june-2024">during a Nintendo Direct earlier this year</a>. One thing's for sure, though: it won't be longtime developer AlphaDream, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-and-luigi-dev-alphadream-files-for-bankruptcy">declared bankruptcy in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly, Nintendo doesn't feel like it's under any obligation to reveal the developer of the new <em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game as part of its pre-release marketing blitz, but the absence of Grezzo's name from marketing materials is pretty disappointing, to say the least.</p>

<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is the latest in the long-running&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>series. It combines the top-down perspective of classic&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games with the experimental gameplay of more recent entries like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>.</p>
<p>In a break from tradition, you'll play as Princess Zelda, who must save Link after he disappears into one of a number of rifts that suddenly appear around Hyrule.</p>
<p>Unlike Link, Zelda's not much of a direct fighter, so she'll fight indirectly by controlling enemies and using <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-swordfighter">her Swordfighter Form</a>. She can also conjure up objects to help her explore the world, and&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>takes a pretty freeform approach when it comes to where you can place those objects.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>launches for Nintendo Switch on September 26th. You can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preview-brilliant-creative-player-freedom">check out our preview here</a> to find out how the latest&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game is shaping up.</p>

When I was making my character during a hands-on preview at publisher Electronic Arts’ Redwood City studio earlier this month, I started to wonder, if I wanted to get closer to a certain character, would it benefit me to choose that character’s Faction so we’d have common interests and history? I asked BioWare at the event and it sounds like while relationships won’t be locked behind your Faction, the shared background may bring new layers to some relationships.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

It seemed like a good place to start the game, as I knew the intro began in the Tevinter capital Minrathous, and the idea of being a freedom fighter in a magical cyberpunk city was a hook I could get behind. Then as I played through the opening hours, I met Neve Gallus, a detective in the city who also was part of the Shadow Dragons’ efforts to reform Tevinter. When we had a moment alone to chat, she remarked “you know me,” to which my Rook, who had known her for hours, at most, rightfully responded, “do I?” Neve said that we were both Shadow Dragons and from Minrathous, so even if we’d never met face-to-face, our work most certainly had.</p><p>I was able to respond that Shadows have to stick together in Tevinter, and I wondered at how many points throughout <em>The Veilguard</em> I’d be able to connect with Neve over our shared plight. That’s a common occurrence in the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, as mage players can discuss their shared experiences with mage party members, or elves can get into debates with characters like Sera and Solas in <em>Inquisition</em> about their people’s history and future. Hell, in <em>Inquisition</em>, the Solas romance was exclusive to elven heroes. So, while at the hands-on preview, I asked creative director John Epler about how your Faction can affect relationships with your teammates, and it’s one of the multiple ways your Rook’s background affects your connections to others However, BioWare doesn’t want your Faction to block any potential romances or friendships.</p><p>“I wouldn’t say it makes for the deepest relationship [to be the same faction as a party member], it would be a different relationship,” Epler said. “We never want you to feel like, ‘if I want to romance this character, [I] have to be this,’ but you’ll get different content. That’s true of both faction, but it’s also true, for example, if you’re an elf and you talk to Bellara. You’re gonna have a very different conversation with the [elven] gods being out than if you are a human or a dwarf or qunari. Because there is that shared link. These are your gods out in the world versus for example, a dwarf or human and qunari who may have a lot of empathy and sympathy, but they’re not sharing the same experience. But again, it’s not more content, it’s just different content.”</p><p>So, there you have it. Your Faction won’t prevent you from entering into certain relationships, but it will give it a different <em>flavor</em>. Almost makes me want to be a Grey Warden so me and the handsome elven warrior Davrin can bond over our both being <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Calling&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Calling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doomed by the narrative</a></span>. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-rook-party-trailer-1851622692&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-rook-party-trailer-1851622692">on October 31</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, the developers within Firewalk are reportedly pessimistic that the game will come back after it was taken offline earlier this month. Some employees have reportedly been asked to explore pitches on what projects to work on next, while there are some that think that Firewalk could function as a support studio for one of Sony's other first-party projects currently in development.</p><p>However, other employees reportedly anticipate that mass layoffs are coming, and even a complete studio closure due to Firewalk reportedly being one of the more expensive studios within PlayStation's suite of first-party developers.

            <p>
Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's shock move to launch legal action against <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> looks to hinge on a patent relating to how players throw Pokéballs. 
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo confirmed it was suing Palworld maker Pocketpair for the infringement of "multiple" patents</a> - but did not detail which ones. Later in the day, Pocketpair itself said it was still to hear which patents it stood accused of breaching.
</p>
<p>
Now, fingers are being pointed at a recent Pokéball-throwing patent jointly filed this summer by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. Indeed, the companies requested this patent was given an accelerated review process - perhaps in preparation for this legal action now. 
</p>
<p>
The detail here comes from Japanese patent attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara, speaking to <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/59f880c5e13b9292f0e3ab2d1d55ce8bdbfdb97f">Yahoo Japan</a> and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/whats-the-killer-patent-nintendo-is-suing-palworld-for-japanese-patent-attorney-offers-in-depth-analysis/">Automaton</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The patent in question describes how a character catches a Pokémon by aiming and throwing a capture item, like a Pokéball, at a creature. Upon successful capture, the creature then becomes "owned by the player". 
</p>
<p>
In Palworld, players catch Pals by aiming and throwing a capture item, named a Pal Sphere, at a creature. Upon successful capture, the creature then becomes owned by the player.
</p>
<p>
"[It's a] killer patent," Kurihara said. "It seems like it would be hard to avoid if you want to make a Pokémon-like game, and it's easy to infringe if you're not careful."
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/20240920-37391.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Patent No. 7545191, owned by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
While filed this summer, Kurihara highlighted this patent had been filed onto a pre-existing "parent" patent filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in December 2021, preceding Palworld's launch. This means it could indeed be used in a patent battle with Palworld now. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld has been dogged by suggestions it has copied Pokémon since launch, though many of the comparisons between the two franchises have focused on the similarity of many monster designs. This - something more likely to be covered by a copyright complaint - does not seem to be Nintendo's tactic here.
</p>
<p>
While interest in Palworld has tailed off since its stratospheric lauch, when 25 million players tried the game, Nintendo will likely be eyeing future developments carefully. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-community-manager-teases-ps5-version">PlayStation version of Palworld looks set to launch at some point</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-signs-sony-deal-to-expand-franchise-beyond-video-games">Sony has invested in Pocketpair to help set up Palworld Entertainment</a>, a division designed to expand the brand beyond the world of gaming. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for more detail, as Pocketpair awaits to hear the details of what it has been accused of.
</p>
<p>
"[Pocketpair's] statement does imply that the final complaint (which should list the patents allegedly infringed) has not been delivered/filed yet," video game legal expert Richard Hoeg told Eurogamer. "First thing defendant gets to know in every jurisdiction is what they are alleged to have done. So they may have received notice that they are a named party, but not the complaint itself."
</p>
<p>
For its part, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">Pocketpair has said it intends to fight the lawsuit</a> to battle what it perceives is an attack on its creativity on behalf of other indie developers. There's concern, too, among Palworld fans over whether the lawsuit could see the game removed from sale - in Japan, or worldwide. 
</p>
<p>
"The reach of Japanese patent law ends at Japan's borders," said Lisa Phillips, an IP and patent attorney with Fisch Sigler LLP in Washington DC. "Which means there won't be any immediate impact of a decision in that court on Palworld's US operations. Of course, Nintendo, which has substantial intellectual property rights in the US could also bring suit against Palworld here, too."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/20/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-review-bombed-over-controversial-sony-policy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Almost a couple of years after its original PS5 release, Sony’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a> PC port is finally here and it’s getting review bombed by angry gamers on Steam. At the time of writing, it sits on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2322010/God_of_War_Ragnark/">a “mixed” 65% user rating</a>. The reason behind this? While there’s nothing inherently wrong with the deity-bashing sequel, Sony’s recent policy of requiring a PlayStation Network account to access its PC titles isn’t going down too well.</p>
<p><iframe title="God of War Ragnarök - Launch Trailer | PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBwxyqq1ON4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Given that God of War Ragnarok is a singleplayer-only game, many are questioning why a PSN sign-up is required as there’s no essential online or multiplayer component. There are also concerns that Steam users in parts of the world where PSN isn’t available simply won’t be able to witness the end of Kratos’s saga despite having purchased and played the original game on PC.</p>
<p>So, why is Sony pushing this requirement so hard? The likely answer is that with so many of its cherished first party games popping up on PC, its looking to draw this player base into its wider PlayStation ecosystem – something the company will no doubt utilise as it introduces new hardware and gaming services further down the line.</p>
<p>Still, the PSN signup requirement is a hurdle some die-hard PC players aren’t willing to navigate. It doesn’t help that Sony negatively impacted the reputation of its celebrated bug hunting shooter, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, by implementing its controversial policy post-launch earlier this year. Players who had already purchased the game were hit with a warning that they needed to obtain a PlayStation Network account to continue playing.</p>

<p>As the company continues to convert its coveted exclusives for PC, it will be interesting to see whether this furore dies down over time. The review bombing casts a dark albeit small cloud over what is one of the strongest open world action games of the current console generation.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/03/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War Ragnarok review</a>, we said, <em>“Kratos has come a long way since first flinging himself into the Aegean all those years ago.God of War, as a series, has come a long way too, pushing the boundaries of hack and slash action to their goar-soaked limits, then breaking free of a years-long slumber to become one of the biggest names in modern gaming. As our own winter approaches, God of War Ragnarok makes for the perfect adventure to lose yourself in.”</em></p>
<p>Since the game launched at the end of 2022, it has since received a meaty free <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/08/god-of-war-ragnarok-free-valhalla-dlc/">Valhalla update</a>, adding a wealth of new content and features.</p>

The world of cooking RPGs just got a little bigger, and we'll tell you what makes this new game so special in our&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>&nbsp;preview.</p>
<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="44cf653b-58ac-4749-a3eb-f1c6caec42ff" href="https://techraptor.net/games/chef-rpg"><em>Chef RPG</em></a>&nbsp;puts gamers in the shoes of a trained chef who has recently taken over an abandoned restaurant. You're tasked with restoring these hallowed halls of cuisine to their former glory while also sharpening your cooking skills and helping the town get back on its feet. There's a lot to love in this unique game, but it also has its fair share of stumbles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chef-rpg-preview-charcoal-grill-minigame.jpg?itok=fVNMNmeZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chef-rpg-preview-charcoal-grill-minigame.jpg?itok=4ZFQxOKy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every cooking station has an associated minigame, and these minigames can get quite complex — but that's part of the fun.</figcaption></figure><h2>Cooking Up Something Special</h2>
<p>The simplest way to explain&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>&nbsp;is to compare it to&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="98bb9fc6-d071-4d2f-9670-92bbc1934cec" href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>, but with one small change: swap out the importance of farming for cooking. Cooking is a side activity in farming RPGs; in&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>, farming is the side activity and cooking is the star of the show.</p>
<p>Cooking's central role should come as no surprise. It's your main story motivation and, indeed, the best way that you can make money. No amount of foraging for wild berries or digging around in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55aa35e9-ac63-45d6-826b-4a4f88b9017a" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/chef-rpg-mining-guide-how-to-get-into-caves">the mines</a> can equal the kind of Credits that you can pull in by filling the stomachs of your customers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, cooking ain't easy. You'll only have a couple of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7066a12f-a028-4b79-a6f5-07deebfbd349" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/chef-rpg-cooking-guide-how-to-beat-minigames">cooking stations</a>, a few recipes, and some donated ingredients to get started. You'll need to slowly build up your money so you can expand your operations with more tables, chairs, equipment, and ingredients.</p>
<p>This certainly isn't a cozy, laid-back game. All cooking is done via minigames that require precise rhythm and timing. You're under constant time pressure as the day wears on. Get the job done right and you'll fill your pockets with money. Screw up too many times, however, and you'll barely turn a profit while sullying the burgeoning reputation of your revived restaurant.</p>

It's a good idea to design your menu to avoid using too much of any one ingredient.</figcaption></figure><h2>Supply Chain Shortages</h2>
<p>As you might expect, a big part of&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>&nbsp;is collecting the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="205074bb-53be-40cd-b9fc-38776df855a3" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/chef-rpg-ingredients">ingredients</a> you need to cook your recipes. The Early Access launch version, however, is a little too difficult in this respect.</p>
<p>Let's start with the shopkeepers. Shopkeepers will only carry a few random ingredients every day; it's entirely possible to find that an item you sorely need is out of stock, especially if it's a rarer quality item. You can increase the quantity and quality of items in a shop by becoming friends with the shopkeeper, but this won't happen overnight.</p>
<p>You could, of course, hunt animals and forage. This is a good way to supplement your supplies; however, it's impractical to do this every day. Some items can't be foraged at all and must instead be grown in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6846f4a-247f-4421-a02b-8e0db576251b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/chef-rpg-farming-guide-how-to-grow-food">your greenhouse</a> or produced with <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1bba44a8-f0e0-4626-bb5e-e429695e4616" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/chef-rpg-brewing-guide-how-to-make-drinks">brewing</a> machinery (in the case of alcohol).</p>
<p>Eventually, you'll be able to unlock the ability to get deliveries from shopkeepers, but these are limited, too; you can only get six types of items from each shopkeeper and no more than 20 of those item, five days a week. That sounds like a lot, but you can easily go through more than 20 Elk Rib or Asparagus in a long cooking session.</p>
<p>That leaves you with two options: you can either carefully craft your menu to use a wide range of ingredients so you don't run out of any one thing too fast, or you can supplement your daily deliveries by buying items from the shops — shops that are already delivering to you every day — and foraging for what you can in the wilderness.</p>
<p>I understand the intent behind the design here — having a steady supply of ingredients is important for any restaurant and it's the same in&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>. The limitations of the system as it's implemented at launch are far too unforgiving for anyone who wants to run a large menu.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chef-rpg-preview-milo-hinting-at-his-favorite-gift.jpg?itok=z-Nk_H2d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chef-rpg-preview-milo-hinting-at-his-favorite-gift.jpg?itok=1DrKeti9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Give a character too many incorrect gifts and they'll give you some hints about what they might like instead.</figcaption></figure><h2>Occasionally Undercooked</h2>
<p><em>Chef RPG</em>&nbsp;has its fair share of bugs and mistakes like any Early Access game. Some of these bugs are minor, some are severe, and some are downright comical.</p>
<p>Many of the silliest mistakes come down to spelling. The refrigerator in your restaurant is a main feature of the game that you'll look at every single day, and yet somehow the developer missed that it was incorrectly spelled "refridgerator" at launch. A forgivable mistake, yes, but this was just one of many spelling and grammatical errors.</p>
<p>There are lots of little hiccups here and there. You'll occasionally have to walk away from an object because you can't interact with it. Sometimes, menus just refuse to close altogether. NPCs won't actually leave or enter an area until you leave it and reload that area into memory.</p>
<p>One of the biggest bugbears in my 60+ hours of gameplay, though, was <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6a0f825d-e922-4316-a025-c47a729b4213" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/chef-rpg-research">the research system</a>. Each research facility has two cooking stations that you need to interact with and it was impossible to interact with them most of the time. A prompt appeared and I furiously tapped the interact button from every conceivable angle, but sadly, they were well and truly broken.</p>
<p>Bugs like these are an annoyance to be sure. To the developer's credit, none of the bugs I encountered were show stoppers (save for the problems with research) and there have already been six hotfix patches since the game launched a week ago. I expect the game to be in much better shape overall in another week or two at most.</p>

<p>Simply put,&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>&nbsp;captures the wonderfully capitalistic vibe of farming RPGs while nudging farming out of the limelight and replacing it with cooking. Every cooking minigame is fun, and the controlled chaos of running your own restaurant is compelling.</p>
<p>Yes, it has its rough edges, but those are being smoothed out at an admirably fast pace.&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>&nbsp;will certainly appeal to the legions of fans who love farming RPGs but are looking for something a little different; if that sounds like you, then I can wholeheartedly say that&nbsp;<em>Chef RPG</em>&nbsp;is worth checking out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-cycle-fortnite-map-yager<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Cycle: Frontier&nbsp;</em>may be dead, but developer Yager isn't letting sleeping dogs lie, as the studio has created a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>map based on the game using the battle royale title's UEFN creative tool.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://yager.de/2024/09/19/the-cycle-prospect-island-a-uefn-project/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement post on its website</a>, Yager says it created&nbsp;<em>The Cycle: Prospect Island&nbsp;</em>out of a desire to "keep the spirit alive" and to pay tribute to the game, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cycle-frontier-shutting-down">shut down in September last year</a>.</p>
<p>Yager says that although it's currently working on its "different co-development ventures" and "new projects", it wanted to pay homage to the "tragic story" of&nbsp;<em>The Cycle</em>, which it says is "beloved" not only by its fans but by Yager as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-cycle-prospect-island-yager-fortnite-map.jpg?itok=f_a0_tSU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-cycle-prospect-island-yager-fortnite-map.jpg?itok=a7OZ37kN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yager's&nbsp;<em>The Cycle Fortnite&nbsp;</em>map contains many references to its deceased shooter.</figcaption></figure><p>In the post, Yager admits that "not everything that made&nbsp;<em>The Cycle: Frontier&nbsp;</em>shine can be brought into this project", but it says that the developers who worked on the map "brought as many ideas and visuals back to life as feasible".</p>
<p>If you load up the map, you'll begin in Prospect Station, and you can visit offices for&nbsp;<em>The Cycle</em>'s various factions, where you'll get contracts you can fulfil in order to unlock new gear and play as individual "faction classes".</p>
<p>Once you've obtained your contracts, you can drop down to the main Prospect Island map, where you'll be able to encounter other Prospectors who are looking to complete their own contracts.</p>
<p>The titular Cycle will also appear "from time to time", causing certain areas of the map to become unsafe, so you'll need to sprint to your nearest evac zone in order to protect yourself from the storm's effects. Beware of other Prospectors, though!</p>

<p>Yager isn't the only developer to dabble in UEFN projects based on its games; Keoken Interactive, developer of&nbsp;<em>Deliver Us the Moon</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deliver-us-the-moon-fortnite-map">created a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>map based on its game</a> last year, for instance.</p>
<p>You can download and play&nbsp;<em>The Cycle: Prospect Island&nbsp;</em>in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>right now. The island code is as follows: 8495-9375-7199. You'll also still get battle pass XP while you're playing it, which is pretty neat.</p>

And while it generally hits the news when a classic card is sold for a ludicrous price, the actual competitive game it’s created for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-euic-tcg-scarlet-violet-championships-1851400530&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-euic-tcg-scarlet-violet-championships-1851400530">has never been more popular</a></span>. This is something The Pokémon Company International (TPCi) is hoping to better take advantage of with a brand-new free-to-play mobile game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pokémon TCG: Pocket</em></a></span>—the <em>Marvel Snap</em>ification of the brand. I went hands-on to see how it compares to both <em>Snap</em> and the existing <em>Pokémon TCG Live</em>.</p><p><em>Pocket</em> takes the core <em>PTCG</em> game and strips it down, streamlining it as a concept to make a faster, more phone-friendly game. The live game, while not as complex as <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, is surprisingly involved, and the ever-changing meta with new cards added every three months means even playing the digital version can be a tricky world to enter. <em>Pocket</em> is very clearly an attempt to sweep all that aside and create a mobile game that’s as instant and speedy as <em>Marvel Snap</em>, except infused with <em>Pokémon </em>magic.</p><p>The instant pull here, for <em>Pokémon </em>fans at least, is that <em>Pocket</em> gives every player two free packs of cards to open every day. Each pack, disappointingly, only contains five cards—real world packs have 10, and we’ll get into why this change is a bummer later on—but all have an equal chance of containing some of the rarest cards in the game. And those rarest cards can be something astonishing, putting <em>Snap</em>’s excellent 3D effects to shame. <em>Pocket</em> has, if you’re exceptionally lucky, so-called “Immersive Cards” that, when tapped, turn into gorgeous animations, where the camera swoops into the full-art picture, revealing entire realms, filled with Pokémon<em>&nbsp;</em>in their element, before eventually pulling back out to the original piece of art. It’s actual magic.</p><h2 id="h86749"><a id=""></a>Mobile Shrinkflation</h2><figure id="" data-id="91d91f41c8ed2f5c9cee6f224961591e" data-recommend-id="image://91d91f41c8ed2f5c9cee6f224961591e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle deck, with its card box above it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A battle deck, with its card box above it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91d91f41c8ed2f5c9cee6f224961591e" data-recommend-id="image://91d91f41c8ed2f5c9cee6f224961591e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle deck, with its card box above it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The game itself is a lot more different to the mainline version than I was expecting. First of all, while a <em>TPCG</em> game is played with a deck of 60 cards, <em>Pocket</em> has decks of only 20. Energy, a vital part of any 60-card deck that’s used to power a Pokémon’s attacks, isn’t played as a card at all, but is rather a resource given out each turn. There are no Prize Cards—the six cards in a live game that must usually be won by a player in order to win the game—but instead victories are based on scoring three “K.O. points,” earned by knocking out an opponent’s cards. Oh, and there are no damage dice. (Trainer cards <em>are</em> still a part of the game, but during my demo they really didn’t come up, so it’s hard to say exactly how they’ll work at this point.) That’s a lot of change!</p><p>However, what’s important to recognize about <em>Pocket</em> is that it’s <em>not</em> an attempt to recreate the live game digitally—that’s what <em>Pokémon TCG Live</em> is (meant to be) for. This is something new, something else, and accordingly it is far more removed from the rest of the TCG.</p><p>Let’s take a tangent to <em>Pokémon TCG Live</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-live-online-migrate-card-game-tips-guide-1849789809&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-live-online-migrate-card-game-tips-guide-1849789809">It’s <em>awful</em></a></span>. The previous <em>Pokémon TCG Online</em>, made offline in 2022, was crumbling, decade-old tech, but as a way to play the TCG in the digital realm, it did the job. Both games are played using packs opened by scanning the Code Cards found in every real-world <em>Pokémon TCG </em>pack, box, tin, etc. Scan the code, and you get a digital equivalent to open, and then can build collections and decks, and take part in online battles against other people. But when <em>Live</em> replaced it, it also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-silver-tempest-lost-origin-code-cards-1849820076&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-silver-tempest-lost-origin-code-cards-1849820076">slashed the number of cards you got from every code card</a></span> you scanned from 10 to five, deleted swathes of cards if you had more than four of any, and entirely removed the “T” from the title entirely—there is no longer any way to trade in the digital trading card game. It was such a crashing dud that it put me off playing online at all.</p><h2 id="h86750"><a id=""></a>Genetic Apex</h2><figure id="" data-id="f7736714b4803a277b2caab29d6b2300" data-recommend-id="image://f7736714b4803a277b2caab29d6b2300" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Eevee playmat art, with Jolteon, Vaporeon and Flareon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Eevee playmat art, with Jolteon, Vaporeon and Flareon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7736714b4803a277b2caab29d6b2300" data-recommend-id="image://f7736714b4803a277b2caab29d6b2300" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Eevee playmat art, with Jolteon, Vaporeon and Flareon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Pocket</em> therefore gains a lot more appeal, and exists with no overlap at all. Sets of packs created for <em>Pocket</em> are completely unique—with the 200-card launch set given the astoundingly terrible name of Genetic Apex—featuring a mix of classic art going back as far as the 1990s, as well as lots of original artworks. There are no real-world code cards, and no real-world versions of the original art. (During my hands-on, another journalist asked if there were plans to release any of the game’s art in a future physical set, and the PR began some obfuscatory waffle. I leaned over and said, “Of <em>course</em> they are.” Of course they are.)</p><p>We were given a rather unrealistic number of digital packs to open, and during this time I was exceptionally lucky (genuinely—while they were supplying us far more to open than would be possible for free in the real game, the packs themselves were the real ones with the real odds that any player would have), pulling some stunning full-art by both known and new <em>PTCG</em> artists. Cards so beautiful that it kind of hurt that they were stuck on a mobile phone screen, and not something you could hold and store in a binder.</p><p>Although, saying that, <em>Pocket</em> has a metric ton more sense when it comes to things like this than <em>Live</em>, with lovely digital binders you can store cards in, and ways to display and share your collection. And talking of sharing, it also features the Wonder Pick—a daily way to try to get lucky and pull a specific card you want from a pack opened by someone else. They don’t lose anything, but you have a chance to gain.</p><h2 id="h86751"><a id=""></a>I Choose You, <em>Pokémon Pocket</em>!</h2><figure id="" data-id="e0fd3374de1487e0deb0f85b81f95438" data-recommend-id="image://e0fd3374de1487e0deb0f85b81f95438" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The opening Battle screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The opening Battle screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0fd3374de1487e0deb0f85b81f95438" data-recommend-id="image://e0fd3374de1487e0deb0f85b81f95438" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The opening Battle screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>OK, the battles themselves. You need a 20-card deck to play, but the game’s opening sequences and tutorial will guide you toward that. There are also so-called “Rental Decks” that can be “borrowed” and used to play, but not added to your collection.</p><p>Like the live game, you begin each game by drawing cards and placing a Pokémon in the Active Spot, and up to three others on your Bench. You then use attacks by matching Energy to cards (here, an Energy Zone generates you an Energy each turn, and shows you which type will be generated next turn), and chipping away at your opponent’s health. You can then evolve your cards as normal, switch cards in and out from the Active Spot, and play Trainers to gain advantages. All of the effects are, in a sense, nerfed from the live game, to make these smaller-scale battles more tactical. It’s far less likely you’ll one-shot an opponent with reduced attack powers, and Trainers will give you the ability to pull a couple of cards from your deck, rather than the fives and sevens possible on a table top.<br></p><p>It works. It’s zippy, less involved, but has enough going on to let tactics be relevant. And, importantly, it plays nothing like <em>Marvel Snap</em>, which is where it could really have come unstuck, not least after “borrowing” the idea for 3D holographic cards and so on. It plays like a diluted version of the TCG, and feels very much a part of that realm.</p><p>This all adds up to a simpler game, but not a simple one, that’ll be neat for quick bursts on your phone, whether against the game’s AI or other real-world players. It’s nothing mind-blowing, but it also doesn’t need to be. It just needs to be fun. And this is, after all, an app that’s putting pack opening and card collecting at its forefront.</p><h2 id="h86752"><a id=""></a>That’s How They Gacha</h2><figure id="" data-id="cb36e215137aadc9cb4eb6e13f425d02" data-recommend-id="image://cb36e215137aadc9cb4eb6e13f425d02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Sabrina card with extra sparkles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Sabrina card with extra sparkles." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cb36e215137aadc9cb4eb6e13f425d02" data-recommend-id="image://cb36e215137aadc9cb4eb6e13f425d02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Sabrina card with extra sparkles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Which, yes, does also point us toward the dark cloud that’s hanging over this otherwise jolly time. Two free packs a day, one released every 12 hours! Ways to get an extra card with a Wonder Pick! But you need at the very least 20 cards to play at all, and many times more than that to build a solid deck. Oh, and those collections! 200 or more cards to collect in the very first set! Gotta catch ‘em all! And yeah, this is unavoidably a gacha game, isn’t it?</p><p>Because, of course, there are ways to spend real money here. The in-game currency is Poké Gold, and it has the magical ability to hurry along access to your next free pack, 1 Gold reducing the wait time by two hours. 5 Gold will cost 99c, and I can only assume a wealth of new ways to use that Gold will be revealed by the time the game is out on Halloween. There’s also the option to spend $9.99 a month on a Premium Pass, which grants you an additional booster pack a day, alongside access to “premium missions,” so essentially a battle pass, with rewards for completing these goals—things like unique promo cards and in-game decorations like playmats, sleeves and coins.</p><p>There are also an array of cosmetics you’ll be able to acquire, and then apply to cards to make them your own. These amount to special foil effects and sparkly decor that will show up in play, which is a great idea, but—and again, I’m assuming here—also another way to spend money.</p><p>And of course, this is a “free” app, and it’s a business, and it’s looking to make money. But it’s also <em>Pokémon</em>, and as much as we adults would like to pretend, it’s a franchise primarily aimed at and marketed toward children. And gacha plus kids makes me uncomfortable. One of the real joys about <em>Pokémon TCG</em>&nbsp;<em>Live</em> is that there’s genuinely no way to spend money within it. Sure, code cards cost money, but you can also buy nine-hundred-trillion of them for cents if you look in the right places, and the code cards come as an extra with the actual physical (gacha) cards you paid for. It’s an app you can set your kids free on, and never worry about them either stealing your credit card, or nagging you to dig it out yourself. With yet another monthly $10 outlay to beg for on <em>Pocket</em>, you can add it to the teetering pile of VBux, Robux, <em>Minecraft</em> subscriptions, and so many more that you might already be on the hook for.</p><hr><p>I dearly wish <em>Pocket</em> could have been built around the same money-free basis as previous digital versions of the TCG, but also recognize how unlikely that would be. As someone who is deeply into the card game and collecting it, I know I’ll be playing this more for the collections than the battles, but I’ll certainly be playing it. It could be <em>huge</em>. I just might be not be telling my son about it.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can almost sense its launch lineup coming into focus as the company’s developers prepare to put their finishing touches on whimsical new experiments. Rumors and speculation around a supposed Switch 2 have reached a fever pitch as fans await a possible official reveal any week now. So it’s our last chance to share our hopes and predictions for the new hardware before dreams become reality. Here’s what we want from a Switch 2, and what we think we’ll actually get. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="985ffbecf7839530e6a23ee6f76c5af2" data-recommend-id="image://985ffbecf7839530e6a23ee6f76c5af2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1840" data-height="1035" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Splatoon 3 is displayed on a Switch OLED" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Splatoon 3 is displayed on a Switch OLED" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="985ffbecf7839530e6a23ee6f76c5af2" data-recommend-id="image://985ffbecf7839530e6a23ee6f76c5af2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1840" data-height="1035" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Splatoon 3 is displayed on a Switch OLED" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I’m not a snob when it comes to screens. My computer monitor is small, off-brand, and doesn’t even have an HDMI port. I play most of my PS5 and Xbox Series S games on a $300 LED TV that I sit 10 feet away from and isn’t even 4K. So when I upgraded from a regular Switch to the OLED model, I was genuinely surprised by just how much better it looked. The contrast was better. The colors were warmer. Everything popped. Even so-so games looked incredible on the vibrant display sitting 12 inches from my face.</p><p>An OLED screen doesn’t amount to a hill of beans for Switch 2 owners who plan on just playing the console in docked mode, but it’s night-and-day for anyone who primarily uses the device as a handheld, which is where I think the hardware excels most anyway. Give me a $400 Switch 2 and a $550 OLED version at launch and I’ll scrape together my pennies to get the latter. Just please don’t make me wait several years. — Ethan</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-recommend-id="image://adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Virtua headset sits in front of a teal background " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Virtua headset sits in front of a teal background " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Evan Amos</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-recommend-id="image://adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Virtua headset sits in front of a teal background " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>My greatest desire is for there to be something <em>weird</em> about the Ultra Switch U. Nintendo is at its best when its consoles force developers to think differently. Just think of the way the Wii drove companies to create bizarre and fascinating games because of its Wii-motes and nunchucks, or how the two screens of the DS demanded a new level of creativity and imagination. While I recognize that the New Switch XL will have to conform on some level to allow cross-platform gaming, I still want that bonkers twist no one sees coming.<br></p><p>Maybe it can produce smells as you’re playing. Or it projects holograms from its screen. Or a good idea. But just not a slightly more powerful version of the Switch, with a bigger screen. I mean, I’d buy that tomorrow. But I really wish for that old Nintendo magic to surprise everyone. — John Walker</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c1fbdddeb149b94ec6e0329ac5a02de8" data-recommend-id="image://c1fbdddeb149b94ec6e0329ac5a02de8" data-format="png" data-width="1130" data-height="518" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Leaks of a possible Switch 2 prototype render " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="c1fbdddeb149b94ec6e0329ac5a02de8" data-recommend-id="image://c1fbdddeb149b94ec6e0329ac5a02de8" data-format="png" data-width="1130" data-height="518" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Leaks of a possible Switch 2 prototype render " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I have seen so many tech companies ruin a good thing with needless iteration. They’ll call it “innovating” and trying not to be “stagnant.” The Switch is, as far as I’m concerned, a perfect device. Console-quality games on a handheld are all I really want most days. The Switch is one of the most affordable portable gaming devices on the market right now, and it fills a niche that Sony and Microsoft are probably too scared to try and touch, given how embedded the Switch is as the go-to item for portable gaming. It is such a perfectly executed concept that I don’t want Nintendo to mess with it too much. Just give me a beefier device that can handle games the base system can’t. Sure, fix problems like Joy-Con drift. But above all else, I want the device to keep what made the Switch so revolutionary. Every Nintendo system has been substantially different than the last, but I would rather see the company innovate in its games than fuck up a good thing, because if the next Nintendo console doesn’t continue to improve upon everything the Switch has given us in the past seven years, it’s a huge loss for everyone. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5151621394e0c3b9739f88c2a15386da" data-recommend-id="image://5151621394e0c3b9739f88c2a15386da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wario plays with treasure " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wario plays with treasure " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / MobyGames</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5151621394e0c3b9739f88c2a15386da" data-recommend-id="image://5151621394e0c3b9739f88c2a15386da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wario plays with treasure " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>2017 feels like a lifetime ago, which is unfortunate because back then, Nintendo could get away with selling a brand new console for just $300. Given the recent announcement of the PS5 Pro and its $700 price tag, I’m wary of what Nintendo will say at the unveiling of the Switch 2. There’s no chance in hell that it’s <em>that </em>high, as I feel Nintendo is savvier than a lot of folks give the company credit for, but there’s similarly no chance it’s as low as previous price points have been, either. The OLED was proof that Nintendo could charge a bit more and people would still come running, and I paid about $400 for my own <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>OLED system. That feels like <em>just about </em>the right asking price, given the upgrades that have been rumored for months now, and it’d <em>still </em>be undercutting its competitors. Now to cross my fingers and hope that Nintendo sees things the way that I do. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb2af4e9826d5c57e88836e75a5abddc" data-recommend-id="image://bb2af4e9826d5c57e88836e75a5abddc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario jumps over mice.

You gave us <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>back in 2017 and <em>Bowser’s Fury </em>as an additional, experimental side game packaged with a remaster in 2021. The streets want a new 3D <em>Mario </em>game and they want it immediately. The children may yearn for <em>Astro Bot </em>these days, but the rest of us need a return to our favorite world-hopping, triple-jumping Italian plumber. I’ll even take a sequel to <em>Super Mario Sunshine </em>at this point, just…please. My crops are dying. Alternatively, if you ever want to <em>finally </em>bring <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2 </em>to modern systems, I’d heavily welcome that too. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1616bf1bec4126a4e94c060ca4ec21a7" data-recommend-id="image://1616bf1bec4126a4e94c060ca4ec21a7" data-format="png" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ness talks to a Mr. Saturn" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ness talks to a Mr. Saturn" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1616bf1bec4126a4e94c060ca4ec21a7" data-recommend-id="image://1616bf1bec4126a4e94c060ca4ec21a7" data-format="png" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ness talks to a Mr. Saturn" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Over the years, the Nintendo Switch has cultivated one of the most baller catalogs of any console in my lifetime. It’s got everything you could want from a Nintendo system, including a number of <em>Mario </em>and <em>Pokémon </em>games that have sold gangbusters, but it’s also been the site of a few revivals. Most notably, Nintendo seemingly resuscitated its dormant <em>Metroid </em>franchise, and has even brought back the <em>Famicom Detective Club </em>games. I guess when you sell as well as the Switch has, you begin to feel like maybe you can perform a few miracles, and I want Nintendo to lean into that. There are so many beloved series that could either use full ports or remasters, or better yet, a brand new installment. <em>Mother </em>is the thing that comes most to mind, especially considering its influence on so many modern RPGs like <em>Undertale </em>and the enduring popularity of both Ness and Lucas in the <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>games. But also, give me a new <em>Star Fox</em>, y’all. Stop being cowards. — Moises Taveras<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="af96f199c98f1944f0af983601d3c6c3" data-recommend-id="image://af96f199c98f1944f0af983601d3c6c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="855" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A blue 3DS sits opened" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blue 3DS sits opened" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af96f199c98f1944f0af983601d3c6c3" data-recommend-id="image://af96f199c98f1944f0af983601d3c6c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="855" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A blue 3DS sits opened" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A lot of people, including myself, obviously love the Switch, but it still feels like Nintendo’s most sterile console. The Wii went all in on motion controls and Miis, which featured in tons of niche games like <em>Wii Sports</em>, and carried over to the 3DS. That handheld had features like StreetPass, encouraging a sense of community among its adopters, and even packaged in minigames that used the Miis that you collected from interacting and walking past other 3DS users. There used to be an offbeat whimsy to the kind of experiments that Nintendo would bundle with its systems that never really found its way to the Switch. Hell, it doesn’t even have customizable backgrounds, which feels like such an easy layup given how beloved Nintendo’s first-party properties are. There’s <em>so </em>much room for improvement in this department, and it’d probably do a lot for my own engagement with the console. I wasn’t necessarily glued to either my Wii or 3DS for the quality and quantity of games on them, but I did find myself coming back because they felt like unique and playful systems that engaged me in a way other consoles didn’t. Let’s get back to that. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bf14b173c9745903b804c44a9a4438e6" data-recommend-id="image://bf14b173c9745903b804c44a9a4438e6" data-format="png" data-width="958" data-height="674" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A green N64 box shows the translucent console" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A green N64 box shows the translucent console" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bf14b173c9745903b804c44a9a4438e6" data-recommend-id="image://bf14b173c9745903b804c44a9a4438e6" data-format="png" data-width="958" data-height="674" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A green N64 box shows the translucent console" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While plenty of people love the Nintendo Switch because it’s a portable powerhouse, able to play tons of indie games and exclusive Nintendo titles, I’m here to ask for a non-portable Switch. Yes, I know it kind of defeats the purpose of the console. It’s supposed to have the ability to “switch” between handheld and home console. But Nintendo eventually released a Switch Lite which wasn’t compatible with the standard Switch Dock and was offered as a portable-only alternative. With the Switch 2 likely being a much more powerful console, I can imagine a lot of PS4/Xbox One ports will show up in the years that follow its launch. And a lot of those games are best enjoyed on a couch with a controller in front of a TV, not hunkered over a handheld that will have its battery drained rapidly.<br></p><p>So come on Nintendo, offer up a Switch 2 Pro or Switch 2 Home Edition or whatever that ditches the touchscreen and Joy-Cons, comes bundled with a Pro Controller, and costs $50-$100 less. A sleek and tiny black box I can toss behind my TV and never think about again. – Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Level Zero: Extraction—an extraction shooter that combines horror elements with the genre’s iconic formula—released mid-August to a relatively mediocre reception. It’s still sitting at ‘Mixed’ reviews on Steam. But since its launch, developer Doghowl Games has worked diligently to improve the core experience and include additional content, as per requests by the community. Here’s everything new in Level Zero: Extraction since launch!</p>







<p>Since launch, fans have requested numerous features and mechanics in Level Zero: Extraction, especially a solo play mode, improved movement, and faster access to weapons. Well, Doghowl listened to its community, and we’re now on update 0.5.0 of Level Zero: Extraction and the game feels better and more fluid overall.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Solo Mode</strong>: Featuring nine mercenaries and a single alien vying for loot and escape on the map.</li>



<li><strong>Movement Improvements</strong>: A complete rework of the mercenary animation systems for more fluid movement.</li>



<li><strong>Gunplay Improvements</strong>: Greater feedback when shooting, switching weapons, aiming, and more.</li>



<li><strong>Faster Access to Weapons</strong>: Instead of starting the game with a nail gun, you now receive the handgun and can upgrade to military-grade weapons quicker.</li>



<li><strong>Progression Overhaul</strong>: Following the game’s wipe, acquiring levels and better equipment takes less time, so players can dive straight into the action.</li>



<li><strong>Weekly Events</strong>: Doghowl intends to host weekly events, occurring every weekend, with unique mechanics, goals, and rewards.</li>



<li><strong>New Items</strong>: Additional weapons, grenades, syringes, and Merc and Alien rewards to earn.</li>



<li><strong>Better Onboarding</strong>: New tutorial mechanics to help new players dive into the game and learn the core mechanics.</li>
</ul>











<figure><p>
<iframe title="Level Zero: Extraction - First Major Update | Server Wipe" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXwFcgNqkEc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This brand-new update to the game includes a bunch of additional content, quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and more:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>In-Game Music Player</strong></li>



<li><strong>Faster Item Swap</strong></li>



<li><strong>New Syringes and Grenades</strong></li>



<li><strong>Unique Animations</strong></li>



<li><strong>Solo Queue</strong></li>



<li><strong>Reward Cosmetics</strong></li>



<li><strong>Revamped Egg Traps</strong></li>



<li><strong>Better Player Dogtags</strong></li>



<li><strong>Reworked Game Balance</strong></li>
</ul>







<p>Level Zero: Extraction will wipe periodically with major updates as the game’s ongoing development continues. The most recent update occurred recently, with the 0.5.0 update. </p>



<p>This is a total wipe, meaning all player progress and vendor reputation are entirely erased, so everyone must start fresh!</p>

You'll be taken to a new browser tab and asked if you'd like to open Coin Master. Proceed and you'll see a pop-up that reads "Coin Master has gifted you spins!" or "Coin Master has gifted you spins and coins!" - click "Collect" to claim your free rewards.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/coin-master-free-spins-coins-link-1725652290120.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>Why Isn't My Coin Master Link Working?</h2><p>If your Coin Master link isn't working, it's likely because of one of the two following reasons:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>You've already redeemed that Coin Master spins link</li><li>The Coin Master spins link is expired</li></ul><p>You can tell if you've already claimed an active Coin Master link if you click on it and you get a pop-up that reads "Sorry. You alredy received the gift from this link." If you haven't claimed a link and the message appears, try force-closing the app and opening it again.</p><p>Coin Master links expire often and are usually only redeemable for two to three days before expiring. So if you've clicked on a link and it doesn't work, even after restarting your game, it's probably expired. You can tell if it's expired if you get a message that reads "Sorry. This offer has ended. Try again next time."</p><h2>How to Get More Coin Master Free Spins</h2><p>There are several ways to get more free spins and coins in Coin Master, including:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Spin the Wheel</strong>: If you're lucky, you'll land on free spins.</li><li><strong>Complete Card Collections</strong>: You'll be awarded with free spins each time you complete a card collection.</li><li><strong>Participate in Events</strong>: Coin Master is often hosting a new event, and participating in them can earn you free spins and coins.</li><li><strong>Invite Friends</strong>: You can earn free coins and spins by inviting friends to the game.</li><li><strong>Complete Villages</strong>: When you complete a village and move onto the next one, you'll be given rewards.</li><li><strong>Complete Achievements</strong>: As you complete achievements and earn pig ribbons, you'll get free spins and coins.</li></ul><p>Also make sure you bookmark this page as we update it daily with the latest Coin Master links for free spins and coins!</p><h2>Are Coin Master Links Safe to Click On?</h2><p>All of the Coin Master links on this page have been tested and verified by us and are safe to click on to earn free rewards.

                <p>The creator of the comic that spawned the "This is Fine" meme is making a video game based on it. KC Green, who created the "Gunshow" comic, has announced a partnership with Numskull Games to make a "classic, old-school platformer" where the dog from the meme, Question Hound, dives into his subconscious to fight his inner demons. The game is called This is Fine: Maximum Cope.</p><p>Question Hound will do battle against creatures that "feed off of the fear and anxiety of every day living." Question Hound is no longer putting up with it, and neither should you, KC Green said.</p><p>"Run, jump, and use your new skills to explore Question Hound's crowded mind and help him knock back the nasties!" reads a line from the game's description. "Help him keep the waves of depression at bay! And shine a light on his darkest fears! Maybe we all might learn some kind of coping skills along the way? Or at least have a rad game to enjoy for a brief respite."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4370268-screenshot2024-09-20at9.18.58am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4370268" data-ratio="0.55823293172691" data-width="747" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4370268-screenshot2024-09-20at9.18.58am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4370268"></a><figcaption>Maximum Cope</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4370268-screenshot2024-09-20at9.18.58am.png"></figure><p>KC Green and Numskull are launching a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kcgreen/this-is-fine-maximum-cope" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter campaign</a> to fund the untitled Question Hound game.

			<p>Gaming is at it’s best when it’s a little janky. As much as I appreciate the advances in tech that a lot of triple-A games have broken ground on, there’s an undeniable charm to a game that’s just a little busted yet full of heart. Double-A JRPGs made on a shoestring budget are some of the strongest soldiers of janky gaming, and for all their flaws they’re still absolute gems to experience. Reynatis will be a love it or hate it game for many, as it falls confidently into that category.</p>
<p>Despite wearing it’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/29/kingdom-hearts-3-review-dlc-2020/">Kingdom Hearts</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/26/neo-the-world-ends-with-you-review/">The World Ends With You</a> inspirations proudly on it’s sleeve, this FuRyu developed modern mage adventure never reaches the same heights as those Tetsuya Nomura classics – but watching it shoot for the stars and seeing where it comes so close is still a hell of a time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Reynatis - Demo Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dXdiRXjgkWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Reynatis, magic and wizards are real – but only a select few are born with those abilities, and in the modern heavily-sanctioned Tokyo streets you can only use those gifts legally if you’re a member of the police force. Sari Nishijima is a high-ranking member of that magic-enabled police task force. and one of our protagonists. She spends long nights on the streets of Shibuya hunting down rogue wizards and potential magic users who are addicted to the street drug rubrum. Our other main character is Marin Kirizumi, an angsty magic-user who sets out to Shibuya with the incredibly vague and anime-as-hell goal of becoming the strongest magic user ever.</p>
<p>Reynatis tells a really dense story, but I wouldn’t say the overarching beats or twists are all that great. The opening chapters of the game are especially stiff – you’re introduced to two additional party members for each protagonist, and while the police co-workers who join Nishijima are well introduced, the quirky mage girls that end up tagging along with Kirizumi really don’t have any meaningful or well-done reason for doing so.</p>


<p>Despite the flawed story structure, I loved the smaller character moments throughout the game. In an angsty city and a story full of sacrifice and suffering, our characters find a lot of time to exchange silly banter with each other and bond really naturally. You even get to see text message exchanges between them all on your phone, although those texts are annoyingly organised in a giant list of individual conversations and not like actual per-contact text chains.</p>
<p>Combat in Reynatis almost has the opposite problem – at first, the small moments suffer, and each battle encounter felt like a bit of a chore. The game has a unique system where each of your three party members can change between two modes at any time – Suppressed state and Liberated state.</p>

<p>You’ll need to be in Liberated state in order to attack your enemies with basic attacks or special attacks, but being in those mode slowly drains your MP (and special attacks drain it even faster). When you’re in Suppressed state, you can’t attack at all but time will stop as enemy projectiles are about to hit you,&nbsp;letting you dodge them as much as you want. When a melee attack connects, you’re shown a circle rune on the screen. Hold the dodge button down enough to fill that circle, and you’ll dodge the attack plus recover a massive amount of MP.</p>
<p>It’s an incredibly weird system at first – you’ve got to essentially let the attacks hit you to trigger the dodge, which goes against muscle memory from every other game with a parry system. You’ve got some minor options to mix up your combat abilities, too – as you explore Shibuya and complete side quests, you’ll find graffiti across the city that you can acquire and convert into usable combat abilities.</p>
<p>You can tell they really wanted to emulate the feeling of ability pins from The World Ends With You with the way these graffiti pieces are rendered and the collectible nature of them. Since every character can equip any ability art, you’ve got the opportunity to mix and match in a surprisingly open-ended way that helped massage the combat loop into a more satisfying place once I got way deeper into the game.</p>

<p>The most impressive part of Reynatis to me is the attention to detail in recreating Shibuya as your main explorable environment. Streets are full of iconic, real-life shops and landmarks from the vibrant Japanese city ward, and it’s the kind of game world I could pause and take a stroll through in-between missions just to soak in all the atmosphere. It’s just a shame that same attention to detail isn’t present for other environments in the game.</p>
<p>When story missions or challenges take you into the fog-gated world of Another, you’re basically tossed into copy-pasted forest and desert dungeons that lack any sense of style or substance. Even the music in these regions is a bit of a snore, which is heartbreaking when you consider how important music is to the games that seemed to so heavily inspire Reynatis.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lorns-lure-review-call-of-void</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lorns-lure-review-call-of-the-void.986910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lorns-lure-review-call-of-void<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of my favorite manga of all time is <em>Blame!</em>, a somewhat niche title by the masterful Tsutomu Nihei. The way Nihei crafts his worlds, letting visuals speak more than the very characters in his works, it's something unique to the medium of manga. Most of all, however, it's how he is able to portray scale in <em>Blame!</em> and his various other works that amaze me.</p>
<p><em>Lorn's Lure</em> wears its inspirations on its sleeve, and chiefly among them is <em>Blame!</em>. It's a mysterious first-person <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/platformer">platformer</a> that prefers to show rather than tell, and also perfectly captures the unfathomably large scale of megastructures. <em>Lorn's Lure</em> might have niche appeal, but like <em>Blame!</em>, those who consume its content will absolutely love it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-4.jpg?itok=WFQCl1wr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-4.jpg?itok=dfHwlT9L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Believe me when I say you CAN and will find a way to descend from this.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Lorn's Lure</em>, a Precision Platformer</h2>
<p>Armed with nothing but your own body and two climbing pickaxes, your objective is to continue onward. You're being lured by something -- perhaps your own curiosity -- but this megastructure that comprises <em>Lorn's Lure</em> beckons. Descending and ascending incomprehensible obstacles is the fun of <em>Lorn's Lure</em>. You never know what's ahead, even if you see a giant <em>thing</em> in the distance.</p>
<p>Often times, you'll descend (or ascend) via thin rebar and wires jutting out at precarious heights, and you'll have to make plenty of daring jumps, too. In this regard, <em>Lorn's Lure</em> feels like a precision platformer, as finesse is the key. Yet, the platforming in this title, despite being a first-person game, is quite smooth and not in the least bit slippery or difficult to control.</p>
<p>Your standard walking speed is pretty fast, too, but if you want, you can slow down on thin beams so you don't stray over the edge. Nonetheless, this is a game where you need to take as many minuscule footholds as you can get, and you'll be surprised by how generous <em>Lorn's Lure</em> can be despite the unpredictable situations you're put in.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-6.jpg?itok=B5chkKLn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-6.jpg?itok=ihPvTbdA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That tower? You can climb it.</figcaption></figure><h2>Failure is Part of the Process in <em>Lorn's Lure</em></h2>
<p>Of course, failure is inevitable, but even in failure, <em>Lorn's Lure</em> is gracious and respectful to players. Checkpoints are scattered throughout -- not just a few, but dozens upon dozens of them, even on small perches -- so plummeting to your death isn't a huge issue. By pressing one button, you can immediately restart back to that checkpoint, making most situations manageable.</p>
<p>So yes, you'll find yourself falling to death quite a bit, and if the game detects you've fallen for something like three seconds, it'll usually immediately reset -- these falls aren't survivable, after all. You can sort of finesse your way across what seems like impossible scenarios by abusing the stamina system in <em>Lorn's Lure</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-5.jpg?itok=Tj2oSfhx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-5.jpg?itok=pTVnxnp6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pipes are a Tsutomu Nihei staple, so of course they make an appearance in <em>Lorn's Lure</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Jumping around and landing on a slightly slanted edge will give you just the reprieve you need to restore some stamina and either latch onto a wall with your pickaxes or make a second jump to the next ledge. Stamina depletes while you climb or do just about anything else besides walking, so maintaining this and making sure it doesn't expire before you land is key.</p>
<p>Your job of getting to the end of these massive levels, well, it gets easier, and it doesn't. <em>Lorn's Lure</em> does an excellent job at giving players new abilities to utilize as time goes on. It's just the right amount of spice to mitigate what could have been a tedious game. Abilities like dash jets, a mid-air dash, allows for the levels to get even more creative as you progress.</p>
<p>Players can "tic-tac" off of walls (essentially, wall jumping) for some stamina and bridge larger gaps, or eventually an improved jump lets you cross yet even <em>larger</em> chasms later on. I can't commend developer Rubeki Games enough for adding new abilities as time goes on, since it introduces new obstacles even when these abilities make things more convenient.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorns-lure-screen-2.jpg?itok=UzXTxeKk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorns-lure-screen-2.jpg?itok=R5DN0Ts0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For what purpose does this object serve?</figcaption></figure><h2>Oh, the Places You'll Go</h2>
<p>Let's talk about level design -- Rubeki Games is insanely creative in the way they make vast, open spaces and insurmountable obstacles. In one moment, you'll have the feelings of megalophobia from the sheer scale of the objects you're climbing -- in the next, you might have the overwhelming pressure of claustrophobia bearing down on you.</p>
<p>I already touched on scaling giant walls, either by ascending or descending, but I didn't talk about one level in particular. Early on, gameplay does a bit of a shift and throws players into a complex, seemingly endless series of rocky tunnels. Having to squeeze through tiny holes in a dark environment to move forward, it's an uncomfortable experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/screenshot-lorns-lure.jpg?itok=wLVnOflN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/screenshot-lorns-lure.jpg?itok=7-_tywRz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What a daunting climb!</figcaption></figure><p><em>Lorn's Lure</em> excels at making its player uncomfortable, and it's an experience that you can't find in many games. But besides just the feeling of being in a giant (or cramped) space, you have mysterious, abandoned cities, sunken temples, and gigantic canyons that seem to defy reason.</p>
<p>These levels come to life with exceptional use of lighting, fog, and creativity. More often than not, I'd get done climbing down a gigantic building or network of pipes, look up and be amazed by how far I had come.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-1.jpg?itok=CZjSASY_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorns-lure-gameplay-1.jpg?itok=2xVRvo4Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The abyss beckons!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Lorn's Lure </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Seeing how big some of these environments are, one might think it's easy to get lost. There were times when, yes, it became very hard to intuit where the game wanted me to go, and that was frustrating. Thankfully, there's a handy hint system in <em>Lorn's Lure</em> that does a solid job most of the time, even if it's not perfect.</p>
<p>Besides that, I took a methodical and slow approach to my platforming, and while the finale to <em>Lorn's Lure</em> is thrilling, it also felt too fast-paced and grueling for its own good. The final gauntlet will definitely test your patience and felt inconsistent with the methodical pace I went through the levels preceding it.</p>
<p>No doubt, <em>Lorn's Lure</em> is an unconventional game. It defies the ordinary, which perfectly complements the mysterious and foreboding nature of the game's looming megastructures and elusive narrative. I have nothing but respect for the way <em>Lorn's Lure</em> portrays itself, and those who play it to the end will most definitely count it as an indie gem.&nbsp;</p>

There have been novels, comics, anime, and even an audio drama showcasing each of the party members in <em>The Veilguard</em>.

Here are the three major <em>Dragon Age</em> extended universe projects BioWare says you may want to catch up on before <em>The Veilguard</em>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a511a80ce6f689ec2037940db3693db6" data-recommend-id="image://a511a80ce6f689ec2037940db3693db6" data-format="jpg" data-width="650" data-height="365" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An ogre towers over Varric." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An ogre towers over Varric." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dark Horse Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a511a80ce6f689ec2037940db3693db6" data-recommend-id="image://a511a80ce6f689ec2037940db3693db6" data-format="jpg" data-width="650" data-height="365" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An ogre towers over Varric." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Two of these are pretty much direct prologues to <em>The Veilguard</em>, the first of which is <em>The Missing</em>.

<p>The upcoming remake of Silent Hill 2 will be console exclusive to the PlayStation 5 (PS5) for at least a year. The reveal comes via the game’s latest trailer from PlayStation.</p>



<p>At the end of the trailer — you can watch it below — there is a message for players. In a short and simple statement, the video reads, “Not available on other formats until 10.08.2025.”</p>



<p>That means those hoping for an Xbox release will have to wait at least until next year. That said, there’s no confirmation that it will come to Xbox when the window opens up.</p>

<p>Regarding the new trailer itself, it’s all about the game’s immersion on PS5 (as the title would suggest). Specifically, it looks at the way the game will utilize the features available on the DualSense controller. That includes things like Adaptive Triggers, Haptic Feedback, and a dynamic lightbar  for things like your health. There will be 3D Audio support.</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 remake launches October 8 for PS5 and PC. Players have the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">option to buy</a> the Standard Edition for $69.99 or the Deluxe Edition for $79.99. Those who pick up the Deluxe Edition can starting playing starting October 6 as well get a digital artbook, digital soundtrack, and more.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games recently added new anti-cheating measures to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-5-ps4-xbox-one-pc-review/1900-6415959/" data-ref-id="1900-6415959">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> in order to address long-standing issues with cheaters in the game. But that move has apparently had some unexpected consequences for gamers who play the title on Steam Deck. GTA 5 is now listed as "unsupported" by Steam Deck, and it may be down to a dispute between Rockstar and Valve.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248585/gta-v-steam-deck-battleye" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, the Steam Deck compatibility message that comes up with Grand Theft Auto 5 states that "this game's anti-cheat is not configured to support Steam Deck." It also warns that "some or all of the game" doesn't function. What it doesn't say is that the part that doesn't work is Grand Theft Auto Online.</p><p>In a <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/33490543992467/Grand-Theft-Auto-Online-BattlEye-FAQ#:~:text=Steam%20Deck%20does%20not%20support%20BattlEye%20for%20GTA%20Online" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Rockstar writes that Steam Deck doesn't support its anti-cheating BattlEye software for GTA Online. But as noted by The Verge, other titles on Steam Deck have successfully utilized BattleEye. Rockstar has seemingly decided not to work with Valve on the issue despite telling affected gamers that "all technical support questions should be directed to Valve’s Steam Deck support content and community."</p><p>For now, Grand Theft Auto Online functionality has been removed from Steam Deck by Rockstar. The rest of GTA 5's story mode is still playable despite the "unsupported" tag from Valve. It's possible that a solution between the two sides can be worked out in the future. But for the moment, this is where things stand. In the meantime, gamers are already looking ahead to the long-awaited sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-might-not-benefit-from-ps5-pro-in-ways-that-you-expect/1100-6526459/" data-ref-id="1100-6526459">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which is scheduled to arrive in Fall 2025.</p>

<p>The good news is that because of this cloud-centric approach, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-requires-fraction-of-storage-space-versus-last-game/1100-6526578/" data-ref-id="1100-6526578">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will have a much smaller footprint</a> on your storage device.

Entitled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Petals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the title was actually a prequel wrapped up in a mini-game, a means to tell more of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1433140/The_Texas_Chain_Saw_Massacre/">Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> story as it would appear later in the titular game from 2023.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The aim of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Petals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was to prelude the story of Maria Flores through snapshots from her camera, leading up to the events of the game. Lending insight into that is Gun Interactive president and CEO Wes Keltner, who is joined by executive producer Ismael Vicens, to explain their thought process behind the design of this minigame, and why those to deliver a narrative in this specific way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer: What were your design goals in adding a photography mode to the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wes Keltner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: We knew our game was taking place a few months before the 1974 film. In order to provide as much story as we could, while still making a multiplayer-only game, we began kicking around the idea of an ARG. We wanted to tell the story of Maria, why she was in Texas, and what happened to her. The answers to these questions would kick off our multiplayer game. It was the story before the story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our creative director, Ronnie Hobbs, had already written into the bio of Maria that she was a photographer. She went to this area of Texas to take pictures of the bluebonnets and other spring flowers. We were also interested in tying the camera Hitchhiker uses in the film back into our game. Where did he get that camera? This was our chance to do something interesting. So we created this smaller, PC-only experience that allowed players to use that very camera to take pictures of flowers. But with each picture they were looming closer and closer to their end.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Why use photography to deliver narrative?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Keltner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: If you're making a smaller game or experience, you have to start thinking about keeping the systems and mechanics somewhat simple. This isn't a fully scoped-out game, but a smaller, almost demo-like experience. Focusing on the camera was a great mechanic that was somewhat easy to implement while still giving the players something to concentrate on. It allows them to look at things closer, with intent. And honestly, it slowed them down. And as horror game creators, if I can get you to slow down, I got you! I can scare you when you slow down.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What camera or photography features did you feel were essential and which were left on the cutting room floor?</span></span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ismael Vicens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: When we were first discussing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Petals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, something that we felt was worthwhile to implement was the idea of retaining the aspect of the photographer behind the camera. When other games enter a photography mode, they let the players move the camera around and place it more or less where they wish. We have a few photographers at the office, and we understand the feeling of planting your feet and finding your shot—of walking and suddenly spotting something in that moment that you want to capture. So we wanted to make sure that was present in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Petals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, to really put the player in Maria's shoes, so to speak. With The Museum, given the scope and expanse of the levels, and how they recreated an iconic location from the film, we provided the player with a little bit more freedom.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">In both, we decided on a very stripped down feature set, because ultimately, when you're walking and shooting, you're thinking more about what you're pointed at, how you want to highlight it, and how you're going to compose your shot. So we limited ourselves primarily to changing focal length, and adjusting focus. This way, players are thinking about the same things someone in that moment would be thinking about, and approaching their photos in the same way.</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>It seems as though many photography modes are just a modification of the natural camera view that players use in the game, but with added tools. What was the technical process of implementation like?</span></span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vicens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Beyond the natural game camera, when you implement a photography mode, there are additional technical hurdles that you have to concern yourself with as a developer. You have to ensure that the camera doesn't pass into solid objects, or expose an area of the game world that may not have been intended to be seen. These expand the testing burden for integrating such a mode—hence why you don't see it with every title.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">The process of changing focal depth is fairly simple. As a developer, you're constantly manipulating that during the process of making a game as you experiment with what will look best during gameplay, so those controls are already present. Even capturing or freezing a moment on screen is simple—these are things that are baked into a game already. So the majority of the technical process comes down to the additional features you lay on top, and how much freedom you afford the user.</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Are photography modes just a matter of clever UI?</span></span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vicens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I think it can vary wildly, depending on the specifics of the mode, and the intention of the mode's placement in a title. In some titles, photography mode exposes huge amounts of controls for players—the ability to spawn and manipulate objects, or dramatically change the light sources in a scene, etc. This is obviously much more than a clever UI; it's enabling a user to create content for themselves or others that can tell a story.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">For us, we could definitely say that perhaps it is just clever UI, but even just layering on UI creates a different feeling for the player. It allows us to do some things that support the story we want to tell, or the emotions we want to evoke. As a crude example, in the moment when the shutter closes, we've got the ability to suddenly change what you see through the camera, letting us startle the player in that instant. And because we've created specific photos as goals, we have the benefit of knowing what the player is looking at, making this even more effective. These are tools we don't have in uninterrupted gameplay—they rely on the presence of that UI, of that tool and of those goals for the player.</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can video game photography teach us anything about real-life photography?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vicens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I think there definitely could be a time and place where video game photography could teach someone about real-life photography—there are a ton of "simulator" style games on the market, and that area is ripe for educating users about some of the basics. We've focused primarily on photography as a design tool for us to transmit some narrative to the player, or to solve puzzles. However, in the Museum mode we have, we do encourage users to really soak in the details, no matter how small, of the world we've created. In that, perhaps, we can remind someone that a photo doesn't often have to be about the grand subject or perfect moment, but about the little details that make up our world, and how they stack one on top of the other to create our perceptions and deepen our appreciation of the world around us. Every layer—the beauty, horror, textures, and more.</span><br></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How is our portrayal of photography limited or enhanced by the medium?</span></span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vicens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: For us, the portrayal of the photographer being in the moment is enhanced in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Petals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the short experience where you play Maria. Through the combination of art, sound, music, and linear narrative, you go from a character appreciating and experiencing the beauty of her surroundings through the lens of a camera to being disturbed, startled, and ultimately terrified while capturing pictures. So for us it was less about representing a true experience of photography, and more about placing the player in the mindset of that photographer.</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What design features can help us achieve an authentic experience?</span></span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vicens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: "Authentic experience" is a difficult thing to pin down, because we need to define what authenticity means in the specific experience being crafted. Are we seeking to replicate the authentic experience of taking photos? Or trying to let players craft and capture a moment that replicates the authentic feeling of playing the game, albeit in a still image? If the former, is the title live, and in the moment the same way we take photos in life, or is it still authentic if we pause the game and let the player manipulate the camera, as so many titles do?</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">The best we can ever do as developers is think about the experience we want out players to have with every feature—what emotion we want to evoke, what reaction we want to receive—and design for that, while knowing that what a player does is ultimately out of our hands. In our case, we wanted to achieve a few things with photography in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Petals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and later in The Museum. We wanted to put you in the mindset and shoes of a special character in our game. Then we wanted to use the confinement and action of lining up and taking photos to unnerve the player and start to tell a story. In The Museum, we wanted the player to appreciate the lengths we went to to replicate iconic locations from the films while also encouraging them to solve puzzles—and yes, to scare them again!</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Should authenticity even be the goal?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Keltner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Aiming for authenticity is always our goal. In fact it's paramount to our games for two very important reasons. We are entrusted with a globally recognized IP and we don't take that lightly. It's an immense responsibility and we want to make sure we treat it with the respect it deserves. A big portion of that respect is being authentic to the film. Assuring it feels, sounds, and looks like that 1974 film. And I think we pulled that off. The second reason is more of a horror design philosophy and that's immersion. It's our job to keep you immersed in the moment. If something pulls you out because it's incorrect or not authentic, it's very hard for us to pull you back in. It's much harder for me to yell "boo" and it scares you if you're not really present in the game. And authenticity keeps you present and allows you to feel a bit lost in the world.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Community Editorial Coordinator, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Holly Green has been in games media for fifteen years, having previously worked as a reporter and critic at a variety of outlets.

That’s the basic premise of Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, the self explanatory spin-off coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One and PC on 28th February 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCmDF0NqZQc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Half a year after teaming up with Kiryu for the battle at the Millenium Tower, Goro Majima washes up on a remote island with no memories at all, not even his name. He embarks on a new adventure with teenage islander Noah to regain those memories and get ahead in this topsy-turvy world.</p>
<p>That will take them in conflict with criminals, modern-day pirates (who dress like ye olde pirates – and other scoundrels, who are all chasing after a legendary treasure. Thankfully you’ll have your own pirate crew backing you up, with real-time cannon battles against other ships on the open seas, before switching up to hand-to-hand after boarding their ships. Here you can switch between Majima’s Mad Dog and piratical Sea Dog fighting styles, the latter letting him wield a cutlass and other buccaneer gear.</p>
<p>First washing up on Rich Island, the adventure will also take Majima to Madlantis, the secret island where criminal organisation co-exist and the home of the Pirate’s Coliseum. There’s also Nele Island, which features the holy site of Palenka, and you’ll get to revisit Hawaii and Honolulu City, which was a key location for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devil-may-cry-animated-series-april-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has released the first teaser trailer for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>animated series, which will be helmed by former&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>showrunner Adi Shankar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set to debut in April 2025,&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>will, of course, revolve around the adventures of longtime series protagonist Dante. If you're not a fan of the 2013 reboot, you'll be pleased to know we're very much in classic&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>territory when it comes to Dante's design.</p>
<p>Shankar first announced the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>animated series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/adi-shankar-announces-devil-may-cry-series-alongside-castlevania">back in 2018</a>, and we got our first look at the animation style and tone of the show <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series">last year</a>, but this new trailer gives a more involved glimpse into the show's setting and characteristically stylish action sequences.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/devil-may-cry-animated-series-dante_0.jpg?itok=P5hsLL69 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/devil-may-cry-animated-series-dante_0.jpg?itok=e3CqiPMv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yup, that sure does look like Dante alright.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer doesn't give a ton away about what the story will be, but it does show Dante leaping out of an exploding plane, battling demons, and, of course, retrieving his pistols from a pizza box, so it's definitely&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>.</p>
<p>You can take a look at Netflix's trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>animated series right here. We don't know exactly when it debuts yet, but this trailer should get you excited for it, at the very least.</p>

<h2>What else is Netflix working on in the gaming space?</h2>
<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>, we also got to see some of the other things Netflix is working on when it comes to gaming-adjacent shows.</p>
<p>For a start, Netflix is working alongside CD Projekt Red for another animated series based on&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, although whether this one will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/cyberpunk-edgerunners-brilliantly-uses-elements-from-game">an anime like&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/cyberpunk-edgerunners-brilliantly-uses-elements-from-game">Edgerunners</a>&nbsp;</em>or a Western-produced show remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Netflix also revealed the release dates for the second season of&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>adaptation&nbsp;<em>Arcane</em>, which saw its first season launch back in 2021 to critical acclaim, prompting Riot to include one of its most beloved characters <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-ambessa-revealed">as a champion in&nbsp;<em>League</em></a>.</p>
<p>The first "Act" will premier on November 9th, followed by the second on November 16th and the third on November 23rd. Presumably, each Act will contain multiple episodes, although we don't know exactly how many there will be yet.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more on these Netflix projects, as well as all other things gaming adaptation-related.</p>

Colin Farrell plays the titular Penguin (whose name has, strangely, been changed from Oswald Cobblepott to Oz Cobb to try and “ground” the series) as mesmerizing and manipulative in this first scene, and he only gets better from there, propelling <em>The Penguin </em>forward like a motor-mouthed machine, at times eliciting empathy, at others disgust. Farrell is so effective, you can practically hear his name ringing out during next year’s awards season.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Penguin</em> picks up right after the events of <em>The Batman</em>: Carmine Falcone is dead, the Riddler has flooded Gotham City, and crime is exponentially up in the wake of the disaster. Sensing a power vacuum and knowing that Falcone’s drug-addled son, Alberto, is due to take the throne, Oz immediately heads over to the family’s nightclub—the Iceberg Lounge—to raid the safe. When he’s discovered by an angry Alberto, he deflects, offering his condolences and a drink in Carmine’s honor. </p><p>Oz effortlessly manipulates Alberto; within minutes the two of them are half-drunk, reminiscing about the old mafioso until he offers the troubled young man some “drops”— a narcotic that you drop in your eye that induces a state of euphoria (or paranoia). As Alberto gets high, Oz tells him the story of the mob boss who ran his neighborhood when he was young, and how the entire community adored the man, mourning his death with a massive parade. But as Alberto begins to feel the narcotic set in, he doesn’t take Oz’s anecdote as a lovely reminder of his father’s legacy, he (somewhat rightfully, as you’ll quickly learn) picks up on the foot soldier’s desire to ascend the ranks. And so, he begins ruthlessly mocking him.<br></p><p>Alberto unleashes a flurry of insults at Oz from an armchair a few feet away with so much vitriol and hatred you pity the poor guy—you can see he’s faced this countless times before, this endless barrage of barbs based on his physical appearance. You see how it’s sunk deep into his soul, twisting him like gnarled tree roots, darkening his perspective on the world. Right when it all becomes too much, when Alberto seems like he won’t stop, right when you’re practically begging for someone to step in and end it, Oz casually pulls a gun and shoots Alberto point blank several times, barely moving in his seat. My mouth drops, an “Oh shit” escapes me that’s so loud our managing editor Carolyn Petit looks up from her seat several desks away.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="b63dd308d78d8cec92938fd305edbb98" data-recommend-id="image://b63dd308d78d8cec92938fd305edbb98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Oz talks to Alberto, waving a finger in his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Oz talks to Alberto, waving a finger in his face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b63dd308d78d8cec92938fd305edbb98" data-recommend-id="image://b63dd308d78d8cec92938fd305edbb98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Oz talks to Alberto, waving a finger in his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here is where Farrell is especially spectacular: in the immediate aftermath, he lets out a barking, cruel laugh. He’s bested Alberto, he’s silenced someone insulting his looks, his intelligence, his honor. He holds the power. But that harsh laugh dies on his lips, and realization flits across his scarred face—this is the new head of the Falcone crime family, and he just shot him in the club they own. His eyes dart back and forth and I watch as a wave of emotions wash over him: frustration at his knee-jerk reaction, lingering anger at Alberto goading him into violence, fear at the repercussions.<br></p><p>“Oh fu-” Oz laments, his expletive cut off by the bold title card: <em>The Penguin</em>.<br></p><p>Farrell is <em>this</em> good for the entire episode (and series, to be quite honest). His voice, his visage, his physicality are all unrecognizable, and his dedicated adoption of this twisted, tortured soul offers a nuanced performance you so rarely see in a comic-book-inspired series. In one scene, he can make you let out a shocked peal of laughter (I choked on my coffee during a rant about the amount of pickles on his bodega sandwich), and in another he’ll make you despise him for manipulating a young, impressionable kid into doing his bidding. It’s an absolute masterclass in acting, and a delight to watch—and it only gets better from there.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=156085.101105873&amp;trid=1197689.218054&amp;foc=17&amp;fot=9999&amp;fos=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2Fshows%2Fpenguin%2F5756c2bf-36f8-4890-b1f9-ef168f1d8e9c&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=156085.101105873&amp;trid=1197689.218054&amp;foc=17&amp;fot=9999&amp;fos=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2Fshows%2Fpenguin%2F5756c2bf-36f8-4890-b1f9-ef168f1d8e9c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Penguin</em></a></span> episode two airs Sunday, September 29 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have revealed the next Like a Dragon game, and this time, everyone's favorite Yakuza loose cannon Goro Majima will be the star of it. Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will see an amnesiac Majima reinvent himself as a pirate captain searching for a legendary treasure, an adventure that will see him cross swords with Hawaiian pirate gangs. The first trailer doesn't show much in terms of gameplay, but it does give a good look at Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's cast, the actors voicing them, and a release date of February 28, 2025.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD_K05bgjSg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JD_K05bgjSg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>During the RGG Summit, producer Ryosuke Horii explained that the spin-off has a "very different" battle design when compared to the recent mainline games that use a turn-based RPG game. "It's fast-paced, and it has a lot of Majima's uniqueness, that’s what we aimed for," Horii said. Majima will be able to switch between two fighting styles--Mad Dog and Sea Dog--utilizing his signature Yakuza fighting moves and a weapons-based system where he goes all in on the pirate theme.</p><p>Additionally, Majima can take part in several minigames, something that has become a staple of Yakuza and Like a Dragon games over the years. Fans of the franchise have been spoiled for choice recently, as RGG Studio has steadily pumped out several games. Since 2020, the developer has released two mainline entries in the series, a remake of Like a Dragon: Ishin, and the spin-off Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6aJQ9hDFxk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T6aJQ9hDFxk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The most-recent entry, Like a Dragon: infinite Wealth, was released in January and saw current series protagonist Kasuga Ichiban team up with Kazuma Kiryu to explore Hawaii, uncover a major conspiracy, and crack some skulls along the way.</p><p>"It's the best of both Yakuza worlds coming together for a story about life, legacy, and the daunting realities of the world we live in--but, more than anything, atonement and the various forms it can take. It also comes with greatly improved RPG systems that nail the tactical joy of turn-based combat while upholding Yakuza's identity in remarkable ways," Michael Higham wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review-the-things-money-cant-buy/1900-6418170/" data-ref-id="1900-6418170">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth review</a>.</p>
