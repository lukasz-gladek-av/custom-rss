					<p>Anybody who knows me knows I like my strategy and simulation games. Then again, if anybody has any memory of my nine years of writing reviews here at Wccftech (and before then), they'll also know my fondness of the genres - so much so that of the 303 reviews for this site, 103 of them sit firmly in strategy or Simulation. Others have a bit of a toe-in, too. I'm saying this here mainly to fill space because I've already previewed Frostpunk 2 twice, covering both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hands-on-with-frostpunk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Utopia Builder beta</a> and then getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-story-mode-hands-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on with the story mode</a> while in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Let's cut to the chase: if you liked Frostpunk, you will love Frostpunk 2. I liked Frostpunk quite a bit, and Frostpunk 2 is just Frostpunk but more, in every way that matters.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I've been able to play through and complete Frostpunk 2's five-chapter story and a game in the Utopia Builder mode, and there's a lot on offer, with a good amount of replayability on both. The story truly starts thirty years after the events of Frostpunk. It's still new London, but everything else from Tesla City to Winterholme to the dreadnought is the initial tutorial to smooth you into the new way of working.</p>
<p>Time hasn't been kind, but you can build bigger and better. I will skip the Dreadnought as I covered that in my story mode hands-on. The inner city is there when you get to New London, but it's time to spread out. Frostbreaking is where you send out huge machines to break the frost and open up new land to expand your city. On a large map, split into hexagonal pieces, you find access to different resources that, in the first game, will be what you barely touched upon when exploring.</p>
<p>Before we get to how you play, more on the story. As you progress through the campaign, you will be pushing New London from the original circle it was, finding a new fuel source, surviving a whiteout, spreading out and going to Winterholme from the first game, and eventually looking to hold off the downfall of what will now be a thriving metropolis. On your way, you will make decisions that will improve your standing with one or more factions. In the core story, the fervent ones are the Stalwarts and the Pilgrims.</p>
<p>At the end of it all, the ending line from Frostpunk's On The Edge DLC is the most persistent: "The ultimate threat was not the storm, but discord". Finding the balance between factions while trying to maintain resources is not easy. I would argue it's impossible if you wait too long - particularly on a harder difficulty setting. The journey is all worth it, even if the resulting text screens only explain how your decisions impacted the city and its people.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>The last line is a clear link to the new Utopia Builder mode, which is endless. There is a target to achieve, but once that's achieved, you can continue until you want to stop or until the city falls. Here, you get to set up outposts using the population of your current city; you don't need to build in manually, and they are essential as they will give you resources from an unlimited pool. There are also other areas you can colonise and build other cities.</p>
<p>Of course, there's only so much you can do and survive; food is limited, and the longer you carry on, the longer over-population will create an impossible strain on what little there is. Win before you reach that point. All I can say from this is that each Utopia Builder mode, with the seven different starting points and various maps, will give you a different story. This story is exactly what Frostpunk 2 is all about, much like previous similar 11 Bit Studios games, and it does it fantastically.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Whichever mode you're in, the gameplay remains the same. As you expand further out, breaking the frost and building new districts - each district starts by using six hexes. Housing districts can be expanded twice, with all other districts once, and each expansion uses three additional hexes. As you expand, you can build an additional specialist structure; each is researched over time, and building them impacts your standing with different factions and the various metrics and resources your city runs on.</p>
<p>Heat, Squalor, Hunger and Disease. These are the things you will be balancing, and the worse they get, the more the tension in your city rises, particularly if the factions do not well think of you. The resources you're managing are one of the various fuel sources, be it Coal, Oil, or geothermal energy. Heatstamps are the world's currency, with fabrications, materials, goods, and food rounding it all out.</p>
<p>In addition, you will be directing political choices. In the first, you selected what happens. In Frostpunk 2, once you have built the council chamber, the factions - based on population - will have a portion of the 100 seats. You can select a law for a vote to happen or even offer the agenda to one of the factions and boost your popularity, which is interesting if you give them the agenda and don't want their vote to pass. It won't due to sheer numbers, so you get the bonus of making them happier while not having the law go through.</p>
<p>With these laws and the new layer of voting, you can find even more interest, and the factionalism of real politics comes through. If you want a vote to swing one way, you can make promises or, once researched, use some of your trust to swing people. Keep any promises, too, as you have time limits; not fulfilling them will set you back.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I haven't touched upon visuals and audio yet because there isn't much to say. Frostpunk already looked fantastic, and Frostpunk 2 does again. The districts are very detailed, letting you zoom in and see part of their workings, and the effects of the weather and surrounding areas are fantastic. Like the original, the audio is also extremely fitting, with the audio effects planting you firmly in the frozen wasteland and a soundtrack that never feels out of place. That's often the best praise I can give a game. I want the sound to immerse me, and it does.</p>
<p>Frostpunk 2 is, like other titles by the same studio, a game about balance and perseverance and follows on from the original in a fantastically organic way. Once a city has reached its initial limits, it will naturally have to spread and use the resources around it. In such an inhospitable world, you will be forced to make difficult decisions and forge a path that will not suit everybody, and human nature and our inability to think beyond our narrow field inevitably leads to conflict, as we have seen ourselves - and continue to see - all too recently.</p>
<p>If you liked Frostpunk, you will love Frostpunk 2.</p>

<p>Frostpunk is an excellent looking, excellent sounding, and great playing organic growth and succession from the original. Spreading further along the wasteland, you have to balance more as you deal with politics, resources, factions, and ever more challenges, often including settling and building in new areas. Still a challenge, but more approachable, this is yet another city builder that will shine out amongst others.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/plucky-squire-review-real-page-turner</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-plucky-squire-review-a-real-page-turner.983502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/plucky-squire-review-real-page-turner<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I don’t know what it is about games that play in both 2D and 3D, but ever since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/paper-mario-and-power-of-charm"><em>Super Paper Mario</em></a> came out for the Wii, I’ve been a huge fan of that particular subgenre. It’s one of many reasons why <em>The Plucky Squire</em> caught my eye when it was first announced a couple of years ago. The colorful and cutesy art style, the somewhat wacky storybook premise, and, of course, the hopping between 2D and 3D worlds. It was love at first sight.</p>
<p>After playing it for about 15 hours, though, I can say it’s much more than just another quirky game that utilizes both 2D and 3D well. <em>The Plucky Squire</em> pays a lot of homage to the world of art and artists, whether that’s painters, musicians, or writers. The titular plucky squire is a heroic writer named Jot. He’s the land of Mojo’s savior by day and a world-famous author by night. Talk about work-life balance.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20240910124225_1.jpg?itok=jGudQcDK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20240910124225_1.jpg?itok=km4TdEVk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You’ll soon find that <em>The Plucky Squire</em>’s storybook setting isn’t just for looks. Jot must defend the world from the evil wizard Humgrump once again, but this time, there’s a twist. Humgrump reveals that they’re inside a story and that Jot’s destined to win against him every time. Jot must now prevent himself from being written out of his story and save the lands from being destroyed.</p>
<h2>The Good, the Bad, and the Plucky</h2>
<p>Accompanying Jot on his cross-dimensional journey are his childhood friends Violet and Thrash, and their magical mentor, Moonbeard. Violet and Thrash aren't really that helpful, but they're funnily self-aware that their characters are written that way. Don't worry, they have their own moments to shine. Moonbeard is a sorcerer but also a DJ. Yeah, he's pretty cool.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20240916142939_1.jpg?itok=uYbscGp8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20240916142939_1.jpg?itok=kblDDIzO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You’re equipped with nothing but a sword and the capability to dodge, but as you slash your way through enemies and bushes, you’ll find a light-bulb-shaped currency that you can use to unlock and upgrade attacks. Unfortunately, buying them these abilities is the only way to obtain them. That forces you to search every nook and cranny for bulbs, so scraping together enough cash can be a hassle.</p>
<p>You can choose between story mode and adventure more, depending on what tickles your fancy. Admittedly, I’m not exactly someone who’s an expert when it comes to video games. I consider myself to be average, but I’d never back down from a challenge, so I went through my playthrough in adventure mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, I never really found myself in a real pickle when it came to <em>The Plucky Squire</em>’s combat. The game is a bit too generous when it comes to the number of hearts you can get, making it really easy to not get a game over. In fact, the only time that I did was when I got accidentally one-shotted by an enemy that I wasn’t supposed to try and fight. This does make it a very kid-friendly game, but players looking for more of a challenge might find themselves disappointed.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20240916185935_1.jpg?itok=DdRr1BgW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20240916185935_1.jpg?itok=lioPIVKB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>However, the rest of <em>The Plucky Squire</em>’s gameplay is incredibly enticing and will keep you looking forward to more. I especially loved the mini-game segments, where you could find yourself being thrown into a new genre every time. One moment, you’re in turn-based combat with an archer, and the next, you’re in a rhythm game fighting a giant eagle. Just when you think things are getting a bit stale, the next mini-game comes in to freshen things up.</p>
<p>The puzzle-based aspects are another area where <em>The Plucky Squire</em>’s gameplay really shines. There are sentences that describe what’s going on, as storybooks do, and Jot’s abilities allow him to swap words around to alter the environment. You can cross a river by making a little lily pad large or even lure a giant rat by turning a wooden cube into a block of cheese.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20240916200321_1.jpg?itok=WUOoIPrF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20240916200321_1.jpg?itok=Uxp_HBU7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>At times, you’ll need to think outside the box, or rather, the book and use your powers to find clues. You can hop outside the book with portals made with ‘Metamagic’ to turn pages and even tilt the very objects that are inside the pages. There are also objects in the outside world that you’ll need to locate as 3D Jot. The 3D environment is essentially a desk in the outside world, and while you don’t spend as much time being 3D as you do 2D, these segments are crafted with just as much care. You’ll be able to jump into sheets of paper and sticky notes, à la the wall merge ability from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/best-legend-of-zelda-games"><em>A Link Between Worlds</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game does seem to hold your hand a lot. Some of the optional hints that you can get from Minibeard (Moonbeard’s tinier clone) are appreciated, it gets a little tiring when Moonbeard just calls you up and tells you exactly what you need to do. I certainly like figuring things out for myself, so it would have been much better if there was a choice to turn these clues off.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20240916113417_1.jpg?itok=qZxQLa6A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20240916113417_1.jpg?itok=LKILwNXX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I did end up encountering a few bugs with the game. These bugs seem to only be prevalent in the 3D areas. Some of them are a quick fix and can be solved by just reloading the game, but in the case of the game-breaking bug, I ended up getting soft-locked out of my save file and had to start a whole other save. Hopefully, these end up getting solved in later patches.</p>
<p>Atmosphere-wise, <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is a top-notch game. There’s no doubt that it’s a wonder to look at in both 2D and 3D. The hand-drawn 2D sprites are a joy to look at, especially all the types of enemies. Evil has never looked cuter! Of course, the game is no slouch in the sound department either. The soundtrack remains pretty upbeat, and you’ll be surprised to find plenty of genres here as well. EDM, metal, jazz, you name it. Also, a special mention to all the little jingles and clinks this game has. My ears were very pleased upon collecting a bulb or opening a chest.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20240916120918_1.jpg?itok=srdm9i0X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20240916120918_1.jpg?itok=yPBQ1Eem 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>The Plucky Squire</em> | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>The Plucky Squire</em> is one of my favorite games to come out of this year, and it’s definitely earned a special place in my heart as a 2D and 3D action-adventure game. For All Possible Futures’ first game, it’s an incredible feat to make something that has this much sheen and sparkle, but just a little more polish would have made it a perfect game.&nbsp;</p>

There’s little better to me than a cool autumn weekend spent on the couch rewatching some of my favorite shows and movies or picking at a particularly lengthy game. The days are getting shorter and the nights are growing long again, and as we naturally begin spending less time outside due to the cooling of the temperature, why not mark the occasion with a great new adventure?</p><p>Fall is also when most big developers and publishers begin pushing their biggest releases, since it comes just ahead of a whole bunch of consumer-friendly holidays, such as Black Friday and Christmas. So maybe it’s quite natural after all that I think about big ol’ open-world games like <em>Red Dead Redemption 2 </em>when this time of year comes around. After all, I’m positive most of these games came out in the back half of their respective years, so my brain’s just connecting the dots. Anyways, Xbox is holding a sale on a bunch of open-world titles until <strong>September 23</strong>, so here are the absolute best of the bunch to pick up.</p></div></div><div><p>Everyone (and I do mean <em>everyone</em>) is waiting for Rockstar to provide <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-take-1851617299&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-take-1851617299">any more news on <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a></span>.

But while most everyone has definitely played the latter, the former still feels like an acquired taste, and never took off as dramatically as the studio’s lead franchise. That feels like a shame because <em>Red Dead Redemption 2 </em>finally sees Rockstar in its absolute best shape.<br></p><p><em>Red Dead Redemption 2 </em>is not only the studio’s most mature story, but it is far and away its best, too. Watching your band of thieves and crooks—who protagonist Arthur Morgan comes to know and love as family—fall apart is nothing short of tragic. As a prequel to the original <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, it even successfully connects the two games and their overlapping casts, and makes more sense of John Marston’s motivations and regrets as he hunts down his former brothers-in-arms. It is also an absolutely astonishing technical marvel. It transforms the onset of metropolitan infrastructure and the downturn of the natural world into something equally beautiful and woeful. It is big, sometimes even too big, but it’s also a game whose head and heart feel in the right place most of the time, and I was shocked by how effective <em>Red Dead Redemption 2 </em>ultimately was.<strong> If you bear with it through the painful opening stretch, there’s a hell of a tale in </strong><em><strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong></em><strong>, which you can pick up for about $30 on Xbox.</strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-odyssey-the-kotaku-review-1829425897&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-odyssey-the-kotaku-review-1829425897"><em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em></a></span><em> </em>has the distinction of being the first AAA game I ever reviewed and it remains one of the biggest, too. To call it huge is to do it disservice, honestly. <em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey </em>is, for all intents and purposes, a <em>sprawl</em>. Spread out over various isles on the Mediterranean Sea, this game lives up to its name, sending you on a journey that can only be summed up as a Greek epic. In it you play as either Alexios or Kassandra, who embark on a quest that sends them all over the known Greek world. You become the captain of a ship, you engage in territorial battles on several warfronts, and on at least one occasion, you get shitfaced with some soldiers on the beach. <em>Odyssey</em> features, among other things, a <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>-like nemesis system that is tied to a web of conspirators, as well as romance, which results in a freewheeling exploration of the sexual fluidity of Grecian culture. As you sleep and murder your way from Athens to Crete, you even unearth the origins of several mythological creatures. <em><strong>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</strong></em><strong> may be intimidatingly large, and even a little bit unwieldy, but it also has the most fun of any of the formulaic Ubisoft open-world games, and it can be yours for $12 on Xbox.</strong></p></div><div><p>You’ve heard it a million times before, but it bears repeating: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sea-of-thieves-the-kotaku-review-1825046876&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sea-of-thieves-the-kotaku-review-1825046876"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a></span><em> </em>has the best water of any game ever.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-game-water-no-mans-sky-update-1851599212&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-water-no-mans-sky-update-1851599212"> As someone who <em>really </em>appreciates water technology</a></span> in games, this is the single most important point about <em>Sea of Thieves</em>. There is more to it than just that, though. <em>Sea of Thieves </em>is bliss. Its art style is incredibly vibrant and cartoonish, which flies in the face of countless other pirate games these days that aim for a somewhat dour realism. It is also a game best played with friends, who can accompany you as you sail and help you maintain and operate your ship, doing things like loading up cannonballs, stocking up on food, and repairing cracks in the hull that threaten to capsize your crew.</p><p><em>Sea of Thieves </em>is one of the games that puts the most emphasis on the “open-world” aspect, given that it doesn’t really feature anything resembling a traditional campaign or storyline outside of entirely optional DLCs that crossover with <em>Pirates of the Caribbean </em>and the <em>Monkey Island </em>games. Instead, over the years, Rare has simply built on the world, adding new locales, threats, reputations for varying factions and pirate crews, and more in order to deepen the allure of the virtual pirate life. As far as games-as-services go, it is one of the most approachable; most of its battle pass rewards were actually on the free track as of the last time I played and it has even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sea-thieves-game-pass-xbox-solo-season-10-update-1850864864&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sea-thieves-game-pass-xbox-solo-season-10-update-1850864864">added modes that strip PvP from the experience,</a></span> in case you just want to merrily sail with your friends and animal companions. <strong><em>Sea of Thieves </em>is on Game Pass, but you can also own the base game for just $20 right now, and for that price, this pirate fantasy is worth it.</strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tunic-xbox-game-pass-zelda-dark-souls-fez-indie-impress-1848668747&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tunic-xbox-game-pass-zelda-dark-souls-fez-indie-impress-1848668747"><em>Tunic</em></a></span><em> </em>is the most curious game included in this sale. I guess it is pretty open-ended, though I never stopped to think about whether it was so tightly designed that I considered it a true open-world game or not. Regardless, <em>Tunic </em>is worth the price of entry because not only is it a great game in the vein of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, but it is also one of gaming’s best mystery games. You see, <em>Tunic </em>is a game with some dense layers. On its face, it’s a cute, voxel-style mashup of <em>Zelda</em>’s exploration and <em>Dark Souls</em>’ difficulty, but there’s so much more happening just beneath the surface of the game’s driving action. Mechanics, as well as the nuances of its curious world, are conveyed via torn-up manual pages that can be discovered through exploration, except it’s all in a language that looks like nothing you’ve ever seen before. It <em>can </em>be translated, though, and deciphering it helps unlock so many of the tucked-away secrets within <em>Tunic</em>, which transforms the experience into something else entirely. Would you believe me if I said that wasn’t even <em>Tunic</em>’s only language that can be found and translated?</p><p><em>Tunic </em>is like a Russian nesting doll of game experiences, and cracking one layer of it just to find another is a bewitchingly good time. I’ve actually not played a game quite like it, and to give away any more would be to rob you of a singular experience. <strong>Grab </strong><em><strong>Tunic </strong></em><strong>on Game Pass or while it’s $15 on Xbox right now.</strong></p></div><div><p>At a time when most open-world RPGs were leveraging scale to entice players, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-outer-worlds-will-rattle-your-idea-of-a-perfect-pla-1839238442&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-outer-worlds-will-rattle-your-idea-of-a-perfect-pla-1839238442"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a></span> did something pretty neat and went in the other direction. By comparison to some of the heavy hitters on this list, <em>The Outer Worlds </em>is tiny, but to me it’s just right. This satirical sci-fi RPG, which appears on its face like Obsidian trying its hand at making its own <em>Fallout</em>, can be completed in less than 20 hours if you just beeline it to the end. Now, that’d rob you of a lot of the side quests and exploration that games like this tend to excel at, but it’s a game that’s meant to be economical in its design, so I can’t blame anybody for treating it as such. Even when maximizing your time with this game, which has multiple story expansions, the total amount of hours spent in <em>The Outer Worlds </em>will likely be dwarfed by those you sink into almost any other open-world RPG like it. If you’re looking for a big game that’ll also be respectful of your time, you can’t go wrong here, and luckily it’s pretty affordable too. <em><strong>The Outer Worlds </strong></em><strong>is available on Game Pass, but you can get the </strong><em><strong>Board-Approved Bundle</strong></em><strong>, which features the game and the expansion pass, for $25.</strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-fixed-re-review-2023-impressions-saved-1850143200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-fixed-re-review-2023-impressions-saved-1850143200"><em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>has a complicated reputation</a></span>, to say the least, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791">Night City</a></span> is one of the most believable worlds a game’s ever taken me to. I could get lost in its city streets for days and still turn up something or someone that was new and exciting, and that’s kind of life in the big city as I’ve always known it. Confounding in its labyrinthine depth, but always deeply rewarding to explore, <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>features a cast of characters from every walk of life too, including folks from the rough-and-tumble streets of Santo Domingo and Pacifica, where marginalized communities live in dilapidated and abandoned structures. <em>C<strong>yberpunk 2077</strong></em><strong>’s world is rich in texture and history around every corner, and you can be a part of it by picking up the base version of the game for $30, or the ultimate edition including the </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-review-idris-elba-1850852291&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-review-idris-elba-1850852291"><strong><em>Phantom Liberty </em>expansion</strong></a></span><strong> for $53.59 on Xbox.</strong></p></div><div><p>I’m so surprised that Ubisoft has yet to <em>really</em> follow up on the incredible success of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ghost-recon-wildlands-the-kotaku-review-1793227761&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-recon-wildlands-the-kotaku-review-1793227761"><em>Ghost Recon Wildlands</em></a></span>. An open-world take on the often linear genre of tactical third-person shooters, <em>Wildlands </em>felt like an outrageous entry into a storied franchise that typically prided itself on realism. It was the answer to a question nobody really asked: “What do you get if you smash <em>Ghost Recon </em>and <em>Far Cry </em>into one game?” It worked though, and sold millions of copies, because it turns out that just dropping four players into an open world where they can perform tactical hijinx is a winning formula.</p><p>Now, Ubisoft did follow this game up with <em>Breakpoint</em>, a sequel that focused far more on a story led by Jon Bernthal (<em>The Bear, The Punisher) </em>and survival mechanics than the explosive fun and looseness of <em>Wildlands</em>. The key to a great open-world game is almost never narrowing the possibilities though, making <em>Breakpoint </em>a bit of a misfire. A sequel that taps into the first game’s more hands-off approach would go a long way, but while Ubisoft figures out what it wants to do next with the series,<strong> you can pick up the base version of </strong><em><strong>Ghost Recon Wildlands </strong></em><strong>for just $10, or the ultimate edition which includes years of DLCs for $24 on Xbox. </strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the first Frostpunk, you would place down individual buildings to expand your colony, bolster happiness, and improve industry. In Frostpunk 2, construction proves a little more streamlined, as you’ll now construct specialized districts that allow you to focus on more macro decisions instead of micro. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-districts-of-frostpunk-2">The Districts of Frostpunk 2</h2>



<p>There are five main districts in Frostpunk 2: <strong>Housing</strong>, <strong>Food</strong>, <strong>Extraction</strong>, <strong>Industrial</strong>, and <strong>Logistics</strong>. You may enhance each by unlocking additional research in the Idea Tree, then construct new buildings within each district that further specialize them. For example, one of the earliest technologies you may unlock, the Dust Coal Mine, enhances the Extraction District by installing a unique extraction depot designed to improve the efficiency of coal output efforts.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-build-districts-in-frostpunk-2">How to Build Districts in Frostpunk 2</h2>



<p>You can construct districts in Frostpunk 2 by selecting the District Construction menu from the bottom-right of the HUD. It’s the icon that looks like three crates or buildings stacked beside each other. Alternatively, hit “B” on your keyboard to open the District Construction menu quickly.</p>



<p>But before you can build a new District, you must clear away the hardened ice by using the Frostbreaking mechanic, which is the last icon on the bottom-right of the HUD—it looks like three arrows pointing outward from a circle in the center. You’ll Frostbreak sections of the ice surrounding your colony, clearing enough space for each District. They require three to six tiles of space to construct, so be tactical about where you work.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>With ice-breaking complete, choose the District you wish to construct, then select a single white tile nearby to place the first segment. From there, connect the series of tiles until you meet all of its space requirements, and the checkmark appears. Tap that checkmark to issue the orders for a new district.</p>



<p>Your workforce will take some time to construct the District, but you can always speed up game time with the 1, 2, and 3 hotkeys.</p>

<p>Let’s dispel any hope straight off the bat because Frostpunk 2 is a challenging game. It isn’t easy to succeed, even in the game’s prologue, unless you know precisely what you’re doing. To reach that point, you either need a few Frostpunk 2 tips and tricks open or play through the same scenario repeatedly. I don’t know about you, but I would prefer the former. So, here are a few tips to help you become the Steward you were meant to become!</p>



<h2 id="h-frostpunk-2-tips-to-keep-in-mind">Frostpunk 2 Tips to Keep in Mind</h2>



<p>The encroaching ice, internal conflict, and a severe lack of food will test your patience and resolve as you attempt to survive the Frostland in Frostpunk 2. It’s only a matter of time before the next Whiteout strikes, and what then? Will you have prepared enough to outlast the cold weather? Here are a few Frostpunk 2 tips and tricks to keep in mind as the new Steward of New London!</p>



<h3 id="h-stockpile-food-for-whiteouts">Stockpile Food for Whiteouts</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll want to stockpile as much food as humanely possible before the next Whiteout occurs. The tutorial teaches you the dangers of the Whiteout, but it goes so much further through the entire campaign as a core gameplay mechanic. In the prologue, you have a small number of Wanderers, which, while challenging, makes learning the core mechanics easier. But your first settlement—New London—is significantly larger and has a bustling and growing population. You’ll attract new citizens regularly. They all require food, as do your current citizenry.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The more Food Districts you construct, the better. But don’t overextend yourself. You still require the appropriate Workforce and materials to build your Districts. I’m saying prioritize Food and Coal, but don’t ignore everything else. Frostpunk 2 is about balance as much as it is about survival.</p>



<h3 id="h-strategically-place-your-districts">Strategically Place Your Districts</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>When placing one of your Districts, try to think strategically. In the screenshot above, you’ll note that this area of the map includes three Material deposits, and during the planning phase of the Extraction District, I covered all three with a single District. This method optimizes resource production and ensures you don’t waste construction materials, such as Materials or Prefabs, on multiple Districts that all serve the same purpose. </p>



<p>Your goal, as Steward, is to conserve resources while bringing in new materials for the betterment of what’s left of society, not to waste time and energy on building too wide.</p>







<h3 id="h-don-t-be-afraid-to-negotiate-in-the-council">Don’t Be Afraid to Negotiate in the Council</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As Steward, your rule is not absolute, but a law is. Occasionally, you spot a law proposal that benefits the entire settlement, but not everyone on the Council supports the suggestion. You may need to sway opinions. Don’t be afraid to negotiate, as it allows you to gain favor for a specific law, allowing it to pass more easily while promising potential improvements that you may want to pass anyway.</p>



<p>There’s give and take with any negotiation. Occasionally, the requirements to sway one of the factions to your side may appear unfair or downright terrible for the settlement, but it’s a necessary evil. For instance, to pass quarantine measures for sick workers, I was required to negotiate with the Londoners to provide improvements to the Central District, which in turn would craft Prefabs. It’s a win-win in this case!</p>



<h3 id="h-build-trails-to-major-resource-nodes">Build Trails to Major Resource Nodes</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>When you finally start to explore the Frostland with the Frostland Teams from the Logistics District, you’ll inevitably stumble upon massive resource deposits. In my game, I found an Abandoned Mine, which houses hundreds of thousands of Coal to keep my Generator in New London burning endlessly for weeks. But it doesn’t automatically link to my settlement just because I discovered the point of interest. You must build a trail to ship resources from point A to point B (New London).</p>



<p>Constructing a trail does cost time, resources, and Frostland Teams, but it’s well worth the effort. My people won’t freeze for a considerable amount of time because of these resources!</p>



<p>As we continue diving into the game, we’ll update this guide with additional tips and tricks for Frostpunk 2!</p>

            <p>
Four years after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-later-ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate">announcing</a> a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate">Skate</a> game - and two years after eliciting collective groans with the news it would be free-to-play - EA has revealed the latest instalment in its long-running skateboarding series will launch into early access next year.
</p>
<p>
When developer Full Circle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">first began sharing details</a> of its new Skate project (which is officially known as Skate, rather than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-4">Skate 4</a>) back in 2022, the studio explained it wasn't "a sequel, it's not a remake, a reboot, [or] a prequel." Instead, it was described as an "authentic evolution" of the series intended to reflect "where skateboarding and gaming is in the real world".
</p>
<p>
Two years on, and Skate - which is set in San Vansterdam, a sister city to previous games' San Vanelona - has already been available to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-skate-opens-up-insider-playtesting-programme">steadily growing number of early playtesters</a> for quite some time. It was also briefly available to considerably more than a select few players after an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-download-the-early-leaked-version-of-skate-developer-says">early build of the game was leaked</a> back in 2022.

<p>
And now - following EA's recent announcement that <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/insider-playtest-registration">closed playtests for Skate's console version</a> are launching this "fall" - the publisher has <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1836065157027402235">confirmed</a> early access is due to begin next year. That's presumably early access for everyone, but the announcement is vague - with EA adding it'll "share more details on what to expect in the coming months."

Skate will be available on PlayStation, Xbox, PC (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-stake-is-coming-to-pc-via-steam">including Steam</a>), and mobile devices when its early access begins in 2025 - some 15 years after the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-3-review">Skate 3</a>.

			<p>Today, Electronic Arts <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1836065157027402235" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that skate would launch next year in early access. The fourth mainline installment in the extreme sports series is in development at Vancouver-based studio Full Circle and has already been playtested by 'tens of thousands' of PC gamers over the last couple of years. Console playtesting is set to begin this Fall.</p>
<p>Last we heard from the studio, they were making a series of changes based on the feedback gathered from playtesters:</p>
<p><em>We’ve done a ton of work rebuilding Flick-It, skate.'s core trick control system. We want to make sure every trick feels fun and satisfying, while delivering the familiarity from past Skate games. On top of that, we’ve improved accuracy and control to make learning tricks easier.</em></p>
<p><em>The team is also hard at work to give you the tools to have fun your way, by yourself or with friends, anywhere in San Vansterdam. Almost everything you do in the game will earn you rewards, so you can customize your character, setup, and even unlock new objects to place and skate in San Van.</em></p>
<p><em>Self-expression is what skateboarding’s all about, which is why we’re stoked to bring in as many character customization options as possible to skate. Body types, hair, clothes, your board setup (including stickers!) — you’ll be able to tweak and style to your heart’s content.</em></p>
<p><em>What we’re most excited about with skate. is that we’re building a game that can live, grow, and change with you for years to come. Everything you’ve heard about so far — the city, its story, the gear, music, game modes, and more — will evolve as we go from season to season.</em></p>
<p>The game will employ a <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-free-to-play-live-service-full-crossplay-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free-to-play business mode</a>l and also include crossplay functionality across all platforms (PC, Mac OS, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and mobile devices). It's going to be '<a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-always-on-online-multiplayer-activities-some-without-skateboards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always-on</a>', that is to say, a live service game persistently connected.</p>

            <p>As the end of the UK workday approaches, and the last few grains of sand trickle through the neck of the huge, obsidian hourglass our overlord Graham keeps on his desk, let me bid you goodbye by writing up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/some-goodbyes-we-made">Some Goodbyes We Made</a>. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Created by Safe Flight Games, it's an hour-long collection of 11 minigames which include pint-sized visual novels, platformers and free-standing character creators, all contained within a charming faux-desktop interface. As the title implies, each is about the act of saying farewell to something or someone - an old home, your university life, a friend you're no longer on good terms with. "You'll see how the protagonist preserves the sadness and profundity of their goodbyes through these minigames, and feel the unique complexity, heartache, or beauty of each one," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705820/Some_Goodbyes_We_Made/">the Steam page</a>, perhaps a bit heavy-handedly.</p>
<p>While they're obviously going square for the emoti-glands, the games appear quite mischievous in style. There's one in which you wave frantically with the mouse cursor while your train pulls away, and another that looks a little like Earthbound in which you are a kid raising hell during a house move.</p>
<p>Safe Flight's two developers are both alumni of New York University Game Center. I've played a lot of absorbing smaller experimental games from NYU Game Center grads. I also love the concept of a collection of endings - a sort of anti-demo disc, if you will. It reminds me a bit of John Thyer's micro-RPG <a href="https://farawaytimes.itch.io/facets">Facets</a>.</p>
<p>All that said, I'm not entirely sure I want to actually experience Some Goodbyes We Made - or at least, it's not a game I'd jump into offhandedly. The developers note that in the course of playing the game "you might also revisit the goodbyes of your own life", which is a kind thought, but I've said some goodbyes I don't personally want to revisit.</p>
<p>Still, I'm glad that this game exists and, given a certain amount of mental preparation, intrigued to see how they've pursued the concept across different genres. I wouldn't mind smashing together a compilation of ending sequences from other games, slotting the final mission from Mass Effect 2 in alongside the Death Egg Zone from Sonic 2, and challenging people who've played neither to make sense of it all. What would you put in yours? </p>
<p>Some Goodbyes We Made will launch on 25th October. And with that, dear reader, I will say not goodbye, but: see you tomorrow!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you don’t care about the meta and choosing the absolute best, there’s nothing wrong Dehya. She does get better the more you build up her Constellations, and more importantly, she still looks cool as hell.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d7b59bf08d451fd8068ae79fb4c7d882" data-recommend-id="image://d7b59bf08d451fd8068ae79fb4c7d882" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Qiqi has a dilemma over her zombie status, on a nice green hill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Qiqi has a dilemma over her zombie status, on a nice green hill." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d7b59bf08d451fd8068ae79fb4c7d882" data-recommend-id="image://d7b59bf08d451fd8068ae79fb4c7d882" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Qiqi has a dilemma over her zombie status, on a nice green hill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Next on the list is Qiqi. Healers are pretty invaluable in this game, and Qiqi is capable of outputting some big healing numbers. However, she’s arguably outperformed by others in the same role due to her long cooldowns and majority focus on healing. There’s a much more dependable and versatile healer to choose later on this list.</p><p>The right team can support Qiqi well enough though, and it’s easy for her to save the team right back when they’re on the brink of death. To top it all off, this short zombie girl is cute as a button and she’s the only Cryo user on this list. Those who enjoy Cryo elemental reactions, or simply like the character, will benefit from adding her to their teams.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1e636ee08d8ebef31564204e4e26420d" data-recommend-id="image://1e636ee08d8ebef31564204e4e26420d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="878" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The character screen shows Diluc, a red-haired man with a hawk perched on his wrist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The character screen shows Diluc, a red-haired man with a hawk perched on his wrist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e636ee08d8ebef31564204e4e26420d" data-recommend-id="image://1e636ee08d8ebef31564204e4e26420d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="878" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The character screen shows Diluc, a red-haired man with a hawk perched on his wrist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If a Pyro user with a big sword is what you’re looking for, but you want someone more dependable than Dehya, you can’t go wrong with Diluc. He can pile on damage super easily, especially when his skill can be used three times in a row before cooldown and his Elemental Burst requires little energy to use.<br></p><p>I’ve found him to be a lot of fun to explore with too. His claymore breaks items down quickly, and the uptime of his skill makes it great for puzzles. There have certainly been stronger Pyro DPS introduced during the game’s lifetime, but Diluc is reliable and effective. You can’t go wrong with him.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d1c11704c52c8906bccd469984883828" data-recommend-id="image://d1c11704c52c8906bccd469984883828" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kequing stands in front of a building, a dog sat on the steps behind her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kequing stands in front of a building, a dog sat on the steps behind her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1c11704c52c8906bccd469984883828" data-recommend-id="image://d1c11704c52c8906bccd469984883828" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kequing stands in front of a building, a dog sat on the steps behind her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In contrast to the slow and heavy claymore DPS so far, Keqing is a refreshingly quick Electro Sword character. Her attacks come in fast and with wide range, meshing well with AoE-based skill and burst moves. Pair her with a Dendro team to make great use of their plethora of Elemental Reactions.</p><p>I’d be remiss to not mention the practicality of her skill as well. Keqing can teleport to the mark left behind by the ability, making it great for combat in addition to exploring. I’m always tempted to keep her on my team solely to avoid some of the monotonous climbing.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c6c06da7d69ff2754b6d9ee9e4a71c5" data-recommend-id="image://7c6c06da7d69ff2754b6d9ee9e4a71c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mona casts some magic from beneath her very fetching hat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mona casts some magic from beneath her very fetching hat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c6c06da7d69ff2754b6d9ee9e4a71c5" data-recommend-id="image://7c6c06da7d69ff2754b6d9ee9e4a71c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mona casts some magic from beneath her very fetching hat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s nothing quite as satisfying as seeing massive damage numbers over your enemies. Mona excels at making this happen thanks to an Elemental Burst that can drastically buff a follow-up attack. As a Hydro Catalyst character, she can constantly barrage with element damage and inflict the Wet status on enemies.<br></p><p>Her unique sprint that moves quicker over water is notably useful too. For those like me who love exploring but hate having to cross long stretches of water, Mona helps a lot. Just remember that she needs to start sprinting on land first before transitioning to the water.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0213f3e69c363b9400000c6b3439a527" data-recommend-id="image://0213f3e69c363b9400000c6b3439a527" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="877" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The character screen showing Jean, a blonde woman with a dandelion in her hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The character screen showing Jean, a blonde woman with a dandelion in her hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0213f3e69c363b9400000c6b3439a527" data-recommend-id="image://0213f3e69c363b9400000c6b3439a527" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="877" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The character screen showing Jean, a blonde woman with a dandelion in her hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Remember when I said there was a better healer on this list? That title belongs to Jean. Not only does her Elemental Burst heal the entire party, but her first passive gives her normal attacks a 50 percent chance to heal the party as well. She can also easily slot into a DPS role thanks to her huge Anemo damage. Being able to launch enemies into the air for some impressive fall damage is the cherry on top.<br></p><p>Not many characters, much less healers, can match her versatility. There’s a good reason why Jean has remained a prominent healer choice in the community. <strong>If you’re a new player, this is actually who I recommend choosing.</strong> Even though I’m about to argue she’s not the best on this list, I do believe newcomers will benefit the most from having her on their teams. She’s great enough to carry you through the initial chapters to the more challenging endgame content like Spiral Abyss.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9d84b963553389cd85df46cadce7b7f3" data-recommend-id="image://9d84b963553389cd85df46cadce7b7f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="877" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The character screen shows Tighnari, who is holding one of his bunny ears." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The character screen shows Tighnari, who is holding one of his bunny ears." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d84b963553389cd85df46cadce7b7f3" data-recommend-id="image://9d84b963553389cd85df46cadce7b7f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="877" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The character screen shows Tighnari, who is holding one of his bunny ears." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Dendro element and its elemental reactions are pretty highly favored by the fan base, which already gives Tighnari an advantage. What cements him at the number one spot here is that he’s the best DPS from the Standard banner. He can set up elemental reactions quickly, and help dish out damage just as fast. Dendro-related puzzles are also made easy since you only need to charge up a bow attack to trigger them.<br></p><p>Tighnari might not be a great pick for you if you’re not a fan of bow weapons. I certainly hate using them whenever I decide to play <em>Genshin Impact</em> with a controller. What helps in Tighnari’s case is that his Elemental Skill distracts enemies and reduces the charge time for his next three shots. Even better is that his Elemental Burst, while dealing low damage, auto-targets and requires little energy to fill. It can’t be understated how effortless he makes dealing damage with other characters.</p><hr><p>These are great choices. Even the most mid of 5-star characters will have something that helps them shine compared to others. Whether you’re a newcomer looking for a proper DPS or a long-time player interested in the one character you don’t have yet, any of these will be a fine addition.<br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-xbox-release-date-nintendo-switch-port-1851627237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-xbox-release-date-nintendo-switch-port-1851627237"><em>Genshin Impact</em> Finally Hitting Xbox In November But Still No Nintendo Switch Port In Sight</a></span></p><p>Just make sure to confirm your choice sooner rather than later. <strong>A Quest to Kindle Ancient Flames lasts until October 8, 2024.</strong> I suggest adding the free character ASAP, especially if you plan on playing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-xbox-release-date-nintendo-switch-port-1851627237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-xbox-release-date-nintendo-switch-port-1851627237"><em>Genshin Impact</em> on Xbox</a></span> the following month.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft has announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/three-new-games-and-more-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three new games</a> are set to join Xbox Game Pass over the next week. However, it’s not just games coming to the service they announced. It <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/17/xbox-game-pass-september-2024-wave-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was also revealed</a> that nine games are leaving Xbox Game Pass soon, too.</p>



<p>The biggest games — as far as notoriety is concerned — leaving Xbox Game Pass soon are Valheim and Gotham Knights. However, those aren’t the only prominent titles being removed.</p>



<p>The full list of nine games are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gotham Knights&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>Let’s Build a Zoo&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>Loop Hero&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>My Time At Portia&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>PAW Patrol Grand Prix&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season&nbsp;(PC)</li>



<li><em>The Walking Dead: Season Two&nbsp;(PC)</em></li>



<li>Valheim&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>



<p>There is no specific date for when the games will be removed. As far as a reasoning, it’s likely due to various licensing agreements expiring between Microsoft and the publishers. Those who wish to keep playing them can buy them for update to 20% off as part of their Xbox Game Pass membership.</p>



<p>Do any of the nine games leaving Xbox Game Pass stand out to you? Let us know in the comments, and join the discussion in the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/219/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>Fans of ultra-viral mobile gaming hit <em>Flappy Bird</em> who were stunned by the game's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/at-height-of-popularity-creator-pulls-flappy-bird-from-app-stores/">sudden removal from the iOS App Store</a> 10 years ago were probably even more stunned by last week's <a href="https://x.com/flappy_bird/status/1834241698781630485">equally sudden announcement that <em>Flappy Bird</em> is coming back</a> with a raft of new characters and game modes. Unfortunately, the new version of <em>Flappy Bird</em> seems to be the result of a yearslong set of legal maneuvers by a crypto-adjacent game developer intent on taking the "Flappy Bird" name from the game's original creator, Dong Nguyen.
</p><p>"No, I have no related with their game. I did not sell anything," Nguyen <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/1835229532301017328">wrote on social media</a> over the weekend in his first post <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/825935290430742528">since 2017</a>. "I also don't support crypto," Nguyen added.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">No, I have no related with their game. I did not sell anything.<br>
I also don't support crypto.</p>
<p>— Dong Nguyen (@dongatory) <a href="https://twitter.com/dongatory/status/1835229532301017328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>"<em>Flappy Bird</em> was designed to play in a few minutes when you are relaxed," Nguyen <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/creator-cites-addictiveness-discomfort-in-pulling-down-flappy-bird/">said in a 2014 interview</a> after removing the game from mobile app stores. "But it happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it’s best to take down <em>Flappy Bird</em>. It's gone forever."
</p><h2>“A decade-long, convoluted journey to get here”</h2>
<p>So how can another company release a game named <em>Flappy Bird</em> without Nguyen's approval or sale of the rights? Court filings show that a company called Gametech Holdings <a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Dong%20Nguyen%20Ha%20%20">filed a "notice of opposition"</a> against Nguyen with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in late 2023, seeking to invalidate his claim on the "Flappy Bird" name. When Nguyen, who lives in Vietnam, didn't respond to that notice by November, the US Patent and Trademark Office entered a default judgment against him and officially canceled his trademark in January, allowing Gametech to legally claim the name.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>But Gametech's efforts to legally acquire the Flappy Bird name seem to go back much further than that. Back in 2014, an outfit called Mobile Media Partners <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn86188824&amp;docId=AAU20140222151009&amp;linkId=18#docIndex=17&amp;page=1">tried to claim the Flappy Bird trademark</a> in a filing made mere days after Nguyen pulled the game from the App Store. Coincidentally enough, the specific New Jersey address listed by Mobile Media Partners on that 2014 application <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98007245">matches an address used by Gametech Holdings</a> in the paperwork for its 2023 legal efforts.</p>
<p>Mobile Media Partners' 2014 application makes reference to a (now-defunct) FlappyBirdReturns.com and asserts that the company had "reserved/acquired the name from Apple in their Apps Store [sic]." It also claims that "Flappy Bird" is "not being used by any other companies and/or people," taking quick advantage of Nguyen's decision to take the game down.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/flappytm.png" data-height="468" data-width="759" alt="A section from the USPTO's 2018 trademark certificate granting &quot;Flappy Bird&quot; to &quot;Mobile Media Partners.&quot;"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/flappytm.png" data-height="468" data-width="759">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> A section from the USPTO's 2018 trademark certificate granting "Flappy Bird" to "Mobile Media Partners."</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this "evidence," the USPTO actually <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn86188824&amp;docId=ORC20180311112708&amp;linkId=4#docIndex=3&amp;page=1">granted Mobile Media Partners a Flappy Bird trademark in 2018</a>, a fact that Gametech <a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91287432&amp;pty=OPP&amp;eno=4">cited</a> in its successful 2023 opposition to Nguyen's use of the mark.</p>
<p>In a press release, a spokesperson for the newly formed Flappy Bird Foundation—which acquired the trademark from Gametech—summed this all up as "a decade-long, convoluted journey to get here." The new company said it also acquired the legal rights to <em>Piou Piou vs. Cactus</em>, a little-known 2011 web game that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CcAOnxYe6g">seems to have heavily inspired <em>Flappy Bird</em></a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://flappybird.org/">newly launched FlappyBird.org website</a> proudly refers to "the decade-long mission" to revive the game, which "involved acquiring legal rights." The post also mentions "working with my predecessor to uncage me and re-hatch..." in phrasing that seems to imply a link to the original <em>Flappy Bird</em> but which could also reference the <em>Piou Piou vs. Cactus</em> acquisition.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated that artificial intelligence has become indispensable to modern computer graphics, signaling a major shift in how visual technologies are built. Speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference on September 11, Huang explained that AI is now integrated into the very foundation of graphical computing.</p><p dir="ltr">"We can't do computer graphics anymore without artificial intelligence," Huang said (via <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4720501-nvidia-corporation-nvda-ceo-jensen-huang-presents-goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology" rel="nofollow ">Seeking Alpha</a>), noting that Nvidia uses AI to compute a small part of the image and infer the rest. "We compute one pixel, we infer the other 32... it looks photorealistic, and the image quality is incredible, the performance is incredible."</p><p dir="ltr">AI has been criticized for its energy consumption, but Huang argued that using it for graphics can reduce energy use. "Computing one pixel takes a lot of energy... inferencing the other 32 takes very little energy, and you can do it incredibly fast." Huang added there are "productivity gains" from using these methods to generate code, and the capacity for that is "just incredible."</p><p dir="ltr">Relatedly, Huang also emphasized AI's role in software development, particularly with code generation. "There's not one software engineer in our company today who doesn't use code generators," he said, predicting that AI-driven "digital engineers" would become standard across industries.</p><p dir="ltr">Nvidia's AI-based DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) boosts performance by generating extra frames. Sony is employing similar AI techniques with its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">PS5 Pro's</a> PSSR upscaling.</p><p dir="ltr">Huang concluded by outlining Nvidia's broader AI applications, including autonomous vehicles, robotics, and digital biology. AI, he said, is transforming fields like drug discovery with computer-aided tools.</p><p dir="ltr">Nvidia's AI innovations are part of a growing and already-here trend, with <a href="https://unity.com/resources/gaming-report?isGated=false" rel="nofollow ">a Unity report</a> showing that 62% of game development studios now use AI, primarily in animation.</p>
