			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 CPU will address one of the most critical issues of its predecessor, which caused slowdowns in certain games.</p>
<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/the-nintendo-switch-limited-cpu-and-ram-but-it-also-made-optimization-a-fun-puzzle-to-figure-out-japanese-engineers-talk-about-difficulties-they-faced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AUTOMATON</a> recently interviewed some Japanese developers who worked on ports for the original Switch, asking them what difficulties they had to face and what are their expectations for its successor. Speaking about the CPU, the most frequent comment from developers was that it was often running at full capacity in games and thus couldn't handle background loading, forcing developers to either optimize background loading to make it happen whenever possible or to abandon optimization entirely, leading to performance drops in games. The much more powerful CPU of the Nintendo Switch 2 will address this issue, making background loading easier for developers.</p>
<p>Another well-documented weakness of the original system, which the Nintendo Switch 2 will address, is the RAM, as its measly 4 GB made it difficult for some developers to port games developed for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which had 8GB of RAM. One developer who worked on a port of an open-world RPG said that working around the RAM limitations of the system was like solving a puzzle, as compressing textures to the absolute limit to save as much memory as possible actually made their game look better the more memory was saved.</p>
<p>No matter what individual game developers' expectations may be, the vast majority of them are really looking forward to the Nintendo Switch 2's improved hardware specifications. Those working primarily on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S titles, in particular, highlighted the urgent need for the system, as its increased specs will make porting games much easier.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch later this year. According to analysts, it should be priced at<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-399/"> $399</a> for a variety of reasons.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-train-2-brings-more-deckbuilding-madness-demo-available-now.1113363/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-train-2-announced-demo-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Big Fan Games and developer Shiny Shoe have announced&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2</em>, a followup to the 2020 roguelike deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>Monster Train</em>, and you can try it out right now if you want to.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://x.com/BigFanPresents/status/1892227902936093175" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> by Big Fan over on X,&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>will boast "new clans, card types [and] gameplay twists", as well as new factions and challenges to take on. Of course, the core gameplay, in which you'll defend your Pyre across three vertical gameplay fields, remains intact.</p>

<p>This time around, the story revolves around Titans, powerful beings who have "seized control of Heaven". It's up to you to command the forces of angels and demons in order to fight back against the Titans and reclaim the heavens from their machinations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-train-2-announced-big-fan.jpg?itok=SWv412AE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-train-2-announced-big-fan.jpg?itok=t02F_REf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>brings more deckbuilding madness soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Developer Shiny Shoe is promising five new clans for&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2</em>, each of which will bring its own unique strengths to the table.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to experiment with two new types of card in the form of Room and Equipment Cards. The former adds new boosts to your train, while the latter can be applied to units to help them (and you!) out in combat.</p>

<p>Much like in roguelites like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>has a hub area to which you'll return after each run. The Covenant Outpost is where you'll customize your train, take on new challenges, and interact with the game's characters to move the story forward.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p><em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>will be published by Devolver Digital subsidiary Big Fan Games, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devolver-big-fan-games-licensed-indies" rel="nofollow">effectively the successor to Good Shepherd Games</a> (also a Devolver subsidiary and the publisher of the original&nbsp;<em>Monster Train</em>).</p>

<p>If you want to try the game out, you can do so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on Steam</a>, where a demo awaits you. It doesn't sound like that demo is available on other platforms, unfortunately. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>"Two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-train">Monster Train</a> breezed into my life like a man wearing a trenchcoat stuffed with cocaine," wrote Matt (RPS in peace) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-train-review">his review from 2020.</a> "I've been playing Shiny Shoe's roguelike deckbuilder almost every night since, and I have no intention of stopping. Monster Train is at least as good as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a>."</p>
<p>The full game is "leaving the station later this year", say developers Shiny Shoe. Easy on the low hanging puns there, please. I'll be out of a salary and the single off-peak return it allows me to buy every two years.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

NetEase’s overseas investments include studios like Bulletfarm, led by ex-<em>Call of Duty</em> developer David Vonderhaar, and Bad Brain Game Studios which is made up of ex-Ubisoft devs. The video game industry is in a state of unprecedented turnover right now, with thousands of people having lost their jobs in the past year.

                <p dir="ltr">Choices have consequences. Unfortunately for Sony, one particular decision has led the company to missing out on a couple of the biggest franchises in gaming. The PlayStation team decided not to publish Demon's Souls globally in 2009, which led to a sour taste for the now-well-known studio From Software. That meant the developer looked elsewhere for a publisher with Dark Souls, according to former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fromsoftware-didnt-want-sony-to-publish-dark-souls-as-it-was-disappointed-by-how-demons-souls-was-treated/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> reports that Yoshida explained why Sony didn't publish <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-souls-review/1900-6337621/">Dark Souls</a> while appearing on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-122597374" rel="nofollow ">the Secret Symbols podcast</a>. It wasn't because the PlayStation team wasn't interested, per Yoshida. "From Software was already working on the sequel [to Demon's Souls], but they were so disappointed with how PlayStation treated them, we wanted to work with them again but they passed on it," said Yoshida.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2059335759" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Souls in North America for PS3, while Bandai Namco handled similar duties in Europe. Sony reportedly passed on bringing the action-RPG to other worldwide markets because the PlayStation team didn't think it would appeal to the mass market. Ultimately, Demon's Souls ended up being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgYBivaVco8">GameSpot's game of the year in 2009</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Afterward, From Software partnered with Bandai Namco for the Dark Souls franchise, which spawned three games. From there, Bandai Namco has also worked with the developer on the critically acclaimed Elden Ring series, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-launches-in-may-has-no-microtransactions/1100-6529408/">Elden Ring Nightreign launching on May 30</a>. So, in retrospect, Sony missed out on handling these two massive properties over the past 15 years.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Sony did team up with From Software again for the PS4 exclusive Bloodbourne. "We have huge respect for [From Software president Hidetaka] Miyazaki, and we were able to work with them again," Yoshida said. "Bloodborne is one of his best games."</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement-from-sony/1100-6528084/">Yoshida retired from Sony after 31 years</a> with the company.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/19/monster-train-2-chugs-to-release-this-year-with-a-debut-demo-playable-today/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Monster Train 2 has been announced, a full-sized sequel to the hit deckbuilding roguelite that is set to pull into the station later this year for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PC. But there’s even better news for fans of the original, because <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830">a Debut Demo is out today on Steam</a>!</p>
<p><iframe title="Get on board Monster Train 2 by Shiny Shoe and Big Fan Games!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GfyQXesmn2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monster Train 2 looks to build on the original’s three-floor battle system while tasking you with stopping the hugely powerful Titans from destroying the world. That means that – gasp – Heaven and Hell will be forming an alliance? And journeying together to the homeworld of the Titans, the Abyss.</p>
<p>You’ll have new enemy factions to face off against, and helping you to do that are the five playable clans, each of which has specific advantages and battle styles. New unit abilities have been added, which can be activated at the player’s choosing to maximise their effectiveness, while there’s hundreds of new and familiar cards in your deck, with the debut of some new card types.&nbsp;Room Cards will boost a single floor of the train, Equipment Cards stack powers onto units, and the clan-agnostic Neutral Cards will be a general purpose stopgap.</p>
<p>There’s new ways to play with an Endless mode, Daily and Dimensional challenges, run mutators, leaderboards and more, and you can draw upon some buff-granting train customisation too.</p>

<p>The demo gives two of the five new clans in Monster Train 2 – the Banished and the Pyreborne – and is limited only to the full run experience. It also doesn’t include many of the new clans,&nbsp;cards, artifacts, modes and features that will come to the full game… but it is a demo, so that’s fine.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed playing Monster Train after its debut into Early Access in 2020. “Monster Train already feels like a fairly well-polished roguelike,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/21/monster-train-preview-roguelike-card-battling-in-hell/">Jason said at that time</a>, “and it’s doing something a little bit different with the card-battling side of things too. It’s exciting to see it playing so well and already feel perfect for the “one more run” mentality that lets a roguelike thrive. It’s certainly one to watch, and hopefully, the arrival time of the game will be more reliable than the form of transport it’s based on. Given that they’re Hell trains, I assume it’s Southwest Trains specifically.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-ceo-is-not-forcing-teams-to-work-on-live-service-games-shuhei-yoshida-says/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite what the live service push announced some time ago, PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst is reportedly not forcing teams to develop live service games.</p>
<p>As reported by<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/yoshida-i-played-the-last-of-us-online-and-it-was-great"> Push Square</a>, former PlayStation Studios CEO Shuhei Yoshida spoke with Sacred Symbols+ about the now infamous live service push that has yet to produce any result, saying that, to his knowledge, first-party studios are not being forced by current CEO Hermen Hulst to develop live service games, although the big initiative did in some way push studios to work on this type of game. According to Yoshida-san, when studios see the company has a big initiative, riding on it gives them a better chance to get a project approved and supported.</p>
<p>Among the games that were part of the PlayStation Studios' live service push but were eventually canceled was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-online-devs-tease-their-canceled-game-it-was-the-highlight-of-my-career/">The Last of Us Online</a>. During the interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sacerd Symbols+</a>, Shuhei Yoshida confirmed he had played the game and that it was great. However, after a conversation with Bungie, Naughty Dog realized they couldn't support a live service game and work on <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Project</a> at the same time, so they canceled the project to focus on the single-player game.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, PlayStation Studios' live service push has yet to produce any results. Last year's Concord was a complete failure, <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/">going offline shortly after launch</a>, while other projects that were part of the initiative, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">God of War game by Bluepoint</a>, have been canceled.</p>

Well, twice. It’s that often. <em>Tails of Iron 2</em> ensures that your rodent power fantasy can be played out in all its gory glory in this animal-slaying sequel. If you’re interested in this second outing from developer Odd Bug Studio, you’re probably wondering how much of your life is going to be devoted to it.

While some may prefer a game that’ll take over your life for the foreseeable, there are many others who just want something they can finish. If your main goal is to mainline to reach the credits of <em>Tales of Iron 2</em>, you can expect it to come in at around <strong>10-12 hours</strong> on its normal “Tails of Iron” difficulty. This makes it reasonably longer than the original game, which could be beaten in about 8 hours.</p><p>Of course, there are also easier and harder difficulties, named “Fairy Tale” and “Bloody Whiskers”, respectively. Depending on which of these you may opt for, your playtime is almost certain to be reduced or extended to some capacity.</p><p>However, as with any soulslike experience, there is more meat on the bones of <em>Tails of Iron 2</em> if you wish to see it. You can go for full completion to snag all trophies or achievements, which will require you to engage with all of the game’s content, including completing all of the hunts, collecting all of the tarot cards, and defeating a certain number of different enemy types.</p><p>If you aim to 100 percent <em>Tails of Iron 2</em>, you can expect your total playtime to land between <strong>15 and 20 hours</strong>. That may not sound like a lot for a soulslike game (especially if you’re used to massive adventures like <em>Elden Ring</em>), but it’s pretty solid for an indie side-scroller that only runs $25.</p><hr><p><em>Tails of Iron 2</em> is available now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unlike <em>Pokémon Go</em>, an augmented reality game meant to be played by groups of people wandering outside looking for whimsical creatures, the board game adaptation is mainly a cleverly designed solo skinner box for watching numbers go up as players accrue wealth and real estate. Scopely, which also operates <em>Marvel Strike Force</em> and <em>Star Fleet Strike Command</em>, was purchased by Savvy back in 2023 for nearly $5 billion as the investment company becomes a growing player in the world of games. </p><p>Despite <em>Pokémon Go</em> becoming a household name since its launch back in 2016, Niantic, which grew out of an internal Google startup, has struggled to replicate that success across other franchises and genres. <em>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</em> arrived in 2019 and shut down just a few years later, while <em>Pikmin Bloom</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, despite being fun mobile games, never took off in the same way. It’s unclear what would happen with those under Savvy management. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Many Trophies and Achievements await those who seek to voyage in Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. I can tell you already the list is fairly sizable and could make the meaty package even more perilous and piratey.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> arrives barely a year after Infinite Wealth. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has done an incredible job of delivering a polished, pirate-filled party. It develops the Like a Dragon story further, explores Goro’s more, and it also means there’s a new Trophy and Achievement list to agonize over.</p>



<p>I’ve put together a handy guide featuring every trophy—and I’ve <strong>separated the hidden trophies for spoiler purposes</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/delta-force-black-hawk-down-preview-a-solid-job-of-reviving-a-classic-military-fps-campaign<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Jade’s Delta Force: Hawk Ops revival was always planned to be an ambitious attempt at the modern military shooter in three distinct flavors: large scale tactical team-vs.-team multiplayer; Escape from Tarkov-inspired extraction shooter; and a focused, high-energy single-player campaign. The Warfare and Operations modes launched last year to mostly positive reception, but the single-player campaign – a remake of the original Black Hawk Down game inspired by the 1999 book that inspired the 2001 movie – was still in the oven cooking up a lot of intrigue. I finally got some hands-on time with a small selection of missions ahead of its launch, and while I can confidently say that it does genuinely capture the spirit of an old-school, turn-of-the-century shooter campaign, there are still enough unanswered questions that being guardedly optimistic is the only answer I could come up with after my time with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s going to be pretty tough for people who didn’t play the original game 20 years ago to compare it to Team Jade’s modern interpretation directly, since it’s not currently available digitally and physical copies of the old PC, PS2, and Xbox versions are becoming more and more scarce every year. But I was one of those people who was wading in the waves of the military shooter revolution at the time – the first Call of Duty launched the same year as Black Hawk Down, and Battlefield 1942 dropped the year prior. But I distinctly remember Black Hawk Down having some standout gameplay features that really raised the bar for the genre as a whole. It featured big, sprawling level maps that offer multiple ways to approach objectives. Some mission sequences would change dramatically depending on the current task, taking you from the back of a humvee to an on-foot stand-off with ambushers to a hurried escape via helicopter, all in the same chapter. And bullet physics and gun handling, specifically the more realistic projectile speeds, bullet drops, lethality, and recoil, made skirmishes less arcadey and more dangerous. Mixed with absolutely arid checkpointing, NovaLogic’s Black Hawk Down was one of the toughest games in the genre.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Delta Force Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Jade’s Black Hawk Down certainly comes from a place of reverence for the old game, obvious in the way it tries to capture this old style of shooting in its missions, and also in the effusive praise game director Shadow and designer Novak laid on the other old work. “When we played the original in cafes so many years ago, it was mind-blowing,” said Joe Meng, PR Manager of Team Jade, translating on Shadow’s behalf. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This Black Hawk Down certainly comes from a place of reverence for the old game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing the initial mission, where we infiltrated the city in search of the enemy stronghold via a rooftop from a building nearby, the tense exchanges of fire between my squad of four (all played by other humans in co-op) and the enemies proved that keeping bullets dangerous was a top priority in their translation. It didn’t take much to drop us to dangerously low health, and that health did not restore itself after being out of combat for a bit. Only specific health restoratives could get us back to ship shape, and only medics – one of the four classes available to choose from – could provide them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once we got out to the street, progress became slightly less linear. This isn’t an open-world map, and there was a clear target that we had to infiltrate, but the path there felt open-ended. My squad, split into pairs, tiptoed down both sides of the street, following some NPC teammates in clearing buildings we passed on our way to the objective, in this case a hotel under control of rebels who were holding hostages somewhere in the building. We entered the building through the front, where the heaviest fire was being exchanged from the lobby plaza to our entrenched spot in the entrance. We could have found a side door and attempted to flank the lobby shooters as well, I found out later, and though you don’t have Hitman-levels of freedom, it is refreshing to know that if this Black Hawk Down has difficult chokepoints, the answer may lie in just finding a safer route. Shadow mentioned that the feeling of relief and reward for overcoming stacked odds was a driving sensation in the design, and this was a great example of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This mission was a little more linear than the next one we tried, which saw us sprinting through a claustrophobic shanty town attempting to get to the crashed Black Hawk helicopters. The mission’s pace and setting was very reminiscent of the original’s Valiant Heroes mission, which features a maze of buildings players had to navigate while freeing stranded friendly soldiers from incoming militia. Both used the labyrinth as an advantage for the enemies, who could pop out from around corners without warning, but where the original made you differentiate between hostile militia members and disgruntled civilians (penalizing you for harming the latter), this updated mission treated everyone in the branching alleyways or dusty markets that wasn’t you as an enemy. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Jade’s take does add snipers who can shoot at players from long distances from the relative safety of a clock tower several blocks away, uses modern environment design trends to make the city dense with small, open shacks and streets to navigate, and checkpoints that bottleneck the sprawling neighborhoods into points of entrenched resistance where more direct assault is required to continue. This was where the difficulty was its most intense, as enemies appeared from all directions, constantly moving while obscured by buildings and searching diligently for angles to take us by surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did miss the detail of having to show some semblance of trigger discipline under these conditions, though. It was certainly engaging and fun, but even in the face of the obvious danger, it felt like a step backwards from the kind of provocative design of the original. And in our limited test, we only tried out two of the seven total missions in the campaign, but neither gave the sense of dynamic scenario switching like the original’s River Raid, which starts as an on foot trek across the desert, turns into a frantic car chase through a minefield, then transforms into a Metal Gear Solid 3-esque tiptoe through the a Somalian river full of crocodiles, and then finally finishes with a multi-stage raid on a village. Of course this, or something equally as energetic, could be in the full three- to four-hour campaign, and I won’t discount the remake’s dedication to the original’s boldness of mission design before deploying myself when it launches on February 21st.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-monster-hunter-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For the last 20 years Capcom's Monster Hunter series has captured fans' hearts with its exhilarating mix of careful strategy and heart-pounding monster battles. From its humble beginnings on the PlayStation 2 in 2004 to topping the charts in 2018 with Monster Hunter World, the series has evolved a lot in the last two decades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While every Monster Hunter game is unique in its own way, we’ve ranked the entire list of games plus the biggest DLCs, to determine which is the very best. One note to consider – given that Capcom has released multiple versions of some of the games, our ranking only takes into consideration the Ultimate versions of each of these. So with that cleared up, let’s kick things off…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Monster Hunter</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-1-1739896860712.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Monster Hunter laid the foundation for everything to come in the 20 years that followed. Its obtuse directions and control scheme might make it harder to revisit than most of the other games on this list, but the core pillars of what makes Monster Hunter great are still present. Taking on larger-than-life beasts with nothing but a weapon and a knack for survival helped set it apart in 2004, even if its steep learning curve made it a somewhat frustrating experience for players at the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed as part of an initiative at Capcom to focus on online games for the PlayStation 2, Monster Hunter's primary focus is through its online event missions. While it's a bummer that official servers are no longer online outside of Japan, the single-player still lets players experience the hunts that kicked off a new genre.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Monster Hunter Freedom</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-freedom-1739896890820.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Freedom released on the PlayStation Portable in Japan in 2005, and followed everywhere else a year later. It was the first handheld game in the series and is an expanded and re-tuned version of Monster Hunter G.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Freedom includes everything from Monster Hunter G and adds in a number of quality of life improvements, the biggest jump was giving Monster Hunter a new home on a portable device. It was the catalyst that pushed Monster Hunter to a whole new audience, putting co-op front and center and bringing together millions of players as they teamed up to hunt, no matter where they were.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its clunky controls and wonky camera – which really demonstrate how far the games have evolved – Freedom is still a lot of fun to play. True, it's not the best Monster Hunter game but it’s certainly one of the most important, and became the blueprint for the future of the series’ handheld games. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-freedom-unite-1739896906136.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Freedom Unite is an expanded version of Monster Hunter Freedom 2, which itself is an expanded version of Monster Hunter 2, which was only released in Japan. It was easily the largest game in the series when it was released and introduced new monsters that have gone on to become high points for the series, including black panther-cross-lizard wyvern,  Nargacuga. It was also the first time the much-loved Felyne companions joined you on the battlefield, and while they might not have helped overcome some of Freedom Unite’s tougher challenges, they made the journey a lot more enjoyable. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-1739896920149.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate was built off of the bones of 2010's Monster Hunter Tri, but with a restructured story and difficulty curve to create a more streamlined experience that included new monsters and quests to keep things fresh. Furthermore, Ultimate 3 brought back the Hunting Horn, Bow, Gunlance, and Dual Blades – which were missing from Tri – to give a more rounded roster of weapons for players to wield. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s therefore no surprise that Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is the definitive Monster Hunter 3 experience. New encounters like underwater fighting added a lot of variety to keep everything feeling fresh, even if you had to wrestle with the camera to make it work properly. And while online multiplayer on the Wii U was not as advanced as it was on other consoles, co-op is so integral to the Monster Hunter experience that its inclusion was a must.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is the natural evolution of everything that came before it and is a strong contender for one of the better monster hunting experiences. It’s showing its age now though, leaving room for other games…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-4-ultimate-1739896935456.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate marked an important turning point for the series. While local co-op was always Monster Hunter’s bread and butter on handheld consoles, dedicated online multiplayer finally arrived in 4 Ultimate, delivering a true leap forward for the series. Now it didn’t matter where your friends were – as long as everyone had access to wifi you could party up and take on a hunt from anywhere in the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Capcom debuted Apex Monsters to give skilled players true endgame challenges to test their mettle against, and these are easily some of the toughest fights in the series to date. Other improvements included a huge roster of monsters to hunt and the addition of vertical movement, which transformed how the game played and almost doubled the size of the map. Monster Hunter 4 really was a leap forward for the series, but it’s still not the best the series has to offer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Monster Hunter Rise</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-rise-1739896953774.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">2021's Monster Hunter Rise brought the series back home to handhelds after jumping to consoles and PC with Monster Hunter World in 2018. Originally exclusive to the Nintendo Switch, Rise took what Capcom learned from making bigger-scale Monster Hunter games on consoles and refined them for handhelds, delivering a faster-paced game with more streamlined features for a smoother overall experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Rise introduced Palamutes, the rideable dog companions that allowed for easier and speedier movement around Rise's maps. It was a welcomed addition that Capcom seems to be repeating, by bringing back Seikrets in Monster Hunter Wilds. Combined with the new Wirebug mechanic, which unlocked new weapon attacks and let you grapple high up into the air like your favorite anime protagonist, Rise brought a sense of scale previously only found on the console versions of Monster Hunter games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it was decimating monsters with acrobatic stunts or soaking up the serene vibe of Kamura Village, Monster Hunter Rise proves that, after scaling up for Monster Hunter World, all those big design ideas could be scaled down to create one of the best handheld Monster Hunter experiences in the entire series. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-1739896973922.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The follow up to Monster Hunter Rise was a massive expansion called Sunbreak, which added an all new location, ferocious new monsters, and a revised weapons system that added freshness to the fights. While Sunbreak doesn't reinvent the wheel, it makes Rise’s already amazing experience even better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most memorable thing about Sunbreak is how Capcom delivered full-fledged gothic horror vibes thanks to the new Citadel castle location and fascinating monster designs inspired by vampires and werewolves. It also addressed the series’ previous lack of endgame content by adding super tough hunts designed to challenge even the most experienced players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sunbreak’s gothic setting might be one of the most beautiful locales ever introduced in the series but the true brilliance of this monster-sized expansion remains the final fight against the vampiric flagship monster, Malzeno, and the horrors of its life-stealing abilities. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-generations-ultimate-1739896995204.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate is Capcom’s swansong to the last decade of Monster Hunter games. Alongside a hugely satisfying customization suite for hunters, Generations Ultimate also features the largest roster of monsters across the entire series. With 93 large monsters, Generations Ultimate is like a greatest hits from your favorite band.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike most other Monster Hunter games, Generations Ultimate features Hunter Styles, which can radically change the way you play. In addition to the usual weapon types, Hunting Styles gave every weapon four unique movesets to choose from, dramatically increasing the fighting styles on offer. Veteran players could stick with the standard Guild style they’re familiar with, or experiment with new styles like Striker, which let players chain together Hunting Arts, turning them into special moves to learn and master. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This deep level of customization was hugely experimental and tremendously fun. Combined with endless hours of hunts, Generations Ultimate is a victory lap for the series, a triumphant showpiece of the iconic monster designs and the joys of playing with friends and family.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-1739897014045.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom followed up the hugely successful Monster Hunter World with the large-scale expansion, Iceborne, and to this day it remains our second-favorite Monster Hunter experience in the entire series. Iceborne’s massive new campaign and long list of hunts makes it feel like a proper sequel to World rather than just an expansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Guiding Lands – a hodgepodge of previous zones mashed together – created an entirely seamless experience that felt like a highlight reel of all the best parts of Monster Hunter World in one area. It also added countless quality-of-life improvements to what was already one of the best games in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it was Iceborne’s new monsters that really stuck with fans, and Savage Deviljho, Velkhana, and Fatalis are considered by many to be some of the best monsters in any game in the series. Indeed, Iceborne could’ve made it to the top spot in this list if it wasn’t for the original game that came before it…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Monster Hunter: World</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/monster-hunter-world-1739897030227.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">2018's Monster Hunter: World kicked off a global frenzy for Monster Hunter like no other game in the series. After years of primarily being a handheld game and labeled with the caveat “Big in Japan”, World brought the series back to its console roots on PlayStation and Xbox, and rocketed it to an entirely new audience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter: World's foundation was rock solid because it offered players some of the largest open zones in the series and emphasized the pure excitement hunters have while tracking and hunting enormous monsters. Indeed, it’s Monster Hunter: World’s sense of scale that sets head and shoulders above its peers. Whether it’s seeing a Rathalos swooping down and flying away with a weakened Anjanath, or witnessing a Diablos burst in on your hunt, Monster Hunter: World didn’t just create a breathtaking setting to play around in, it made you feel like you were in the middle of a sophisticated ecosystem of apex predators all fighting for supremacy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the dense jungle to the high cliffs of the Coral Highlands, exploring World’s diverse environments felt like traveling the globe, bolstered by unique monsters designed to perfectly compliment its surroundings. There is a sense of place for everything, including the endemic life that makes Monster Hunter: World almost like a nature documentary, except, y’know, fun. What’s more, Monster Hunter: World’s story was given a much needed facelift thanks to high quality cutscenes made possible by running on more powerful home consoles, which only added to the brilliant sandbox world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So World is not only a must-have for both fans of Monster Hunter and newcomers alike, but it’s an all-time great video game period.  </p><div id="the-10-best-monster-hunter-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3><h3>The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That's our ranking of the 10 best Monster Hunter games of all time. Which ones have you played, and which do you think are the best? Tell us your ranking in the Tier List above. Will you be preparing to hunt again with the release of Monster Hunter Wilds?

                <p>The next Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game is reportedly going to be released this summer, seemingly backing up the claims of another pro skater earlier this week who said that a new one is coming.</p><p>According to leaker <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, known internally at Microsoft as Project Chicago, will launch in June during Microsoft's currently unannounced Xbox Summer Showcase presentation. It'll reportedly be shadow-dropped on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, as well as Game Pass. The leaker couldn't confirm if the game was also coming to Switch 2, however.</p><p>Yesterday, pro skater <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unannounced-tony-hawk-remaster-on-the-way-pro-skater-claims/1100-6529542/" data-ref-id="1100-6529542">Tyshawn Jones claimed that he was in an upcoming Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> game even though Activision had not announced a new one yet. Some version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-was-reportedly-rejected-in-favor-of-more-call-of-duty-content/1100-6523189/" data-ref-id="1100-6523189">Tony Hawk's's Pro Skater 3 + 4 was reportedly rejected by Activision</a> after the launch of 1 + 2 in 2020, but things may have changed under Microsoft's leadership since then.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnCqKCNNJFs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UnCqKCNNJFs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 isn't on Game Pass, it would make sense that 3 + 4 would be given that Activision is now part of Microsoft. Microsoft has shadow-dropped games onto Game Pass to great success in the past. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hi-fi-rush-review-good-vibes-only/1900-6418023/" data-ref-id="1900-6418023">Hi-Fi Rush</a> garnered critical acclaim, and Team Ninja recently shadow-dropped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-drops-today-included-in-xbox-game-pass/1100-6528989/" data-ref-id="1100-6528989">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> last month as a surprise to tide players over until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-from-team-ninja-and-platinum-games-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct/1100-6528986/" data-ref-id="1100-6528986">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>'s release later this year.</p><p>If Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 gets revealed, expect to see PlayStation's logo on the trailer. Xbox boss Phil Spencer said that Microsoft will begin including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-showcases-will-now-have-playstation-and-nintendo-logos/1100-6529535/" data-ref-id="1100-6529535">logos of other platforms at Xbox showcases going forward</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/19/scuf-valor-pro-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>When it comes to pro-styled controllers, the Xbox family currently sports an embarrassment of button-filled riches. From their Elite series offerings to top-tier competition from Nacon, Turtle Beach and PowerA, there’s never been a more competitive field. SCUF know a thing or two about competition though, and after years as a well-known figure in esports, they’re releasing one of their most mainstream, most competitively priced controllers, while losing none of their esports-bred edge. The result? The SCUF Valor Pro is one of the best wired controllers of this generation.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll experience is the feel of the Valor Pro in your hand. It immediately lends you a sense of quality and craftsmanship, with gorgeously firm and weighty tactility. Built from quality black and grey plastics, the soft-touch faceplate feels fantastic under your hand. There’s also comfortable rubberised texturing on the underside of each arm, helping to keep it firmly in place no matter how sweaty the situation might be.</p>



<p>The SCUF Valor Pro’s styling is understated but incredibly cool, with orange highlights around each of the analogue sticks, black camouflage patterning on the shoulder buttons and triggers, and subdued SCUF logos on the faceplate and the top of the controller. The faceplate is magnetic, letting you swap out the analogue stick tops, or customise the controller’s look, with alternate options available from SCUF, which is nice to see, even if it does come at additional cost.</p>
<p>Connectivity comes via the 10ft braided cable, leading from a USB-C socket on the top of the Valor Pro to a USB-A connector at the other end, ensuring that you can game while sat a sensible distance from your TV. While it’s branded for the Xbox family of consoles, it’s also fully compatible with PC, giving it some useful dual utility if you’re a multiplatform household.</p>

<p>The Valor Pro apes the asymmetrical layout of the official Xbox Series X|S pads, and when that’s one of the most comfortable controllers of all time, it makes sense to refine rather than reinvent. They’ve slightly reduced the controller’s size, making it easier to handle, and the resulting shift means that the rear paddles now sit directly beneath your fingers. There’s a host of improvements here that further lift it above its inspiration, not least the overall quality of the buttons and controls.</p>
<p>The Hall Effect analogue sticks feel excellent, both taut and precise, and the box includes a choice of concave and domed tops depending on your preference. I’ve never been particularly sold on domed tops, but it’s nice to have the option. They feel acutely tuned to FPS play, and through many days of Overwatch games they’ve shown their worth time and time again.</p>

<p>Hall Effect sticks are on course to be an industry standard now, but that’s in response to Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo’s own controllers not including the magnet-based technology. Where the official controllers can all eventually suffer from stick drift, Hall Effect sticks use magnetic field sensing instead of physical contacts that greatly extends the sticks potential lifespan. It’s impossible to say they’ll never wear out – no one can account for exactly how much Call of Duty you play – but they’ll definitely last a lot longer than the alternatives and drift shouldn’t be a factor.</p>
<p>Those FPS chops are furthered by the inclusion of my favourite trend in controllers – trigger lockouts. The Valor Pro’s versions take things one stop further though, completely altering the function of the trigger from analogue to digital micro switch. I’m not even sure how that’s possible, but in use, it means that your trigger response is as fast as a mouse click. It’ll be music to the ears of PC players who prefer to use a controller despite living in the world of keyboards and mice.</p>
<p>The central face buttons feel quick and solid, though it’s interesting that they’ve gone for membrane switches for the main ABXY buttons, but then the circular D-pad uses micro switches. This feels like the fastest D-pad I’ve ever come across, with that speed further helped by the wired connection. A future update on PC will mean the Valor Pro is rated for a 1000Hz polling rate which, for all you number fans, is very fast. Even without that, the Valor Pro feels super-fast and super-precise on both Xbox and PC. If you’re building on well-honed skills, the SCUF Valor Pro can take you to the next step.</p>

<p>There’s further controls to help you achieve greatness, with four additional paddles sitting beneath your fingertips on the underside of the controller. These are a great size, so you can’t miss them, but there’s a firmness to the P1 and P4 paddles to prevent you from accidentally activating them, which makes them feel strangely satisfying to use.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the internal P2 and P3 buttons use micro switches, accelerating the Valor Pro’s responsiveness and making every millisecond count. If you’re not a paddle person, the central ones can be blanked out, with covers included in the box, while all of them can be deactivated to prevent any mishaps.</p>
<p>Two unusual additions are the control wheels to the left and right of the 3.5mm audio port. These give you incremental control over your in-game audio, affecting master volume and the game/chat mix. It’s a helpful inclusion, particularly if you’re using a wired headset like the Turtle Beach Elite Pro that has no onboard controls, and I really enjoyed having everything in one place.</p>
<p>At $109.99/£109.99 the Valor Pro offers a heap of features for less than half the price of some of its competitors. It seriously undercuts the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/19/thrustmaster-eswap-x2-pro-controller-review/">Thrustmaster eSwap X2 Pro</a>, my previous pick for a wired Xbox controller, and while it doesn’t have the modular layout functionality, the Valor Pro is far more natural to hold. If you’d rather go Wireless, I do like the Elite 2, with the Core version coming in at £114.99, but you have to pay extra for the paddles, and fundamentally they aren’t quite as comfortable to use as the Valor Pro’s offering.</p>

		<p>RoadCraft is the video game equivalent of playing in a sandbox with a bunch of bright yellow diggers and trucks. Sure, it’s got its roots in the often torturous terrain traversal of the MudRunner series, but once you get into the swing of the reconstruction tasks it sets you, it really starts to feel like you’re a big kid and your mates have come round to play.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s no need to really engage your imagination here, conjuring up mental imagery of imagined disasters, or making mechanical or engine noises as you smash plastic into sand or dirt – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/roadcraft">RoadCraft</a> has all these bases covered.</p>
<p><iframe title="RoadCraft - Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ldax1af5Wk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We played an opening scenario featured in the new Steam Next Fest demo – available for all from 24th February – dropping into a region that has been devastated by a tornado rolling through – how inconvenient! The power is out, the roads are flooded, and the terrain is only just the right side of a boggy swamp.</p>
<p>The first job is figuring out that you need to disengage the handbrake on your 4×4, and turn on AWD and split diff so that you can actually drive places without spinning your wheels deeper and deeper into the mud. Also, I inadvertently hooked my tow cable to a tyre and was dragging that around for five minutes before realising why I was randomly veering to the right –&nbsp;Look, it’s my first time actually playing these games, but I did eventually catch up to Dom, who knows his MudRunners like the back of his muddy hands.</p>

<p>Once we finally reached the first objective, picking our way through the woods and skirting flood waters, we got stuck in with the meaty terrain-altering vehicles that the game puts at your disposal. Swapping between vehicles from the world map is about as seamless as it gets, at which point you can dive straight into the task at hand –&nbsp;this first job being to clear an area of trees and stumps to make way for future work.</p>

<p>I forget their actual names, but for this one job we had to make use of Choppy the tree murderer, who can effortlessly cut a tree, spin it on its side and then “process” it into a single log, making way for Stumpy the tree stump muncher to come along and just mulch whatever was left sticking out of the ground. Finally, Grabby the… grabber lorry was on hand to come and pick up the logs and take them back to base on his trailer.</p>
<p>Stumpy was by far and away the most direct, with Choppy being similarly decent to get to grips with as you drive to the right position and then trigger his super effective tree murdering attack when the highlight turns green. Grabby, though…. let’s just say that Grabby actually needs you to be able to visualise the relative movement of his arm in 3D space, calculate some angular motion, and is prone to the waggly whims of a dangling mass of wood. It’s a real faff, in other words, but you do get used to it and shifting the camera to a top-down view helps a lot.</p>
<p>The second goal was where this all really started to shine. With a goal to power up and restore a concrete plant, we got to work figuring out the best route to take to this part of the map with our newly unlocked Kay Blur the cable layer –&nbsp;by this point we’d waved away a good chunk of the ‘fog of construction’ obscuring the landscape – and figuring out what we needed to use to get there. Again, there’s no simple road or clear path to take, and with the size of Kay and her laying apparatus, it quickly became clear that we’d need to take Choppy and Stumpy with us.</p>

<p>So began a half hour trek across the map, hopping back and forth between the vehicles and gradually clearing a path for Kay to take. I’ve said it already, but it really did bring to mind that kind of singular vision and clear focus of playing with construction toys to tackle some imagined goal. It was a lot of fun with two of us going at the task, and I can only imagine the kind of coordinated efforts that four could apply in co-op.</p>
<p>That mission complete, we came to the end of the demo on this map – the demo features three maps and scenarios – but this unlocked some further toys that you can play with. In particular, it opens up the possibility to actually start laying roads, using a dump truck to drop a steady bed of sand before laying tarmac and then flattening it out. There’s also a bridge that would been a concrete slab putting in place and more.</p>
<p>This really feels like the next logical step after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/02/spintires-mudrunner-review/">MudRunner</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/27/snowrunner-review/">SnowRunner</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/expeditions-a-mudrunner-game-review/">Expeditions</a>. You still have the foundational vehicular gameplay that proved to be a hit with so many players, and there’s some of the advancements from Expeditions, like having the terrain scanner to lean on. Applying this to a reconstruction scenario and with more deeply ingrained co-op feels like a perfect fit.</p>

<p>Really the only sticking point I can see for newcomers to the series is your mentality as a player, just as with the earlier games. There is that inherently torturous set of vehicle physics as you have to drag yourself through deep mud and water at points, which can be rather frustrating at times, and having to go back and get a slower vehicle for a job halfway across the map could easily be a 30 minute job with misadventures along the way. I’m sure this is as heretical to suggest as an easy mode for Dark Souls, but an option to lift away some of the drudgery with a quick-switching element as in The Crew 2 could just elevate that sandbox play. Of course, you don’t want to lose that inherent charm of playing and collaborating in co-op.</p>
<p>Coming out in May, the full game will feature eight large maps, over 40 vehicles, and a campaign that lets you build up your own building company to handle all manner of disasters around the world. For now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2104890/RoadCraft/">check out the demo on Steam</a> when it arrives next Monday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-hands-on-preview-revisiting-a-cinema-classic/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Wccftech was recently invited out to meet with the leads of Studio Jade to get an exclusive early look at the Black Hawk Down campaign set to become part of the complete Delta Force experience later this year. Alongside a small group of fellow media broken up into three-man squads, we had boots on the ground to get a first look at two of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force/">Delta Force Black Hawk Down</a> campaign's early chapters.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>The Black Hawk Down campaign is intended to be a much more masochistic take on the title’s tactical gunplay, and the developers intended for this co-op experience to require true cooperation to succeed. After picking one of the four pre-made operators, I had a limited selection of loadouts to choose from with no ability to customize and mix/match weapons and attachments. In the group Q&amp;A following our session, I inquired if the Gunsmith system, which is a core part of the Delta Force multiplayer, would be considered to customize a pre-mission load out and was told by the developers that the amount of planning and procedure would run antithetical to the type of narrative they’re pushing in Black Hawk Down and the scramble of boots on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span>Because ammo and consumables are so scarce, bringing along an operator who can resupply fellow teammates is all but essential. While I initially thought that bringing a shotgun would work great for close-range encounters with its one-shot-ill potential, I instead started gravitating towards bringing along the heaviest machine gun I could manage with the highest ammo count. Headshots are almost always an instant kill in the multiplayer session I joined, so it made more sense to bring a weapon with the highest ammo count and carefully pick my shots to snipe enemies from out of their line of sight and hopefully make it through most of the stage without even needing to reload.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Gunfights are typically lethal for the side that comes in unprepared in Delta Force: Black Hawk Down. Most of my team’s early deaths were from not checking corners or opening a door only to find an enemy soldier with an assault rifle on the other side. While the enemies are incredibly deadly, I’m grateful that there are times when the AI is as dumb as a box of rocks. Sometimes the enemies could have laser precision, while other times I found they’d have their backs turned, allowing me a free shot before every other enemy within earshot would home in on my position and blast me away.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We only got a brief taste of two of the campaign missions to Delta Force’s Black Hawk Down campaign, but both had distinctly different gameplay loops. The first mission was a hostage rescue where, after being delivered to the roof of an abandoned apartment building, our squad had to proceed down to ground level, navigate through some open streets, and make it to a large multilevel building filled with enemy ambushes and hostages in dire need of rescue. Line of sight and vantage points played a major part in the latter section as enemies vastly outnumbered our modest squad, and any gunfights in the open would cause other enemies to swarm in. While I initially thought grenades would be an efficient way to take out groups of enemies hiding in rooms across the pavilion, I learned the hard way that one of these rooms held the hostages we were trying to rescue when we were met with a game over screen during our best run to date.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>The other mission involved rescuing a Black Hawk helicopter that'd been, well, downed with enemy soldiers converging on its location. This was the first mission where we had an active time limit and had to play a bit more aggressively instead of moving from cover to cover. This was made increasingly difficult with the level being set up across scattered clusters of favelas with wide open streets that required constant awareness and changing the field of engagement from close quarters to long-range sniping at a constant shift. Our group took no less than three attempts to try and make our way toward the downed chopper and each time we were eliminated less than halfway from the goal, most often from a sniper hiding on one of the rooftops that we could never get a proper line of sight on to take out. I’m sure, with a bit more time to learn the layouts and anticipate these obstacles, clearing the campaign might get a little easier, but still not a walk in the park.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Delta Force’s Black Hawk Down is a drastic shift in both technology and pacing from the multiplayer experience that players might have to take a moment and recognize that they’re getting two distinct gameplay experiences in the same package. The last time I covered a multiplayer shooter that featured a distinctively different campaign was Remedy Games’ work on CrossFireX.It’s not to say that the two experiences are similar in every way, but rather the complexity of having to balance a modern-futuristic multiplayer experience with a campaign centered around Mogadishu in 1993.</span></p>

            <p>Valve have unleashed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>’s client and server game code into the wilds of the internet by way of a Source software development kit update, allowing modders to release their own Steam games based on the long-serving <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Horace">hat-powered</a> FPS – as long as they give them away for free.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's a step up in capacity from existing TF2 modding functionality. “Unlike the Steam Workshop or local content mods, this SDK gives mod makers the ability to change, extend or rewrite TF2, making anything from small tweaks to complete conversions possible,” explains a <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809">blog post on the official site</a>.</p>
<p>“The SDK is licensed to users on a non-commercial basis, meaning that any mod created using the SDK must be free, and any content in those mods must be free,” it continues. “TF2 mods may be published on the Steam Store, and after publication will appear as new games in the Steam game list.”</p>
<p>The post also notes that Team Fortress 2 players have spent a lot of money on stuff created by Steam Workshop contributors, and that “the majority of items in the game now are thanks to the hard work of the TF2 community". Valve would like Team Fortress 2 mod makers to “respect that connection” by not making mods “that have the purpose of trying to profit off Workshop contributors' efforts”. In other words, you're not allowed to re-monetise a decade of community-created hats. Valve would love for all mods to let players access their existing TF2 inventories freely, “if this makes sense”.</p>

<p>The release of the client and server code accompanies a big update to back catalogue Source engine titles, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a>: Deathmatch, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-source">Counter-Strike: Source</a>, Day Of Defeat: Source, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> Deathmatch: Source. This adds “64-bit binary support, a scalable HUD/UI, prediction fixes, and a lot of other improvements”.</p>
<p>Team Fortress 2 was originally released in 2007, back when there was still some hope, and remains one of the top 100 most-played games on Steam as of today.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-discontinues-gold-points-reward-program/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the best features of Nintendo has been announced that it will be discontinued. This is the Nintendo Gold Points program, where you would be able to<a href="https://wccftech.com/six-weeks-of-activities-discounts-rewards-start-today-on-nintendo-switch/"> accrue Gold Points</a> with digital or physical purchases you made for the Nintendo Switch. However, it's now been announced by Nintendo that the company will be discontinuing the Gold Points program on March 24, 2025. The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67660#s1q4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official statement</a> is available on the Nintendo website, where the details of the discontinuation are listed. While points won't be added to your total after March 24, you will have a year to redeem the points you've stored or 12 months from the purchase date of the item.</p>
<p>This is the typical amount of time that Gold Points were available for previously, with them expiring after a year. So, while Nintendo is discontinuing the points program, you won't lose them early. However, if you forget to use them or simply decide not to use them, they will be removed from your account after the expiration date.</p>
<p>Up until March 24, you are still able to earn Gold Points if you redeem your physical product or if you purchase a digital product. After this date, consumers won't earn Gold Points from purchasing digital content.</p>
<p>After the cut-off date, Nintendo has also noted that "some retailers may continue to sell Nintendo eShop cards that disclose earning Gold Points." However, this will not be the case. You will still be able to purchase and redeem the Nintendo eShop cards as normal, but you won't earn any Gold Points when using the cards for purchases.</p>
<p>For those who pre-ordered digital content or purchased a physical copy of a game that would typically come with Gold Points, the specified amount of Gold Points will be available for the consumers as long as the purchases and pre-orders were made before the cut-off date. Physical games that were released on or before March 24 will also still be eligible to earn the Nintendo Gold Points, even if the game was purchased after the cut-off date. However, if the game was released after the cut off date, you will not be able to get the Gold Points.</p>
<p>It's not been specified by Nintendo as to why the company has decided to discontinue the Nintendo Gold Points program, which was utilized by many. However, the Platinum Points will continue to be available, which was a significantly less beneficial program than those of the Gold Points.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-raising-salary-fourth-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that it will raise base employee salaries in its home country of Japan for the fourth consecutive year.</p>

<p>In a news <a href="https://www.konami.com/news/ja/release/2025/0219/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website (for which we're using machine translation, since the original post is in Japanese), Konami says it will raise employee base salaries for all "full-time employees at domestic group companies" in order to create a "rewarding work environment".</p>

<p>Not only that, but new graduates' starting salaries will be raised from 300,000 yen to 305,000 yen per month. The changes will take effect starting from March 2026, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-salary-increase" rel="nofollow">last year's base salary increase</a> set to go into effect next month.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/konami-salary-increase-2026-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=7X2dlvbK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/konami-salary-increase-2026-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=iUPKDcjC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Konami had a pretty good year last year thanks to&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Konami says that its staff are the "source" of its "competitive edge", and that by increasing salaries, the company is hoping to "improve employee engagement and continue to strive to create better products and services".</p>

<p>As with last year, Konami does add the proviso that "some domestic group companies and some job types are not included", but it doesn't go into detail regarding which jobs these are.</p>

<p>All in all, Konami had a pretty solid 2024, it seems. The&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake was released in October last year, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">sell a million copies</a> within its first three days on launch and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">reaching two million</a> as of late January.</p>

<p>Not only that, but in October, FIFA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-konami-esports-partner" rel="nofollow">picked Konami as its new esports partner</a> after the organization's well-publicized split with EA, although it's worth noting that this doesn't mean Konami will be developing whatever FIFA's&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</em>competitor turns out to be.</p>

<p>Set to launch in August (as revealed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-recap-february-2025" rel="nofollow">the State of Play presentation last week</a>), the game represents the first major entry in the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series since 2018's&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Survive&nbsp;</em>(discounting 2023's&nbsp;<em>Master Collection</em>).</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/615075/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-review-test-benchmark</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/615075/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-review-test-benchmark<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia’s new RTX 5070 Ti graphics card is the most intriguing entry in the 50-series lineup so far, promising to outperform last-gen cards that were even more expensive. At $749, it comfortably beats AMD’s $899 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499697/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xt-xtx-review-benchmarks-price">RX 7900 XT</a>, trades blows with the $999 RX 7900 XTX, and is closer than I was expecting to Nvidia’s own $999 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5080</a>. It’s a capable card for a relatively good price, and that makes the RTX 5070 Ti an ideal choice if you’re tempted to move to 4K gaming or want a card that can deliver high frame rates for 1440p. </p><p>But like the rest of the 50-series cards, the RTX 5070 Ti is not as much of an upgrade as we’ve come to expect from Nvidia. The card is around 14 percent faster at 4K than the last-generation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23538558/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">RTX 4070 Ti</a> and 22 percent faster at 1440p. It’s nearly as fast as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24055394/nvidia-rtx-4080-super-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">RTX 4080 Super</a>, which launched at $999, and it’s more than 80 percent faster at 4K than the two-generations-old RTX 3070 Ti. Those are decent numbers, but it’s mostly because the 40 series was such a big leap. </p><p>All of this makes the RTX 5070 Ti a good deal at its $749 MSRP, but only if it stays there — and prices are already going up.</p><p><em>Editor’s note: We aren’t scoring the RTX 5070 Ti until the pricing situation is clear at launch on February 20th.</em></p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->749</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>RTX 4080 levels of performance</li><li>Power draw isn’t significantly higher than the RTX 40 series</li><li>$50 less than the RTX 4070 Ti</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>I wish it had more than 16GB of VRAM</li><li>Not a huge performance boost over the RTX 4070 Ti</li><li>Unlikely to stay at $749 MSRP</li></ul></div></div></div><div><p id="1440p-and-4k-benchmarks"><h2>1440p and 4K benchmarks</h2></p></div><p>I’ve been testing MSI’s RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X OC edition, which looks almost identical to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24046652/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-super-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">RTX 4070 Ti Super I reviewed last year</a>. MSI’s tried-and-true Ventus 3X OC cards use a triple-fan layout with a copper baseplate and heat pipes to cool the GPU and memory modules. </p><p>For both my 4K and 1440p testing, I paired MSI’s RTX 5070 Ti with AMD’s latest Ryzen 9 9800X3D processor and Asus’ 32-inch 4K OLED PG32UCDP monitor. I also put the RTX 5070 Ti up against the $999 RTX 5080 — the next step up in the RTX 50 series — as well as the RTX 4080, RTX 4070 Ti, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and AMD’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499697/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xt-xtx-review-benchmarks-price">Radeon RX 7900 XT</a>.</p><p>The RTX 5070 Ti delivers what you’d expect from a modern GPU: playable frame rates at both 4K and 1440p with all the settings maxed out. While the hardware isn’t quite as sleek as Nvidia’s Founders Edition cards, MSI’s GPU will fit well into most gaming rigs.</p><p>Without DLSS or ray tracing enabled, the RTX 5070 Ti is nearly 13 percent faster than the RTX 4070 Ti Super at 4K and 1440p, enough to make it practically identical to the RTX 4080 at 4K and not far behind at 1440p. You could even overclock the RTX 5070 Ti with the click of a button in Nvidia’s app or by using MSI’s Afterburner utility and get slightly ahead of the RTX 4080 Super. </p><p>The RTX 5070 Ti makes for a great 1440p experience and solid 4K gaming, especially if you’re willing to turn the settings down slightly or overclock the card to squeeze out a little more performance. The next step up in the RTX 50-series line, the $999 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5080</a>, is around 12 percent faster than the $749 RTX 5070 Ti at 1440p and around 15 percent faster at 4K resolution — but you have to pay an extra 33 percent in cash for not much more performance.</p><p>The RTX 5070 Ti, much like the RTX 5080, makes the most sense if you’re upgrading from the RTX 30-series models or earlier. At 4K without DLSS or ray tracing, the RTX 5070 Ti is nearly 84 percent faster than the RTX 3070 Ti. It will be a noticeable upgrade if you’re using an RTX 30-series card or older, and you’ll also get access to Nvidia’s Frame Generation technology.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524897/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review-test-benchmarks">Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti</a>, which launched in 2021, was only suitable for very entry-level 4K gaming, in part because it shipped with just 8GB of VRAM. The limitations were especially noticeable in the <em>Forza Motorsport</em> benchmark, where the RTX 3070 Ti averaged a measly 33fps compared to the 109fps on the RTX 5070 Ti.</p><p>I’m hoping we won’t see those same limitations further down the line with the RTX 5070 Ti’s 16GB of VRAM. The original RTX 4070 Ti only had 12GB of VRAM, which Nvidia bumped up to 16GB with the RTX 4070 Ti Super. If there was a little more VRAM on the RTX 5070 Ti, then it would help avoid any video memory limits at 4K gaming in the future.</p><div><p id="dlss-4-and-multi-frame-gen"><h2><strong>DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Gen</strong></h2></p></div><p>I’ve also been testing DLSS 4 and Nvidia’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">Multi Frame Generation technology</a> with the RTX 5070 Ti. Multi Frame Gen uses the latest AI graphics models, powered by an updated transformer architecture, to generate up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, pushing the RTX 5070’s frame rates beyond what it’s normally capable of at 4K and 1440p. </p><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has been a great test title for DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Gen, demonstrating how Nvidia’s new technique can provide motion clarity improvements with higher frame rates. Without DLSS 4, <em>Cyberpunk </em>runs at an unplayable 15fps average with ultra settings and full ray tracing enabled on the RTX 5070 Ti at 4K resolution. I was able to push that all the way up to 110fps thanks to 4x Multi Frame Gen.</p><p>As I’ve argued in my previous RTX 50-series reviews, this still doesn’t feel like a real 110fps because it maintains the same input latency it has after DLSS Super Resolution is applied. Super Resolution renders the game at a lower resolution and then uses AI to upscale it — in this case, from 15fps to 33fps. Multi Frame Gen then creates the three extra frames to make the motion of gameplay look smoother, but it still feels like a sluggish 33fps, so it’s less reactive than a real 110fps when you hit a button or click to shoot.</p><p>DLSS Multi Frame Gen still makes the most sense at 1440p with the RTX 5070 Ti, simply because the base frame rates (once Super Resolution is applied) are high enough to make the input latency less of an issue.</p><p>While there still aren’t many games that support Multi Frame Gen and DLSS 4, you can force these techniques on with Nvidia’s new app. DLSS 4’s new transformer model even works on existing RTX cards, so you’ll get the benefits of improved image quality if you force DLSS 4 on in games before developers have patched them. </p><p>Like the rest of the RTX 50 series, the RTX 5070 Ti is also a capable card if you want to do video editing or run AI workloads. I found that the RTX 5070 Ti was nearly 14 percent faster than the previous RTX 4070 Ti in PugetBench’s DaVinci Resolve test and Procyon’s AI XL (FP16) test.</p><div><p id="power-draw-and-heat"><h2><strong>Power draw and heat</strong></h2></p></div><p>Nvidia recommends a 750-watt power supply for the RTX 5070 Ti, which is only 50 watts more than for the RTX 4070 Ti and 4070 Ti Super. The 300W total graphics power is just 15 watts more than the 4070 Ti.</p><p>At 4K resolution, the RTX 5070 Ti averaged 271 watts across the nine games tested — a little more than the 245-watt average draw of the RTX 4070 Ti but less than the RTX 4080’s 282W average for almost identical performance.</p><p>I only noticed the RTX 5070 Ti hit its max power draw of 300 watts during the <em>Metro Exodus</em> extreme benchmark, and it also maintained the exact same max GPU temperature (68 degrees Celsius) of the RTX 4080 in my open bench testing. It’s great to see Nvidia hasn’t massively increased power or cooling requirements here. </p><p>The RTX 5070 Ti continues the 50-series trend of modest generational improvements. At 1440p, the RTX 5070 Ti delivers a good deal more performance than the RTX 4070 Ti and 4070 Ti Super, but I was really hoping for more at 4K. That would have pushed this firmly past the RTX 4080 and 4080 Super to make 4K gaming even more affordable.</p><p>Whether the RTX 5070 Ti is a good value will come down to pricing and availability. Without a Founders Edition to put pressure on board partner pricing, I think it’s going to be very hard to find an RTX 5070 Ti at $749. Micro Center is <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?N=0&amp;NTX=mode+MatchPartial&amp;NTT=5070+ti&amp;NTK=all&amp;sortby=pricelow">already listing</a> overclocked models at $999, the same price as the RTX 5080, and only a single card is listed at $749 out of the 12 available. Nvidia insisted that the MSI card we tested has an MSRP of $749, though it was listed as $909 at Micro Center just hours before this review went live. </p><p>I suspect it will come down to availability, too. It looks like there’s a real shortage of GPUs in the market. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603863/nvidia-rtx-5090-out-of-stock-paper-launch">RTX 5090 was barely in stock</a>, and restocks are rare right now. Even the RTX 5080 is sold out at most places, and one retailer in the UK says it won’t be getting more for at least six weeks, with some models even further out. 40-series Nvidia cards and AMD’s 7900 XT series also look thin on the ground.</p><p>AMD might help with keeping pricing under control, as long as it has stock available. It’s about to enter the market with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336246/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-rdna-4-fsr-4-ces-2025">two new GPUs</a> that look like they’re going to compete directly with Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070. Nvidia has even delayed the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612650/nvidia-delays-rtx-5070-after-amd-9070">debut of its RTX 5070 until March</a>, which suggests a GPU pricing battle is about to take place at this important part of the market. </p><p>The RTX 5070 Ti is a good purchase if you can actually get one at $749, but it might be worth waiting a few weeks to see how AMD’s performance, price, and availability shape up against Nvidia’s latest GPU.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’re quite silly to try. But since you’re here, if you want to fight Lu Bu come hell or high water, here are a few tips to help you claim victory:</p><p>1: All of Lu Bu’s attacks have elaborate telegraphs. For example, it’s impossible to miss when he jumps into the air and gets ready to use his dive attack, and the timing to perfect dodge it is the same every time. Conversely, Lu Bu leaves himself open after he finishes his attacks, which gives you windows to start piling on damage before you need to watch out for his next move.</p><p>2: You might get tripped up by Lu Bu’s two unique attacks that start with him swinging his halberd in front of him. Normally, he’ll attack twice in a row, so the safest move is to dodge away to avoid the second attack. However, if he glows red, he’ll only take a single swing. Use this to your advantage.</p><p>3: Lu Bu’s most difficult attack to dodge is his bow and arrow move. Lu Bu will attack twice in a wide-reaching cone in front of him, and after a delay he’ll launch one final attack at you. Since you can stagger Lu Bu during this attack, you’ll ideally want to use a skill like Palm Strike so you don’t have to worry about dodging at all. However, if that’s not possible, using a quick special move (like Palm Strike, actually) after you dodge the first strike will interrupt the dodge roll animation, allowing you to immediately dodge the second part of the attack. From there, Lu Bu will finish the attack about 2.5 seconds later.</p><p>If you’d like a visual aid, an especially handsome writer uploaded his first clear of this fight on Hero difficulty, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/dynasty-warriors-origins-goaded-me-into-spending-an-hour-trying-to-beat-lu-bu-then-gave-me-nothing-for-winning-and-i-loved-it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/dynasty-warriors-origins-goaded-me-into-spending-an-hour-trying-to-beat-lu-bu-then-gave-me-nothing-for-winning-and-i-loved-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as seen on PC Gamer</a></span>. You can check out the video for yourself below:</p><h2 id="h5043"><a id=""></a><strong>What happens if you defeat Lu Bu?</strong></h2><p>If you defeat Lu Bu in the Assassination of Dong Zhuo mission, both Lu Bu and Cao Cao will react to your surprising strength. Lu Bu will retreat, and the entire enemy army will suffer a huge morale loss that will make the rest of the mission a total cakewalk. In other words, you take on a huge challenge at the start to make the rest of the mission easier.</p><p>This is true of Lu Bu’s second appearance in Chapter 2 during the Battle of Hulao Gate mission. Normally, Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei will hold off Lu Bu shortly after he appears. However, if you defeat Lu Bu here, Liu Bei’s party can rejoin the main battle and you won’t have to worry about how long they can fend off the beast of a man. So, again, a huge challenge so you can make the rest of the mission easier.</p><figure id="" data-id="8ac66eb86200cb93385d014610fd28b0" data-recommend-id="image://8ac66eb86200cb93385d014610fd28b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors Origins.

This will only ding on <em>this </em>mission specifically, so beating Lu Bu during the Assassination of Dong Zhuo mission <strong>will not</strong> unlock it.</p><p>That said, <strong>not only can you go back to this mission during the postgame of <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, you’ll need to beat Lu Bu here on a postgame-exclusive difficulty setting to unlock one of the strongest weapons in the game</strong>.</p><hr><p>While there aren’t compelling rewards for beating Lu Bu early on beyond the sheer satisfaction and achivement, it is a good opportunity to get some practice in against him. You <em>will </em>have to fight Lu Bu later on, and these earlier appearances have simpler movesets that you can study and learn. This will make future Lu Bu encounters go a little smoother, since you can focus on dodging the stuff you’ve memorized while you pay attention to the new tricks he has up his sleeve. You can also choose to lower the difficulty or level up if Lu Bu is giving you trouble too, so play your way and don’t stress out about missing anything important!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
