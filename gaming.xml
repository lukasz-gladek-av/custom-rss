            <p>
Roblox's record on child safety has come under fire yet again, this time in a damning new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">Bloomberg</a> report that details the scale of the issue faced by the game's developers, who are unable to keep all of its young players safe. 
</p>
<p>
Last year, Roblox itself reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation to US authorities, and responded to over 1300 requests from authorities for detail on predatory players. 
</p>
<p>
In the last six years, at least two dozen people have been arrested in the US for abusing victims met via Roblox.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg's report goes into detail on the case of DoctorRofatnik, real name Arnold Castillo, who ran a hugely-successful Sonic the Hedgehog rip-off and earned tens of thousands of dollars in revenue. 
</p>
<p>
The 22-year-old Castillo was admired by an army of children who played his Roblox game, some of whom he paid to work on the project with him. But despite reports by Roblox players of inappropriate contact between Castillo and players as young as 12, it wasn't until a 15-year-old girl he had preyed on went missing from her home that Castillo was caught by the FBI.
</p>
<p>
Castillo is now serving a 15-year sentence for grooming and sexually abusing the child.
</p>
<p>
The scale of the issue and the work needed to solve what Bloomberg calls a "pedophile problem" is enormous. Roblox filters 50,000 chat messages a second between its tens of millions of concurrent users, most of whom are under the age of 18. It employs 3000 human moderators, though relies on AI for much of the work. 
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg has spoken with Roblox moderation staff who say they feel overwhelmed, with hundreds of reports of child safety issues reportedly flooding in every day.
</p>
<p>
The report alleges that Roblox is putting growth over player safety, as the company pushes towards an eye-opening target of reaching a billion daily users (Roblox currently has around 100 million today).
</p>
<p>
Responding within the report, Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman declined to comment on specific cases, but said that safety and civility were "foundational". 
</p>
<p>
"Tens of millions of people of all ages have a safe and positive experience on Roblox every single day," Kaufman said.
</p>
<p>
Roblox has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-commits-to-ensuring-a-positive-and-safe-experience-for-its-users">repeatedly faced criticism</a> it isn't doing enough to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">ensure its young audience are safe</a> on its platform. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-studio-boss-children-making-money-on-the-platform-isnt-exploitation-its-a-gift">Roblox also responded to criticism over comments made by studio head Stefano Corazza regarding payments to children who create games on the platform</a>.

It’s also extremely obviously responding to arguments made by the anti-DEI hordes, while presenting itself as a direct communication with Japanese players alone.</p><p> Ubisoft has previously effectively shot down such bad faith responses, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007">especially with regards to the comments made by Elon Musk</a></span>, so it is peculiar to see the publisher bringing these subjects up again.</p><p>However, the main controversy that’s been raised focuses on the use of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.siliconera.com/ubisoft-apologies-for-assassins-creed-shadows-flag-art-infringement/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.siliconera.com/ubisoft-apologies-for-assassins-creed-shadows-flag-art-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a modern-day reenactment group’s logo in marketing materials</a></span>. Concept art on Ubisoft’s site showed a flag used by Sekigahara Teppo-tai, an infantryman reenactment group, but the publisher had not sought permission to use it. </p><p>At the time of the issue, the group’s “cannon chief” contacted Ubisoft, which responded by removing the piece of art from its site and apologizing. Sekigahara Teppo-tai were still not happy, given their flag will also appear in the game’s collector’s edition’s art book and it’s too late for Ubisoft to stop that. At the time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1810238727064854807&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1810238727064854807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft tweeted</a></span> (in Japanese),</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> The art in question will not be used or distributed any further beyond this date, except for being included in the artbook in the Collector’s Edition.  We deeply apologize for this matter.</p></blockquote><p> However, so primed are those who believe they are saving gaming from the evil poison of progressive pleasantness, that any legitimate fault by <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is leapt upon and blown up to the most enormous scale. It’s this that Ubisoft’s statement seems to be addressing.</p><p>Today’s statement, released in both English and Japanese, feels fairly defensive. It’s  clear that Ubisoft’s development teams went into this game with a huge desire to recreate a period of Japanese history as accurately and respectfully as they could, much as they’ve approached other historical periods, but also wanted to do something off-piste and explore the (entirely real) person Yasuke, a black samurai. (His contested samurai status is, of course, fully dismissed by those acting as if they’ve just completed their post-doc in Japanese history, rather than read a Wikipedia entry).</p><p>Yet, it’s also a video game, not a documentary series on PBS. People can’t actually dive off tall, tall towers into a hay cart and not break all their bones, for instance. Nor can they, apparently, re-enter the past by using magic DNA machines. Despite this, the studio wants to make clear it’s not attempting reality. In the statement Ubisoft says,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>...our intention has never been to present any of our <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, including <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, as factual representations of history, or historical characters.</p></blockquote><p>It’s such a “well, duh” point, but it’s one that unfortunately seems to need making in plain text amidst the ludicrous brouhaha that surrounds the game. So many bad actors are determined to win some imagined battle because one of the main characters is Black (it’s important to note the other main character is a Japanese woman).</p><p>However, the statement goes on to imply that other—entirely unmentioned—issues have been raised by Japanese players, and that the company is going to “continue our efforts” to respond to “constructive criticism.” “All game footage presented so far,” they say, “is in development and the game will keep evolving until launch.” It’s frustrating that these issues aren’t identified.</p><p>The most telling aspect of the response that directly addresses those who continue in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428">the delusion that external companies are controlling the “woke” content of games</a></span>, reads,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We also want to clarify that while we have been consulting with many people throughout the development process, they are in no way responsible for the decisions that are taken by the creative teams in the interests of gameplay and entertainment.</p></blockquote><p>It goes on to add the publisher’s wish that everyone stop harassing such groups.</p><figure id="" data-id="a634fa84035c9892bada3165c662f028" data-recommend-id="image://a634fa84035c9892bada3165c662f028" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The assassin stares across snowy Feudal Japan as the sun sets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The assassin stares across snowy Feudal Japan as the sun sets." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a634fa84035c9892bada3165c662f028" data-recommend-id="image://a634fa84035c9892bada3165c662f028" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The assassin stares across snowy Feudal Japan as the sun sets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The final part of the statement reads:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The representation of Yasuke in our game is an illustration of [creative license]. His unique and mysterious life made him an ideal candidate to tell an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> story with the setting of Feudal Japan as a backdrop.</p><p>While Yasuke is depicted as a samurai in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, we acknowledge that this is a matter of debate and discussion. We have woven carefully into our narrative and with our other lead character, the Japanese shinobi Naoe, who is equally important in the game, our dual protagonists provide players with different gameplay styles.</p></blockquote><p>Lots of people want to see themselves represented as the main character of a video game. There are rather a lot of games that feature white men in this role, and indeed a fair few with Japanese men as the lead. This one, as it happens, features a Black dude and a Japanese woman. People can choose to buy the game or not based on this knowledge. It perhaps doesn’t help when publishers give oxygen to those who fail to grasp this simple concept by issuing forelock-tugging statements that attempt to address the bad-faith arguments such people raise.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That begins with the reintroduction of the Impaler, a Terminid enemy type that burrows in the ground and unleashes large, ferocious tentacles to fight players. According to <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s design director Miklas Malmborg, the Impalers are meant to “cut off your escape route” with their large tentacles, at which point you can reroute or stay and fight. Fans actually began theorizing that the Impalers were on their way to <em>Helldivers 2 </em>months ago, after a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cie618/a_real_what_now/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cie618/a_real_what_now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post mentioned tentacles a few times</a></span> and seemed to show off at least <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-warbond-battle-pass-weapon-bad-1851467213&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-warbond-battle-pass-weapon-bad-1851467213">one new weapon specifically meant to combat them</a></span>.</p><p>There are even more enemies, too. Terminids will also be getting a new variant of the Charger that rocks a bunch of noxious spores on its carapace and is followed by a fog effect. Expect to see these things pop out of nowhere every now and then, folks. Automatons, the brutal robot horde that <em>Helldivers 2 </em>players are also combatting in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing Second Galactic War</a></span>, are also getting some upgrades. Basic foot soldiers seem to be getting a jump pack upgrade, but the biggest incoming threat on that front are new rocket-launching tanks. From afar, you can see them unleashing volleys into the sky to come back down on your head; otherwise, they’ll be firing right at you.<br></p><p>These updates to the enemy forces are being accompanied by a whole new difficulty level. While Arrowhead didn’t go into too much detail about what to expect on difficulty 10, it’s probably safe to assume that it’ll be a nightmare, especially if these new units are a part of things.</p><p>Mission variety is also being spruced up in the Escalation of Freedom update. Arrowhead most heavily teased a new mission type about the retrieval of a Terminid larva, which goes into a case on a player’s back and then must be escorted back to extraction. To make things difficult, the larva will cry, which can be heard by the bigger Terminids, who will proceed to swarm squads. Additionally, and perhaps most exciting to me personally, there will now be bigger enemy outposts to take out. Arrowhead’s CEO Johan Pilestedt referred to these things as fortresses and goddamn, do they kind of look like it.</p><p>These encampments have always been randomly generated and placed around the map, but they were hardly an issue due to their small size. Throwing the right kind of stratagem (deployable weapons and abilities like orbital strikes) into one would wipe it off the map, and eventually we even got weapons that were really excellent about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-r-36-erupter-best-gun-premium-warbond-1851419855&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-r-36-erupter-best-gun-premium-warbond-1851419855">taking out even the biggest bug nests</a></span> in a matter of seconds. These much larger outposts seem like they’ll present far more of a challenge, whether due to their increased scope, the new enemies bound to populate them, or the sheer density of foes we should likely escape, especially on the new difficulty.</p><p>The additions simply don’t stop there, either. There will be a new version of the swamp environment because Arrowhead wanted to “spook it up.” It appears to tout a darker sky with the occasional crack of lightning, and the whole thing really does look a fuckton moodier than before. There will also be new environmental hazards and reworks of existing ones, like the Acid Storm, which now applies a debuff to both players and enemies instead of just limiting visibility.</p><p>There will even be some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quality-of-life fixes in the new update</a></span> that players will likely appreciate. Social menus are being improved to make it easier to join friends, and kicking is being retooled to stop griefing players as much. Kicked players will now become the host of their own session immediately after being given the boot, and they will be able to pick up any loot from the last match.</p><p>Elsewhere, the galactic war is still in full swing, and while the studio teases <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-black-hole-meridia-major-order-1851515722&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-black-hole-meridia-major-order-1851515722">developments for the story</a></span>, including mention of Terminid migration patterns and “irregular readings” of their spores in sectors of the galaxy, it stops short of giving away anything major. In fact, the trailer ends with various members of the studio doubling down on secrecy and outright declaring that they haven’t shared everything new that’s coming. Fine, keep your secrets.</p><p>As far as I’m concerned, this major update marks the beginning of a new kind of season for <em>Helldivers 2, </em>as well as a new cadence for releases. Seeing Arrowhead begin to take its time to properly stew on some ideas and mechanics is a relief after they released new content at an alarming clip in <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s early months, and it seems to be going over well with fans. Updates began to get consolidated into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-patch-buff-stratagems-1851540317&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-patch-buff-stratagems-1851540317">more impactful patches</a></span> that didn’t break the game as much, and after an especially turbulent period following the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071">PSN login debacle</a></span>, fans appreciated the stability, as well as the ability to just keep up with their new favorite game.</p><p>I wouldn’t mind if we moved to a model where we get one of these major updates every few months over the past haphazard schedule. As impressive as it was, <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s early content releases and surprises always seemed untenable, and this new update feels a hell of a lot more healthy for everyone involved. Moreover, slapping a date on a bunch of new content has me genuinely excited to jump back in when <em>Helldivers 2 </em>receives its first major update in just two weeks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new official <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc/news/2024-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, EA revealed a full 2024 roadmap for EA Sports WRC, confirming a new expansion is coming October 2024 and other key details.</p>



<p>October’s Season Expansion will include “new locations, rally stages, high-performance vehicles, liveries and more.” The devs add they will reveal the complete details about the expansion “in the coming months.”</p>



<p>It also announced that two additional DLC packs will follow. The first will release in Winter 2024, while the second is currently slated for Spring 2025. Among other things, the DLC packs will feature new cars, rally stages, and moments.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Today’s 2024 roadmap for WRC also confirms the Season 6 Rally Pass will launch on July 30 with new liveries, suits, and helmets. </p>



<p>The new Rally Pass will be free for all players, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wrc-moments-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the moments feature</a> will return. Fans can also unlock liveries outside the WRC Rally1 class. Further, it will overhaul the rewards system, allowing players to customize drivers with complete cosmetic sets rather than unlocking them piece by piece.</p>



<p>In addition to the roadmap, today’s blog gave fans an update about WRC eSports. EA confirmed it is “still in development” and coming soon. The devs are “almost ready” to share details about official competitions.</p>



<p>EA Sports WRC first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-wrc-releases-november-3-features-car-builder-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in November 2023</a>, and is available now on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/original-signed-nes-tetris-charity-auction<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A signed copy of the original NES version of influential puzzle classic&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>is to be auctioned off to support a trans charity.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/alyssa_merc/status/1815519512944361922" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alyssa Mercante on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the cartridge has been signed by Alexey Pajitnov and Henk Rogers, the creator and original licenser of&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>respectively. It also bears the rather amusing legend "PLAY&nbsp;<em>TETRIS</em>!". As if you could stop yourself.</p>
<p>The game will be up for grabs during the Firefall Firesale Get Rich or DEI Trying Stream-a-Thon, which is being held on August 3rd to support trans charity <a href="https://translifeline.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trans Lifeline</a>, a "peer support and crisis hotline" organization that supports the trans community.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nes-tetris-signed-copy-alyssa-mercante.jpg?itok=bI2O4yvc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nes-tetris-signed-copy-alyssa-mercante.jpg?itok=f_yk79uY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Image <a href="https://x.com/alyssa_merc/status/1815519512944361922/photo/1">courtesy of Alyssa Mercante on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Pajitnov, who currently resides in the US, is known as the original designer of&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em>, which was based in part on the game of pentominoes he used to play in his childhood.</p>
<p><em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>was originally released in 1985, but perhaps its most famous port is the Game Boy version, which was released in 1989. A version for the NES followed shortly afterwards, and that's the cartridge you'd be buying if you bid at the aforementioned auction.</p>
<p>Henk Rogers, meanwhile, is the person who originally acquired the rights to&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>and subsequently negotiated with Nintendo for its inclusion on the Game Boy. Alongside Pajitnov, he'd later found The Tetris Company, an organization that remains active today and that still holds the exclusive rights to&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>in all its forms.</p>
<p>In essence, what all of this means is that these signatures are from people extremely important to the&nbsp;<em>Tetris&nbsp;</em>lineage, so this is a pretty swanky piece of history to own.</p>

On August 6th, the Escalation of Freedom update will offer players new game modes, enemies, mission objectives, and a much more punishing difficulty. In the announcement trailer, chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt and design director Niklas Malmborg went over the details, sharing that they’re planning on bringing back an old enemy from the original <em>Helldivers</em> to terrorize freedom lovers across the galaxy. </p><p>The impaler is a large enemy type designed to halt divers’ attempts to esca... err <em>tactical retreats</em>. The update will include a number of new enemy types both terminid and automaton, while remixing existing enemies to give players a new experience. Speaking of experiences, the <em>Helldivers</em> team also shared details on one of the new mission objectives: retrieve the larva. In that mission, divers will be tasked with carrying a screaming terminid larva through enemy territory to reach the extraction point. In addition to the new mission, enemy outposts have been expanded, turning them into massive, more challenging bases for players to capture. Finally, <em>Helldivers 2</em> will be getting a brand-new difficulty level, combat rating 10, that’s meant to be a significant step up from other difficulties.</p><p><em>Helldivers 2</em> has enjoyed massive success since its release in February of this year. The game did, however, suffer a couple setbacks with server instability and by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24148144/helldivers-2-steam-psn-account-link-review-bombing">requiring PC players to connect to a PSN account</a>. Arrowhead and Sony <a href="https://youtu.be/pQl2BmhSCsA?si=1kr25OfDJqF-08G7">later walked back that decision</a> after a massive outcry from players, including review bombing the game on Steam.</p><p>Despite the game’s success, player numbers on Steam have seen a bit of a dip since February. Likely, this new content refresh, which the developers say is the first step of many they have planned, will be what the game needs to bring back the masses. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To continue the mostly fun vibes of the expansion, the raid puts the Warrior of Light in an anime-style tournament in which they face off against progressively tougher and more eccentric foes. The second opponent you go up against is Honey B. Lovely. As her name might suggest, she’s a bee-themed boss wearing yellow and black from head to toe. The stage you fight her in is also full of bright neon pinks, purples, and yellows. In fact, it’s essentially a concert stage, with adoring fans of Honey B. Lovely sitting in the audience. Once the raid itself starts, it’s a frantic fight, a surprisingly upbeat pop song begins to play, this is “Bee My Honey.”</p><p><em>Final Fantasy 14</em> is no stranger to incredible music. Composer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-s-grand-score-shows-masayoshi-soken-i-1845419557&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-s-grand-score-shows-masayoshi-soken-i-1845419557">Masayoshi Soken</a></span> has created many iconic songs for expansion after expansion, ranging from operatic ballads to rock anthems and everything in between, but the pop delight of “Bee My Honey” might surpass them all thanks to its incredibly catchy lyrics. From the song’s almost <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hatsune-miku-expo-2024-hologram-led-tv-screen-concert-1851395526&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hatsune-miku-expo-2024-hologram-led-tv-screen-concert-1851395526">vocaloid</a></span> sounding intro you can tell that this song is going to be a hit. </p><p>Honey B. Lovely gives a fantastic comedic performance switching between playing a pop idol persona to adoring fans while also reminding you, her opponent, that if you don’t succumb to her “you’re as good as dead.” Even if the Warrior of Light does ultimately defeat Honey B. Lovely, the idol has won the hearts of countless new fans in the community.</p><p>What’s so impressive about “Bee My Honey” is that, as a raid song you’ll have to hear on repeat as you farm the fight for gear, it never seems to get old. Quite the opposite, it only gets better every time you listen. I’ve been listening to it on repeat the entire time I write this article, it rocks! The community seems to agree, with many sharing the sentiment that the weekly reward reset is a welcome event because it gives them a reason to go back to the Arcadion and listen to “Bee My Honey” while battling Honey B. Lovely. That’s made even funnier by the prospect that any raid drama that does arise from the Honey B. Lovely fight will always occur with this earworm in the background. </p><p>Now all we have to do is wait for the official <em>Dawntrail </em>soundtrack to release so I can put “Bee My Honey” on loop instead of restarting a YouTube video every time the song ends.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This new short story “articulates the high stakes and specific challenges that The Travelers face throughout their brave journeys across the universe.” This is the sixth short story in the prologue to give players the backstory of the game, and why things have gotten to the state they’re in.</p>

<h2 id="h-exodus-the-travelers-humanity-s-eternal-warriors">Exodus: The Travelers–Humanity’s Eternal Warriors</h2>



<p><em>The loud echo of the steel door closing on your ship, the silence that grips your heart as you depart, and with each and every star you pass, a subtle reminder that time is ticking away back home. Becoming a Traveler is no small feat.&nbsp; There is no training program to ease the transition into a lonely and isolating life that comes to surround you like a skin you cannot shed. The act of balancing the known threats looming over your homeworld versus the unknown dangers you will face on your mission is the first trial you have to conquer.&nbsp; Everything else is just table stakes as we used to say back on Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Nothing you have experienced up to this point can prepare you for the perils that await. But you know that.&nbsp; That’s why you became a Traveler. The fear of losing everything, even our very lives, is not daunting enough to deter us from our goal – ensuring the survival of our species.</em></p>



<p><em>What defines us? We believe in the value of our inheritance and the promise of our heritage. The belief that we will survive, and triumph, is in our DNA—it is the most powerful weapon we have against our Celestial adversaries. We have not lost that spirit that empowers us to confront the unthinkable and believe we can prevail. Humans share an undying faith that we are meant to be. History has taught us to stand firm in the presence of evil and to tap our inner strength—to harness our faith in humanity as the power to fuel our actions. This bond unites us in our commitment to humanity’s survival, to our salvation. Against the Celestials, it is our secret weapon. Well, one of them anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>We hardly think about the fact that surviving an Exodus is a near miracle. On the surface, we are ill-equipped to battle such insurmountable power and live to tell our tales. But what we lack in physical strength or technology, we compensate for with courage, conviction, and commitment. We leverage our hearts against their intelligence; we use our instinct to fight their intentionality and inspiration to outwit their innovation.&nbsp; Our mission is spiritual: a commitment to humanity’s salvation.&nbsp; Their goal is practical. Based on the logic that they were here millennia ahead of us and have evolved well beyond us, they do not need us—or want us.&nbsp; We are but a grim reminder of a past they have chosen to forget. But does superiority trump spirituality? Does it?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Travelers are a rare breed. Committed to challenging an enemy whose intelligence vastly outstrips our own. The Celestials, once our equals, 40,000 years ago, are now highly advanced beings with superior technology, ingenuity, and therefore, great power. To the Celestials, we are relics of a past they have discarded; useless and worse, a threat to their continued existence and dominance. They see us as a passing infestation that they must eradicate. To us, they represent what happens when you sacrifice your humanity on the altar of technology. We fight to shift the balance in our favor, hoping to create a new civilization that is wiser, more compassionate, and more connected.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Hailing from disparate homeworlds, all Travelers are bound by The First Principles: “Assume Nothing, Question Everything.” This philosophy is vital for maintaining our sanity in a universe where so many of humanity’s beliefs are challenged or discarded and deemed irrelevant. Separated by our travels and spread across distant stars, it is not often we have the chance to connect with our comrades. But we are allied – united by our shared faith in humanity.&nbsp; We know they are out there fighting with us.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Our common bond is that we can never escape the real enemy – time dilation. While we spend mere weeks on a mission, years slip away at home. Time stretches and warps, reshaping our homeworld and forcing unforeseen changes on loved ones left behind. Ties to our homes grow tenuous, our relationships are tested, and the heartache of separation from all that we hold dear is a constant companion on every mission. In the endless stretch of space, the silence is deafening, giving our nightmares free rein.&nbsp; Most heart-wrenching of all is when we return to find our homeworld pillaged or destroyed.&nbsp; The horrors that strike in our absence dull whatever successes we achieve, be they hard-won relics, tech, or insights. Though outwardly we appear unchanged, our souls carry indelible scars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>The life of a Traveler is a heroic pursuit of survival and spirituality fueled by skill and grit (something no longer present in our technologically advanced descendants). It’s less about braving the unknown and more about the defiance that comes from a bold heart and a resolute spirit. We are humanity’s eternal warriors, traversing time and space to face the unexpected and capture the unimaginable. We are the explorers, treasure hunters, archaeologists, scientists, and engineers… the pathfinders who are always pushing the barriers and battling the obstacles that block the way to a better future. We are also mothers and fathers. Sons and daughters. Friends and lovers.&nbsp; We don’t know any better than to overcome.&nbsp; That is our heritage… the same legacy that follows us from Earth, where we escaped extinction. We did not come this far to go quietly.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>For each of us, every Exodus mission is a leap into the abyss —the only thing we can be sure of is that days for us are decades back home. Time dilation is a blessing and a curse. Every minute we lose with our loved ones, every tear we shed upon our return is a part of our story and a reminder of our humanity.&nbsp; Every decision is made in service to ending the sacrifices we make to time. We are the frontline fighters in humanity’s final battle: survival vs. extinction. We are humanity’s last hope. When you think back on our history as a species, we have survived political upheavals, cultural revolutions, and wars.&nbsp; Who knows… perhaps one day we will have our day of independence, a day to celebrate and honor the timeless sacrifices we Travelers make for humanity’s future.</em></p>



<p><em>And that, my child, is what it means to be a Traveler. We exist outside of time; it is the price we pay. One day, I hope our story will be etched ‘into the history books’ of Centauri.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/at-least-it-will-be-satisfying-to-wreck-fortnites-cybertruck<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The internet is full of things to cheer you up, or at least distract you, when you’re sad. One of my go-to videos is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCQn_FkFElI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Moonlight</em> winning Best Picture</a> at the Oscars in 2017. Another is the video of the Cybertruck reveal, where Elon Musk<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udxR5rBq_Vg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> dares a guy to break the monstrosity’s armored windows</a>, but when the guy throws a ball at the car the glass cracks. It’s a good video because Musk is terrible, and his truck is terrible, so it’s satisfying to watch them both be humiliated on a public stage. If you want to experience some of that humiliation in virtual form, the Cybertruck is in <em>Fortnite</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Cybertruck is a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/unlock-the-cybertruck-in-fortnite-by-goin-on-a-summer-road-trip-with-the-squad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quest reward</a>, where getting a certain amount of XP in different game modes earns progress toward unlocking the car and some variations. (If you’re not a <em>Fortnite</em> player, it’s worth noting that the Cybertruck isn’t a discrete vehicle, but rather a cosmetic for in-game SUVs.) The car can be earned for free, but will also be on sale in <em>Fortnite</em>’s item shop in August. The quest can also be progressed in Epic-owned <em>Rocket League</em>, which has its own terrible version of the truck.</p><p>People have been rightly <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1815386568263110908/quotes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mocking</a> this since its reveal on Monday, when the <em>Fortnite</em> Twitter account posted a <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1815386568263110908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a> featuring the Cybertruck in a car-vs-car game of tug-of-war, a reference to a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1198751258384818176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla video</a> showing a Cybertruck against a Ford about which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elon-musks-tesla-cybertruck-will-be-available-to-buy-in-fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer </a>writes that “Tesla's original video shows the Cybertruck winning, though Ford said Tesla cheated and asked for a rematch.” The most common jabs have been that you shouldn’t be able to drive the <em>Fortnite</em> Cybertruck in water or up hills, and several very funny <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1e9q3ya/gameplay_footage_of_the_upcoming_cybertruck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fakeouts</a> of supposed in-game footage of the truck that are just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1e9xq3z/howd_they_get_the_tesla_cybertruck_early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pictures of dumpsters</a>. Players have been saying that anyone sporting the vehicle in-game should be driven from the match on site; I woke up early this morning curious to see this happening, but since the truck can’t be unlocked yet, we’ll have to wait a bit to see if players stay true to their vow.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3OKTfZS5qE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This reaction reflects feelings about the real-life Cybertruck, which is a universal <a href="https://jalopnik.com/this-is-how-the-tesla-cybertruck-became-a-culture-war-o-1851601057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laughingstock</a>: a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/cars/tesla-recalling-cybertruck/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">constantly-recalled</a>, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-rusting-complaints-from-owners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blemish-prone</a>, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/tech/the-tesla-cybertrucks-fail-safe-for-a-stuck-charge-cable-can-actually-break-the-plug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">janky</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cybertrucks-stiff-structure-sharp-design-raise-safety-concerns-experts-2023-12-08/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dangerous</a> machine that highlights Musk’s bad taste and worse decision-making. I recently saw my first Cybertruck in the wild while biking through Brooklyn a few weeks ago, and I was weirded out by how it looked both too big and too small, a disturbing hunk of angles that calls to mind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHGczDHTDpo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Homer’s disastrous car design</a> from <em>The Simpsons</em> except in no way funny.&nbsp;</p><p>The bad car is the brainchild of a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/12/tech/spacex-elon-musk-former-employees-lawsuit/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad</a> man, who has driven Twitter into the ground and is currently being a weirdo about <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184097/trump-elon-musk-causing-kamala-harris-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kamala Harris running for President</a> and <a href="https://x.com/GBBranstetter/status/1815518427093557614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying some appalling shit about his trans kid</a>. While it’s gross to see <em>Fortnite</em> get in bed with this guy, even if you could argue it’s at a remove, it’s also not totally surprising; Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has the kind of free speech, “no politics” <a href="https://kotaku.com/epic-boss-confusing-comments-about-games-and-politics-d-1841706060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politics</a> that are prone to jumping the track. Part of me worries that, since kids are going to see the <em>Fortnite</em> Cybertruck, this is some effort to launder the car’s reputation–and, by extension, Musk’s reputation–to a younger generation, though I also have zero faith that the real-life car will still be on the road by the time your average <em>Fortnite</em> player is old enough to drive.</p><p>When I booted up <em>Fortnite</em> this morning to look for the truck, I was prominently greeted with a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/disneys-pirates-of-the-caribbean-docks-into-fortnite-br" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> event</a> replete with a Jack Sparrow character. Players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1dndgg5/thoughts_on_jack_sparrow_not_really_looking_like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">torn</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeppDelusion/comments/1e3abiq/it_boggles_my_mind_that_in_a_few_days_fortnite_is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether</a> the skin actually resembles <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23043519/johnny-depp-amber-heard-defamation-trial-fairfax-county-domestic-abuse-violence-me-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Johnny Depp</a>, and this feels like an obvious outcropping of Epic’s recent <a href="https://aftermath.site/disney-epic-fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deal with Disney</a> rather than anything more nefarious, but the two events combined caused me to heave a deep sigh. We have enough <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dr-disrespect-allegations-journalists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad men</a> in and around games to not need to tap in guys from other fields to make things worse, and it feels like one more symptom of <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-cant-go-home-again" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how different <em>Fortnite</em> is </a>from what it started as. Of course it was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3bkgj/fortnite-fortnight-black-appropriation-dance-emote" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never</a> some happy wonderland, but we’re likely to see more and more questionable tie-ins as the game races after the <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-donald-mustard-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">metaverse</a> ambitions that have already cost so many people their <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/layoffs-at-epic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jobs</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Because now I’ve made myself depressed, it will be fun to see who brings the shame of the Cybertruck on themselves and what happens in response, so at least we have that to look forward to. I will take a particular delight in wrecking one of Musk’s trucks while kitted out like a <a href="https://aftermath.site/lego-fortnite-cat-enters-his-queer-elder-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trans guy cat</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-helldivers-2-difficulty-level-and-more-arriving-in-august.934593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-escalation-of-freedom-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Arrowhead Game Studios have announced a major new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update, and it's introducing a new difficulty level, new enemy types, and much more.</p>
<p>The Escalation of Freedom update lands on August 6th, and unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-helldivers-2-update-stratagem-changes">some</a> of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-update-nerfs-burn-damage">game's</a> previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-update-dev-datamine-comments">patches</a>, this one's pretty big, so it should give you a good reason to head back to the front if you're one of those filthy deserters that has abandoned the cause of Super Earth.</p>
<p>First up, an entirely new tenth difficulty level has been added, and it'll throw more enemies at you than you've ever faced before. Arrowhead says the jump from level nine to level ten is supposed to feel significant, so you should notice the difference.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-difficulty-escalation-of-freedom-impaler.jpg?itok=_MXvnSgN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-difficulty-escalation-of-freedom-impaler.jpg?itok=yi-quQ_b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Prepare to face new enemies in the next&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update.</figcaption></figure><p>You're also getting new enemies to fight. On the Terminid side, you can look forward to the introduction of the Impaler, a returning enemy from&nbsp;<em>Helldivers</em>. Its massive tentacles sprout up from the ground and cut off potential escape routes.</p>
<p>A new variant of the Charger, the Spore Charger, is constantly surrounded by visibility-lowering fog, and a new Brute Commander variant will be deadlier and more "brutal" (ahem) than you're used to, as well as spawning different kinds of bug allies.</p>
<p>The Automatons, meanwhile, are getting access to an honest-to-god artillery tank, which will fire directly at you if you're close and fire into the air to scupper you and your teammates if you're distant. Frankly, this one sounds absolutely terrifying.</p>

<p>New, larger types of outposts are being introduced, and while they'll be a huge challenge to take down, Arrowhead is promising "great rewards" if you manage to do so.</p>
<p>There will also be new map variants and objectives for you to take on, including a larva retrieval mission, and Arrowhead is teasing a new direction for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s story involving ramped-up Automaton production and changing Terminid migration patterns.</p>
<p>This will be&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s first significant update since chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo">stepped down as CEO</a>, and it'll also be the first since the notorious <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">PlayStation Network controversy</a>. Hopefully, the update helps Arrowhead put that unpleasantness behind it and focus on the game.</p>

Big players like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">EA</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/phil-spencer-xbox-layoffs-will-ensure-company-has-enough-of-the-right-people-to-succeed">Microsoft</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-gutted-playstation-studios-to-keep-room-for-future-growth-">Sony</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have cut workforces in the United States in the face of high operating costs. Startups like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wyrdsong-dev-something-wicked-reportedly-lays-off-majority-of-staff">Something Wicked Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rpg-studio-thought-pennies-appears-to-lay-off-employees">Thought Pennies</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have suddenly laid off workers as funding dried up. All of these cuts were accompanied by messages from leadership about the "tough economic situation" that caused operational costs to vastly exceed incoming revenue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But while we've reported on each of these brutal layoffs, we've still filed stories about new studios coming online. Some, like Jake Solomon's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/firaxis-vet-jake-solomon-unveils-new-studio-working-on-a-life-sim-game">Midsummer Studios</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, are still in the United States, but more and more are popping up in developing regions with lower costs of living like Poland, the Czech Republic, the Philippines, and beyond. As </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lower-cost-regions-are-key-to-the-industrys-rebuilding-opinion">our peers at Gamesindustry.biz noted</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, these regions are going to be a key part of the future of game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In isolation, that's great. Game development should be a global community, and for too long such regions have only been able to participate by offering low-cost contracting or co-development work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But the trend raises ominous questions: can American developers expect to find employment if they're told they're "too expensive" over and over again? Are these countries actually getting a fair deal if investors are expecting them to do the same amount of work as seasoned studios for a fraction of the cost? What can be done to ensure the art and business of game development can be sustainable for more and more workers?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These were questions we posed to industry leaders at companies of all sizes over the last few months. We got a number of conflicting answers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some industry veterans mused about how pandemic-era salary spikes drove up development costs as cash-rich companies competed for talent. Some offered conflicting opinions on whether or not remote work increased or decreased costs in that same period.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But the light of all these opinions cast a shadow on a deeper structural flaw: that the game industry at large has so few financial tools to support iteration and "failure"...and in America, where every dollar you don't earn through revenue has to go back to an investor, the risks studios face have gotten particularly grim.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What makes American game development so uniquely expensive?">What makes American game development so uniquely expensive?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ask anyone "why is the game industry laying off so many workers?" and you'll get a variation on this answer: many game studios and investors overprojected sales and player growth in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and expanded way too quickly. They did this right as inflation ballooned around the globe, and central banks like the United States Federal Reserve increased interest rates, making the cost of borrowing money more expensive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That increased debt hit game companies </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>hard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "The game industry is a hit-driven business, but you can't predict hits," said independent director, adviser, and "fixer" Scott Hartsman, a veteran of Wargaming and Sony Interactive Entertainment. That means many game companies require "sales spikes" to keep revenue coming in, and must seek publisher or investing resources to help keep cash flow moving in between major releases.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That cash flow is essential because a studio's operational costs remain fixed (or even increase) while revenue fluctuates up and down. Like most software companies, game development operating costs are derived almost entirely from salaries. And in the United States, there are dozens of factors that drive salaries upward.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In countries like Poland, the cost of living means salaries are relatively lower and the cost of employing workers isn't as high. The many Polish studios popping up staffed with former CD Projekt and 11-bit Studios studios workers can make investor and publisher cash run longer while they work to release new games or updates to existing games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In late 2023 the average monthly gross salary of Polish workers is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://stat.gov.pl/en/topics/labour-market/working-employed-wages-and-salaries-cost-of-labour/average-paid-employment-and-average-gross-wages-and-salaries-in-enterprise-sector-in-january-2024,3,154.html">almost 8,000 pln</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (about $2,000) or about $24,000 per year. In the United States the monthly average salary was about $4,941 per month, coming in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://data.bls.gov/cew/apps/table_maker/v4/table_maker.htm#type=0&amp;year=2023&amp;qtr=2&amp;own=0&amp;ind=10&amp;supp=0">at about $59,300 per year</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at the same time period. In other words, investors and employers can pay for more Polish workers than American ones with the same amount of cash.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's before you calculate the "cost of employment"—how much each employee actually costs a company when you factor in benefits and payroll taxes. American companies have to pay for private healthcare and 401k plans to attract workers. Some research indicates those healthcare costs </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/health-costs-how-the-us-compares-with-other-countries">may be inflated,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> because private healthcare costs more in America than government-run healthcare in other countries.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The cost of employment can still run high in other countries, where public healthcare is subsidized through corporate taxes. But many of those nations </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/">spend far less on healthcare overall.</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also worth considering what drags game development salaries upward in the first place. In the United States, employees in the field are often concentrated in especially high cost-of-living areas like Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Even in lower-profile software development hubs like Austin, and Raleigh, increasing housing costs are shrinking how far a software development salary can go.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These areas have seen the cost-of-living go up thanks in part to increased housing costs, which have shot upwards through supply-and-demand driven by potent tech salaries and a shortage of new housing. Many leaders we spoke with, like Outerloop Games CEO Chandana Ekanayake, acknowledged the challenge of setting engineering salaries at rates that are competitive with giants like Microsoft and Amazon.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explained that smaller studios like his have to offer additional unique benefits to encourage programmers to take a lower paycheck. Outerloop has one unique benefit—it's run by a close-knit team making creatively interesting games like the upcoming title </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://outerloopgames.com/dosa">Project Dosa</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is probably a better work environment than </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html">what's been reported at many Amazon offices</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p>Image via Outerloop Games/Outersloth.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But if your mid-sized game studio making a mainstream live service game doesn't have a great workplace—securing that general talent could be harder.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those companies can command such high salaries thanks to their global reach and enormous war chests of cash and capital. But if you're looking at the bigger picture of the American economy, consider this: Microsoft isn't just competing with game developers when it's considering how much to pay its engineers, it's competing with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>every </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">software company in every city it operates in. Software engineers with transferrable skills can hop to highly profitable jobs in other fields like aerospace, military contracting, financial software, credit checking companies, and beyond.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Engineers in developing regions have some transferrable opportunities—but not as lucrative as those in the United States.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's another wrinkle raised by Execution Labs co-founder Jason Della Rocca: America's employment base for game developers is saturated with experienced employees—some who've been at it for over 40 years. These workers are more likely to demand (well-deserved!) higher salaries to pay for their mortgages and families.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In developing regions, the workforce is still younger as game development scenes have taken more time to get up and running.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both parts of the world must grapple with the fact that for some fields like art and game design, the pool of available jobs is vastly smaller than the number of aspiring employees.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Remote work has a complex impact on game development costs">Remote work has a complex impact on game development costs</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The role of remote work also played a fascinating dynamic in this conversation. Some, like Hartsman, said it's a factor that can drive down development costs. He complained about having to pay for office space in his days at Sony and said he'd gladly trade paying rent in Seattle for a handful of engineers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Others, like Hi-Rez Studios CEO Stewart Chisam, noted that the COVID-19-driven remote work boom raised costs for their various subsidiary game studios. "It made the hiring market national," he said. "All these big companies being based in high-wage markets...that could have brought [salaries] down to a medium, but instead it brought it all the way back up."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He and Valued Cultures co-founder Daryl Ogden—a former leadership coach at companies like Microsoft—expressed doubts that remote work, as many developers believe, improved their workplace efficiency. Chisam said Hi-Rez has studied the impact of remote work on the company, and that they found it led to some increased inefficiency. Ogden said he worries that an all-remote team can't collaborate as quickly as one that can quickly huddle together and speak in-person.</span></p><p>Image via Evil Mojo Games/Hi-Rez Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, American companies looking to keep staffs of anywhere from 20-50 people (or even more) struggle under the weight of salaries. Every solution requires managing costs and increasing revenue to keep people paid.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a depressing list of issues—if mostly because it feels so disconnected from the labor of game development. Talented people across the industry know how to make good games and know how to market games to players. But the people signing their paychecks are just as—if not more—concerned with the challenges above than making and selling good products.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some executives like Saber Interactive CEO Matt Karch have observed that their peers stubbornly refuse to adapt and will double down on strategies that were more viable when costs and interest rates were far lower.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I still hear from some major players...'oh, we don't want to development unless it's in California,' Karch said, adding that said comments came from "major executives and key publishers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To change this dynamic, companies may need to begin thinking about radically new ways to operate—and in some cases, funding for "failure" as much as they do success.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why studios, investors, and publishers need to &quot;fund for failure&quot;">Why studios, investors, and publishers need to "fund for failure"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers and business veterans we spoke with offered a variety of solutions, but it was Mobius Games producer Jackie Kreitzberg who spotlighted the most consistent pain point: developers need funds and resources to navigate the prototyping phase in game development—especially prototyping that "fails."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She explained that for the last year-and-a-half, Mobius has been prototyping its next game while shipping patches for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outer Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Many of those prototypes were fun, but weren't ready for production, either because they didn't resonate with some parties or because the developers who engineered them realized they weren't the right one to lead the development process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Funding is great, it needs to be funding for failure," she said. "Because that is the problem that we faced, is that these prototypes were 'failures.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She said that Mobius' funding partners (including Annapurna Interactive, the publisher of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outer Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) were supportive in this period, but also explained they weren't interested in some prototypes. Mobius was lucky, because its partners were patient. But Krietzberg knows other developers aren't in that position. "Funding sources almost always want to see success come out of [the process]," she said.</span></p><p>Image via Mobius Digital/Annapurna Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kreitzberg's analysis makes sense. Game development is a strange beast in terms of software design. It's more iterative and product-led than general commercial software—but the time needed for iteration can drastically drive up costs. With the hit-driven sales strategy many companies rely on, developers need time between releases to prototype and iterate for extended periods—but prototyping and iterating don't bring in revenue, creating the pressure to chase publisher or investor money.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Harebrained Schemes executive producer Mike McCain and creative director Chris Rodgers also zeroed in on this time period as they explained how the company is recovering from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/harebrained-schemes-splits-off-from-paradox-will-be-independent-again-in-2024">its exit from Paradox Interactive in 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. McCain said the team is worried less about the length of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/WeBeHarebrained/status/1813630437539152070">their next game's</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> development cycle, and more focused on how to validate ideas, get feedback, and ship solutions as early as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All of the solutions the industry needs to become more sustainable orbit around this phase almost wholly unique to game development—though some of the ideas are automatically contradictory. Hartsman said some studios need to explore the idea of "elastic hiring"—being able to efficiently onboard and offboard contract workers at key phases in development. Meanwhile Ekanayake and Aggro Crab founder Nick Kaman frowned on the idea of increasing and then decreasing headcount with every project, noting that keeping closely-knit teams with experience working together is faster than having to train new hires.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you have to shut down operations in between every game, then I don't think that's a game studio. I think that's just a series of projects," Kaman said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All studios, Ogden mused, could benefit from a "shipping culture" like the kind he observed in Obsidian Entertainment during his time consulting with Microsoft. The famed role playing game studio spent the last few years working on four games: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because the company has prioritized regular updates for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after a short development cycle, it's been bringing in revenue while its larger titles simmer in the pot. Triple-A and indie game studios, he said, need to "think about making smaller, better games, less expensive games, and increase the cadence of release."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think about how to lower risk by making thoughtful decisions about doing smaller-ambition games that are still incredibly fun and can still lead to franchises...not making essentially existential bets on a single game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, some will see the funding of developers in lower-cost-of-living regions as an opportunity to take advantage of. Execution Labs co-founder Jason Della Rocca said American developers seeking publisher or investor money should look for overseas partners who can be part of the game development team. Doing so would reduce the costs of studio operations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that strategy doesn't help workers here in the United States (especially those in our most expensive cities). So that raises the question: if the United States is struggling to compete with global markets where labor is cheaper, shouldn't the government help out in some form?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Can government funding help American developers?">Can government funding help American developers?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Almost everyone we asked about government funding programs for game developers—like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/eu-raises-7-5-million-in-funding-for-2024-creative-european-program">those in the EU</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/screen-australia-reshapes-funding-programs-to-provide-wider-support-to-indies">Australia</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and beyond—sighed with exasperation at the topic. The answers were simple enough: yes, everyone would like better subsidies. No, they don't expect they'll come.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to American game developers and government incentives in the United States, developers' options are limited. Chisam praised the state of Georgia's tax credits for entertainment production, and Ekanayake noted that similar refunds had been established in states like Louisiana </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/new-colorado-tax-credit-includes-boon-for-game-developers">and Colorado</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for developers to take advantage of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But those credits aren't large, and federal benefits like a research &amp; development tax credit that Outerloop games benefitted from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-sets-forth-required-information-for-a-valid-research-credit-claim-for-refund">can change</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at the whim of legislators or regulators. Lobbying those organizations for benefits is also a tall order given the United States' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/arts/nea-neh-endowments-trump.html">general hostility to funding the arts</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and skepticism that the games industry needs assistance when giants like Activision Blizzard, Take-Two, and Electronic Arts are all headquartered here.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But game developers shouldn't just throw their arms up and go home. There are strong reasons to lobby local and state legislators to do more for game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chisam and Della Rocca both have experience speaking to governments about the benefits of boosting game development. Della Rocca said he's spent a lot of time in recent months consulting with various international government representatives about the advantages of funding game development communities. He said while tax credits are generally the solution he's asked about, they're not the first option states should reach for.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In regions where game development hubs aren't established, tax credits won't do much, said Della Rocca. "Governments are usually disappointed, because they thought all they had to do was, write some legislation for taxes, and instead I go 'no, you have to have the talent pipeline.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You have to work at the schools to [educate] programmers and artists. You have to have a prototype fund, so new projects get started, and success starts to come in," he continued. After time passes and local indie devs and small companies are successful, larger companies like Ubisoft will be more attracted by a tax incentive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That could still be a tough sell to any government. But Della Rocca says he's won representatives over with this argument: game development salaries are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>really</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> good for local economies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Think about it like this: because game development budgets are tied to the cost of labor, little is spent on equipment and manufacturing. That means money flows into the company and into the pockets of employees, driving taxes on wages. Then employees spend that money locally on bars, restaurants, concert halls, housing, etc. "Wages recycle into the economy very quickly, right?," Della Rocca said. "You get paid every two weeks every month. You pay your mortgage, you buy your groceries, you pay your gas. Your kids go to school. It's not like the revenue comes in and sits in a vault."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This argument plays well in other nations where game development is a "net export" business, like Brazil, Poland, or Malaysia. Selling to countries like the United States brings higher-value foreign currencies into the local economy for a relatively low ecological footprint. Nothing needs to be built, no forests need to be cleared—developers just need resources to prototype and get games out the door.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Supporting local game initiatives also helps combat "brain drain," the phenomenon of college-educated workers decamping for regions where they can earn higher wages. And when studios become successful—and particularly if their intellectual property becomes successful—they attract fresh talent to the region.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chisam echoed some of these sentiments based on his conversations with the Georgia state legislature and its ongoing tax credits for entertainment production. He said he's told legislators that backing game development is a better bet for the state than film and television production, because film and TV production is inherently a stop-and-start business, with talent entering and exiting the state when projects are shooting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think putting that money into the gaming industry really makes sense, because that tends to be more permanent jobs in the city versus a lot of the television and movie type businesses," he said. "Here we're creating permanent jobs, high quality jobs, and that has a pretty good impact on the economy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He said he's surprised more studios haven't set up offices in Georgia, especially with plenty of local talent coming out of universities like the Savannah College of Art and Design. But that lack of interest may speak to what Della Rocca described—tax credits benefit companies already established in the areas, and don't automatically convince companies to pick up shop and move.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The American game industry can be more sustainable">The American game industry can be more sustainable</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game industry crisis has left plenty of industry leaders we've spoken with pessimistic about how things can recover. To hear some talk about it, the glory days are done, large development is unsustainable, it's either tiny teams or enormous companies paving the way forward.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That may be true. But it doesn't have to be. Inside studios and in the halls of state governments, there are tools to build better safety nets that can help studios make it from project to project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Investors only seeking to maximize gains are going to stick with the higher returns they can get out of lower-cost-of-living areas. But if developers do their best to build studios without them—they'll have far more bargaining power when they come back wanting their own slice of the pie. That's part of the attitude driving McCain and Rodgers' efforts at Harebrained Schemes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to be there, these people with money say 'oh, we do need fresh content,'" he said. "We have to be adaptive, always reassess how we're making things and look for ways that we can stay active with the way things are now.

<p>As the highly anticipated release date for Deadpool &amp; Wolverine approaches, leaks have started popping up revealing information about collaborations with several games. We have received details about the superhero duo arriving in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-is-seemingly-gearing-up-for-a-deadpool-and-wolverine-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a>. Deadpool &amp; Wolverine might also be gracing the Fortnite item shop. Learn more information below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deadpool and Wolverine are not new to Fortnite, with both characters receiving a diverse range of skin variants in the popular battle royale title. Excitingly, according to reliable Fortnite leaks source <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iFireMonkey</a>, players will be able to add to their collection of Deadpool and Wolverine skins with the upcoming movie release.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Today, the Fortnite leaker unveiled a set of images labelled ‘Deadpool &amp; Wolverine Bundle’. These images showcase unique skin variants of Deadpool and Wolverine, each with a distinct, comic-like art style. This is a departure from their earlier skins, which were more in line with the game’s art style.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deadpool’s variants include one with his mask off, one with his mask on, and a third with an arrow piercing his head. These variants come with new cosmetic accessories, such as a jam track, weapon skins, a glider, back bling, and his iconic Katanas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, Wolverine only has two variants, mask on and mask off, wearing the iconic Blue and yellow costume. Logan will also have weapon skins, a jam track, a new glider, his claws as a pickaxe and a backing. The pricing of the Fortnite Deadpool &amp; Wolverine bundle hasn’t been revealed yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Fortnite, their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fall-guys-collaboration-arrives-in-uefn-following-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaboration with Fall Guys</a> arrived today in UEFN.

<p>For the first time in three generations, Nvidia could be set to bring back its TITAN graphics cards with the new GeForce RTX 50 series.</p>



<p>According to known leaker <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1815688314177159602" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">kopite7kimi on Twitter</a>, a TITAN card with new Blackwell architecture is in the works from Nvidia. </p>



<p>“The big thing exists,” they said in reply to a question about the card.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As far as specs go, one report from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBNPVcRYTyw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RedGamingTech</a> claims that the new TITAN is 63% faster than the RTX 4090. If other reports on the cards are to be believed, that would put it, roughly, 10% or so faster than the upcoming RTX 5090.</p>







<p>It’s worth noting that Nvidia had plans for TITAN models for both the RTX 30 and RTX 40 series of cards. However, neither ultimately saw the light of day. So, while the card can exist and be planned, it actually releasing it a completely other story. </p>



<p>The last TITAN graphics card was the released back in 2018 and cost $2499. With the pricing market being what it is now, it’s hard to put a guess on what a new TITAN card would cost in 2025. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-escalation-of-freedom-update-teases-arrowheads-biggest-content-drop-yet<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Helldivers 2 isn’t out of the fight yet, as Arrowhead Games Studios has announced that its latest update, Escalation of Freedom, will be its biggest yet.</p><p>The studio unveiled the latest addition to its post-launch rollout in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation.Blog post.</a> It’s an update that’s meant to give Super Earth defenders more variety, including new missions, objectives, enemies, planets, and even a new difficulty mode. While we wait for launch on August 6, you can see how Arrowhead plans to move into the next phase of Helldivers 2 with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQl2BmhSCsA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Escalation of Freedom update trailer</u></a> below.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Do you have what it takes, Helldiver? The Escalation of Freedom Major Update begins on August 6, featuring:</p><p>• Difficulty Level 10<br>• New mission objectives<br>• Bigger enemy outposts<br>• New Bugs and Bots<br>• New environmental hazards</p><p>Full briefing: <a href="https://t.co/GTTi0R4tc3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/GTTi0R4tc3</a> <a href="https://t.co/h8gEewiu5G" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/h8gEewiu5G</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1815733606251463104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>“Our community continues to show us how strong we all are when united against the mindless Automatons and the scourge of the Terminid,” Arrowhead social media and community manager Katherine Baskin said in the blog post. “As we stand here, on the eve of the Escalation of Freedom, we reflect on the 6 months since launch. We could never have predicted how far this game would go and how many Citizens would answer Super Earth’s call to arms!”</p><p>Arrowhead’s biggest fundamental change to the Helldivers 2 formula is its new, harder game mode: Combat Rating 10: Super Helldive. That’s right – if you thought your standard Helldive was too much, Super Helldive is here to offer an entirely new level of challenge. Arrowhead calls the mode its “most challenging, most relentless” difficulty mode, and of course, it means better rewards for those who are able to successfully extract at the end of the mission.</p><p>With Super Helldive comes added variety to missions, as well as larger Terminid and Automaton outposts that yield new Super Sample rewards. Arrowhead notes that new missions and objectives will be playable on other difficulty modes, too. What seems to be Escalation of Freedom’s flashiest new addition, however, is the return of its earth-kraken enemy, the Impaler. Originally seen in the first Helldivers, this tentacled creature is described as “big, imposing, and destructive,” requiring players to focus their fire until it’s been terminated.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Helldivers 2 Escalation of Freedom Update Gallery</h3></div></output><p>Along with the Impaler come new Terminid enemies the Spore Charger, a sneakier version of your standard Charger, and the Alpha Commander, a larger Brood Commander that calls other bugs for backup when in a pinch. The formidable Automatons have called for reinforcements, too, with players now needing to be on the lookout for something called a Rocket Tank. Arrowhead also teases some other “bot surprises” to keep an eye out for but doesn’t give specifics. Helldivers 2 players can also look forward to a new, updated swamp biome, which features denser layers of fog and more places for enemies to hide.</p><p>As Arrowhead moves to drop Escalation of Freedom into the world of Helldivers 2, it let players know that it is working to mitigate the consequences of grief kicking. With the update launch next month, players will find that, after being kicked, they will spawn into a new session as host with all of the squad’s loot from the session they just left. The Helldivers doing the kicking will also be notified that their loot is unchanged when the player is removed.</p><p>“With these changes, all players have the opportunity to leave with all loot collected on mission, with not one Helldiver losing out,” Baskin continues. “We’re committed to making changes that will improve the player experience and encourage healthy, cooperative gameplay. Along with this, we’re also releasing other quality of life upgrades with Escalation of Freedom, including major fixes to the social menu to make diving with your friends easier.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Helldivers 2 launched February 8, 2024, and has become one of PlayStation’s biggest success stories in recent memory. The squad-based extraction shooter has been praised for its world-building, chaotic gameplay, and team-based objectives, and with the Escalation of Freedom update, it’s clear Arrowhead has plenty more in store. We loved the sequel upon its release, giving it a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review"><u>our review</u></a>. At the time, we said, “Helldivers 2's combat feels fantastic, its missions stay fresh and interesting, and its smart progression system doesn’t nickel and dime you.”</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98adaption-shooter%E2%80%99-ascendant-gets-an-open-beta-weekend-in-august.934545/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/adaption-shooter-ascendant-gets-an-open-beta-weekend/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>PlayFusion has announced an open beta weekend for their upcoming ‘Adaption Shooter’ Ascendant. The game will be free for all and sundry to play at the start of August. The Ascendant open beta weekend will take place from 3rd to 4th August on PC via Steam or <a href="https://ascendant.com/beta/web">Ascendant.com</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="ASCENDANT | OPEN BETA ANNOUNCEMENT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/meen88rAxZg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The specific dates and times for the Ascendant open beta are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>STARTS: </strong>Saturday 3rd August: <strong>10am ET</strong> (USA) / 3pm BST (UK) / 4pm CET&nbsp;(EU)<br>
<strong>ENDS: </strong>Sunday 4th Aug: <strong>11.59pm midnight ET</strong>&nbsp;(USA)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you might fairly be asking, what is an adaption shooter? It’s a new term that developer PlayFusion has cooked up to explain their fresh take on the extraction shooter style, emphasising the changeable game map that players in which players will battle for supremacy as they fight to capture Biocores.</p>
<p>This is a 3v3v3v3 shooter, with teams heading into each match with the goal of capturing at least one of three Biocores that will be made available over the course of the match. Through a match, they’ll be able to earn cash to spend on weapon and shield upgrades, as well as make use of map elements that are different each time you play. Some rounds will open up a rocket barrage tower, others will let you capture and use a Deathbringer tank, or open up the underground tunnels, and more. You’ll have to adapt to what each match offers you, and to what the other teams are trying to pull off themselves.</p>

<p>Coming from a team founded by former Jagex developer, PlayFusion announced&nbsp;Ascendant back in January as Ascendant Infinity, but has now trimmed off the fat from the title – the marketing does list it as Ascendant.com, just to get you straight to the game’s website.</p>
<p>We’ve been hands on with the game twice now, and in today’s preview, I said, “While the somewhat cheesy 80s aesthetic is the hook, there’s plenty going on with Ascendant that helps differentiate it from other extraction shooters, from how the map and modifiers are remixed for each match, to the social space that you can mess around in between games.”</p>

		<p>What if culture just stopped in the 1980s? In the wake of a civilisation-ending environmental cataclysm that forced humanity to quite literally freeze itself in time until the planet could (hopefully) recover, the world of Ascendant (formerly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/14/ascendant-infinity-preview-adapt-and-thrive-in-this-80s-fuelled-online-shooter/">Ascendant Infinity</a>) is stuck in the 80s, with all the big hair, lycra, and music very much intact. The difference is that, outside of protective shelter of a few Earthtrees, it’s now a hellscape out there with mutated monsters, and scarce resources that your tree’s inhabitants need to fight over using all the Biopunk tech they have to hand.</p>
<p>With Ascendant heading into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/adaption-shooter-ascendant-gets-an-open-beta-weekend/">an open beta weekend in early August</a>, we’ve been hands on once again to check it out.</p>
<p><iframe title="ASCENDANT | OPEN BETA ANNOUNCEMENT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/meen88rAxZg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If we want to be brutally honest, the games industry is rarely about the next big thing. The battle royale genre is a case in point: after PUBG and Fortnite, the only real success story has been Apex Legends, despite probably hundreds of attempts. Of course, there does always need to be that spark, that game that popularises a new idea, and Ascendant has the potential to pull that off, even if it’s building off another established formula.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, Ascendant is an extraction shooter, where you get in, fight to grab some loot and then try to get it back out to safely extract as other teams bear down on you and try to wrestle it away – the Biocore carrier emits a ping that pinpoints them on the map for others. It’s a format popularised by Escape from Tarkov, but Ascendant mixes it with the general feel of Apex Legends and throws a whole host of other ideas into the pot that should help it really stand out from the crowd.</p>

<p>PlayFusion is trying to brand this as the first Adaption Shooter, and you can absolutely see where they’re coming from in that regard. There is a single map in the game to start, but where a battle royale gives you the full map to start with before the storm rolls in, Ascendant takes this one map, locks and opens certain areas and avenues, throws in interactive elements and modifiers and tells you to… well, adapt.</p>

<p>There’s some real Hunger Games vibes to some of these, with the possibility of being able to launch missiles from a command tower, send EMP bombs to dampen shields on a part of the map, or use a huge armoured vehicle with flamethrower, artillery and more on it. It’s immensely satisfying to be able to pull the handle on a rocket barrage to land on another team and see damage and knockdowns ping on your screen.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to learn here, and that’s going to take a good few matches as different variables come into play, but as you learn these elements, you can also start to read what other teams are doing. If a rocket barrage is launched, then you can immediately pinpoint where that team is and make a choice to go and attack them or steer clear and do something else –&nbsp;with a pool of respawns and forward bases to capture, you can be pretty bold in your decision here.</p>
<p>With a blend of devs and playtesters in the lobby alongside us, there were some interesting strategies playing out through our two matches. On one occasion, there was one player from another team playing the role of disruptor, running around and harassing us as we explored the underground passageways. On another, one team actually managed to grab a later Biocore and then tried to use that core’s ability as a way to beef up an attack on an earlier core that was still in play.</p>

<p>Another big element to wrap your head around is your character build. There’s no defined classes here, but you rather have up to four perks equipped at once, deeply upgradeable and customisable weapons, and Biocore abilities to effectively create your own class. The intention from PlayFusion is to have breadth as opposed to depth, so newcomers to the game can quickly get to the dominant meta or experiment with new builds without being at a sudden deficit.</p>
<p>Not everything is going to be in your hands at the start of a match. You start with a base weapon, but anything that you’ve customised will then have a price tag on it, with more powerful weaponry set to cost you a pretty penny from what you earn in a match, and picked up from vending machines at various points. Biocore abilities, such as a powerful shockwave or a big leap across the map, are then only active while you’re actually holding a core and have the target on your back.</p>
<p>What’s also fairly distinct for this kind of game is that there’s a social hub to hang out in between matches. Instead of having a basic menu screen, you head back to your home tree and a social space called The Shade for up to 24 players. It’s similar to visiting the Tower in Destiny 2, letting you run around between specific vendors and talking to characters who can give you missions and rewards – there’s 60 NPCs who can hand out fairly simple quest chains that, while they won’t affect the core gameplay, might nudge you toward using a particular weapon type, or something similarly straightforward.</p>

<p>But there’s a more playful side to this as well. Already in the hub is a hide &amp; seek game that players can sign up to take part in before trying to disappear off to different corners of the map –&nbsp;it plays like a classic game of Infection or Zombie, without guns –&nbsp;and they’re working on adding little RC car races, and more.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes there’s actually a bit of social matchmaking going on, with the game looking at your friends list, keeping a tally of people you’ve played with before, and trying to make it so there’s names you already or will come to recognise. When the matchmaking turns to be skill-based, there’s a different weighting between casual and ranked play, with casual emphasising K/D ratios and damage output and ranked more the actual objective play.</p>
<p>And there’s already plans for how events can mix up the main Biocore hunt. While the game is built around having four teams of three, there’s really no limits to player count, as far as PlayFusion is concerned, so there could easily be a weekend event with two teams of ten, ten teams of two, and the like.</p>
<p>While the somewhat cheesy 80s aesthetic is the hook, there’s plenty going on with Ascendant that helps differentiate it from other extraction shooters, from how the map and modifiers are remixed for each match, to the social space that you can mess around in between games. If you’re looking for a fresh alternative to a battle royale or extraction staple that’s getting long in the tooth, then you should definitely check out Ascendant with its open beta weekend.</p>

<p>With its release less than a month away, Strange Scaffold’s newest game, I Am Your Beast, has received a brand new gameplay trailer.</p>



<p>This new trailer shows off more of the intense gameplay that players can expect to experience as retired secret agent. You can check it out for yourself below.</p>



<p>I Am Your Beast launches August 15 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC via Steam</a>. It’ll also be launching on iOS on November 19. There is a demo available via Steam if you want to try the game before buying it. It was also one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-next-fest-june-2024-10-games-you-need-to-check-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s “Top Games To Play”</a> during June’s Steam Next Fest event.</p>



<h2 id="h-about-i-am-your-beast">About I Am Your Beast</h2>



<p><em>“I Am Your Beast&nbsp;places you deep within the North American wilderness, fighting against the Covert Operations Initiative (COI) who are hunting you down. You play as retired secret agent Alphonse Harding, who refuses to keep being used after completing a series of “one last jobs.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Declining his latest mission sets in motion a guerilla war against the COI, littering the forest with bodies and bullet casings.
