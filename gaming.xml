            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It's not that often that a perfectly good and functional air hockey video game drops. In fact, considering that the grotty arcade staple translates so readily to the sphere, very few air hockey games release in general. One of life's persisting mysteries, right there.</p>
<p>However, fear not Switch 2-owning air hockey fans (which I'm sure is a large demographic), as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/handy-hockey">Handy Hockey</a> is now here, it costs a fiver and, to borrow an old proverb, 'it does exactly what it says on the tin.' This re-release/remaster of 2010's Japan-only DSI title from ITL is the epitome of laser-focused game design. There is one thing to do here, and it's play air hockey. Go *insert air hockey team name*!</p>
<p>This lovely little Switch 2 version allows players to compete with a mixture of human/CPU opponents in matches that can be either singles or doubles. Simples. Now, the real juice is that you can also choose to play in a variety of ways, because Switch 2 gonna switch, too.</p>
<p>You've got normal TV play from side-on and top-to-bottom viewpoints, and you get to use mouse controls to direct your paddle. You can also choose to use a controller in regular ways if it suits you better. However, the real clincher, and the reason why this one deserves your money, is that you can play with your Switch 2 lying flat on a surface to replicate an arcade table, then sit across from each other and dig into 1v1/2v2 air hockey with zero distractions.</p>
<p>There are no other modes to mess with, no collectibles, or towers to climb, there's not even any emotional banter between a Godfather and his broken son. None of that. Get rid of it. Handy Hockey gives you air hockey. Full stop and/or period.</p>
<p>If anything didn't work well, the whole thing would collapse on its airy arse in short order and we'd have to go back to playing the grabby machine in the corner for knock-off Kirby plushies. But — and remember this game costs less than a (nice) sandwich — the controls with all the motion tech and mouse stuff are really well done. It just works. It's responsive, you can give the puck a gentle nudge or power blast. And when people (me) get over hitting things as hard as they can, well, it's quite strategic.</p>
<p>I've been playing four-player with my wife and kids, all using Mouse Mode, and it's the sort of thing (because of the lack of other modes or online) that's got a tabletop game purity to it. No distractions, just family fun time. My kids also played it later alone, so that's worth a mention, as it rarely happens.</p>
<p>It's advertised as a 120fps experience, and performance-wise — as you'd expect for such a simple game — everything is good. And it looks fine, too: clear, concise, and easy to parse. On the negative side, it would have been nice to have a bit of character added via avatars and persistent profiles for players to keep a history of their play. A few different tables would really help things from growing stale, too.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/handy-hockey]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has warned Switch owners in Japan not to let their consoles get too hot or too cold.</p>
<p>Spurred by the high temperatures in some parts of Japan, Nintendo posted a statement to Japanese social media informing players that by playing in "high-temperature environments", the device's temperature, too, may rise, potentially causing "malfunctions".</p>

<p>"When using a Nintendo Switch or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in a high-temperature environment, the device's temperature may rise," the statement said, as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-warns-japanese-users-about-operating-the-switch-and-switch-2-at-too-high-or-too-low-temperatures/">Automaton</a>. "This could potentially cause malfunctions, so please use it in a location between 5–35°C.</p>
<p>"Recently, temperatures have been exceeding 35°C. Please be cautious when using it outdoors."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="ja"><p>気温が高い場所でNintendo SwitchやNintendo Switch 2 を使用すると、本体の温度が高くなることがあります。<br>故障の原因となる可能性がありますので、5～35℃の場所でご使用ください。</p><p>最近は35℃を超える日が続いています。屋外で使用する際はご注意ください。</p></div>— 任天堂サポート (@nintendo_cs) <a href="https://twitter.com/nintendo_cs/status/1951116935409860651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Interestingly, the statement not only warns about ensuring the device doesn't get too warm, but also warns about low temperatures, too, suggesting playing it in environments where the temp struggles to get past 5°C could also be problematic.</p>
<p>It's caused a number of players who live in colder climates to respond to Nintendo on Twitter, with one player from Hokkaido, where it regularly falls below freezing in winter, writing: "5°C?! [Is Nintendo] telling me not to fight in Hokkaido?!"</p>
<p>"It's midwinter outdoors, so it's naturally below freezing lol," they later <a href="https://x.com/nomin7500love/status/1951243781929574433">added</a>. "But there are times when it's 5°C indoors."</p>
<p>While Nintendo didn't explain why players should avoid playing when it's very hot or very cold, much like using any electronic device in extreme temperatures, it's thought that this can slow the charging speed and degrade the battery, ultimately shortening the console's lifespan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/almost-all-switch-2-users-have-bought-mario-kart-world-as-sales-of-new-console-pass-6m-worldwide">Nintendo sold 5.82m Switch 2 consoles worldwide in its first month of release and 5.63m copies of Mario Kart World</a>, meaning the launch title has an attachment rate of around 97 percent.</p>
<p>The figures came from <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">Nintendo's latest earnings release</a> as of 30th June, where the company added software sales for Switch 2 reached 8.67m units in that same period. That means <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> accounts for 65 percent of all software sales on the new console.</p>
<p>Nintendo added, in the seven weeks since launch, the Switch 2 has sold over 6m units worldwide. Even so, Nintendo has noted demand is exceeding supply in many countries.</p>
<p>Shortly after the console's launch, Nintendo announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Switch 2 was the company's fastest-selling hardware ever</a>, moving 3.5m units worldwide in its first four days on sale. Last week, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-video-game-hardware-device-in-us-history-usurping-the-ps4">Switch 2 is the fastest-selling video game hardware device in the US</a>, beating the PS4.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-warns-japanese-players-not-to-play-switch-2-in-extreme-temperatures]]></content:encoded>

<p>I don’t know if y’all noticed, but Hideo Kojima likes movies. <i>A lot</i>. I know this will come as a great shock to the maybe 12 of you who haven’t been paying that much attention over the man’s nearly 40 year career in games, but even the <i>Metal Gear </i>/ <i>Snatcher</i> era saw him taking direct inspiration from <i>The Terminator</i>, <i>Blade Runner</i>, and <i>Escape from New York</i> way before it was cool. But fast forward to now in 2025, and the man has been able to live some very specific cinephile dreams over the last decade and change, one of which involves being able to meet some of the best filmmakers in the world and then ask if he can stick their likenesses into his wackypants delivery service games about death and societal collapse.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-metal-gear-solid-3-remake-stranding-1851787440">Kojima On Whether Or Not He’ll Play <i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i> Remake: Lol, Nope</a></p> <p>Famous film talent was a big factor in the first <i>Death Stranding</i>, and it’s even more of a nerd flex in <i>Death Stranding 2</i>. Somehow, most of them wind up saying yes to being in Kojima’s project. Game literally recognize game, really. Kojima’s one of the few game devs who can legitimately lay claim to the auteur label–which, tangentially, we need to define as a creator whose clarity of vision guides a project, <i>not</i> that they’re doing all the work themselves; I cannot stress enough how important that distinction is–and the folks he’s invited for cameos in the whole <i>Death Stranding</i> project are all directors with a similar bent towards their work.</p>

 <p>That’s why it’s even more important, in these times when there are a shitload of games and movies created without that clarity, to recognize the filmmakers Kojima held sacred enough to nest them into his own work. TL;DR, Kojima’s got dope taste in film, and that’s clearer even than it was in the first game. Once Sam Porter-Bridges is done delivering his last package in <i>Death Stranding 2</i>, you owe it to him and yourself to fall into the big beautiful rabbit hole of cinema that Kojima wanted to show off to the world. So, here’s your starter pack of all the real-world film directors crammed into <i>Death Stranding 2</i>, and the very first thing you should check out from their filmography.</p> <h2><span id="guillermo-del-toro-(deadman)-%e2%80%93-blade-ii-%5b2002%5d"></span><b>Guillermo Del Toro (Deadman) – </b><b><i>Blade II</i></b><b> [2002]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614425" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614425"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614425">© 2002 New Line Cinema</figcaption></figure> <p>Del Toro’s probably the most well-known and beloved filmmaker in either <i>Death Stranding</i> game, which is why you probably don’t need to be told that yes, you should check out the excellent flick where the mom from <i>Paddington</i> fucks a fish man that somehow won a Best Picture Oscar (2017’s <i>The Shape of Water</i>). That also goes for <i>Pan’s Labyrinth</i>, a movie whose aesthetics have now been strip-mined for parts hundreds of times over in games and film (but you should watch it again anyway).</p>

 <p>So as a late summer blockbuster treat, you should go watch <i>Blade II</i>. One: because it’s looking pretty likely we ain’t getting the Daywalker back in multiplexes anytime soon (<i>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</i> doesn’t count, and you know it). Two: because you get a bonus <i>Death Stranding</i> connection with Norman Reedus playing Scud, Blade’s interim man-in-chair before Whistler re-enters the picture. Three: because it fucking rules. It’s a perfect, big, brutal sequel to one of the most effortlessly cool action flicks of the modern era, kicked up a notch by Del Toro adding some genuinely fucked up horror to the mix. Prior to Robert Eggers’ <i>Nosferatu</i> last year, <i>Blade II</i>’s Reapers represent the last time bloodsucking vampires weren’t intriguing or tragic or sexy, just&nbsp; absolutely goddamn terrifying. Watch it 100 times and the money shot reveal of a Reaper’s mouth will still be an all-timer blood-curdling moment.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>The Devil’s Backbone<i> [2001]</i></h3> <p>If you still want to aim higher class, <i>The Devil’s Backbone</i> seems like it’s fading into the background of Del Toro’s filmography, and it absolutely shouldn’t. Maybe wait till it’s October and spooky season begins in earnest; but it’s a very different take on a ghost story that doesn’t have the luxury of falling back on facestabbings like <i>Crimson Peak</i>. Not that we have anything against the many, many facestabbings of <i>Crimson Peak</i>.</p>

 <h2><span id="nicolas-winding-refn-(heartman)-%e2%80%93-bronson-%5b2008%5d"></span><b>Nicolas Winding Refn (Heartman) – </b><b><i>Bronson </i></b><b>[2008]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614426"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614426">© Vertigo Films</figcaption></figure> <p>The other returning filmmaker from the first <i>Death Stranding</i>, Refn’s kind of an oddball first step for learning how arthouse cinema differentiates from the multiplex. Ostensibly, the man operates in familiar genres. It’s pretty likely that if you’ve seen any Refn film, it’s probably <i>Drive</i> with Ryan Gosling, and that’s a perfect example. You can sell your friends on it as a slow burn action flick/crime drama, when in reality, it’s kind of an off-kilter, neurodivergent deconstruction of the whole idea of an action hero; and you’re either on its wavelength or you’re not. Or you’re a guy who made Gosling’s jacket your entire personality and need a lot more time in therapy. Point being, the man’s films are never what you want or expect.</p> <p>Except for <i>Bronson</i>, which isn’t trying to hide a damn thing about what it is: a psychofuck trip through the life and times of one of the most ruthlessly destructive people to ever pass through British prison, Charles Bronson. The entire film feels delirious, punch-drunk, and vicious—and that’s exactly the point. This was Tom Hardy’s breakout role, and without a doubt it’s the one that got him the part as Bane in <i>Dark Knight Rises</i> on sight. It’s a perfect, unnerving portrait of an erudite psychopath.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mentions:</i> Only God Forgives<i> [2013] </i>/ My Life Directed By Nicolas Winding Refn<i> [2014]&nbsp;</i></h3> <p>So, <i>Only God Forgives</i> is a mixed bag, and that’s being generous. It’s Refn trying to do for Asian crime epics what he did to American gangster films with <i>Drive</i>, but with less success outside the visuals and the way-too-brief action. It’s like watching <i>The Raid 2</i> on Xanax.</p>

 <p>However, it’s worth it just so you have context for the much more interesting <i>My Life Directed By Nicolas Winding Refn</i>. It’s a one-hour documentary directed by Refn’s wife, Liv Corfixen, which is less about the actual behind-the-scenes day-to-day making of the film–though you do get to see Refn and Alejandro Jodorowsky hang out together for a bit, which is neat–than about Corfixen’s life being upended by having to move herself and her two kids to Bangkok for six months for the sake of her manic-depressive husband and the crowd-repulsing movie he’s making. That’s a fascinating angle to take. There’s also another very good reason to check it out, which is that <i>Death Stranding 2</i> is another family affair for Refn. Corfixen plays The Hydrologist, and their daughters Lizzie and Lola play The Chronobiologist and The Metagenomicist, respectively.</p> <h2><span id="fatih-akin-(dollman)-%e2%80%93-in-the-fade-%5b2017%5d"></span><b>Fatih Akin (Dollman) – </b><b><i>In The Fade</i></b><b> [2017]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614427" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614427"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614427">© Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure> <p>Even beyond Fatih Akin being a talented director with amazing control over tone–the man does more with tense silence than some directors do with an entire orchestra–as a German-born Turk, the man’s got a cultural perspective you definitely don’t see much of in Western media. He’d be a gem for that alone, but just about every off-the-cuff interview with the guy is bursting with energy and enthusiasm for life, art, everything. To wit, as a side tangent here, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HnOlLQce4k">this interview</a> Kojima and Akin did at Cannes this year about their philosophies towards art and their own work. Kojima making Dollman such an integral part of Sam’s journey was a stroke of genius and the whole game is better for it (though yes, I know the Tranq Sniper Rifle doesn’t have a suppressor, sir, you can stop reminding me, I’m good, thanks)</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Technological Constraints &amp; Freedoms – Technology &amp; Storytelling feat. Hideo Kojima &amp; Fatih Akin" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HnOlLQce4k?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>As for a starting point for Akin’s work, though, <i>In The Fade</i> is almost the winner by default: It’s Akin’s most easily accessible film (it’s on HBO Max at the time of this writing, in fact), and probably the most horrifyingly relevant. A reformed drug addict named Katja (Diane Kruger, who, fun trivia, happens to be married to Norman Reedus IRL) marries a similarly reformed Turkish ex-con named Nuri (Numan Acar). When Neo-Nazis set off a nail bomb outside Nuri’s workplace, killing him and the couple’s young son solely for the crime of being immigrants, Katja’s entire life spirals out of control, and Germany’s criminal justice system is, well, less than helpful, leading Katja to take matters in her own hands. It’s not the easiest watch, but it’s impossible not to once you’re engrossed in it.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>Head-On<i> [2004]</i></h3> <p>Once you’re done with <i>In The Fade</i>, though, and want another downward spiral to dig into, <i>Head-On</i> is a damn fine choice. A Turkish woman (<i>Game of Thrones</i>’ Sibel Kekilli) meets a suicidal, aging punk named Cahit (Birol Ünel) while at a mental health facility, and out of sheer desperation to escape her extremely traditional Turkish family, she asks to marry him on the spot. It goes about as well as you might think. Despite that rom-com setup–complete with a Greek choir of Turkish musicians, which is a wild choice—it is often just as fatalistic and grim as it is funny and hopelessly romantic.</p> <h2><span id="george-miller-(tarman)-%e2%80%93-three-thousand-years-of-longing-%5b2023%5d"></span><b>George Miller (Tarman) – </b><b><i>Three Thousand Years of Longing </i></b><b>[2023]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614430" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614430"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614430">© Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures</figcaption></figure> <p>If the first time you ever heard the name George Miller was due to <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>, congratulations, you’re the next contestant on America’s favorite game show “Holy Shit, The Guy Who Made <i>Fury Road</i> Directed THAT?!” Because Miller has had a hell of a diverse career, from the <i>Mad Max</i> saga, to beloved childrens’ classics such as <i>Babe</i> and <i>Happy Feet</i>, to weepy dramas like <i>Lorenzo’s Oil</i>. To wit, this could very easily have just been a recommendation to go watch <i>Furiosa</i> and call it a day, because that flick deserves way more love than it got, especially that unhinged Chris Hemsworth performance. But oh no, y’all are not getting off that easy. <i>Furiosa </i>failing to set the world on fire is nothing compared to the absolutely lovely <i>Three Thousand Years of Longing</i> basically being dumped on the side of the road by Amazon and left to starve.</p>

 <p>In fairness, I’m not sure how many millions of dollars more were really left on the table by not marketing a romantic fantasy by the <i>Mad Max</i> guy about Tilda Swinton finding a genie in a bottle, but living such a fulfilled life that she refuses to wish. Surely, a lot of people would certainly have spent the money to hear Idris Elba try to convince her to make a wish with multiple magical tales of love, lust, greed, and power gone wrong across the vast expanse of time itself, especially when those tales are as lavishly directed as these are and when they lead to a modern love story unlike any other. Seriously, it’s a $60 million movie that looks like it cost $300 million, with one of the most achingly beautiful film scores in recent years, from Junkie XL of all people. If nothing else, come to get a debilitating addiction to those pistachio cookies Tilda and Idris are eating in their hotel room the whole movie.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>The Witches of Eastwick <i>[1987]</i></h3> <p>If that’s a little too schmaltzy for your liking, there’s also that time The Guy Who Made <i>Fury Road</i> directed a romantic horror comedy about three witches (Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Cher) winding up in a polycule with Satan himself (Jack Nicholson). Somehow, that thing is scored by John Williams, too. I don’t know what to do for you if that premise alone can’t perk your ears up.</p> <h2><span id="mike-flanagan-(mike-northcote)-%e2%80%93-the-life-of-chuck-(2024)"></span><b>Mike Flanagan (Mike Northcote) – </b><b><i>The Life of Chuck</i></b><b> (2024)</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614431" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614431"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614431">© Intrepid Pictures</figcaption></figure> <p>Mike Flanagan might be the best thing to ever happen to Stephen King. Flanagan seems to be a perfect creative distillery, boiling out everything clunky and problematic in King’s post-car-accident work, while accentuating the sobering poetry and grim insight that’s still present even in his weaker efforts. That’s of course to say nothing of Flanagan’s own work on stuff like <i>Haunting of Hill House</i>, the brilliant adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe’s <i>Fall of the House of Usher</i>, and <i>Midnight Mass</i> (which is, ironically, a better <i>Salem’s Lot</i> remake than the actual, garbage <i>Salem’s Lot</i> remake from last year).</p> <p>That makes it all the more frustrating that Flanagan finally broke his confinement at Netflix to put a new King adaptation in theaters for it to release with absolutely zero impact. Not even a thud. It’s yet even more frustrating that <i>Life of Chuck</i> is easily one of the best damn films of the year, to say nothing of being one of the most affecting, heartfelt films in recent memory at a time when we desperately need it. It’s got less of a linear narrative–or even a reverse chronological narrative–than a series of seemingly disconnected vignettes from the life of a man named Chuck (played at various ages by Cody Flanagan, Benjamin Pajak, Jacob Tremblay, and Tom Hiddleston), spiraling out from the simple, haunting moment that Chuck finds out through supernatural means exactly how and when he will die.</p>

 <p>Armed with the knowledge of a tragic, comic, and beautiful past, and an equally beautiful, but truncated future, the film is basically a literary argument for the value of life itself–a common thing in all of Flanagan’s work, really. It’s all that and it’s got one of the most wonderfully unorthodox ensemble casts you’ll ever see. That, of course, includes Flanagan’s wife, Kate Siegel, who <i>also </i>pops up in <i>Death Stranding 2</i> as West Fort Knot’s Olivia Westbury (with an Irish accent, weirdly enough). It just hit digital this week. Do yourself the favor of getting your eyes on this.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>Doctor Sleep: Director’s Cut<i> (2019)</i></h3> <p>Oh yeah, don’t think I’ve ever forgiven y’all for the last time this happened. Granted, the world had an excuse last time. <i>Doctor Sleep</i>: The Novel is a complete mess of ideas, and the trailers for this made it look like a cheap Kubrick legasequel cash in. Flanagan, however, finds the beating heart in all of it, again stripping out all the problematic landmines of King’s book and replacing them with a genuinely empathetic and still often-frightening look at alcoholism through the lens of <i>The Shining</i>, both King’s book and Kubrick’s film. Come for the storytelling, stay after you fall madly in lust with Rebecca Ferguson’s Rose the Hat.</p>

 <p>Yes, hunt down the Director’s Cut, the added bits make it perfect.</p> <h2><span id="danny-and-michael-philippou-(mr-impossible)-%e2%80%93-talk-to-me-%5b2022%5d"></span><b>Danny and Michael Philippou (Mr. Impossible) – </b><b><i>Talk To Me </i></b><b>[2022]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614432" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614432"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614432">© A24</figcaption></figure> <p>At some point, someone’s gonna have to write a deep, academic paper on why great comedians are somehow absolutely incredible at horror. (Partial theory: Any truly great comedy played straight <i>is</i> horror) Millennials saw this play out with Peter Jackson and Edgar Wright. Gen Y and Z get to see it with Jordan Peele and, now, the RackaRacka guys, a.k.a. The Philippou Brothers. Somehow, these Aussies, known for their Suburban Violence videos and genre mashup shorts, started plying their trade on the big screen, and with all the same DIY tools that made their Youtube videos utter chaos, managed to deliver one of the most chilling tales of possession in recent memory.</p> <p>It’s a simple setup, too: Australian teenagers have somehow stumbled upon an unholy relic in the shape of a hand that allows them to communicate with the dead. Saying “Talk to me” while holding it lets you see a dead person. The phrase “I let you in” allows the dead person to possess you, which is safe only for 90 seconds. Surprisingly, teenagers, long known for how much they love to follow rules, let the possession go on too long and…well, bad things ensue. The film never quite escalates after an absolutely gnarly bit of self-mutilation at the halfway mark, but things are still pretty fucking far from sunshine and daisies after.</p>

 <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>Bring Her Back<i> [2025]</i></h3> <p><i>Bring Her Back</i> wasn’t as much of a smash hit as <i>Talk To Me</i>, but to be fair to the general public, it’s also a much, much, <i>much </i>more fucked up piece of work. It’s about two orphaned kids whose new eccentric foster mother (Sally Hawkins) loves them so much that she intends to let one of them become the new vessel for her dead daughter’s soul by performing a Satanic ritual. Fun fact: This was the movie Sally Hawkins did immediately after dropping out of <i>Paddington in Peru</i>. Good call, tbh, I don’t want her anywhere near children or that sweet, trusting bear after this.</p> <h2><span id="s-s-rajamouli-(the-adventurer)-%e2%80%93-rrr-%5b2022%5d"></span><b>S.S. Rajamouli (The Adventurer) – </b><b><i>RRR </i></b><b>[2022]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614433" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614433"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614433">© ZEE5</figcaption></figure> <p>If<i> RRR</i> is somehow a new title to your ears, I’m gonna politely invite you to drop everything you’re doing right this second.Clear the rest of your day and go experience the greatest three hours you will spend this year. Like what are you even doing reading this article? It’s on Netflix, don’t argue with me on this.</p> <p>If you’re still here, sure, I guess let’s qualify that for you. For folks who might be dipping their first toe into the Wild World of Indian cinema, Indian movies tend to have a reputation for a kitchen sink approach to filmmaking, which is why you might have a concept of them that’s mostly centered around weird bespoke musical numbers. It’s actually very much by design. Especially for areas so remote that going to the movies means most of the day is spent travelling, the entire country’s various film industries–and no, not every Indian film is Bollywood–have the unspoken mandate that they need to make the trip worth it for every single potential viewer. So action movies aren’t just action movies, musicals aren’t just musicals, romantic comedies aren’t just romantic comedies. Every film’s got to do <i>a lot</i>, and many end up feeling like tonal whiplash to Westerners as a result.</p> <p>And even by that standard, <i>RRR</i> is just an unlimited Golden Corral buffet of awesome things on every single conceivable creative level. The core plot plays out like an Indian historical fiction riff on <i>The Departed</i>, except imagine Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are not just friends, not just best friends, but <i>the best friends that have ever lived</i>. When our heroes, Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) and Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) meet for the first time during an explosion on a bridge, they wordlessly decide from a half mile away to perform one of the most heroic rescues ever executed, all while swinging from a bridge waving an Indian flag. The big conflict of the film comes down to (of course) the goddamn British being assholes in the 1920s. And when some foppish fuckhead starts laying into Bheem about being an uncultured peasant, Raju steps in and the two clap back with one of the greatest dance sequences ever committed to film. It’s so undeniably great that the song they dance to become the first song from an Indian film to win Best Original Song at the Oscars. Raju is introduced as a soldier so badass he’s ordered to arrest one single dude who threw a rock during a full-scale riot, and then literally fights his way through a pissed-off crowd of <i>thousands </i>with nothing but a nightstick and his goddamn mustache. Bheem’s ultimate plan involves rescuing a kidnapped village girl with a full on assault on a British palace whereupon he unleashes a truck full of every single pissed-off forest animal he could trap onto the property. The money shot of that sequence would make Zack Snyder soil himself with <i>awe</i>. Don’t even get me started on the sequence they actually reference in <i>Death Stranding 2</i> with that hologram up above. This is a <i>fraction</i> of the various glories <i>RRR</i> delivers on, all while still making good on being a fist-pumping story of the marginalized fighting their oppressors by any means necessary. The actual title is <i>Rise, Roar, Revolt</i> for a good god damn reason. Why are you not watching it right now, fool? Get out of here!</p>

 <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>Baahubali: The Beginning <i>and </i>Baahubali: The Conclusion</h3> <p>Look, if <i>RRR</i> took that long to hype up, we’ll be here till next weekend running down the <i>Baahubali </i>flicks’ whole deal. We’ll keep this one nice and short. I’ll just say “Indian <i>Lord of the Rings</i>” and leave it to you to find out. And even the <i>LoTR</i> flicks didn’t have Aragorn doing a Van Damme split riding two flaming bulls into Helm’s Deep.</p> <p>Oh, and in case you were wondering about Rajamouli’s <i>Death Stranding 2</i> appearance, yes, that’s his actual stepson, S.S. Karthikeya, playing The Adventurer’s Son; yes, Karthikeya’s a director in his own right, he did second unit on <i>Baahubali</i>; yes, I got tired of saving The Adventurer’s ass up in the mountains too, for god’s sake, put an AirTag on that man or something.</p> <h2><span id="yusaku-matsumoto-(the-architect)-%e2%80%93-winny-%5b2023%5d"></span><b>Yusaku Matsumoto (The Architect) – </b><b><i>Winny </i></b><b>[2023]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614434" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614434"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614434">©Yusaku Matsumoto</figcaption></figure> <p>Admittedly, Matsumoto was the director I knew the least about going into this article. Finding out about him wasn’t a particularly easy feat either, with <i>Winny</i> being the only one of his films available to stream in North America. Thankfully, <i>Winny</i> is a fascinating piece of work. The framework is easy to nail down as basically the story of Japan’s very own Napster/Limewire equivalent, but as opposed to going down the <i>Social Network</i> route of showing the new titans of Silicon Valley as antisocial children playing businessman, <i>Winny</i> is more about the actual trial, and a scathing indictment of the law enforcement response to the app’s success. It could use some of David Fincher’s flair for making dry procedurals feel energetic, but it’s still a riveting watch.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mention:</i> House of the Owl <i>[2024]</i></h3> <p>One of Matsumoto’s only other directorial credits that’s readily available is actually a TV show currently on Hulu. It’s kind of a Japanese riff on <i>Succession</i>, except there’s less satire, since it’s not as much about the powerful patriarchs than it is the political schemer guiding their hands. It’s also slower and drier than <i>Succession</i>, but it’s rare to see this kind of show cross the Pacific in general, and Matsumoto’s style fits the material like a glove, so there’s still an interesting perspective to be found in here.</p>

 <h2><span id="kevin-ko-(the-ghost-hunter)-%e2%80%93-incantation-%5b2022%5d"></span><b>Kevin Ko (The Ghost Hunter) – </b><b><i>Incantation </i></b><b>[2022]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614435" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614435"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614435">© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p>For much of its runtime, <i>Incantation</i> isn’t doing&nbsp; anything folks haven’t seen out of every other found footage horror flick this side of <i>The Blair Witch Project</i>. But the very beginning snaps you to attention regardless: a woman talking about perceptual illusions, and asking us, the audience, to remember a specific chant and a specific symbol. It’s mostly a slow burn possessed-child story for most of the time after that.</p> <p>Thing is though, you might remember a little game called <i>Devotion</i> from a few years back, mostly famous for getting stomped out of existence by the Chinese government <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-bails-on-selling-taiwanese-horror-game-devotion-1845895225">for the dumbest reason imaginable</a>. That controversy sadly obscured the fact that <i>Devotion</i> was a completely unmooring sort of horror experience that relied on very specific Taiwanese religious symbology to emphasize something extraordinarily fucked up is going on. <i>Incantation</i> does much the same, using a lot of that same symbology, but taken even further into the realm of pure horror, made even worse by the found footage factor. The ambient score plays its hand a bit too much but when <i>Incantation</i> gets down to business, it’s still terrifying. The final stretch in particular, if you know what you’re seeing, is an all-timer of a blasphemous exclamation point on the whole thing. The film begs for a bit of patience, but it certainly earns it by the end. There’s absolutely a reason Ko is cast as a post-apocalyptic ghost hunter in <i>Death Stranding 2</i>.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>A Choo<i> [2020]</i></h3> <p>On the complete flipside of <i>Incantation</i> is a genuinely bizarre take on a superhero film. Actually, “superhero film” feels like the wrong description too. It’s a film taking place in a universe where superheroes exist, but it’s mostly a boxing movie about an orphan named EJ who falls in love with his best friend Hsien-Hsien at a young age and dedicates his life to being a good enough fighter to be able to protect her–despite her life very much moving on without him. It’s.very weird, kinda like a cruder, loopier version of <i>Kick-Ass</i>, and it doesn’t entirely work, but, it’s kind of a running pattern in Kevin Ko’s work that the ending will always pull it all together. And even as ridiculous as <i>A Choo</i> can be, the climax, connecting the course of EJ’s history to one lucky punch against a rogue supervillain, is pretty wonderful.</p> <h2><span id="mamoru-oshii-(the-pizza-chef)-%e2%80%93-ghost-in-the-shell-%5b1995%5d-/-ghost-in-the-shell-innocence-%5b2004%5d"></span><b>Mamoru Oshii (The Pizza Chef) – </b><b><i>Ghost In The Shell</i></b><b> [1995] / </b><b><i>Ghost In The Shell: Innocence</i></b><b> [2004]</b><span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614437" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614437"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614437">© Bandai Visual</figcaption></figure> <p>Being a Millennial anime fan is a weird position to find yourself. I’m not “<i>Speed Racer </i>/ <i>Astro Boy</i> on Saturday mornings” old, but I’m not “<i>Naruto </i>/ <i>Bleach</i> on Toonami”&nbsp; or “<i>Demon Slayer </i>/ <i>Jujitsu Kaisen</i> on Crunchyroll” young either. I am, specifically, “<i>Project A-Ko</i> and <i>Demon City Shinjuku</i> on the Sci-Fi Channel Annual Anime Festival” old. I am “Paying $50 to a dude in NYC for a bootleg VHS of <i>Street Fighter: The Animated Movie</i> recorded off a laserdisc” old. I am “Programming the VCR to record the one time Showtime will ever broadcast <i>Dominion Tank Police</i> at 2 am on a school night” old. My tastes in anime skew slightly off the pulse, is the point I’m getting to here.</p>

 <p>And as such, it’s hard to say whether Mamoru Oshii’s <i>Ghost In The Shell</i> remains one of those immovable gargantuan touchstones of any otaku’s experience anymore (especially as more and weaker <i>GTS</i> adaptations keep happening, each of them taking another tiny step towards making Major Kusanagi into lolicon). The ‘95 film absolutely should be considered must-watch material, mind you. It’s still a stone cold masterpiece of animation, whose influence continues to worm its way through modern sci-fi to this very day. Kojima certainly recognizes that–it certainly helps that his ride-or-die mech designer Yoji Shinkawa worked on the original manga–but you don’t often hear about it in the same hushed tones you used to, compared to, say, <i>One Piece</i>. So, it’s also included here as a mandate and reminder that<b> this is required viewing.</b></p> <p>That said, if the original <i>Ghost In The Shell</i> film has fallen ever so gently out of the zeitgeist, its sequel still deserves to finally breach into it. Oshii had no interest in conforming to genre convention with <i>Innocence</i>, and not only does he take the iconic Major out of the equation–except as the metaphorical angel on the shoulder of World’s Greatest Cyborg Simp Batou–but drags <i>GITS</i> kicking and screaming into a philosophical ponderance of what artificial life has done to the nurturing part of the human mind, all centering around a series of brutal murders by supposedly-soulless gynoids all around the city.</p> <p>There are still plenty of baser joys to recommend in there. There’s two absolute banger shootouts; there’s a Mobius Strip sequence in a “haunted” mansion that’s kind of a masterclass in fucking with the audience; Kenji Kawai’s score is incredible, especially the evolution of the opening credits theme; and just, sweet swaddling Jesus, the entire film is breathtakingly animated. There’s still very little in film as a medium as astonishing as the parade sequence intermission here. It’s just that it’s a film that demands more patience than folks who go in looking for flashy cyberpunk thrills have ever been ready for. But just maybe, as way too many of the technological nightmares in Oshii’s universe come to fruition, the world might want to take more notice of what he tried to say with <i>Innocence</i>.</p> <h3><i>Honorable Mention: </i>Avalon <i>(2002)</i></h3> <p>All that said, if you really want Mamoru Oshii reading the year 2025 for filth, <i>Avalon</i> predicted the entire rise of live-service gaming and its effects on human empathy and creativity. The film–shot and set in Poland, weirdly enough–posits the GaaS future as a land laid to waste because the generation best equipped to handle inequality can only really make a living–or, really, even function as human beings–in the confines of the world’s most popular MMO. This is the gamer dystopia Ernest Cline wishes <i>Ready Player One</i> was.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s become the new normal, unfortunately, to wait years for a follow-up to our favorite games. While the realities of modern game development mean studios are working harder than ever to meet ever-higher standards, that hasn’t stopped projects like Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto 6, Valve’s Half-Life 3, and especially Team Cherry’s Silksong from becoming the unwitting faces of the industry’s lengthening timelines. That last one is surprising because when it was first announced, it didn’t seem like the sequel to Hollow Knight was all that far away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Months turned into years, and until very recently, it felt like we were no closer to Silksong than we were in 2019, back when we played a hands-on demo of the mystical sequel. In the years since, Silksong has achieved meme status, where fans don clown makeup and wigs after each new Nintendo Direct or Xbox Developer Showcase fails to bring them closer to the promised sequel. How did we get here? And just how much closer are we to the fabled Silksong release?</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Silksong Was Originally Supposed to Be DLC</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Australian-based studio Team Cherry first launched Hollow Knight on Kickstarter back in 2014, hoping to secure enough funding to turn its 2D Soulslike+Metroidvania fusion game jam prototype into a full-fledged game. After meeting its initial funding target, Team Cherry revealed additional stretch goals that promised new quests, bosses, and, eventually, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/1088384" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a second playable character named Hornet</u></a>. Those funding targets were met, and so development began on expanding Hollow Knight. </p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/01/f4fb74677f3159ab2ab2231284a971d5-1754062986749.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Concept art for Hornet when she was first announced as a DLC character. Credit: Team Cherry</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As promised, Hollow Knight’s 2017 launch was followed by a series of DLC drops. The Hidden Dreams, The Grimm Troupe, and Gods and Glory added new boss fights, quest lines, fast travel mechanics, and more to the base game. But what about the second playable character? Where was Hornet?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, on February 14, 2019, Hollow Knight: Silksong was officially announced. In a blog post and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv6CRPqkpuU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer diary</a>, Team Cherry explained how plans for Hornet had quickly evolved. Initially, the developers debated whether to add her as a second protagonist that players could switch to during the main campaign or to make her the star of a standalone chapter. Eventually, the ideas for Hornet grew so big that Team Cherry decided to spin the DLC off into a full sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The plan was now to tell a brand new Hornet-focused story in an entirely new kingdom. She would have a very different playstyle – much more nimble and acrobatic than The Knight, who is slower and heavier in comparison. She would need all her speed and dexterity when going up against Silksong’s over 150 new enemies and bosses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Hollow Knight rejoiced, and Team Cherry capitalized on the excitement for Silksong quickly…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>We Even Played It</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though Team Cherry never announced a release date, none of us expected Silksong’s unveiling would be the start of a six-year-plus wait to get to the sequel. The same year as the announcement, Team Cherry was all-in on promoting Silksong, revealing a cast of NPC characters via an anniversary <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hk-physical-late-anniversary-celebration-silksong-mini-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post</u></a> in March 2019, before showcasing a playable demo at E3 2019.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only did we at IGN see the demo ourselves at E3 that year, but our very own Tom Marks played it. In his preview, he <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/21/hollow-knight-silksong-feels-wildly-different-and-incredibly-familiar-e3-2019"><u>wrote</u></a>, “Hollow Knight is one of my favorite games ever, but I think Silksong has the potential to be even better.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo was roughly 20 minutes long and took place in a new, fiery area filled with several new enemies and two boss fights. I caught up with Marks for this story to ask him if, at the time, the Silksong demo seemed like a game that would be ready in a few years, or if it felt far from finished.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It didn’t feel six years away,” Marks tells me. “You [could] tell it wasn’t the final version, but based on the vertical slice I played, it felt really polished.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This demo would later be taken to PAX Australia 2019 and shared with attendees there as well. Generally when a game shows up with a playable build at multiple events, things are closing in on the finish line, and so we were all completely unaware of the reality that awaited. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the publicity campaign progressed into 2020, Team Cherry marketing and publishing lead Matthew “Leth” Griffin began revealing new NPCs on the official Hollow Knight Discord server as a reward for fans solving a variety of riddles. And in that December, there was a <a href="https://x.com/edgeonline/status/1344588834231693313" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>full-on cover story in Edge Magazine issue #354</u></a> with new details, screenshots, and an enlightening interview with Team Cherry co-directors Ari Gibson and William Pellen that discussed deeper, more intricate levels and offered a glimpse into Hornet’s mysterious story.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Silksong Goes Into Hiding</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The frenzy of Silksong news in the immediate aftermath of the sequel’s announcement would soon give way to a long winter. Team Cherry went radio silent throughout 2021, and fans spent the year waiting for any sign of a release date.  A 2020-2021 release window was anticipated, thanks to a few accidental messaging blips that sent the rumor mill turning.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September 2019, for instance, the official Silksong Steam page was suddenly updated with a June 12, 2020, release date. Later, Team Cherry would confirm it was just an accidental placeholder date. Just a couple of months later, on August 20, the Silksong logo appeared in an <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1296809703230582785" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official Nintendo UK tweet</u></a> that read, “Take a look at some upcoming games headed to Nintendo Switch this year and beyond.” It wasn’t immediately clear that Silksong belonged firmly in the “beyond” category – we’d yet to learn that expecting it anytime soon was folly. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Will there be Silksong at the new Nintendo Partner Direct?” fans dare to ask. 
“Absolutely not, you clown,” the universe responds.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>"Everything Shown Today Will Be Playable in the Next 12 Months"</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn’t be until almost another two years had passed that we would see Silksong again. On June 12, 2022, Xbox aired its annual summer Games Showcase, which premiered, among other things, a brand new, minute-long trailer for Silksong. But while it revealed new gameplay, areas, and bosses, the trailer didn’t include a release date. It did, however, announce that Silksong will be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-trailer"><u>playable day one on Xbox Game Pass</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This might have been enough for fans if it weren’t for an unfortunate follow-up message from Xbox. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the showcase, the official Xbox Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1536034468460261376" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted</u></a>, “Everything you’re seeing today is playable over the next 12 months.” Given Silksong was one of the games present in the showcase, this was rightfully taken as a release window for the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So you’re telling me SIlksong is out within the next 12 months?” asked one user on Twitter. <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1536035818275487746" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“That’s exactly what we said,” Xbox answered</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh boy.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">That's exactly what we said.</p>— Xbox (@Xbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1536035818275487746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 12, 2022</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Silksong Gets an Official Delay, Without Ever Getting a Release Date</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, it did seem like Team Cherry’s plan was to release Silksong within 12 months of the Xbox Games Showcase. This much was <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>confirmed by Team Cherry’s Matthew Griffin</u></a>, who shared on Twitter in May 2023 that Silksong was planned to be released in the “1st half of 2023.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Griffin added that unfortunately, “development is still continuing. We’re excited by how the game is shaping up, and it’s gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can.

The COVID-19 pandemic meant that in-person events were temporarily paused, with some events like E3 now seemingly gone for good. In place of those traditional events, various digital showcases from the likes of Geoff Keighley, Xbox, PlayStation, and even yours truly here at IGN, as well as countless others, were created to fill the void of E3. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This meant there were now dozens of potential new showcases where Team Cherry could share more information about Silksong. Every new indie game showcase, Nintendo Direct, or any number of other shows had the potential to reveal a new Silksong trailer, preferably one with a release date. And with each new showcase that failed to deliver the goods, fans began to treat Silksong’s absence as a running joke.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone who follows the games industry on social media will likely recognize the most popular Silksong meme: Anytime a company posts about an upcoming game showcase, there will be at least one picture of the Knight from Hollow Knight or Hornet from Silksong in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/rczv0k/fellow_clowns_how_you_feeling/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>clown wig and make-up</u></a>, indicating that the poster is ready to feel like a fool when Silksong inevitably fails to appear.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/01/asasisbfdc7d1-1754062608945.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A popular online meme where Hollow Knight waits foolishly for Silksong news. Credit: u/GaelSK</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/vbcj7k/ive_been_saving_this_image_for_a_year_and_a_half/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fan art of the Knight or Hornet in clown regalia</a> is now ubiquitous. It signifies the folly of wanting to learn more about Silksong. The rainbow-colored wig and clown nose have become the unofficial <a href="https://x.com/Littlebox_Goi/status/1904949908643434695" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>uniform for Silksong fans</u></a> after years of suffering. “Will there be Silksong at the new Nintendo Partner Direct?” fans dare to ask. “Absolutely not, you clown,” the universe responds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And just to prove the universe is also in on the joke, the first time Silksong received an official listing on the Xbox store was on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-got-an-xbox-store-page-on-april-fools-day-and-fans-dont-know-how-to-feel"><u>April 1, 2024. April Fool’s Day</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Light at the End of the Tunnel</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Cherry confirmed multiple times throughout 2024 that Silksong would not be appearing at any of that year’s biggest shows. It was not present in any of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-fans-crushed-as-summer-showcases-pass-with-no-silksong-announcement"><u>2024’s E3-replacement Summer Showcases</u></a>, and Geoff Keighley confirmed that Silksong would <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-not-be-at-opening-night-live-geoff-keighley-confirms"><u>not appear as part of Opening Night Live</u></a> at Gamescom 2024. Team Cherry also skipped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-fans-are-ready-to-have-their-hearts-broken-again-by-tuesdays-nintendo-direct"><u>back-to-back Nintendo Directs</u></a> that year, both the August 2024 Indie Direct and the Third-Party Partner Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, 2025 has been a different story. The year began with a fan posting on the official Hollow Knight subreddit that they ran into Silksong co-director Ari Gibson. According to the fan, Gibson joked about there not being a sequel yet, but that there would be more to share <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1i42wln/met_ari_gibson_a_few_days_ago/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“soon.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was no bluff. On March 19, 2025, Xbox published a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/idxbox-developers-finding-success-with-xbox/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ID@Xbox blog</u></a> highlighting its ongoing commitments to release great indie games, including Silksong. And a few weeks later, during the April 2 Nintendo Direct, Silksong re-emerged in the show’s sizzle reel with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-makes-brief-appearance-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct-to-secure-2025-release-window"><u>2025 release window</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silksong made another appearance during the announcement for the upcoming ROG Ally X handheld, where the game was seen briefly running on the Xbox-branded device. Team Cherry’s Matthew Griffin later confirmed in the official Hollow Knight Discord server that Silksong’s release is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-responds-to-release-date-confusion-promises-launch-before-holiday-not-tied-to-xbox-handheld-arrival"><u>not tied to any particular console</u></a> and the sequel is still slated to be released “before holiday [2025].” And now we know that Silksong will be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-a-new-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-playable-at-gamescom"><u>playable at the Xbox booth at Gamescom</u></a>. This will be the first playable demo for the game since 2019. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Silksong was a no-show at the most recent Nintendo Partner Direct — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-react-in-uproar-after-the-games-latest-nintendo-direct-no-show"><u>cue the clown memes</u></a> — it does feel like we’re finally going to get the elusive Silksong, six long, painful years after it was announced that the DLC character, Hornet, will be starring in her own game. Maybe we can start removing the clown makeup from our faces once and for all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-the-story-behind-the-insanely-long-wait-clown-meme]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I didn’t expect a brief game about flies to make me emotional. But when I finished <em>Time Flies</em>, I nearly began to cry.</p><p><em>Time Flies</em> initially seems very silly. You play as a little buzzing fly that has to try and accomplish a bucket list of tasks before it, well, kicks the bucket, something that happens in a matter of seconds. The tasks are vague, with titles like “Just Roll with It” or “Meet Your Biggest Fan,” and the goal of the game is to zip around each level, generally cause mischief to complete the tasks, and finish an entire stage’s bucket list to move on to the next one. (Naturally, the last task of each list involves dying in some way.)</p><p>The task titles are usually a joke or a pun of some kind, and a lot of the fun is finding objects around the levels and messing with them to see if they fit. Unrolling an entire roll of toilet paper completes the “Just Roll with It” task. You “Meet Your Biggest Fan” by turning on a fan.</p><p>When you’re flying around from place to place, things stay zoomed out and the fly is just a tiny speck. When you approach something of some significance, though, the game will zoom in so that you can more easily hop on that roll of toilet paper or grab the fan’s chain. The tighter perspectives are also generally a clue that you’re interacting with something that’s part of your list of goals.</p><p>One quirky part of the <em>Time Flies</em>: you choose how long your life is by selecting what country you’re in. Based on World Health Organization (WHO) data, the game translates real information about life expectancy into seconds to determine the life of your little fly. Picking the US gave me a life expectancy of 76.4 seconds, but I usually said I was in Japan, which gave me a comparatively lengthy 84.5 seconds. Because the runs are so short, every second counts — though there is a clever way to give yourself a few more seconds to explore the levels.</p><p>Once I got the hang of things, I found myself zipping through the game’s four stages to figure out the bucket list tasks and eventually string them all together, and I finished it after a couple hours. As the game went on, I felt that some of the tasks got a bit more sincere, even if the activities to accomplish them were still quite silly. Don’t we all aspire to “Bring People Together” (push one bust toward another with a wheelchair to make them kiss), “Spend Time with Family” (sit on a floating pile of garbage with other flies), and “Reflect on Your Life” (fly into an upside-down mirror world)?</p><p>Maybe it’s because I’m a new dad and I’m just a little bit softer now. But when I showed my wife the whole game — which, if you know what you’re doing, you can do in just a few minutes — we were both choked up on the couch. Even a little fly can have a big life.</p><p><sup>Time Flies</sup><em><sup> is now available on Nintendo Switch, PC, and PlayStation.</sup></em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707596/time-flies-review-pc-nintendo-switch-playstation-panic-playables]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Embark on the second half of the Amphorean story alongside Hysilens and Cerydra.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.5 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [41 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Before Their Deaths,” will launch on August 13, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [200 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-981945"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update officially kicks off the second half of the Amphoreus story. Trailblazers will encounter new companions, confront fresh enemies and events, and witness old friends in entirely new forms. Hysilens and Cerydra will also make their long-awaited debut as playable characters, joining players in the next leg of the Amphorean trailblazing expedition.</p><p>In the previous chapter, the Trailblazer made a promise to Phainon and took up the mantle of the Deliverer. In return, Phainon unleashed their blazing wrath upon Nanook, once again forcing Irontomb’s advance to a halt. Yet the journey is far from over, rescuing Amphoreus remains an unavoidable challenge. In the new Trailblaze Mission, the Trailblazer will accompany Cyrene into another cycle of Eternal Recurrence, traveling back a thousand years to the ancient Okhema. This was the age when Imperator Cerydra, the holder of the Law Coreflame, ruler of Okhema, Aglaea’s predecessor, still sat upon the throne of Okhema.</p><p>Version 3.5 introduces two powerful new characters to the team of Trailblazers. The first is Hysilens, commander of the holy city’s knights and a 5-star Physical-Type character following the Path of Nihility. Hysilens excels when paired with characters who specialize in DoT. Upon using her Ultimate, Hysilens creates a Zone. While the Zone is active, each instance of DoT inflicted on enemies will trigger an additional DoT from her. At the same time, all enemies will suffer reduced ATK and DEF. Moreover, her Basic ATK, Skill, and Ultimate each have a chance to apply a random type of DoT. Her Skill also increases the DMG enemies take, boosting the team’s overall DMG output.</p><p>The other 5-star Wind-Type character following the Path of Harmony, Imperator Cerydra, is the holder of the Law Coreflame and the initiator of the first Flame-Chase Journey. A master strategist raised on the principles of chess, she excels at long-term planning and command. In combat, her Skill grants an ally a special upgradable buff known as “Military Merit,” increasing the ally’s ATK and dealing additional DMG. As the battle progresses, Military Merit levels up. The affected ally will gain increased CRIT DMG and All-Type RES PEN when using Skills and can even replicate their Skill effects, boosting the team’s overall DMG output. Her Ultimate deals DMG to all enemies and obtains Charge for herself, providing sustained support for the team.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Additionally, the limited 5-star characters Stellaron Hunter Kafka and Silver Wolf will have their return in the first and second halves of the Version 3.5 warp event. Their formidable support makes them invaluable allies for our Trailblazers’ future journeys.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_981947"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Version 3.5 will also introduce a brand-new map, offering Trailblazers a fresh glimpse into Styxia, the City of Infinite Revelry. The story will reach a turning point as Trailblazers face off directly against Lygus, an enemy who constantly shifts between two distinct forms. As the battle intensifies, his true identity and hidden motives may slowly be revealed.</p><p>Version 3.5 brings not only new characters and stories, but also a variety of fun-filled events for Trailblazers to enjoy. In the “Chrysos Maze Grand Restaurant” event, Trailblazers will work alongside the Chrysos Heirs to manage a restaurant in Aedes Elysiae. As a “Restaurant Manager,” you’ll serve delicious food to the fairies of the Membrance Maze and renovate the run-down venue by managing it wisely to win their praise and support. Meanwhile, in the “Old Brews &amp; New Friends” event, Trailblazers will once again step behind the counter as a guest drinksmith at the “Dreamjolt Hostelry,” mixing drinks and reuniting with familiar faces to share heartwarming moments.</p><p>Version 3.5 will also introduce a voice toggle feature for collaboration characters. Trailblazers will be able to switch their interaction, combat, and idle voice lines between the in-game dub and the original licensed voice actors, offering a more immersive experience. Additionally, Honkai: Star Rail will be attending this year’s gamescom. Trailblazers are invited to stop by the event booth to check in and pick up some giveaways.

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b0dd8eca985a/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome to August, folks! Let's kick things off right with a fresh edition of What Are You Playing.</p>
<p>It was Direct week over in Nintendo Land, with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Partner Showcase</a> delivering us 25 minutes of... meh. There were some big hitters that we're pleased to see (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a>), but we were hoping to be a <em>little</em> more excited by the whole affair.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, new card art in Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-pulls-new-expansion-card-art-amid-accusations-of-plagiarism">landed TPC in hot water</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> made a surprise appearance on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-a-mouse-game">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, and Microsoft confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-at-gamescom-2025">playable at Gamescom</a> — we're <em>totally</em> not envious of everyone getting to go hands-on with it...</p>
<p>We also shared our thoughts on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_of_the_shire_a_the_lord_of_the_rings_game">Tales of the Shire</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_friends">Pokémon Friends</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/time_flies">Time Flies</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was">Dear me, I was...</a></p>
<p>Now then, what's team NL up to this weekend?</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I am feeling very much <em>BetweenGamesTM</em> at the moment after polishing off DK and all its related guides. I was hoping to have a little something drop my way in the Direct, but left feeling pretty uninspired, if I'm honest. I'll defo check out the Elliot demo this weekend, and the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-gets-free-switch-2-performance-patch">free Switch 2 update</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III</a> has me keen for some more HD-2D action.</p>
<p>Have a good one, friends!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>There aren't many changes in my gaming habits from last week, folks! I'm in the endgame of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and, let me tell you, they've definitely saved the best until last, I'm going to 100% this big banana and nothing is going to stop me from doing so.</p>
<p>I did pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files">No Sleep For Kaname Date</a>, even though reviews seem a little lower and I was pretty disappointed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ai_the_somnium_files_-_nirvana_initiative">nirvanA Initiative</a> (I know that's not a common opinion; I'm sorry!). Still, I love these characters enough that I want to spend more time with them. We'll see! Have a good one!</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I’m gonna be digging into a few different things that I’ve picked up in the sale, and I won’t feel bad about telling you that one of them is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">FC 25</a>. I just really needed an on-the-go footie fix, even if it is running at 30fps on my Switch 2.</p>
<p>In much nicer news, I’ll also be having a blast on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, which I picked up despite it not scoring quite as highly as I’d hoped in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>. I’ve also been making progress in The Hundred Line - Last Defence Academy and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, so both of those will get some loving too.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>It is going to be hard to hold out on picking up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/earthion">Earthion</a> on Steam, but I really want to play this one on consoles. I did start making progress on Donkey Kong Bananza, and it is such a cathartic experience. Moving on to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/tekken_5">Tekken 5</a> while still progressing my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> World Tour save and moving upward to battle 25 on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>. The end game is still a long way off...</p>
<p>My game of the week is the incredible, shrewd move by SEGA! In an assault worthy of a true ninja, releasing the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> demo on the same day <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> got its own release was something out of guerrilla '90s marketing. Said entry in the Ninja Gaiden series is not only my game of the week but one of my GOTY candidates. And by the end of this month, I would write the exact same sentence about Shinobi were I not away on vacation. Truly, this is the Summer of the Ninja!</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend, I was going to do a bunch of garden stuff, but the weather is pants, so that means I'm going to stay inside instead. Now that my Tales of the Shire review is done and dusted, I can go back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>! Yayyyy. I'm on day 80-something, and I hear I have a lot more to do, so I'm looking forward to that.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm trying to keep my video game slate fairly open, because <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_grand_bazaar">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> comes out in a month, so I want to make sure I have time to fit it in.</p>
<p>Oh, and I've been playing <strong>Peak</strong> with friends. Very good, although I'm certainly not very good at it. I really need to work on being a team player and not just flinging myself up at cliff faces, then getting stuck...</p>

			<p>The biggest announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-digital-showcase-returns-on-august-1st/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2025</a> is definitely Darksiders 4. After Chronos: Before the Ashes and the two Remnant games, Gunfire Games returns to its historical franchise (the studio was founded by David Adams after the closure of Vigil Games, which developed the first two Darksiders titles). </p>



<p>The previous chapter was released in 2018 to relatively mixed reviews. However, 2019's spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/darksiders-genesis-top-down-or-third-person-hell-is-still-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Darksiders Genesis</a> (developed by Airship Syndicate) fared better and also introduced the final horseman of the apocalypse, Strife (the previous games allowed players to control the others: War, Death, and Fury).</p>



<p>Admittedly, Gunfire and THQ Nordic had teased a new Darkiders title during last year's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase. However, now we have a teaser trailer, and it shows us that the Four Horsemen will all work together for the first time in the franchise. As confirmed by the Steam page, this indeed means that online co-op will be available for the first time in Darksiders.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Choose Your Horseman<br></strong>Take up one of the legendary Horsemen—each with their own unique weapons and combat styles</li>



<li><strong>Cinematic Combat<br></strong>Experience fast-paced, visceral action blending melee, fluid traversal, and supernatural abilities.</li>



<li><strong>Expansive Realms to Explore<br></strong>Journey through apocalyptic landscapes - each teeming with secrets, enemies, and mythic bosses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not much else is known at this point, but it's certainly enough to get fans salivating about the series' culmination. Are you eager to end the Eternal War between the forces of Heaven and Hell? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

The completed 2,503-piece figure is 17.5 inches tall and is chock-full of references to other characters and places in Fortnite. Just like in the game, the formidable robot is an amalgamation of five different styles. The robot's blue left leg features a Durrr Burger foot, while the right leg is inspired by Uncle Pete's Pizza Pit and ends with a Tomatohead foot.</p><p>Mecha Team Leader's right arm is even more chaotic, as the Rex inspiration makes it look like a dinosaur is wielding the Sword of Singularity with its teeth. The left arm is modeled after the legendary fox Drift. The beautiful absurdity of the design is rounded out by the Cuddle Team Leader-inspired head and chest armor. Mecha Team Leader is basically a killer robot teddy bear. Sid from Toy Story would be impressed.</p><p>The Lego version of Mecha Team Leader has articulated hips, arms, feet, and a rotating head. A hatch on the robot's chest opens to reveal a cockpit for the included Cuddle Team Leader minifigure. The figure can also be displayed next to the buildable name placard.</p><p>The set includes two bonus outfits for Lego Fortnite the video game: Mecha Team Leader and Mecha Team Shadow.</p><p>Despite Mecha Team Leader's many callbacks to Fortnite lore, this set probably has the broadest appeal of any in the lineup. It would probably look cool on a display shelf next to Lego's Optimus Prime Transformers build. Ironically, Mecha Team Leader launched the same day as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-icons-transformers-soundwave-10358-buying-guide/1100-6533085/" data-ref-id="1100-6533085">Soundwave, the latest addition to the Lego Icons: Transformers</a> lineup.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible\/dp\/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Lego Fortnite Peely Bone (1,414 Pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible\/dp\/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$92 (was $100)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Prior to Mecha Team Leader, the Peely Bone buildable statue was the elaborate build in the series. The 1,414-piece display model was one of the four building sets that launched the Lego Fortnite series last fall. Like Mecha Team Leader, Peely Bone is packaged in a black box, which means it's geared toward adult collectors and experienced builders.</p><p>When fully pieced together and connected to the buildable stand, Peely Bone is over 14 inches tall and wields the Peely Pick Pickaxe and Paint Launcher. A Banana Bag Back Bling attaches to his back.</p><p>The included stand with a placard on the front may make Peely seem statuesque, but you can move the figures arms and bend the wrists to create different poses.</p><p>Peely Bone's half-skeleton, half-banana has a practical benefit here for those who enjoy dynamic builds, as you're working with entirely different pieces on each side. Plus, Peely Bone simply looks awesome, and the Lego replica is quite clever from a design perspective.</p><p>Peely Bone, like all of the Lego Fortnite launch sets, includes the in-game Operation Brite Starter Pack bonus. </p><p>At 1,414 pieces, the $100 build offers pretty great value--and even better value right now since it's on sale for $92.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Supply-Llama-Building/dp/B0DF85X82B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Fortnite-Supply-Llama-Building\/dp\/B0DF85X82B?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Supply-Llama-Building/dp/B0DF85X82B?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Lego Fortnite Supply Llama (691 Pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Supply-Llama-Building/dp/B0DF85X82B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Fortnite-Supply-Llama-Building\/dp\/B0DF85X82B?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Supply-Llama-Building/dp/B0DF85X82B?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$34 (was $40)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Supply Llama has been Fortnite's main mascot since launch, and this set lets you piece together your own Llama Piñata out of Lego bricks.

The Supply Llama's mouth can move, too. </p><p>The Supply Llama was a launch set, so you'll get the Operation Brite Starter Pack bonus.</p><p>Even at its full $40 price, the Supply Llama is cheaper than many licensed sets with around 700 pieces.

<p>Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/rumour-spongebob-squarepants-is-bringing-a-new-game-to-switch-2">a recent rumour</a>, THQ Nordic and Purple Lamp have now officially lifted the lid on the latest SpongeBob SquarePants game.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide">SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide</a></strong> will make its debut across multiple platforms including the Switch 2 later this year on <strong>18th November 2025</strong>, with pre-orders now live for <strong>€39.99 / $39.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's a bit about what to expect from the official PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Prepare to be scared – in the most nautical nonsense kind of way!</strong> When the Flying Dutchman and King Neptune’s egos collide, the result is pure undersea chaos: spectral mayhem spreads across Bikini Bottom, and only two brave(ish) heroes can set things right. SpongeBob and Patrick must team up, combine their unique skills, and (hopefully) stop the total ghostification of their world. From the depths of Neptune’s Palace to the icy peaks of Mount Bikini, fans will explore iconic locations, face epic bosses, and first and foremost: have F.U.N!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Alongside standard pre-orders, there'll also be a digital deluxe edition and ultimate edition of the game. These versions will include a Tidal Season Pass (also available for separate purchase).</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Order &amp; Digital Editions</strong><br>
Pre-orders are now live! Digital pre-orders include the <em>Natural Costume Pack DLC</em> as a bonus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Edition: Base game</li>
<li>Digital Deluxe Edition: Base game + Tidal Season Pass</li>
<li>Ultimate Edition: Base game + Tidal Season Pass + Natural Costume Pack + SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated (Game) + SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake (Game) + SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake - Costume Pack (DLC)</li>
</ul>
<div><p><strong>Tidal Season Pass (also available separately)</strong><br>

                <p>The Little Nightmares franchise has been creeping us all out since the original game landed in 2017, and the series continues its trends of unsettling creatures, dangerous exploration, and melancholy stories with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-599972">Little Nightmares III</a>. However, unlike the last two entries, Little Nightmares 3 also features online co-op, allowing you to face its eerie world with a friend. There are some limitations to consider, though, so here's what to know about Little Nightmares 3's cross-play and cross-progression functionality.</p><h2>Does Little Nightmares III have cross-play?</h2><p>If you were hoping to team up with friends for a spooky adventure, you may be out of luck. <strong>Little Nightmares 3 doesn't feature cross-play between different ecosystems</strong>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Little Nightmares III – 'You're Being Watched' Trailer</p>
      </div>
<ul><li>PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 users can play together.</li><li>Xbox One and Xbox Series X users can play together.</li><li>Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 users can play together.</li><li>PC players can only play with PC players.</li></ul><p>So, while you may not be able to join those on completely different platforms, it's good to know you can still hit up your friends who have previous generation console and bring them along for the ride.</p><p>Even better, <strong>Little Nightmares III comes with a Friend's Pass</strong>, which allows you to <strong>team up in online co-op with only one copy of the game,</strong> similar to games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/it-takes-two/" data-ref-id="5000-514264">It Takes Two</a>. You or a friend buys the game, then the other can join at no cost and play through the journey with you. However, you can only play on that save file with that friend going forward, so you'll need to start another save file to play the game in single-player.</p><h2>Does Little Nightmares III have cross-progression?</h2><p>We hate to be the bearer of bad news, but <strong>Little Nightmares III also does not support cross-progression features</strong>. This means that whichever platform you purchase the game on is the one you'll need to finish it on. You won't be able to move your saves between platforms.</p><p>Little Nightmares III launches October 10 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>

If you're a Pixar fan, this massive puzzle is an excellent project to take on. By the time you finally finish this puzzle, you'll likely want to watch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pixar-movies-in-order">all of the Pixar movies in order</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Buy a Puzzle or a Poster for Your Wall?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This depends on what you're looking for. Paper movie posters can really capture that traditional feeling of walking into a movie theater when they're in a frame, but puzzle movie posters like the ones above add a fun pop of personality to a room. Since they come in different sizes and styles - especially if you choose to go with one of the collage-style puzzles listed above - and you pieced them together yourself, they can add a nice personal touch to your wall. But again, it all depends on your personal preference of what sort of poster design you'd rather have up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're leaning towards framing the movie poster puzzles listed above, we can help with that, too. You can check out some of our favorite frames for puzzles in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">puzzle gift guide</a> and this <a href="https://zdcs.link/av48p8?object_uuid=f9d1f4ba-9fce-40f0-95e6-df22dc343bc6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RoseArt Jigsaw Puzzle Glue</a> will help you keep your favorite pieces together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 1, 2025 11:52 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-movie-poster-puzzles]]></content:encoded>

Now, after 15 years, the ending of the original game is revisited in the first teaser for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/darksiders-4/" data-ref-id="5000-638028">Darksiders 4</a>. The announcement video recalls Darksiders' closing moments as War is joined by his fellow Horsemen of the Apocalypse: Death, Fury, and Strife.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eafBknCPcI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The sequel was officially unveiled today during THQ Nordic's online preview event. The publisher confirmed that Darksiders 4 will continue the story directly after the first game and allow up to four players to ride together as the Four Horsemen through co-op.</p><p>Darksiders and its sequels take place in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a conflict between Heaven and Hell. War was initially blamed for triggering the apocalypse early, and then given the chance to prove his innocence by searching for the one responsible.</p><p>Death and Fury were respectively featured as the leading characters in Darksiders 2 and Darksiders 3. Then Strife took the lead in the 2019 spin-off title, Darksiders Genesis, which moved away from the series' third-person action in favor of a top-down view.</p><p>Darksiders 4 will return to the franchise's third-person perspective, and THQ Nordic states that it will have "cinematic" action that is "fast-paced" and "visceral," with melee and supernatural abilities at players' disposal.</p><p>THQ Nordic hasn't set a date for Darksiders 4 yet, but it will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> is just around the corner, promising more looter shooter shenanigans than ever before with its seamless open world design and exciting new traversal methods. There's a ton to look forward to when the game lands on September 12, and it's certain to keep you busy for many months beyond. But what if your friends are picking the game up on a platform you don't have? And what if you want to carry your saves between different ecosystems? We've got the answers about Borderlands 4's cross-play and cross-progression below.</p><h2>Does Borderlands 4 have cross-play?</h2><p>If you have friends playing on different platforms, we've got some good news for you. Borderlands 4 supports cross-play functionality across every platform, letting you team up with any of your pals for some lootin' and shootin'.</p><p>Before you can begin playing with anyone on another platform, however, you'll need to <a href="https://shift.gearboxsoftware.com/home" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for a SHiFT account</a>. This is a "Gearbox account," for all intents and purposes. Without one, you'll be limited to playing with players who own the game on your platform.</p><p>A SHiFT account has other benefits beyond just cross-play functionality, though. It also allows you to redeem SHiFT codes for special in-game items in the Borderlands series. These codes are often shared during various promotions on social media and beyond, so keep an eye out for them.</p><h2>Does Borderlands 4 have cross-progression?</h2><p>As for cross-progression, nothing has been shared about Borderlands 4's cross-save features quite yet. The franchise's two most recent games, Borderlands 3 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, did not feature cross-save functionality. So, it would certainly be nice to finally be able to carry save data between different platforms--but we'll have to wait and see if Gearbox goes all-in on this feature. Even if they do, though, it's important to remember that you'd need to purchase the game on every platform you want to move saves between.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches September 12 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC, with a Nintendo Switch 2 version following a few weeks later on October 3.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">GOG launched a new website Friday where users can claim 13 games that have been delisted from other online sales portals for free. In a press release, GOG wrote that with the giveaway, it and the game publishers taking part are "taking a stand against the quiet erasure of creative works from digital shelves."</p><p dir="ltr">GOG's giveaway--found at the URL <a href="https://freedomtobuy.games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FreedomToBuy.games</a>, makes the games available for free to users for the next 48 hours. The titles are mostly sexually explicit and were recently delisted from other digital purchasing sites. GOG's site also includes an email link for developers or publishers interested in offering their games for free "as part of the protest."</p><p dir="ltr">"As an archival platform dedicated to protecting gaming history, we believe that if a game is legal and responsibly made, players should be able to enjoy it today--and decades from now," GOG wrote in a press release about the giveaway.</p><p dir="ltr">"We launched FreedomToBuy.games to make a statement: when games are delisted today because of discomfort, reviving them tomorrow becomes exponentially harder," it continued.</p><p dir="ltr">Sexually explicit games became the focus of controversy in July when thousands were abruptly removed from online game storefronts Steam and <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a>. Those removals were the result of pressure on the storefronts from payment processors like Mastercard and Visa to remove games featuring sexual content.</p><p dir="ltr">Payment processors were in turn pressured by a campaign by conservative anti-porn organization Collective Shout, which released an <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow ">open letter to payment processors on July 11</a>. The organization said it targeted the removal of games about "rape, incest, and child sexual abuse, and asked its members to <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/win-new-steam-policy-games-removed" rel="nofollow ">call and send emails to payment processors</a>. As <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamers-are-furious-about-the-censorship-of-nsfw-games-and-theyre-fighting-back/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired reported</a>, experts call this tactic "financial censorship," using financial institutions to sidestep platform rules by risking a seller's ability to do business at all. As a result of the campaign, hundreds of games were removed from Steam and, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/itchio-steam-collective-shout-sex-games-consume-me" rel="nofollow ">GameFile</a>, more than 20,000 games marked "not safe for work" were removed from Itch. (Itch released a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" rel="nofollow ">statement</a> regarding the situation and has begun <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">re-listing some NSFW games</a> if developers choose to make them available for free.)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542253" data-ratio="0.43043295502312" data-width="2379" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542253"></a><figcaption>freedomtoplay.games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Backlash to the delisting began immediately, as many developers and players saw the situation as payment processors dictating to adults what content they were allowed to buy and play. Many developers also said that their games were caught up in the delisting sweep not because they contained pornographic content, but because they focused on LGBTQ elements and themes, or dealt with tough topics like sexual abuse.</p><p dir="ltr">Players and developers have taken to social media to put pressure of their own on payment processors to push against what they see as censorship. The International Game Developers Association released a <a href="https://igda.org/news-archive/press-release-statement-on-game-delistings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> where it called for "clear rules, fair warnings, and the right to appeal" in this and similar situations, and directed developers to contact Visa and Mastercard directly, and to petitions from the <a href="https://action.aclu.org/petition/mastercard-sex-work-work-end-your-unjust-policy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">American Civil Liberties Union</a> and <a href="https://www.change.org/p/tell-mastercard-visa-activist-groups-stop-controlling-what-we-can-watch-read-or-play" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Change.org</a> pushing back on censorship from payment processors.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mastercard-responds-to-censorship-allegations-after-forcing-storefronts-to-remove-adult-games/1100-6533641/">Both Mastercard and Visa have issued statements</a> saying the companies do not make moral judgments about merchandise sold by partners, and both suggested there was an issue of potential illegality at the heart of the situation.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations," <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" rel="nofollow ">the company said</a>. "Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content."</p><p dir="ltr">Visa made a similar statement to Polygon, saying it requires "enhanced safeguards" for merchants facing "an elevated risk of illegal activity."</p><p dir="ltr">"We do not make moral judgments on legal purchases made by consumers," the statement said. "Visa does not moderate content sold by merchants, nor do we have visibility into the specific goods or services sold when we process a transaction. When a legally operating merchant faces an elevated risk of illegal activity, we require enhanced safeguards for the banks supporting those merchants."</p><p dir="ltr">No claims of potential illegality have been made about any games removed from platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">GOG's FreedomToBuy.games website leads with a statement that could be seen as addressing the legality argument.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some games vanish. Not because they broke the law but because someone decided they shouldn’t exist," the site reads. "For 48 hours, these games are free, because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it."</p>
