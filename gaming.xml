<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a27af05310361/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>For those of you who managed to bag a Switch 2 on 5th June, you've had that big dock set up near the TV for exactly three months now. Are you tired of 'clacking' those Joy-Con into the system yet? Nope, us neither.</p>
<p>In that time, we've seen over 50 games come to the platform, large and small. While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/developers-reportedly-still-struggling-to-get-switch-2-dev-kits">some devs are still struggling</a> to get dev kits, other tiny outfits have managed to secure a Switch 2 release. Nintendo is keeping its hands tight on the eShop reins and being very particular in who it allows on the platform, it seems - presumably to prevent a deluge of titles that might distract from the platform holder's early offerings.</p>
<p>So, compared to its predecessor (which is still getting new games on a weekly basis, in amongst all the unspeakable slop), the rate of new releases is much slower. And the fact that many S2 games are reworked versions of old software or ports from other platforms means 100% new experiences have been thin on the ground. For multiplatform gamers who don't have a backlog to keep them busy, it's possible you'd look at the lineup of available Switch 2 games below and feel...disappointed.</p>

<p>Then again, it's hard to argue with the quality, old or otherwise! With several all-timers in there, there's plenty to play, and the long-awaited <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> definitely injects some much-needed 'brand new' into the library. (We're still working on our review, by the way - we'll have it with you as soon as we can.)</p>
<p>But what do you think of the Switch 2 library as it stands? Are there any gems in there which have flown under the radar and surprised you? Have all the big hitters landed for you? How would you rate the games in your collection so far?</p>
<p>Now that we've crossed the threshold of 50 games, we'll be publishing our reader-ranked list of the system's best games very soon, so take a look at the lineup below and feel free to rate any games you've played accordingly. (If you've rated any game previously, thank you! It will show up in red already, so no need to do so again - unless you wanted to revise your opinion, of course.)</p>

<p>And finally, let us know what you think of the overall software catalogue up to now by scoring the overall offering:</p>

<p>For our money? The library so far is an incredibly solid base to build on — and there are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/27-upcoming-nintendo-switch-2-games-were-excited-for-in-2025">some very exciting games coming</a>. With record-breaking console sales in a suboptimal economic environment, Switch 2 is doing very nicely after three months. There's work to do, but the future's bright in Nintendo Land, so here's to that!</p>
<p><em>Thanks for rating. Okay, back to Silksong with you.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/poll-three-months-in-how-would-you-rate-switch-2s-library-so-far]]></content:encoded>

<p>One of those fresh rides is a bridge layer, and you best believe it'll end up wedged somewhere improbable with its wheels spinning helplessly once I get my hands on it. How can you mess up motoring towards a gap, and pressing the 'commence bridgening' button? It'll be possible.</p>

<p>Alongside that bridge layer in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2104890/view/521974992851698336?l=english">Rebuild expansion</a>'s offerings are two new Central European maps. The first,  Contamination, is all about cleanup duty following a train crash dumping something not nice in a river thanks to some earthquaking. Then, there's Wash-Out, which as its name suggests is a rather wet venture into a "reclaimed wasteland" to get an oil processor up and running again.</p><p>Developers Saber Interactive have split 100 new missions between the two, many of which will likely amount to pick thing up or unfuck this please, as is the runner series' tradition. I'm a tad disappointed in the fact that aside from the all-new Vostok MU-97 'Ant' bridge layer, the other four extra vehicles are just revamped versions of rides from the base game. There's a bridge layer conversion for the Tayga dump truck, plus beefed up variants of the Thunder scout, Tuz 119 scout, and Mule T1 crane lorry.</p>
<p>That's it for the stuff included in the expansion, but there's also some free stuff on top of that, in the form of the Wayfarer ST7050 fuel truck and some advanced difficulty options. The latter includes "tougher fuel management, harsher convoy conditions, and stricter recovery rules, while adjusting costs and economy for a more demanding, realistic experience".</p>
<p>While these are features some players have been asking for since release, back when <a href="https://www.vg247.com/roadcraft-review-streamlined-building-biz-beset-by-bumbling-ai-bobs">I reviewed it</a> I quite liked the fact that it omitted some of the nitty gritty management you've got to juggle in a lot of these games. It was something that helped set the RoadCraft experience apart from its muddy siblings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snowrunner">SnowRunner</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/expeditions-a-mudrunner-game">Expeditions</a>, both of which are still getting fairly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1465360/view/543367091067028490?l=english">regular</a> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2477340/view/541115291253342913?l=english">additions</a> for those who want an excuse to hop back into them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our Brendy summed the RoadCrafting experience up thus in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roadcraft-review">his review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>RoadCraft is a podcast game, in the same vein as Truck Simulator or Elite: Dangerous. There's a big place for games like this in the world, sims that excel in delivering a specific kind of wonderful and comforting boredom. Slow tasks that act as a reassuring sedative in the manic whorl of life. But RoadCraft's start-and-go flow makes it a bumpier ride for me. I was falling asleep, but I never quite drifted off into its promised dreamland.</blockquote>
<p>I can definitely see what he means about the constructadriving sim having a bit of a mixed-up ethos when it comes to taking it slow all of the time, or being able to speed along if you wish. As the Brendo also wrote, whether you enjoy RoadCraft'll likely depend on how much time you're willing to give it, especially when things go wrong.</p><p>If you've dug this sort of thing before and can clear the calendar, this Rebuild expansion looks a decent reason to fire it up. If only to see whether the bridge layer's as satisfying to use as the stump mulchers and tree harvesters.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Happy Silksong Weekend to all who celebrate. If you’re not playing the most anticipated game of the decade right now, I can only imagine it’s because you don’t own any gaming console or PC to play it on. So, here! Let me help you. <strong>The Xbox Series S is a wonderful option for an entry-level game system and right now it happens to be on sale</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3931/">It’s MSRP is $380, but for a limited time, you can grab one for 13% off at just $329.</a></p>
<p>Now for the elephant in the room… Back when the Xbox Series X and Series S first launched in 2020, the latter of which was priced at just $300. A few months back, Microsoft made and announcement confirming plans to raise the price of its consoles and games. The Xbox Series S went up by $80 to $380. So while this discount brings console down lower than the current list price, this Series S is still $29 more than it had been for five years (ignoring any other discounts over that time). It stinks, but it is what it is.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3931/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All-Digital Gaming Console</h2>
<p>This model comes with a controller and hold 512GB. It’s disc-free so you’ll be downloading all your games onto that internal storage or onto an external SSD which you can purchase separately. It may not have 4K gaming, but it can still produce higher than standard HD resolution at 1440p. Plus, it’s got HDR support to ensure that the darks look dark and the bright colors pop. It can handle refresh rates of up to 120FPS so performance is still pretty great.</p>
<p>Like it’s counterpart, the Xbox Series X, this console has a feature called Quick Resume. No longer do you need to worry about finding a save point when you want switch to a different game. You can suspend your gameplay in the background, hop into something else, then return to it later right where you left off. My apologies to any game dev who works on title screens because I only ever see those once.</p>



<p>Quick Resume is possible because of the Xbox Velocity Architecture, which also allows for super-fast load times.</p>
<p>You can enjoy streaming your favorite TV shows and movies right on the Xbox Series S. Download apps like YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max. While your games are locked to 1440p, you can still stream video from Disney+, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and more in full 4K.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3931/">For a limited time, the Xbox Series S is down to just $329.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mark-zuckerberg-sues-facebook-lawyer-meta-2000623429</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mark-zuckerberg-sues-facebook-sort-of.1289730/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you found that headline confusing, try to imagine the constant bemusing misery that arrives at the door of seemingly the only other Mark Zuckerberg, an attorney who is finding his life made increasingly complicated by the shared name. So even though it’s not actually Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg that’s suing Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, the mop-haired billionaire remains the cause of the consternation, because for Indiana lawyer Mark Zuckerberg, sharing the Facebook creator’s name is causing him massive issues in both his work and personal life, and indeed costing him lots of money.</p> <p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/04/mark-zuckerberg-sues-mark-zuckerberg/">As reported by&nbsp;<em>TechCrunch</em></a>, Mark S. Zuckerberg—a bankruptcy attorney from Indiana—is repeatedly having his paid-for Facebook posts removed by Meta, and his accounts closed down, on the inaccurate basis that he’s falsely impersonating Mark E. Zuckerberg, co-creator of Facebook—and he’s not getting his money back. He’s had enough.</p> <p>Speaking to Indiana’s WTHR, Mark S. explained that he and Facebook’s Zuck are the only two people he can find who share the name, meaning his situation is rather unique. Four times Facebook has suspended the attorney’s business account and deleted his firm’s advertisements, based on the belief that he’s deliberately trying to pass himself off as the tech billionaire, and then failing to return his resulting lost costs. So this Zuckerberg is now suing that Zuckerberg to get his money back, his legal fees paid, and potential lost money as a result of Meta’s actions.</p>

  <p>“All my competitors advertise on Facebook,” says our new favorite Mark Zuckerberg, “so I have to do it too.” Speaking to the Indianapolis news station, he says he pays for ads, “they take my money, but then they shut me down.”</p> <p>Meta gave a statement to WTHR saying, “We know there’s more than one Mark Zuckerberg in the world and we are getting to the bottom of this.”</p>

 <p>Mark S. Zuckerberg’s life isn’t only affected in this way. It seems sharing his name with one of the most controversial figures in the world comes with a personal cost, too. He has in fact <a href="https://iammarkzuckerberg.com/">dedicated an entire website to the topic</a>, on which he talks about how even his personal Facebook account has been suspended five times, despite providing three forms of identification each time he re-opens it, and when it’s working he’s the constant target of hacking attempts, while his phone blows up with notifications every night. (Dude, come on, just turn the notifications off. And don’t even have the app on your phone. No one should. It’s looking at data from all your other apps.) His office receives daily phone calls from furious people demanding tech support, and he says he “routinely” receives death threats and harassment via Messenger.</p> <p>In fact, at one point he was <a href="https://iammarkzuckerberg.com/docs/20250821111936235R.pdf">accidentally sued by the State of Washington</a>, which somehow mistook him for the other guy. And that must suck. Short of changing his own name (and really, the world should surely be able to cope with two people using it), he’s left resorting to legal action to at least not have it cost him money. Oh, and the attention it’s attracting in the press probably won’t do him much harm, either.</p> <p>Mark S. Zuckerberg’s site ends on a lovely note:</p> <p>“Like I said, I don’t wish Mark E. Zuckerberg any ill will at all. I hope the best for him, but let me tell you this: I will rule the search for ‘<a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=mark+zuckerberg+bankruptcy&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zuckerberg bankruptcy</a>‘. And if he does fall upon difficult financial times, and happens to be in Indiana, I will gladly handle his case in honor of our eponymy.”</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mark-zuckerberg-sues-facebook-lawyer-meta-2000623429]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo has just kicked off its Switch 2 era of gaming, but the company is also saying goodbye to its 3DS line of handheld gaming consoles. While Nintendo continued supporting the 3DS and its various models via a repair service in Japan, even after the systems were discontinued, Nintendo began to slowly wind down these operations over the years. The New Nintendo 2DS XL was the last console to be officially supported in this way, but the company has announced that this is coming to an end.</p><p>"As we have run out of parts needed for repairs, we have discontinued repair services for the New Nintendo 2DS XL as of September 4, 2025," Nintendo said in a statement (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-ends-repair-support-for-new-2ds-xl-meaning-all-3ds-models-are-now-no-longer-supported/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). "Repairs for all other Nintendo 3DS series systems have also been discontinued."</p><p>This effectively brings the Nintendo 3DS era to a close, as Nintendo no longer has the parts necessary for it to perform repairs on units submitted to its Japanese facilities. The company ended support for the original 3DS handheld in August 2024, and it ran out of parts for the Nintendo 2DS not long after.</p><p>It's also worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u-eshop-stores-will-shut-down-march-2023/1100-6500734/">Nintendo closed the eShops for the 3DS and Wii U console back in 2023</a>, with repair support for the Wii U ending last year. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-is-is-the-last-week-your-3ds-and-wii-u-games-will-work-online/1100-6522326/">3DS doesn't have online-play functionality anymore either</a>, it's still home to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-3ds-games/2900-3935/">rich collection of games</a> that are available in a physical cartridge format.</p><p>The 3DS was a solid performer for Nintendo, as it went on to sell 75.9 million units worldwide during its run. The evolution of the best-selling Nintendo DS handheld offered an interesting 3D screen gimmick, but later models, renamed to 2DS, would drop this feature entirely. At one point, Nintendo even sold a 2DS that didn't have a clamshell design and was geared toward younger members of the family.</p><p>Meanwhile, it looks like the Switch 2 is off to a solid start. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-massively-outpacing-switch-1-sales-so-far-in-the-us/1100-6534305/">Sales of the Switch 2 are outpacing sales of the original Switch in the US</a> by a wide margin, with 2 million units sold as of August 27.

Since being acquired by the Xbox maker in November 2018, the Irvine outfit has released an impressive roster of titles including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pentiment</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Outer Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A sequel for the latter will be dropping in October.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio's other sophomore effort, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, is already available in Xbox Game Preview and Steam Early Access. But what pushed Obsidian to revisit the little-becomes-large world of Grounded with so many other irons already in the fire?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Two words: Insect mounts.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During an interview with Game Developer on Gamescom 2025 show floor, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">game director Chris Parker and creative director Justin Vazquez from Eidos-Montreal—which is co-developing the sequel alongside Obsidian—suggested the title might not exist if players hadn't insisted upon bestriding bugs.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This was the main feature we wanted to bring to the game," says Vazquez. "It was the number one request from the community and it was the biggest justification as to why we wanted to create a new world in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Even if the team had wanted to do it in the first one, the world wasn't built to support it."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/shuhei-yoshida-devs-in-emerging-markets-can-soar-with-authentically-crafted-titles" target="_self" data-discover="true">Shuhei Yoshida: Devs in emerging markets can soar with 'authentically crafted' titles</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vazquez explains that mounts, appropriately named 'Buggies' by the dev team, had to be designed hand-in-hand with the environment itself. "We often say we couldn't have done Buggies without the park, and we couldn't have done the park without Buggies," he adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On paper, it might sound like a mechanic that's fairly easy to implement. But adding mounts to a title like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> impacts the experience in a massive way. Parker explains that if you make Buggies too fast, then traversing on foot instantly becomes punishing. But, if they feel too sluggish, you'll have players questioning why they were included in the first place.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Once you've figured out how fast you want the Buggie to go, then you have to figure how far apart you want the different point of interest in the world" he continues. "Then you have to tune both of these things hand-in-hand at the same time. You have the same sorts of issues with combat. Once you start fighting stuff, you're balancing for both on-foot combat and Buggie combat."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, Parker says that Buggie combat had players feeling "invulnerable" during early tests and nobody was dismounting to explore as a result. The development team quickly readjusted, but then found they'd made Buggies too weak. In the playtests that followed, nobody used Buggies at all.&nbsp;"You get into these tug-of-wars with balance that was really quite challenging," adds Parker.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/unlocking-the-vault-designing-shadow-complex" target="_self" data-discover="true">How 'playful paper prototyping' paved the way for Shadow Complex - Unlocking the Vault #1</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early access development is about unearthing &quot;identifiable and actionable problems&quot;">Early access development is about unearthing "identifiable and actionable problems"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early access is a blessing and a curse when fighting those battles. Vazquez says the more time you spend in early access, the more feedback you receive. That can be incredibly useful, but as production gathers pace and more and more systems come online, it can also become overwhelming.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's why it's vital to be intentional when introducing new features to players—even when you're in the middle of that early access process. "That's the balance we have to find. When is a feature complete and ready enough that we feel getting it into players hands will be valuable and still feel like a complete experience for them, but isn't so finished that there isn't room for the community to give their feedback and put their stamp on it?" Vazquez adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Buggie is a really good example, because originally we had a ton of ideas about all the different Buggies we wanted to do, but one of the first big questions we asked ourselves was 'how many do we want to do before we get them into players' hands?' The decision was made to do just two as well as possible and hand those over to players so we could get really meaningful feedback that will help influence our future Buggies."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-developers-can-learn-from-the-indie-social-co-op-games-topping-the-steam-charts" target="_self" data-discover="true">What developers can learn from the indie social co-op games topping the Steam charts</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Parker says separating useful feedback from the cacophony of noise is a "tricky process." He explains Obsidian has a comms group that helps the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">team sort through everything the community is saying. The studio also uses Discord bots to let fans vote on gameplay features and other additions. The development team then gathers once a week to discuss those requests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We kind of reprocess [the feedback]," says Parker. "We need to understand, when a player finds something good or difficult or whatever, whether that's a symptom of another problem. [...] By addressing this thing, will we fix that? There's a lot of philosophical conversation that goes into that."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Vazquez, early access is about translating the feelings of players into "identifiable and actionable problems" the development team can address.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How long will it actually take to balance all of those equations is anybody's guess. Parker explains he's unsure whether there's an "optimal" early access timeframe, but says it's important for people to have dates and goals to shoot for so they can evaluate their progress. He does, however, confirm that he doesn't want </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grounded 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to still be kicking around in early access in five years time, so expect a full launch before 2030.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> has today received its fourth update since release, as developer Build A Rocket Boy attempts to turn around the game's fortunes.
</p>
<p>
Available now across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Update 4 brings improvements to the user interface, performance enhancements, and bug fixes. However, more is due in the fifth update, with the studio promising "a major performance, combat and Enemy AI system improvement".
</p>
<p>
MindsEye was heavily criticised at launch for its poor performance, among other issues. At the time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">Build A Rocket Boy acknowledged problems</a> and stated it was "working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles". At the end of June, shortly after release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-developer-reportedly-prepping-for-layoffs-after-botched-launch">layoffs were confirmed</a>.

<p>According to a new report, Steven Spielberg really wanted to direct a ‘Call of Duty’ movie and even pitched for it.</p>



<p>For those who have been living under a rock, Paramount and Activision have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-is-officially-making-a-call-of-duty-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed on a deal</a>, and the former has officially acquired the rights to produce a Call of Duty movie. However, we still don’t know who will be writing and/or directing the film or who will star in it. A new report reveals that the Call of Duty movie was almost directed by Spielberg. </p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-movie-nearly-had-steven-spielberg-as-its-director">Call of Duty Movie Nearly Had Steven Spielberg As its Director</h2>



<p>The details about Spielberg wanting to direct a Call of Duty movie through Puck’s latest <a href="https://puck.news/newsletter_content/what-im-hearing-spielbergs-call-of-duty-pitch-phil-suns-exit-the-rock-rebrand-a-rotten-reckoning/#selection-2355.0-2381.131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">newsletter</a>. According to three of their sources, “Steven Spielberg really wanted to direct the&nbsp;CoD&nbsp;movie and his Amblin teamed with Universal dealmaker Jimmy Horowitz to present the filmmaker’s vision for one of the world’s biggest gaming franchises.” </p>



<p>The report adds that Spielberg is “famously a big gamer” and has a special love for the Call of Duty franchise. However, when bringing Spielberg on, Activision would have to abide by his rules, which include top-of-market economics, final cut, and full control over production and marketing. These requirements “spooked” Activision, and they opted for David Ellison’s pitch instead, as it provided them with more control over the movie.  </p>



<p>Nevertheless, as this information does not come from an official source, readers should approach it with caution. </p>



<p>In other news, Call of Duty is set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-will-drop-100-gb-in-an-upcoming-ps5-update-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drop 100 GB</a> in an upcoming PS5 update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Forget the weather or the date, you know we’re in a new season because of the games coming out. That’s right, it’s straight into silly season, with Silksong’s launch crashing all the console and PC stores yesterday, Hell Is Us, Cronos: The New Dawn and more! I’ll personally be making a start on Indiana Jones’&nbsp;The Order of Giants DLC today.</p>
<p>But maybe it’s actually spooky game season already? I’d say it traditionally starts in October, but Laura has other ideas, as she’s been playing Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden. She says, “It’s fun switching between characters and I’m enjoying getting into Banishers lore. Plus Red has the most luscious Scottish accent, so what’s not to love?”</p>

<p>Adding weight to the spooky games in September theory is Steve, who’s reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/cronos-the-new-dawn-review/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> from Bloober Team –&nbsp;“I enjoyed it a lot and will play NG+ on when I find the time.” But time waits for no man, so he’s also been playing the “aggressively mediocre” Lost Soul Aside for review, a bit of Davy X Jones as it heads into Early Access, and has jumped into the classic action adventure of Otherskin. Ha, and he’s made a start on Silksong as well, so there’s that!</p>
<p>Aran has been continuing on with Wild Hearts and reckons he’s getting to the ending, so he’s grinding his way through gear upgrades before tackling the finale. Gringing away to improve his own skills is Ade, who’s sticking with Marvel Rivals, has joined a faction and is even thinking he might take part in an upcoming PlayStation Tournament thingy.</p>


<p>It’s been BlazBlue Entropy Effect for Jason, who says that “it slaps” and demands to know “Why did nobody tell me about it sooner?” He’s also been playing He Is Coming, but cannot get a win in the Kingmaker mode.</p>
<p>It’s been a struggle for Nic, who’s little one is poorly and had no time to play games because of it –&nbsp;I helpfully suggested Dr. Mario or the old Trauma Center games –&nbsp;and Gamoc’s also had a somewhat sucky time of it, but has snuck in some The Rogue Prince of Persia, Ghost of Tsushima, HIrogami and Discounty, albeit only in smaller doses.</p>

<p>And finally, Dom has played some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/madden-26-review/">Madden 26</a> and Star Wars: Outlaws on Switch 2, and you’ll soon get to read about just how impressed he is with the latter this afternoon, while Jim played some Sword of the Sea which, “to nobody’s surprise, is a cross between Journey and ABZU.”</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing?</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> shines on Nintendo Switch 2, which seems to provide a better handheld experience than the Steam Deck.</p>



<p>A new video shared today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> compares the extremely successful second entry in the series by Team Cherry running on Nintendo Switch 2 and Steam Deck, highlighting how the two systems handle the game. The differences aren't massive, unsurprisingly, but they are big enough to make some players gravitate towards either of the systems, as the Nintendo Switch 2 offers a superior handheld experience thanks to its bigger screen with 120 FPS support, while the Steam Deck offers better versatility in docked mode, capable of pushing past 120 FPS with ease at multiple resolutions. The game's native support for the Steam Deck's 1280x800p resolution is also rather welcome, as well as the slightly faster load times, compared to the Switch 2 version. All in all, there's no clear winner, but for handheld play, it seems like Hollow Knight: Silksong is best experienced on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong has been in the works for a long time, and the almost complete silence Team Cherry held since the game's announcement only added to fan excitement, which literally exploded yesterday when <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-launch-19-99/">the game finally launched on PC and consoles</a>, overwhelming Steam and other digital stores as users rushed to download the game. Needless to say, the game is setting out to be a smashing success and of the most popular releases of the year, as it managed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-shatters-original-steam-user-record-within-minutes/">beat its predecessor's Steam concurrent users record in mere minutes.</a></p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch. The game is also available as part of the Xbox Game Pass library.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> developers Team Cherry are "working to improve" the game's Simplified Chinese translation, following "quality issues" which have seen its Steam user reviews from those speaking the language drop to "mixed".</p>
<p>As you can easily see thanks to Steam's recent introduction of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-now-has-language-specific-review-scores-which-might-make-identifying-certain-review-bombs-easier">language-specific review splits</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/#app_reviews_hash">the mixed reviews</a> are unique to the 6,382 people who've left verdicts in Simplified Chinese so far. For every other language, including Traditional Chinese, the impressions being left are either mostly or overwhelmingly positive, though it's worth noting that a sizeable number are more shows of support for Team Cherry than proper reviews, being based on less than an hour's playtime.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Team Cherry have clearly spotted this, with the studio's marketing and publishing director Matthew 'Leth' Griffin having <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1963798473700168146">posted a message</a> to Chinese-speaking Skongers. "We appreciate you letting us know about quality issues with the current Simplified Chinese translation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>," he tweeted. "We'll be working to improve the translation over the coming weeks. Thanks for your feedback and support."</p>
<p>Issues with this translation of metroidvania were <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595157852293939174/">flagged online</a> as early as its recent Gamescom demo in late August, with one user describing it as "terrible" and adding "if there are no changes in the official version, I am afraid there is a risk of bad reviews".</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another user in that thread added: "If the demo’s text reflects what we’ll see in the final release, I must say the translation style in the demo differs greatly from the first game. Many lines feel unnatural, and some are even quite awkward or confusing in Chinese."</p><p>According to our Guides Writer Jeremy, who's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-bosses-made-unkillable">half-Chinese and categorises his knowledge of the language as moderate with speaking fluency</a>, the unnaturalness of the translation appears to stem from the use of classical grammar, a bit like an English translation which uses words like 'thee' and 'thou'. Shakespearean Skong. Sounds like it could be a fun time, were you not just trying to lose yourself in a game you've waited ages for.</p>
<p>Wherefore art thou, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-out-hollow-knight-silksongs-hiding-a-sneaky-stardew-valley-creatorman-cameo">Eric Barone cameo</a>?</p>
<p>Here's hoping Team Cherry's planned translantion tweaks do let Chinese players enjoy jumping about as Hornet as much as many other Steam reviewers appear to be, without being subjected to bardly prose.</p>

              <p>The Switch 2’s game key cards have <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-key-card-game-cart-physical-list-confirmed-1851777742">proven a source of extreme consternation</a> since the launch of Nintendo’s latest console. Physical carts in plastic boxes that don’t actually contain the game at all, making a mockery of game preservation and the entire purpose of owning a physical copy of your game. The reason for their use is usually presumed to be cost, given how expensive a 64GB Switch card is for a publisher (apparently $23 each!), and that Nintendo <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-cartridges-new-size-capacity/">right now</a> is not offering a smaller option to publishers. However, in the case of Ubisoft’s <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> it seems it’s a due to a more significant weakness of the Switch 2.</p> <p>So far, tech geeks are super-impressed with how Ubisoft has managed to get such a large, complex open-world game working on the handheld console. As much of a step up from the original Switch as the Switch 2 might be, it’s still not exactly cutting-edge technology, and the requirements to be able to run on a handheld device can be restrictive. So great work by all involved! However, <em>Outlaws</em> has become yet another entry in the very long list of games releasing with nothing but a game key on an otherwise blank cart, and understandably people are narked about spending $60 to buy a pile of empty plastic.</p> <p>More than anything else, it’s the knowledge that Nintendo absolutely&nbsp;<em>will</em> one day switch off the eStore that processes the keys to allow the games to be downloaded. As with every previous generation of digital store, the servers will go away, and the purchased games will disappear into the ether. This leaves people either looking at emulation (which Nintendo deeply loathes), or re-buying the same game again when it’s released as a “Classic” download on the newer device (where, hilariously, Nintendo makes it available via emulation). This all enormously sucks. So yes, one day your copy of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> Switch 2 will be nothing but a very bad-tasting SD card.</p>

 <p>Except, it seems in this particular instance this isn’t an act of cost-cutting on a premium-price game. (For whatever reason, <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-max-cartridge-size/">Nintendo has only offered 64GB cards for the Switch 2</a>, driving up production costs and encouraging many to resort to key cards instead.) However, according to Rob Bantin (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">thanks <em>Nintendo Life</em></a>), the audio architect on <em>Outlaws</em>‘ engine Snowdrop, it’s because the streaming speeds between the Switch 2 carts and the console just aren’t fast enough to run the game properly. And that seems like it could be a big deal.</p> <p><em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s John Linneman <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dark1x.bsky.social/post/3lxx7nqqits2t">posted on BlueSky</a> to report how impressed he was with the port, reposting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m_cu6LfAuA">VCG’s video about the tech</a>, adding that&nbsp;<em>DF</em> has its own video on the way. Others replied, one person pointing out that the game is somehow only 20.2GB, but another expressing disdain that it’s a key card. After a bit of back and forth, Rob Bantin entered the conversation and revealed all.</p>   <p>“Snowdrop relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments,” said Bantin. “And we found the Switch 2 cards simply didn’t give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for.” In other words, the game needs to be full installed on the console’s SSD drive to be able to run properly. The audio architect continued, “I don’t recall the cost of the cards ever entering the discussion – probably because it was moot.”</p>   <p>It’s hard to know how big of an issue this is going to be for the Switch 2 over the next seven or eight years of its likely life, but given a 2024 port can’t run off the card because of speed limitations, other larger, open-world games could share some similar issues. We’re talking about games releasing in 2030 after all. However, Bantin offers some optimism. “I think if we designed a game for Switch 2 from the ground up it might have been different,” he added. “As it was, we’d build [sic] a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later. In this case I think our leadership made the right call.”</p>

 <p>We’re stepping beyond my nerdy understanding here, but from my research the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lwgdn433kc27">Switch 2 cards are limited</a> to 400MB/s transfer rates, while the <a href="https://www.thessdreview.com/our-reviews/sd-express/nintendo-switch-2-powered-with-silicon-motion-sm2708-sd-express-controller-for-800mb-s-speeds/#:~:text=The%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%20console,the%20normal%20NVMe%20SSD%20protocol.">Switch 2’s SSD can offer close to 900MB/s</a>. So that’s a obviously a significant difference. However, it’s crucial to note that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> runs from its game card at 400MB/s, and there are few complaints there. So if games are intentionally designed for the Switch 2’s card limitations, this might not be a frequent issue? But, again, it does mean that releasing a cross-platform game could require a huge amount of heavy lifting to make a version that runs from a card, when the PlayStation, Xbox and PC versions will all be installing to SSD. (Why Nintendo doesn’t allow SSD installation from game cards is another massive question, and seemingly a very obvious solution.) And, let’s not forget, the Switch 2 will be overlapping the second half of its life with the inevitably PlayStation 6 and Xbox Series 2.</p> <p>It’s all a pretty pickle for developers looking to release big games on the Switch 2, without pissing off audiences and rendering their games ethereal.</p>

The true player count across all platforms will be much higher.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Silksong also launched DRM-free on GOG, so it was no surprise to see a cracked version available to download in the hours after launch. What was a surprise was the response from some veteran video game pirates, who urged their peers to support Team Cherry and buy the game instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First game I've bought day of release in a decade probably,” said pyrokzg on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1n8bkmo/that_was_fucking_fast/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the piracy subreddit</a> in response to a thread upvoted 7,000 times. “Not even the decade for me. It's the very first,” added Vamsi-Thopu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why is this happening? Clearly, there is a huge amount of goodwill from across the internet directed at Team Cherry, the small indie developer that saw the original Hollow Knight blow up to such an extent that it was able to take its merry time with this ambitious sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s also a feeling that Team Cherry does things the right way. For a start, there’s a DRM-free version available at launch, but the Australian studio was also keen to honor the promises it made with its original Hollow Knight Kickstarter all those years ago. There’s even a free upgrade for the Nintendo Switch 2 version. In short, Team Cherry are the good guys, and the feeling is they deserve their success.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong Release Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a 3-4 person team that has done right by their fans at every turn,” said No-Shape6053, also on the piracy subreddit. “Making sure the PC release is DRM free. Making sure all original backers of Hollow Knight get Silksong free on their choice of platform. This is a time where if we can afford to support them, we should.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Support the devs if you can, they deserve it,” added iTzNowbie.

"Team Cherry has built themselves an amazing reputation," suggested Someone_Existing_1. "Because they’re only a three-person studio, they can keep their games super cheap due to far less employees needing pay.

This lightsaber is Vader's version of the latter — meaning it was used for the fight sequences in both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back">The Empire Strikes Back</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/star-wars-episode-vi-return-of-the-jedi">Return of the Jedi</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/screenshot-2025-0ss9-05-111504-1757067447913.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Darth Vader's lightsaber.

"This is the weapon of the most recognizable character in science fiction history, featured in the most critically acclaimed film of the franchise, The Empire Strikes Back, and in the trilogy’s epic conclusion, Return of the Jedi.

			<p>A <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty/">Call of Duty</a> movie directed by Steven Spielberg could have been a thing, but Activision eventually refused the legendary director's pitch for a very specific reason.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://puck.news/newsletter_content/what-im-hearing-spielbergs-call-of-duty-pitch-phil-suns-exit-the-rock-rebrand-a-rotten-reckoning/">Puck News</a>, Steven Spielberg, who's a big gamer and a fan of the Call of Duty series, wanted to direct the movie based on the franchise, which sounded like a pretty great idea, considering how much some of his movies have influenced the franchise. Teaming up with Universal dealmaker Jimmy Horowitz, the director's team pitched his vision to Activision, which was reportedly spooked by the famous Spielberg deal, including top-market economics and full control over final cut, production and marketing. Instead, the publisher now owned by Microsoft went with David Ellison's pitch to retain more control over the movie, handing the production to Paramount.</p>



<p>Given the series's immense popularity, a Call of Duty movie was long overdue. <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-movie-in-the-works-paramount-skydance/">Announced earlier this week</a>, the first movie based on the Activision series could only be the beginning of a cinematic universe across film and television series, although, for the time being, the focus will be on this movie, whose director has yet to be announced.</p>



<p>The next entry in the series, which will be facing some serious competition this year with the highly anticipated Battlefield 6, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. The game is primarily developed by Treyarch, with support from Raven Software for the campaign development, which promises to <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-reveal-analysis/">shake things up quite a bit</a>. The game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One on November 14.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Late last month, players of Nexon's tactical schoolgirl gacha fest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blue-archive">Blue Archive</a> were horrified to discover that their universe had undergone Koyukification. For context, Kurosaki Koyuki is one of Blue Archive's recruitable characters, a twin-tailed pinkhead known for her immense natural code-breaking skills, her passion for gambling, and her mischievous persona. 
</p>
<p>
On August 31st, Blue Archivists logged onto discover that Koyuki had <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wesleypires.bsky.social/post/3ly2cxqdos22w">multiplied like a virus</a>. Cafes and arcades teemed with duplicates of the character. Her snaggle-toothed rictus filled the game's recruitment banners. The very information page - once a source of guidance and solace to so many - had been edited to read "nihahaha", in mimicry of the character's giggle. 
</p>
<p>
It was kind of like<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2fVfIejbfM"> this scene from Being John Malkovich</a>, if John Malkovich had been a freakazoid 15-year-old piker armed with a light machinegun. And also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBmH1M4DSSU">the closing scenes from Matrix Revolutions</a> (Koyuki's in-game nickname is "White Rabbit"), if Neo and Agent Smith had decided to lay off the kung fu and sample the local parfait.
</p>
<p>
How to explain these nightmarish events? It was a hack, obviously. As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/blue-archive-got-hacked-but-the-hacker-just-spawned-the-same-character-everywhere-without-touching-valuable-data-nexon-confirms/">Automaton West</a>, publishers Nexon took Blue Archive offline for a few hours that Sunday to expunge the excess Koyukis and carry out an investigation. Seemingly, this was the good kind of hack, carried out for the glee of it rather than to filch anybody's credit card details. Or at least, that's what they're saying publicly.
</p><p>
<a href="https://forum.nexon.com/bluearchive-en/board_view?board=3028&amp;thread=3123126">According to Nexon</a>'s subsequent notice to players, somebody managed to break into the game's content delivery network and mess with the environment settings, which are managed separately from the game itself, redirecting them to an IP address in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The hacker's changes only "affected the client-side content display", it seems. Nexon say that "players' accounts, game data, and payment information were not affected, as they are operated in a separate database and always revalidated by the game server."
</p>
<p>
You may find the idea of your online gameworld being suddenly suffused by goblin cryptanalysts amusing. Rest assured that Nexon do not. Aside from introducing new restrictions and countermeasures, they've reported the whole ordeal to the Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency. They've also prepared a player compensation package of in-game McGuffins to say sorry for the emergency maintenance period. Thoughts and prayers, etc.

</p>
<p>Is Blue Archive worth playing post-Koyukification? I can tell you nothing save that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHy8JmWX3kw&amp;t=62s">this trailer</a> thoroughly weirded me out with its bright and breezy scenes of school life in which everybody present is packing enough firepower to clear out a Terminid nest.</p>

            <p>
The games industry has been wracked by layoffs in the last few years, but over half of all layoffs have been in California, with North America overall the worst hit region.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Amir Satvat, who spoke to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/over-50-of-the-job-cuts-in-video">The Game Business</a> on the topic. Satvar was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-first-game-changers-recipient-responds-to-hateful-and-disturbing-comments-accusing-him-of-fraud">first recipient of the Game Changers award</a> at The Game Awards 2024 for his work assisting laid-off employees across the industry.
</p>
<p>
"Over 70 percent, and in some years 75 percent, of the layoffs have been in North America," said Satvat. "North America used to have 30 percent, 35 percent, 40 percent of the open roles, and that number is now down to 25 percent."
</p>
<p>
Globally, employment in the games industry has increased since before the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, though that depends on region. While Asia has seen an increase in jobs, North America has seen its workforce in AAA studios cut by 15 to 20 percent.
</p>
<p>
"And here's another stat," added Satvat, "over 50 percent of the cuts globally have been in California. California AAA is like the epicentre of the difficulty.
</p>
<p>
"There is opportunity, but it may be that if you want to stay in the industry, being open to going to some of these places like China, like Japan, not forever, but for some amount of time, that's going to become a larger part of the equation."
</p>
<p>
The most <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">high profile layoffs recently were from Microsoft back in June</a>, which included the cancellation of Perfect Dark from the California-based The Initiative, though developers were affected on both sides of the pond.
</p>
<p>
So far this year, an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">estimated 4400 people</a> have been laid off globally in the games industry.

            <p>Many of us have a few things to say about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>'s controversial game key cards, which don't actually contain game data, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-dont-like-nintendos-controversial-game-key-cards-you-can-now-let-the-company-know-directly">instead trigger a download from the Nintendo eShop when they are popped into the device</a>. However, developer Rob Bantin, who is an audio architect on Ubisoft's game engine Snowdrop, has revealed why the studio opted for key cards when it came to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-lands-september-switch-2-release-date">Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cubusaddendum.bsky.social/post/3lxzukm3glk2e">reply to Digital Foundry's John Linneman</a> about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' use of key cards and whether or not cost was a factor, Bantin explained that full-fat cards "simply didn't give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for".</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Bantin noted the Snowdrop engine "relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments", adding they "don't recall the cost of the cards ever entering the discussion - probably because it was moot".</p>
<p>The developer said had Star Wars Outlaws been designed for Nintendo's Switch 2 console from the beginning, things may have been different. "As it was, we'd build a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later," Bantin said.</p>
<p>"In this case I think our leadership made the right call."</p>

<p>Many third party developers have also opted for key cards for their own Switch 2 release. One high profile outlier was CDPR, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-developer-comments-on-switch-2-key-cards-says-having-proper-cartridge-with-a-plug-and-play-experience-is-right-thing-to-do">released Cyberpunk 2077 as a physical game cartridge with the actual game on it</a>. Last month, it was revealed that out of all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s Switch 2 sales in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-three-quarters-of-cyberpunk-2077s-nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-physical">over 75 percent were physical</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Silksong / Lone Fungus" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d620621c38f20/silksong-lone-fungus.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After an exceptionally long wait, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is out now on the Switch and Switch 2, and perhaps one of the most pleasantly surprising aspects of its launch is its price.</p>
<p>You're looking at <strong>$19.99 / £16.75 / €19.99 / ¥2300</strong> for the new release which, given the sheer length of its development and presumptions around its runtime, seems very reasonable indeed. Some folks, however, think that Team Cherry has legitimately priced the game too low, and therefore may be distorting players' expectations regarding what a $20 game should look like (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-hollow-knight-silksongs-cheap-price-a-problem-for-other-indie-games-devs-and-publishers-weigh-up-its-impact">Eurogamer</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ovyxik&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>First up is BastiArtGames, the solo-developer of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lone_fungus">Lone Fungus</a>, who took to <a href="https://x.com/BastiArtGames/status/1962412246039953783">X</a> and asked what its sequel, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2463220/Lone_Fungus_Melody_of_Spores/">Lone Fungus: Melody of Spores</a>, should be priced at now that Silksong has launched. The game was originally targeting a price of $20, which the developer had considered fair, but is now questioning whether it should be lowered to undercut Silksong.</p>

<p>Similarly, RJ Lake, who is directing the upcoming rhythm game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/">Unbeatable</a>, posted a thread stating that while he is pleased that Silksong is so cheap, it could have severe ramifications on how players perceive the value of games, stating that "'The Gamer' is a creature very bad at knowing why things cost what they do".</p>

<p>Developer Toukana, who worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> and is now about to release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719750/Star_Birds/">Star Birds</a>, told Eurogamer that the latter's price has also been affected following the game's short delay from 4th September to 10th September:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yes, Silksong's price has influenced our decision. We're trying not to compete too directly with Silksong, both in terms of release date and pricing. Of course, these are two very different games with potentially different player bases, but there's definitely some overlap. That makes things tricky, especially since Star Birds is a joint project between two studios, together employing more people than Team Cherry."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's an interesting situation, to be sure, but we also think a significant jump in price from the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> to Hollow Knight: Silksong would have almost certainly ruffled a few feathers. Given the anticipation around the game along with how few people were involved in its development, we reckon Team Cherry probably made the correct decision regarding price.</p>

<p><em>But what do you think, dear readers? Is Silksong priced appropriately, or do you think Team Cherry could have gotten away with pricing it higher? Let us know with a comment.</em></p></section>

			<p>Although you will often have to fight the mutated creatures known as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-how-to-defeat-armored-tier-3-orphans/">Orphans</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> isn't all about combat. In true survival-horror fashion, the game also features various puzzles that will test your knowledge of the mechanics in puzzle-solving as much as in combat.</p>



<p>While making your way towards your target a few hours into the game, you will get to explore the <strong>Hardware Store</strong>, a once-thriving store destroyed by the effects of the Change plague, just like humanity seems to have been. Inside this location, which is easy to spot thanks to signs nearby, you will find a few items you will very much need to stay alive, but this isn't why this store is so important, as you will have to explore it fully to obtain a<strong> critical item needed to proceed in the main mission.</strong></p>



<p>After looking around inside a bit, you will notice that there's a door leading into some office that cannot be opened with keys or any other item. In reality, the door is blocked by Biomass, which you will have to get rid of to proceed. Doing so isn't as straightforward as it sounds, as the Biomass is located inside the office, and thus has to be <strong>burned from inside the room you need to get into.</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The location of the gas can in the Cronos: The New Dawn Hardware Store</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>From the blocked door, if you head to the right and then to the left, you will find on your left again a window with a broken panel, allowing you to look inside, and more importantly, to shoot inside. <strong>Locate the gas can </strong>inside using the screenshot above as a guide, shoot it with your handgun and you will set the Biomass on fire, allowing you to finally open the door and enter the room. Inside, you will find the <strong>Bolt Cutter</strong> item you can use to open up the other locked door in the Hardware Store, as well as plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-should-you-bring-the-bolt-cutter-with-you/">other doors found all over New Dawn.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> co-founder Nigel Lowrie believes that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> could potentially be the first "AAAAA game".</p>
<p>Lowrie <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-this-years-gta-6-and-whether-a-juggernaut-stomping-on-your-release-date-really-matters">spoke with IGN</a> on the topic of video game delays in the wake of massive releases like GTA 6 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Yet even as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksongs-release-date-causes-delays-for-more-games-than-you-might-think">games shifted release due to Silksong</a>, Lowrie stated GTA 6 will be an industry-shaking event on a bigger scale.</p>
<p>"There are AAA games and then there's AAAA games and I'd argue that Grand Theft Auto is potentially the AAAAA game," stated Lowrie. "It's just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands."</p>

<p>Adam Lieb - CEO of video game marketing platform Gamesight - echoed similar sentiments in the piece, noting: "I would say that GTA for the last year and a half has been a part of almost every conversation around launch dates I have heard."</p><p>Lowrie is correct, of course. GTA 6 is positioned to be a truly monumental release, one that threatens to overshadow not just other games coming out in 2026 but prior releases throughout the history of the industry. The term AAAAA is apt to describe such a monster, though given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-says-70-skull-and-bones-is-a-quadruple-a-live-service-game">gaming's official first quadruple A game</a> Skull &amp; Bones was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review">truly a game like no other</a>, GTA 6 has a big task ahead of it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-whats-the-passcode-for-the-storeroom-lock/</link>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is a survival horror game inspired by some of the series that defined the genre like the Resident Evil and Dead Space, featuring almost every mechanic these series have introduced in the past years, such as limited resources, challenging fights against even the weakest of enemies, and <strong>locked doors that require The Traveler to locate keys and learn passcodes.</strong></p>



<p>During her journey, The Traveler will encounter the first locked door not long before awakening and heading towards her first target. This door is impossible to miss as it is right in your path, but you won't be able to open it as soon as you reach the storeroom, as you will need to input a passcode you have no way of knowing at this point.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The very first locked door you will encounter in Cronos: The New Dawn.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you ignore this locked door and proceed in your mission by following the waymarker, you will have to climb down some stairs and reach another big room where you will find some items and a rather<strong> unusual object you can interact with</strong>. This object actually stores a Travelog from another Travel, who will inform you the door in the room above can be opened by inputting the <strong>367</strong> code.</p>



<p>Although opening this door is not required to proceed in the main mission, you will want to backtrack a little to open it up and get the resources stored within. Cronos: The New Dawn is a little difficult in the first couple of hours, and you will need every help you can get to make it through some challenging fights. Also, consider holding onto the Energy you are gathering to purchase some <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/cronos-the-new-dawn-upgrades-to-get/">critical upgrades</a> that will help you even more during the beginning of the game.</p>

            <p>In case you missed it, a plucky little game no one had heard anything about whatsoever <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-on-steam-our-review-is-on-the-way">arrived yesterday</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Yeah, I know, it's news to me too. Anyway, what's also news is that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric Barone has a voice acting cameo in Skong. Though, he's being all coy about revealing when and where you can hear his dulcet tones.</p>
<p>This came to light because of some valiant folks who've already made it to Silksong's end credits, presumably having pulled mammoth sessions last night, as our own Ollie did to provide you lot with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">some helpful early game walkthroughs</a>. Or, you know, they've gone to the extras bit of the main menu and pressed the button that rolls the credits.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Barone's name is just chilling there in a section dedicated to additional characters voices, which also features Team Cherry marketing and publishing fellow Matthew Griffin. Naturally, the question is where do folks have to go to find Barone's cameo?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/771772/hollow-knight-silksong-stardew-valley-eric-barone-concernedape">The Verge</a>, who reached out to ConcernedApe LLC's head of operations Cole Medeiros, neither he nor Barone would just come out and say where the cameo is, despite confirming it is indeed <em>that</em> Eric Barone. Medeiros told the site that the Stardew and and also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a> dev would "rather not say which character(s) so as not to spoil any surprises for anyone".</p>
<p>I've not had a chance to join the RPS Skong hive currently reviewing/guiding/Edwining their way through Silksong yet, so I'm gonna take a big old stab in the dark as to which character Barone's voiced.</p>
<p>It's this one:</p>

<p>A new season in Marvel Rivals is right around the corner with Season 4, Heart of the Dragon, poised to land, alongside the latest balance changes with a host of buffs and nerfs.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 12</a>, Season 4 of Marvel Rivals has some big additions, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-4-trailer-confirms-ps4-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release on PlayStation 4</a>, a new character, new maps, and plenty more.</p>



<p>Balance changes are just as important as any new content, however, and we’ve got all the details on the buffs and nerfs in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-4-early-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a>.</p>

<p><strong>As is customary at the start of a new season, a huge number of balance changes are being made in Marvel Rivals, with buffs and nerfs to several heroes.</strong></p>



<p>In the Vanguard department, <strong>Peni Parker </strong>and <strong>Thor </strong>receive boosts to their Ultimate abilities, while <strong>Doctor Strange </strong>has increased damage output. On the flip side, <strong>Captain America </strong>and <strong>Emma Frost </strong>have both been nerfed, having dominated throughout Season 3.</p>



<p>Duelists receiving a boost in the patch are <strong>Scarlet Witch, Blade, </strong>and <strong>Moon Knight, </strong>with Blade still finding his feet following an introduction in Season 3.5, while Scarlet Witch and Moon Knight have seen their effectiveness drop off. Counteracting that are nerfs to <strong>Squirrel Girl</strong>, <strong>Black Panther</strong>, and <strong>Psylocke</strong>, while <strong>Magik </strong>has a bunch of changes following the removal of the Dimensional Shortcut Team-Up ability.</p>



<p>Finally, <strong>Invisible Woman, Jeff the Land Shark, </strong>and <strong>Ultron </strong>are receiving boosts, while <strong>Luna Snow </strong>is having the duration of her Ultimate ability reduced, and <strong>Loki </strong>is also affected by nerfs.</p>



<p>Here’s a full list of all the characters affected with buffs and nerfs.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-take-some-cues-sapkowski-latest-book/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-iv-will-take-some-cues-from-sapkowski%E2%80%99s-latest-book.1289598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, during Epic's State of Unreal presentation, we were <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treated to a stunning The Witcher IV tech demo</a> that served as a preview of the level of graphics fidelity CD Projekt RED aims for with the final game. Such a great demo excited the franchise's millions of fans in anticipation of the day they'll get to play it.</p>



<p>There's still a long way before the game's launch, though. While development has been going at full speed (and with more developers than ever, 444 at the last count), CD Projekt RED has confirmed that The Witcher IV won't release before 2027. In the meantime, fans are starving for tidbits, and one such thing was provided this week <a href="https://x.com/PhiWeber/status/1962953933871042847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a> by Narrative Director (previously Quest Designer on The Witcher III: Wild Hunt and Cyberpunk 2077) Philipp Weber. After sharing a picture of <a href="https://amzn.to/46m9C0h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crossroads of Ravens</a>, the latest book written by saga creator Andrzej Sapkowski (out on September 30 in English), a fellow user asked whether any of the book's points would be taken from this new book into The Witcher IV. This was Weber's response:</p>



<p><em>I can't reveal how exactly we'll do it, but Season of Storms also came out while we developed The Witcher 3, so we still tried to include some of the new elements. You can expect something similar!</em></p>



<p>Granted, Crossroads of Ravens is a prequel book. So was Season of Storms, but Crossroads of Ravens is the earliest book in the timeline as far as Geralt's character is concerned. As such, it's hard to imagine CD Projekt RED incorporating more than just a few general ideas into The Witcher IV, which takes place much later in the storyline.</p>



<p>The good news is that CD Projekt RED has long since 'solidified' its relationship with Sapkowski himself. As you may recall, Sapkowski, a self-progressed non-gamer, initially licensed the game rights for a relative pittance. After witnessing the enormous success of the third installment, though, the author eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-author-million-usd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanded $16 million from the Polish studio</a>, alleging that those rights were only valid for the first game. </p>



<p>A little over a year later, the two parties <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-solidifies-relationship-with-andrzej-sapkowski-creator-of-witcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a new agreement</a>, which included a 'framework for future cooperation'. As such, it is possible CD Projekt RED may have already picked Sapkowski's mind to ensure their vision for The Witcher IV is in line with the author's.</p>

Fear not, fans of spirit candy! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-cats-out-of-the-bag-stardew-valley-update-17-revealed-bagged-cat-content-tbc">The recent announcement of Stardew Valley 1.7 update</a> is not evidence that Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone's next game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a> has been banished to the realm of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-videogame-vapourware-no-silksong-allowed-edition">vapourware</a> - or so sayeth Barone himself, at least. In a brief and caveat-strewn Q&amp;A, the life sim creator has gone into more depth about development on Stardew, revealing that he's not as heavily involved with it as with previous updates. As such, he's still focussing "the vast majority" of his attention on Haunted Chocolatier.</p>
<p>It's even possible that the latter will release before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>'s next update, but let's not count our Cocoa Loco Little Choc Chicks (£6.99 minus delivery costs) before they've hatched.
</p><!--more-->
<p>

"Recently, I announced that there will be another major content update for Stardew Valley -- the 1.7 update," <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2025/09/02/on-the-recent-stardew-valley-1-7-update-announcement/">writes Barone on his blog</a>. "You might be wondering: If ConcernedApe is working on Stardew Valley 1.7, will that cause Haunted Chocolatier to take longer? The answer: Maybe a little, but not as much as you might think."
</p>
<p>

Barone goes onto explain that he's been working with a small team on Stardew Valley additions and fixes since update 1.3 - he's still "completely solo" on Haunted Chocolatier "for the time being". 
</p>
<p>
While he was "fully, personally locked-in on content development" for previous Stardew updates, Barone says that with update 1.7, "I have been trying to take more of a "creative director" role in the team, so that (at least for now) I can focus the vast majority of my attention on Haunted Chocolatier." 
</p><p>
"So far, it's been pretty good... we are working at a relaxed pace, we have a ton of ideas, and everything has been high quality," Barone continues. "Eventually, I will have to spend a little more time focused on Stardew Valley, because in order for me to maintain a full connection to the game, I need my hand to touch every piece of new content. And there are some aspects of content development which I insist on doing myself, like the music. 
</p>
<p>
"But with our "no release date" approach to the 1.7 update, it's not certain when that time will come. It might even be after Haunted Chocolatier comes out. (no guarantees though)".
</p>
<p>
Barone adds that "the reality of my life is that I have a very popular 1st game that I still want to take care of, which means that my 2nd game might take a little longer". Stardew Valley's audience is "still growing", he notes, and "it's hard to just stop improving it when there are still things that can be improved. But I hope the approach I am taking for Stardew Valley 1.7 will help keep Haunted Chocolatier on track."
</p>
<p>
Stardewman remains tight-lipped as to what update 1.7 might involve. We don't know a whole caboodle about Haunted Chocolatier, either, other than that it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/haunted-chocolatier-is-the-stardew-valleys-developers-next-rpg">more of an action-RPG than Stardew Valley</a>, and sees you staffing a chocolate shop with ghosts.</p><p>Let me laboriously do some Audience Engagement and ask: what kind of chocolate would you be <em>least</em> surprised to discover is made by ghosts? I've always found hazelnut truffles a bit sinister. I find that they mysteriously make me fatter - clear indications of paranormal activity.

Will it actually accomplish that goal? Who knows. Paramount boss David Ellison said the company hopes to take a few cues from other storming blockbusters like Top Gun: Maverick. It's a good start, but the proof will be in the pudding.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-keywords-subsidiary-high-voltage-games-learned-making-an-original-game" target="_self" data-discover="true">Dragon Front Adventures shows 'support studios' can win big with original projects</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game developers want to raise $200,000 for Palestine through new charity bundle"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/devs-unite-to-raise-over-200-000-for-palestinians-in-need-through-new-charity-bundle">Game developers want to raise $200,000 for Palestine through new charity bundle</a>&nbsp;</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">A chorus of game developers have rallied together to launch a new charity bundle in a bid to raise $200,000 for Palestinians in need.

It has raised over $32,000 at the time of writing, but there's always room for more.

Word on the street is that developers at both Crystal Dynamics and The Initiative were given a chance to salvage the title by seeking a new funding partner. Yet, despite talks initially progressing with a range of suitors including Grand Theft Auto owner Take-Two Interactive, disagreements regarding who would take ownership of the franchise seemingly created an impasse. The end result? More people out of work.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wildgate-and-sunderfolk-publisher-dreamhaven-is-making-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven is making layoffs</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Former Polygon staffers establish independent video game website Rogue"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/polygon-staffers-reunite-to-establish-independent-video-game-website-rogue">Former Polygon staffers establish independent video game website Rogue</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Video game journalists, much like developers, have been subject to a debilitating deluge of layoffs of late. Since the turn of the year, those under the umbrella of media conglomerates like Valnet and Ziff Davis have been kicked to the curb in the wake of major acquisitions. The solution for many has been to shun corporate ownership entirely and kickstart independent publications. Enter Rogue, a new worker-owned outlet established by seven former Polygon staffers. The website was formed in partnership with Rascal and will dish out news, guides, interviews, and more. Some articles (including most news and guides) will be free, while other content will be locked behind a subscription. The upshot of that reader-supported model, according to the founding team, is that advertisements and sponsored articles will be consigned to history. How does that sound?&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven is making layoffs"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wildgate-and-sunderfolk-publisher-dreamhaven-is-making-layoffs">Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven is making layoffs</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">More layoffs, this time at Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven.

Morhaime didn't explain why the company is making layoffs but indicated the company is "facing similar challenges" to others across the industry.

The game has been criticised for its disappointing performance, particularly on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, but a full fix is yet to be released.
