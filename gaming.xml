                <p>The biggest gaming announcement this week came from Valve when it revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">six-inch Steam Machine</a>, a new device coming in 2026 that will allow people to play PC games on their TV. Some have seen this as Valve attempting to enter the living room marketplace currently dominated by the mainstay platform-holders like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. But Valve apparently doesn't pay too much attention to existing consoles and instead came up with the idea for the Steam Machine by looking at the latest trends in PC gaming.</p><p>Software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that when Valve was setting out to create the Steam Machine, the company was "not looking at consoles or other products in that direction. Everything we do is informed by what's happening on the PC gaming side of things."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>At the same time, he admitted that there ended up being "quite a bit of overlap" because the Steam Machine aims to make PC gaming "work better in the living room and that's traditionally where consoles have been."</p><p>"But really I would say that most of our thinking is not informed by what's happening on the console side, and so I don't know if we have many theories as to where that might be headed," Griffais said. "But in general it seems like people seem to be recognizing that there's quite a bit of value in a more PC-like experience and the customizability and all that, and so we're happy to see more of these elements being embraced by platforms in general."</p><p>Rumors have suggested that Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console could take the form of a more PC-like system. In any event, Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said the company considers the Steam Machine to be a PC and not a traditional gaming console.</p><p>"The Steam Machine is just one option in the ecosystem of gaming PCs out there. If you're already happy with your PC gaming experience, that's great. We love that," he said. "We are a PC gaming company. We're just trying to give you more options. And that's how we view it. It's just something that we think is a really great addition to a living room or a desktop, but it's just one other option that people can have available to them to play their Steam games basically."</p><p>The Steam Machine, along with Valve's new Steam Frame VR device and the next Steam controller, will launch in 2026. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">Steam Machine pricing</a> has not been disclosed as of yet for any of the new devices, however. On the subject of pricing for the Steam Machine, Valve said it wants the system to be "affordable," but that doesn't tell us much. One analyst, Rhys Elliott, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">the "sweet spot" would be $400.</a></p><p>The Steam Machine runs the Linux-based SteamOS, similar to the Steam Deck, making the Steam Machine similar to the Steam Deck in a console form factor.</p>

		<p>Rockstar Games has announced that it will be releasing Red Dead Redemption for PS5, Xbox Series XS, Switch 2, iOS, Android, and Netflix, with this version being available on December 2nd. Those who own the PS4, Switch and digital Xbox One versions will get a free upgrade to the the new version of Red Dead Redemption.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption Coming to Netflix, iOS, Android, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlkizyzZ8k4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PS5 and Xbox Series XS versions will have 60 fps, up to 4K resolution, HDR support, and enhanced image quality. The Switch 2 version will support mouse controls, DLSS, HDR, and 60 fps. PS4 and Switch players will also be able to carry over save data so they can continue where they left off. The mobile version will have touch controls, and it will be this version on Netflix too. The updated version will also be part of the PS Plus Game Catalog and the GTA+Games Library.</p>

<p>Way back in 2010, we said in our review of Red Dead Redemption, <em>“Rockstar San Diego’s latest title is an unmissable game for any fan of the genre or great action adventures in general.&nbsp; We don’t often get masterpieces around here, but this is certainly one of those moments in time when gamers will look back more fondly on a dusty old six shooter than anything that involves jacking cars.&nbsp; The Wild West, then, is the new New York, and Rockstar have got their work cut out for them if they want Grand Theft Auto V to come anywhere near close to the majesty of Red Dead Redemption.&nbsp; A job we don’t envy.”</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-is-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-2-and-mobile-next-month.1353178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after a new ESRB rating hinted that Red Dead Redemption <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-switch2-ps5-xbox-series-port/">would be coming to current-generation consoles,</a> Rockstar <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258282o585k1ka/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-netflix-ios-android-ps5-xbox-series-and">officially confirmed the news</a> that both the base game and its Undead Nightmare DLC would be arriving on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 next month, December 2, 2025, with the additional surprise that it'll be coming to iOS and Android mobile devices, too.</p>



<p>For anyone who already bought Red Dead Redemption <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-ps4-switch/">on PS4, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch,</a> you won't have to buy it again, as Rockstar is making this a free update for anyone who already owns the game on any of those platforms.</p>



<p>On Xbox Series X/S and PS5, players can enjoy this new current-gen native version at 4K resolution, 60 FPS with HDR support and an enhanced image quality, while the Switch 2 version includes support for DLSS, HDR, and the Joy-Con 2's mouse controls. It'll also run at 60 FPS on Switch 2, according to Rockstar.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>On top of this new current-gen native version coming as a free upgrade, players on PlayStation subscribed to PlayStation Plus Extra will be able to dive into the game with its new update as of December 2, 2025, when it joins the library of PS Plus Extra titles. Players with a GTA+ subscription will also be able to jump in when it arrives through their subscription.</p>



<p>Regarding the mobile versions, while you'll be able to grab it on the Google Play or App Store, if you have a Netflix subscription, you'll also be able to access the game through the Netflix app as part of your subscription.</p>



<p>It's great to see Red Dead Redemption make its current-gen console debut, and to know that we'll be able to revisit this classic game on modern hardware at an appropriate resolution and frame rate. However, the matter of Red Dead Redemption 2 still being without a native PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version is still unsolved. </p>



<p>Hopefully, that's next on the docket, if Rockstar can find the time between <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">getting ready for Grand Theft Auto VI</a> and dealing with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/200-rockstar-north-employees-sign-letter-calling-out-management-vicious-union-busting/">backlash it has wrought upon itself through alleged union busting</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-the-kotaku-review.1353163/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-1-2-review-aaron-paul-critical-role-2000639678"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i></a><span>, the superhero workplace comedy by AdHoc Studio, oscillates between being a fun, low-stakes romp and the video game equivalent of those obnoxious YouTube brain-rot videos your edgy teen nephew can’t stop watching, and it does so with such whiplash-inducing intensity that there were points when I was genuinely unsure if I even liked the game. Yet, when the week-long gaps between its eight episodes started to close, I was always looking forward to spending time at Robert Robertson III’s desk and sending my team of ex-criminals out to save the day again.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As a video game, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>is a paper-thin, choice-based adventure game that seems kind of annoyed that I’m even holding a controller while its superpowered dramedy plays out. When it’s being a comedic, playable television show, it has almost as many misses in its jokes as it does belly-laugh-inducing one-liners. Then, as a management sim in which you’re sending heroes out to finish odd jobs, </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span> has all the complexity of your favorite time-killing mobile app. The individual pieces of </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>leave much to be desired, but when it’s all put together, it’s a breezy workplace sitcom that occasionally looks over its shoulder to ask for your input. I play its episodes like I watch </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span>: I don’t need it to change my life, but its weekly drops were a nice thing to look forward to.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000644111" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644111"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644111">© Adhoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Robert Robertson III is the latest in a family line of heroes. He, like his father and grandfather before him, pilots a mech suit under the name Mecha Man. Though he doesn’t have superpowers, his heroics have earned him respect in the local superhero community and the fear and disdain of the villains they take down. However, after a fight against his arch-nemesis, the enigmatic, calculating villain named Shroud, puts his robot out of commission, Robert finds lighter work behind a desk at the Superhero Dispatch Network. Here, he guides the Z-Team, a group of ex-villains looking for a new lease on life.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>These ex-cons are all a bunch of delinquents, but the lovable kind that you want to see succeed. Invisigal, voiced by Laura Bailey, is the game’s de facto leading lady, who hates teamwork and doing good, but volunteered for the SDN’s program. Flambae is the flamboyant, fire-manipulating bastard who doesn’t know that the guy who put him away is leading his team. Then there’s Sonar, the literal batman voiced by YouTuber MoistCr1TiKaL, who transforms between his more reasonable anthropomorphic form and his more unpredictable monstrous one. That’s not even half of the crew, but by the time </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s eight episodes concluded, I was pretty smitten with all of them. Each member has their own strengths, weaknesses, and relationships, and knowing them is what can make one of their episodic dispatch shifts a smooth operation or a managerial disaster.</span></p>

 <p><span>But manning the dispatch desk is only half of the team-building exercises </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>requires of Robert. The other half of the game is made up of mostly non-interactive story segments. Despite all he’s been through, Robert wants to believe in something, and if he can’t believe in himself, maybe he can turn this group of rehabilitated comic book villains into a real team that cares about the city and each other. Aaron Paul gives one of his more reserved performances after years of being synonymous with burnout characters like Jesse from </span><i><span>Breaking Bad </span></i><span>and Todd from </span><i><span>Bojack Horseman</span></i><span>, and while he veers close to monotony at times, he makes a good straight man to the more eccentric heroes he works with.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I really do enjoy the character dynamics of </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>, and when it’s not devolving into toilet humor, it’s got a lot of great gags, endearing relationships, and memorable dramatic moments and action sequences for you to QTE through. My trouble is that despite some entertaining writing and the occasional meaningful choice, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>feels like it’s railroading you throughout several of its supposedly big decisions. AdHoc is made up of ex-Telltale Games developers, and </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s approach to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-dialogue-options-chair-episode-3-golem-choice-2000640791"><span>time-based decision-making</span></a><span> feels mostly in line with how that studio’s old adventure games handled it. The major exception is that </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>almost never gives you the option to say nothing, like </span><i><span>The Walking Dead </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Tales from the Borderlands </span></i><span>did. If you let decisions time out, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>will choose one of its (usually binary) dialogue options for Robert to utter, and broadly, the game doesn’t do a great job of masking that it’s forcing you into something, no matter what you do or don’t pick.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000644107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644107"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644107">© Adhoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For example, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/devs-dispatch-telltale-superhero-game-cut-sex-scenes-romance-2000643646"><span>two competing romantic subplots</span></a><span> going on. Robert can get with either his subordinate, Invisigal, or his boss, Blonde Blazer. I felt like both of those relationships weren’t right for Robert at this point in his life, so I tried to circumvent romance entirely. However, as the episodes went on, it was clear to me that </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>was going to force me into one romance or the other, so I went with the one that felt less objectionable and wooed my boss. That’s a microcosm of what it usually feels like to make choices in </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>. There are some meaningful ones, like a point at which you choose to fire one person on your team and replace them with a new recruit of your choice, but those are so few and far between that I sometimes wondered if there was any real reason for me to engage with them. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>has a story it wants to tell, and the real, meaningful impact of your choices is only felt in a few key plot points.</span></p>

 <p><span>By the time I finished the eighth and final episode, I was invested in some of the decisions I’d made and felt like they culminated in a drastically different fate for some of the members of Z-Team, but a lot of them ended up feeling like they were only on the team as props for a few of the others. I rarely felt like I could touch the world of </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span> as a choice-based game, but I still cared about the outcomes, whether I was truly shaping them or not.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>was originally conceived as a TV show, so it makes some sense that the best parts of it are the ones that are tailor-made for that medium. Its animation pops, the performances range from alright to pretty damn good, and the actual workplace drama that acts as the foundation for all the management sim mechanics makes for a genuinely compelling adult animation story. You know, when it’s not aiming for the lowest hanging fruit (or testicles) for its jokes.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000644108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644108"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644108">© Adhoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As for its most video-gamey aspect, its management sim segments start pretty rote but become more complex over time. As Robert, you assign different team members to odd jobs around the city in real-time, with each character having different stats, passive abilities, and synergies with other team members. Objectives can time out, people need breaks between jobs, and sending the wrong person can snowball into a larger problem for the team if you just throw people at work at random. The micromanaging nature of </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s assignment systems is the stuff of your least-favorite retail middle manager’s dreams, but hey, at least in this scenario, you’re actually dealing with life-or-death scenarios while watching your workers’ break time whittle down and not being a cog in the machine of a multi-billion-dollar retail chain.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"SDN: when you're here, you're family."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Adhoc Studio</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Superhero management sim with narrative choices.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Good characters, animation, and management elements; funny sometimes.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Aggressively unfunny at other times, choice impact varies, maybe could've just been a TV show.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC, PS5 (played on)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>Weekly from October 22, 2025 to November 12, 2025.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>~8 hours</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>gradually adds new systems to its calls, such as synergies between different heroes that make them ideal partners and implementing thresholds that can cause you to automatically fail jobs if you overtake certain stat levels, and sometimes it will intentionally overwhelm you with more work than you have people for, so you have to make hard calls as their timers tick down. In between sending people out to do the grunt work, Robert also puts his hacking skills to use for certain jobs, so you’re not just letting everyone else do the hard work while you point and sip your coffee. It’s a simple interface (which is sometimes a pain to navigate on a controller), but it gives you enough moving parts to juggle that some of the latter shifts are a genuinely stressful challenge. </span></p>

 <p><span>Each mission you assign heroes to gives you a breakdown of the situation and a general vibe of what the work entails, and it will often be up to you to discern who you should send to do something based on a job description, rather than hard numbers or required stats.

In the end, I had a fine time with </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>. I liked it when I was playing it, looked forward to its next episodes when I wasn’t, and most of my biggest complaints with it I express with a shrug.

And if no future episodes come, that would be okay, too.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">NCSoft and Sony surprised PlayStation fans this week by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-and-ncsoft-announce-horizon-steel-frontiers-a-new-mobile-first-mmorpg-set-in-guerrillas-horizon-universe-check-out-the-debut-trailer">announcing a Horizon MMO that’s not actually coming to PlayStation</a>. Horizon Steel Frontiers is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game designed for mobile devices, but it will also be playable on PC. NCSoft is working closely with original Horizon developer Guerrilla Games to craft the world, but this is very much an NCSoft-developed game. And based on the reveal trailer, below, it looks like it, too. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-trailer-breakdown">Horizon Steel Frontiers trailer breakdown to find out what we could gather from the video</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say Horizon Steel Frontiers has sparked a debate among fans of Aloy’s adventures. While much of the game world looks familiar, there is much about Steel Frontiers that is different — including the look of the characters you can create and those you can bump into. Guerrilla’s Horizon games go for a realistic look, particularly when it comes to their characters. The developers have maintained this style throughout their Horizon games, starting with 2017’s breakout hit Zero Dawn through to VR game Call of the Mountain and Forbidden West expansion Burning Shores.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Steel Frontiers, developed by South Korean game company NCSoft (Lineage) not only with Guerrilla’s blessing but in close partnership with the team, is going for a stylized look for its characters, as can be seen clearly in the gameplay reveal trailer. But don’t expect “extreme cartoon-like features,” its developer has said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an exclusive interview with IGN following the reveal, Sunggu Lee, executive producer of Horizon Steel Frontiers at NCSoft, answered questions around character creation, gameplay, social features, Steel Frontiers’ place in the Horizon universe, the influence of Capcom's Monster Hunter, and perhaps the most important question of all: is Aloy in the game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How did the partnership between Sony and NCSoft come to be, and how did the idea for Horizon Steel Frontiers come about?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>When I first played Horizon Zero Dawn back in 2017, I was blown away by the incredible graphics and gameplay. It made me think, “How amazing would it be to explore this world with other players?” That simple but powerful feeling — the desire to share a great single-player experience with others — is what sparked the idea for Horizon Steel Frontiers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At NCSoft, we’ve always had a strong foundation in MMORPGs, and I believed that if we could bring the rich, captivating world of Horizon into that space, we could create something truly unique — an MMORPG unlike anything players have seen before. So, we started talking with Sony, the IP holder, and those conversations eventually led to the game we’re revealing today: Horizon Steel Frontiers.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/sunggu-lee-executive-producer-of-horizon-steel-frontiers-ncsoft-02-1763058507077.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sunggu Lee, executive producer of Horizon Steel Frontiers at NCSoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: In the announcement video, Guerrilla Games studio head Jan-Bart van Beek says Horizon Steel Frontiers was designed specifically for mobile. Can it also be played on PC, and how does the game take advantage of PC?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>For mobile, we streamlined the original console-based controls to make them more intuitive. To address the challenges of long-range aiming, we restructured combat to focus more on melee and introduced a smart lock-in system, so battles feel smooth and intuitive even on mobile. On PC, we take full advantage of the larger screen and precise controls, delivering deep, immersive experiences like large-scale raids and extended co-op missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mobile offers quick, on-the-go session play, while PC provides a richer, more strategic combat experience — each platform playing to its strengths. We’re developing both versions to deliver top-tier quality and a true cross-platform experience, so players can team up and hunt together anytime, anywhere, without being limited by their device.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Which PC platforms will it be available on?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>As mentioned earlier, Horizon Steel Frontiers is being developed as a true cross-platform experience for both mobile and PC (PURPLE, which is NCSoft’s integrated game platform).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Are you using Guerrilla’s Decima engine? If not, how will gameplay feel different in Steel Frontiers?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Horizon Steel Frontiers is being developed using Unreal Engine 5. The original Decima engine is incredible — it delivered stunning graphics and amazing asset quality that made Horizon so iconic. Bringing those high-quality resources over to Unreal Engine 5 was no small challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We worked closely with Guerrilla to make sure we preserved the visual fidelity of the original, while creating gameplay that feels unique to Steel Frontiers. Leveraging Unreal Engine 5’s powerful graphics capabilities, we’re able to deliver breathtaking visuals and smooth multiplayer experiences across both mobile and PC (PURPLE).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: From the way players team up to take down creatures, it looks like there’s a fair amount of Monster Hunter in Steel Frontiers. Is it fair to say this was an inspiration?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Yes, that’s right — Monster Hunter was definitely one of the key inspirations for Steel Frontiers. When we started expanding Horizon’s core concept of hunting massive machines into a multiplayer experience, the cooperative hunting system from the Monster Hunter series felt like a natural reference point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the very beginning, combining Horizon’s rich world with the hunting-action genre just made sense. And when you add Horizon’s unique machine ecosystem, the part-breaking mechanics, and its deep storytelling, you get something that feels truly distinctive—an experience that’s uniquely Steel Frontiers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How does the combat in this game differ compared to that in the Horizon games?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Both games share the core idea of taking down massive machines by targeting and breaking parts to weaken them — but as you can see in the trailer, the combat itself is quite different. In the original, ranged combat with a bow is the foundation. Players slow down time to line up precise shots and match elemental attributes to machine weaknesses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Steel Frontiers, it’s all about managing distance and making quick decisions — when to attack and when to dodge. We’ve kept the tension and excitement of the original hunts, but redesigned the combat to deliver a fresh experience that’s optimized for multiplayer hunting action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: There’s a big sand snake-looking machine at 8:18 in the video. Can you tell us what they’re called and what they do?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>The machine you see at 8:18 in the trailer is the Rockbreaker. It’s one of the most memorable machines from the original game — known for moving freely underground and then bursting through the surface for sudden, devastating attacks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Steel Frontiers, we’ve kept that ambush style intact but added new patterns to fit a multiplayer environment. One example is a massive sandpit attack that threatens the entire team. Overcoming it requires tight coordination and role-based teamwork, which makes the fight even more intense and rewarding.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/horizonsteelfrontiers-keyart-1-1763059001122.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Horizon Steel Frontiers is playable on mobile and PC. Image credit: NCSoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Are there player hubs, such as cities?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Yes, absolutely. Steel Frontiers is set in the Deadlands, a vast region inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. Scattered across this landscape are multiple hub towns, which serve as the central gathering points for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These towns are where everything starts — you prepare for hunts, upgrade your gear, meet other players, and form parties. Each town has its own unique character and also acts as a gateway to nearby hunting zones. After every adventure, you’ll return to these hubs, making them the heart of the game’s social and gameplay experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What social aspects will the game have that let you interact with other players?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>In Steel Frontiers, towns and guilds are really the heart of the community. Towns act as central hubs where players gather, prepare for hunts, and naturally connect with others. Out in the field, you might team up spontaneously with players you meet, or join forces in planned, strategic co-op play to take down tougher machines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These moments — whether unexpected or carefully coordinated — help strengthen bonds between players. And of course, we support all the core social features you’d expect from an MMORPG, like friends lists, chat, and party systems, so players can communicate and collaborate seamlessly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How does Horizon Steel Frontiers fit within the overall Horizon timeline? Is it set within the same universe as the previous games? Does it take place before or after any events we’re already familiar with?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Horizon Steel Frontiers takes place in the same universe as the original, but in a completely different region — the Deadlands. While Aloy and her allies are fighting for the fate of the world in the north, the southern Deadlands face a new threat. Players step into the role of machine hunters drawn to this dangerous frontier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As an MMORPG, every player becomes the hero of their own story, shaping their journey in the Deadlands. It’s another adventure unfolding in the same world, parallel to the epic saga of the original game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is Aloy in the game at all, or any other familiar Horizon characters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>We haven’t finalized whether characters from the original game will appear, so it’s too early to share any specific plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The characters shown off in the announcement video have what would be considered ‘pretty’ or ‘cute’ faces. Was there a conscious effort to let players create such characters, despite them not fitting tonally with what we’ve seen in previous Horizon video games from Guerrilla?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>We’re building a character customization system that lets players create the style they want — from realistic designs like the original game to the more stylized characters often preferred in Asian markets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, because the original Horizon is based on realistic human proportions, we won’t support extreme cartoon-like features, such as oversized eyes or tiny chins. Our goal is to offer as much variety as possible within realistic features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be honest, we’re not quite at the level of stylization we’d like yet (laughs), but we’re making steady progress. By launch, we’re confident the customization options will satisfy both fans of the original and new players looking for creative freedom.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How many players can group together to take on a machine?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>In our announcement trailer, we showed a pre-alpha build of raid combat, but the exact scale hasn’t been finalized yet. Because Steel Frontiers is all about observing patterns and responding at the right moment, raids will involve fewer players compared to traditional MMOs. If the group is too large, individual roles can get diluted and the fight becomes chaotic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, we’re testing different group sizes, and the ideal number will vary depending on the machine type and difficulty. Our goal is to support everything from small parties to mid-sized raids, ensuring that every player feels their contribution matters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Can you explain how tribes will compete with each other, and how you’re able to fight over resources? Will players have to pick a tribe to join? Will you compete to own areas of the world as territory?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>In Steel Frontiers, tribal conflict plays out very differently from the original. The Deadlands isn’t home to established tribes — it’s a frontier where hunters from all over gather in search of opportunity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From a gameplay perspective, we’re focusing less on traditional MMO-style territory wars and more on cooperative structures built around hunting massive machines in the field. At its core, Steel Frontiers is a game where collaboration matters more than conflict. Machines like Slaughterspine or Thunderjaw are too powerful for a single group to take down, so players naturally come together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That dynamic mix of competition and cooperation — shifting based on the situation — is what makes the Deadlands unique.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is there PvP?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Right now, we’re currently focused on the core content — PvE elements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What are the aspects of the game that make it an RPG as well as an MMO?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Steel Frontiers is an MMORPG that combines character progression with constant social interaction. Players start by hunting smaller machines, gradually mastering weapons and tuning gear to become true “machine hunters.” Along the way, you’ll team up with strangers in the field to take down a Slaughterspine, meet new partners in town squares, and build lasting connections that grow into guilds and communities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Different players, each with their own growth stage and hunting style, come together in the Deadlands — sometimes cooperating, sometimes competing — to take on even greater challenges. With every season, new threats emerge and the community evolves. Steel Frontiers isn’t a game you play for just a few sessions — it’s a living world shaped by continuous character growth and an ever-changing community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Can you tell us a bit about the partnership between NCSoft and Guerrilla, and how you’ve worked together on the project?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Guerrilla and NCSoft have built a collaborative approach that really plays to each studio’s strengths. Guerrilla focuses on maintaining the consistency and integrity of the Horizon IP, providing continuous feedback to ensure asset quality and reviewing new machine designs and story elements to make sure they fit the world and preserve the original visual standards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On our side at NCSoft, we’re focused on creating new gameplay experiences on top of that foundation — leveraging our expertise in cross-platform development for mobile and PC, MMO systems, and designing cooperative combat mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We hold regular conference calls and meet in person at key milestones for deep discussions. Honestly, coordinating across two global studios can be challenging at times, but it’s also incredibly rewarding. We’re learning so much from each other, and I truly believe that combining different perspectives and development cultures is leading to a better game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Have you been able to design new creatures in the Horizon world? Has Guerrilla had to approve them?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sunggu Lee: </strong>Every new machine design or variation goes through Guerrilla for review and approval. We work closely to ensure everything stays true to the Horizon universe while delivering gameplay that feels unique to Steel Frontiers. It’s an ongoing collaboration to create machines that fit both worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

    <p>Yesterday, Valve announced several different devices: a new controller, a new VR headset (dubbed the Steam Frame) and a fully realized version of the Steam Machine. And while I’m going to need to actually have these things in my hands and on my head to be sure, I’m reading over the specs and mostly nodding while saying, “Oh, that’s quite good.” Valve made a bunch of smart hardware choices, some of which I’ve wanted someone to make forever, and others which I never would have thought of. While I haven’t had a chance to have a hands-on with this hardware, I am fervently excited for everything I’ve seen.</p><h2 id="the-steam-controller-vindicated"><strong>The Steam Controller, vindicated</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: Valve</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are some people out there who never forgot the Steam Controller. Wonky and ambitious, with two big touchpads, it did not hit with everyone, but the people it did strike a cord with hoarded them when it went on clearance and held on to them like doomsday preppers. Though the controller was not a hit, you see the DNA of what it did in other peripherals. An entire cottage industry of DIYers use similar Cirque touchpad modules <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Steam+Controller+Teardown/52578?ref=aftermath.site"><u>used in that controller</u></a> in their keyboards to approximate mousing – the <a href="https://bastardkb.com/dilemma/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Dilemma</u></a>, <a href="https://kbd.news/Harite-v3-2687.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Harite</u></a> and <a href="https://github.com/perseus333/daedalus-keyboard?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Daedalus</u></a>, just to name a few. More importantly, you see it in the dual haptic touchpads of the Steam Deck. You really only come to appreciate using them when attempting to type with them, which feel organically not unlike typing on a phone.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The original vision for the Steam Controller (left) and the final shipped one (right). Credit: Valve</span></figcaption></figure><p>The layout of the new controller mirrors that of the Steam Deck. It has symmetrical sticks like the Deck and the PlayStation controller, which is God’s Correct Layout no matter how many asymmetrical Xbox controller layouts I see in the market. Mercifully, it has TMR sticks, which no first party controller has yet. TMR sticks have become the cutting edge standard in basically<a href="https://aftermath.site/zd-0-excellence-review-controller-gaming-xbox-perfect/"><u> every good third-party controller coming out of China</u></a>. TMR modules are lower energy than Hall Effect modules, which came into vogue a few years back following various stick drift scandals. Though I appreciate that stick drift forced people to get far more inventive and adept at DIY, I’m glad that someone is finally just shipping a controller that I don’t, ideally, have to tear apart later.</p><p>The Steam Controller also features a combination wireless dongle/magnetic charger Valve is calling the “Steam Controller Puck,” and whoever thought of that deserves a raise. It has a grip sensor Valve dubs “Grip Sense,” which is intended to be used to enable and disable gyroscopic controls, but Valve says it can be mapped like any other button. As a person who loved the rear touch pad on the PS Vita, I love when a company throws something freaky back there.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>The little dots are where you connect the puck, MagSafe style. Credit: Valve</span></figcaption></figure><p>I can’t wait <a href="https://gamepadla.com/soft.pdl?ref=aftermath.site"><u>to test the latency on this thing</u></a>, but superficially this all looks great to me, although I would need to actually see how everything fits into my hand. I’m curious if Valve has considered any other input devices for couch-based control, because I currently have a media PC connected to my TV and you would be shocked at how anemic the marketplace is for lapboards and keyboards with integrated touchpads. This dovetails nicely with Valve’s biggest announcement for the day: the Steam Machine.</p><h2 id="the-steam-machine-is-just-a-little-guy-and-it%E2%80%99s-his-birthday"><strong>The Steam Machine is just a little guy and it’s his birthday</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>It's tiny! Credit: Valve</span></figcaption></figure><p>Under my TV, there’s a small form factor PC that I built sometime before covid. It is not the fastest machine in my house– it squeaks along with a 2080 Super–but it covers a shocking amount of my Steam Library and plays video files off my local server, which is enough. For everything else, I have Moonlight streaming and wired Ethernet.</p><p>What Valve announced with the Steam Machine is, spiritually, the successor to a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/while-we-eagerly-await-the-second-coming-of-steam-machines-its-worth-remembering-what-a-gloriously-awful-mess-valve-got-itself-in-over-a-decade-ago/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>debacle that happened over a decade ago</u></a> and also my weird living room PC. According to Valve, the Steam Machine’s design was a response to a significant number of people using their Steam Deck docked most of the time. The Steam Machine is not a powerhouse, but looking at the specs it has just enough power to play a fairly huge swath of my library. It appears to be aimed towards <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>affordability</u></a>, and while Valve hasn’t announced a price yet, this is a good sign given how everything is getting more expensive for exceedingly avoidable and incoherent reasons. I do not expect it to compete with either Nintendo or Sony in terms of sheer simplicity of use; the Switch and the PS5 just work and that’s a huge selling point. But it’s a more coherent version of what Microsoft seems to be pushing on every single level, which is more than enough to justify its existence.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Valve says the LED bar can be customized to show download progress, and more. Credit: Valve</span></figcaption></figure><p>I need to express my adoration for the design of this thing being just a simple, fairly small cube. I have a PlayStation 5 next to my media PC and it languishes like an ugly Roman emperor being fed grapes on a lectus. Despite several revisions, the PS5 still <a href="https://aftermath.site/ps5-pro-700-dollars-looks-bad/"><u>looks like that</u></a>. It is an inefficient use of space and I live in an apartment in New York City, so I’m paying rent monthly for that guy. Meanwhile, the Steam Machine is just an unassuming box that plays games, with a design that’s as spartan as the Slim PS2 and the Gamecube.</p><p>The device also has an SD card slot, making it so that you can just drop an SD card from your Steam Deck into your Steam Machine seamlessly. The front panel is magnetic and swappable, and Valve is actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-machine-everything-we-know-about-valves-new-console?ref=aftermath.site"><u>sharing the 3D files</u></a> so that tinkerers can go nuts making custom front panels. Leaning into something that your fanbase was going to do anyway is smart and allows for an ecosystem to flourish. The conclusion that everyone has come to is that it’s going to take less than 24 hours for someone to spray paint it atomic purple and throw a handle on it, thus turning into a Gamecube or, as many people have dubbed it, a “Gabecube.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>I'm gonna break you down into the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld5XBsB5q8M&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>little cubes</span></a><span>....Credit: Valve</span></figcaption></figure><p>I think it is debatable to say that the Steam Machine is a “console,” but the reality is that consoles have just been PCs with child safety locks on them for a very long time now. I am ancient enough to remember when you could run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_for_PlayStation_2?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Linux on the PS2</u></a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodi_(software)?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">XBMC, which would eventually become Kodi</a>, started off as a homebrew app that you would run on a hacked Xbox. Further dating myself, I remember someone doing this exact thing in my college dorm in like 2005. I also remember the obscene lengths that people took to make homebrew stuff run on Vita and Nintendo DS. I fundamentally believe that if you own a computer you’re its boss and should be able to modify it as you see fit. A tiny, standardized living room PC that starts with this mentality has always been a dream of mine, and I can imagine these little machines having a long life elsewhere in the home as a network device well after they have been replaced by more powerful hardware.&nbsp;</p><p>I have seen people raising concerns about the specs, how it is running with only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rv83LgXiN0&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">8GB of VRAM and RDNA 3</a>. But the genius of the Steam Deck was not that it was a powerhouse, but rather that it established an accessible performance baseline and sorted out compatibility issues, which allowed other manufacturers to build on that. If you want a more powerful version of the Steam Machine, they sell those already: they’re called PCs. This is not an option you have with any other platform, and is as solid a counter argument you could craft to basically any critique of its humble performance. I&nbsp;also think it speaks to a much larger reality, which is that there’s a lot of people who have dropped out of the cutting edge of technology. To be a “gamer” in the AAA sense is a dedicated lifestyle and hobby that requires money, and most people just want something that plays the handful of games they like. I constantly see mini PCs coming out of China from companies like Beelink and Minisforum in roughly this volume, and so the potential for the Steam Machine globally could be huge if Valve is smart with how it positions itself.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>I kinda like that the design is just based around one big fan, although we will have to see how the thermals work. Credit: Valve</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a media hoarder, I’m also excited at what this potentially means for my people: weirdos who stream old video files and BluRay rips from a NAS in another room of their house. Media PCs have been in a weird limbo for a very long time, and I’m a little hopeful that this could be the device that makes that viable. Outside of the ancient Nvidia Shield, the most solid entry level recommendation is buying something called an Ugoos AM6B+ and following a deeply obtuse set of forum instructions. If that sentence gave you a headache, you now have a good handle on where the media PC landscape is currently at. I also think that, long term, Valve should attempt to make sure that streaming services are as well integrated as possible for people who want a unified device, because “just open up Netflix in a browser window” is not a workable solution even for me, and I’m a freak.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>This post has the power to destroy a certain kind of person. </span><a href="https://x.com/nopoweradeinusa/status/1602122365076262912?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Credit:@nopoweradeinusa</span></a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="steam-framehybrid-moment"><strong>Steam Frame - Hybrid Moment</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Valve made a new headset and I'm more interested than I could have imagined. Credit: Valve</span></figcaption></figure><p>The tech world’s fascination with VR has always felt forced. VR is specifically for four kinds of people: freaks who spend a lot of money on racing and flight sims, furries in VR chat, people who stream <em>Beat Saber</em>,<em> </em>and/or people who want to watch incredibly specific forms of stereoscopic movies and pornography. While I do not doubt the commitment of people who work on the devices, the high level vision from leadership at Meta and Apple has always felt obscenely half-baked: a version of <em>Snow Crash </em>for people who communicate with family members mainly via LinkedIn. No matter how good the Meta Quest or Apple Vision Pro become, I cannot see myself owning either of them. Meta is one of the most evil companies on the planet and regularly spends criminal amounts of money, talent, and R&amp;D just so <a href="https://aftermath.site/meta-display-ai-rayban-glasses-ai-fail-demo-lmao-look-at-this-huge-dipshit/"><u>Zuck can get on stage and look like a dipshit</u></a>. Apple’s intended use cases for the Vision Pro are obtuse, confusing, and wildly expensive, which is why I have never seen a single person interact with a Vision Pro in an Apple store even accidentally.</p><figure><figcaption><span>It's modular! Credit: Valve</span></figcaption></figure><p>The original Valve Index understood its audience and is, to this day, a beautifully engineered piece of technology. I own one, and while it has definitely shown its age, the hardware choices it made are still impressive. It utilized an array mic that sounds so good that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejb3sFkiPB8&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">you could legitimately podcast from it</a>. The dual floating BMR drivers worked well and <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/index/deep-dive/ear-speakers?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">allowed for immersion without closing you off to the outside world</a>. It was the first VR device that made me not want to barf, and the level of care put into it was the thing that made me realize that Valve was taking hardware seriously and inventively, which it then proceeded to do with the Steam Deck.</p><p>Like their previous offering, the Steam Frame is also a fascinating piece of hardware. It is very clearly gunning for the Meta Quest 3, which has cemented itself as the go-to recommendation for most people interested in a VR headset. It is primarily intended to be run as a streaming device from a PC, but unlike the Index it instead utilizes a 6GHz dongle for extremely low latency, although you can technically use WiFi as a fallback <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3823053915991825335?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">like the Meta Quest does</a>. It has a standalone ARM-based processor like the Meta Quest, but unlike the Quest it is meant to be usable with your Steam library – both as a streaming device and standalone on the headset itself.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>I was a bit bummed out because I liked the weird straps on the original Index, but apparently similar straps are available as an accessory. Credit: Valve</span></figcaption></figure><p>In order to make this work, they are using <a href="https://fex-emu.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>FEX </u></a>to emulate x86 programs in an ARM environment. I cannot stress how smart a move this could potentially be, even if you do not care about VR. It has long been speculated that Valve was going after ARM-based devices, but trying to figure out the best way to make that compatibility work is quite complicated. By making the Steam Frame primarily a PC accessory with a fallback for emulated ARM-based gaming, they have created an ideal testbed for ARM-based devices in the future. If a single game does not work well locally on-device, that does not diminish the purpose of the device as a streaming headset. I regularly follow ARM-based handhelds, and the progress I have seen people making with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqwlEoXkFRU&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>emulation on ARM devices has been fairly substantial</u></a>. This is what I like so much about Valve’s hardware design philosophy: even if a piece of hardware is not feature complete at launch, the process of getting it to work is often a stepping stone to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818698/valve-steamos-arm-potential-handhelds-laptops?ref=aftermath.site"><u>much larger and more important thing down the line.&nbsp;</u></a></p><p>The entire thing is also modular in its design, which I frankly love. The front of the device with the compute module comes off, so implicitly the idea is that you could theoretically upgrade the entire device by just swapping that part out. It also has an SD card slot, which means you can swap the card from your Steam Deck right into it, just like how the Steam Machine works. The Steam Frame is also using something Valve calls <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/vr-hardware/foveated-streaming-genius-tech/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Foveated Streaming</a>, itself an iteration on the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveated_rendering?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Foveated rendering</u></a>, which uses eye tracking to improve the streamed bitrate directly where the player is looking. I would need to see how this works in practice, but all of this sounds killer. I rarely get excited for VR, and yet.</p><h2 id="gunning-for-microsoft"><strong>Gunning for Microsoft</strong></h2><p>I would not be as excited as I am for any of this hardware were things not so dire with Microsoft, both as a console maker and someone who makes OSes. Microsoft has repeatedly shot itself in the foot on both fronts, and the questions “<a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-playstation-ps5-exclusivity-indiana-jones-starfield/"><u>what is an Xbox?</u></a>” and “what is Windows?” fill me with nothing but dread. We have long needed someone to provide a simple, affordable, Linux desktop machine that just works for normal people. Valve seems to be positioning itself in a very smart way on multiple fronts. They are making moves that could not just have long term ramifications for the console space, but for computers generally. And while we will need to see pricing and performance of this hardware in the wild, I have a good feeling about where it could lead. They did a bunch of stuff I wanted someone, anyone, to do for decades, and I have a gut feeling the consequences could be bigger than any of us could imagine.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Guerilla Games and NCSoft finally announced the Horizon-based MMORPG that <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-mmo-game-reportedly-in-the-works-supposedly-made-by-sony-and-ncsoft/">we've been hearing about for years</a> today with the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/">Horizon Steel Frontiers,</a> which is coming to PC and mobile sometime within the next couple of years. But that's not the only multiplayer Horizon game that Guerilla has on the go.</p>



<p>While previous rumors about an upcoming Horizon multiplayer game <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-multiplayer-early-footage/">seem to have been focused on the coming MMORPG</a>, Guerilla's next major release, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, is a separate multiplayer game that the company is working on.</p>



<p>"<em>Just to clear up some confusion I've seen</em>," Schreier writes in a post on Bluesky, "<em>the newly announced NCSoft Horizon MMO is different from the multiplayer Horizon game that's in development at Guerilla Games. That one is Guerilla's next big project</em>."</p>







<p>Unlike Steel Frontiers, which is coming to PC and mobile, and not PS5, this new multiplayer title from Guerilla will likely not be skipping Sony's console, though it will still likely be a multi-platform release to at least PC players.</p>



<p>Now that Steel Frontiers has had its official reveal, hopefully this other project that the studio is working on isn't too far behind. Guerilla's studio director Jan-Bart van Beek made it clear a couple of short years ago that the team is continuing with the Horizon franchise for a long while, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-developer-has-16-plans-for-the-franchise-highlights-challenges-in-creating-the-multiplayer-game/">that they have scores of ideas on where to take it, new multiplayer games being just one of those avenues</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Netflix’s next stab at gaming is here. Starting today you’ll be able to play a number of multiplayer party games on your TV using your phone as a controller. To start, Netflix is offering <em>Boggle Party</em>, <em>Party Crasher: Fool Your Friends</em>, <em>Lego Party</em>, <em>Pictionary: Game Night</em>, and <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>. A social deduction game based on the <em>Knives Out</em> series, <em>Dead Man’s Party: A Knives Out Game</em>, is also part of this new slate but will launch at a later time.</p><p>The streaming platform’s approach to gaming has been unfocused, with the company bouncing between being a boutique development studio while also being a platform for premium and exclusive mobile gaming experiences. Offering party games on your TV seems like a better fit — one that could allow Netflix to finally find its gaming footing.</p><div><p>TV-supported party games have been a long time coming. Netflix announced that it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23411684/netflix-cloud-gaming-studio-pc-tv">working on cloud streaming technology for games</a> back in 2022 before beta testing began in 2023. Now it’s here, rolling out with multiplayer games that the company hopes will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350690/netflix-cloud-gaming-plans-co-op-party-games">become a new version of family board game night</a>. And while it sounds a bit cheesy, it makes sense.</p></div><p>The big video game publishers have acknowledged that their competitors are not only each other but other attention-hoggers like TikTok and Instagram. Netflix, it seems, has cued in on this too. And a great way to keep people on your app — which is the whole reason Netflix began this gaming initiative — is to give people something to gather around and do.</p><p>Netflix has also shown a bit of savvy in the kind of games it’s offering. This year has seen an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/756236/content-warning-coop-games-nintendo-switch-2-lethal-company">explosion of popularity in co-op games</a> that have less urgency and more casual cooperation elements to them than a traditional multiplayer game; think <em>Peak</em>, not <em>Fortnite</em>. The games Netflix is offering are poised to take advantage of that rising trend. <em><em>Boggle Party</em></em> and <em><em>Pictionary: Game Night</em></em> are video game-ified versions of popular board games, while <em><em>Tetris Time Warp</em></em> and <em><em>Lego Party</em></em> are just good old-fashioned video games based on widely known properties made easily accessible, no console required.</p><p>Netflix’s gaming initiative has had a few fits and starts and was primarily focused on mobile gaming. Starting in 2021 it began acquiring video game studios, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699241/netflix-night-school-acquisition-oxenfree"><em>Oxenfree</em> developer Night School</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/31/23433526/netflix-spry-fox-cozy-gaming-studio-acquisition">Spry Fox</a>, makers of the <em>Cozy Grove</em> game series. It also spun up its own studio — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/17/23686693/netflix-joseph-staten-aaa-game-halo-veteran">staffed with game development veterans who worked on <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Halo</em>, and <em>God of War</em></a> — with designs of making its own AAA console game. Alongside that, Netflix was the exclusive mobile home for a number of critically acclaimed games, including <em>Monument Valley</em>, <em>Poinpy</em>, and <em>Hades</em>. With these offerings, Netflix seemed to signal that it wanted its gaming initiative to appeal to more than the casual set.</p><div><p>But then, mirroring wider trends in the gaming industry, Netflix began shutting studios down. In 2024, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">closed the AAA studio</a> before it could release or even announce the game it was working on. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806303/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment-studio-shut-down">the streamer shut down another of its subsidiaries</a>, Boss Fight Entertainment, shortly after releasing <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>, a game Netflix frequently <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/squid-game-by-the-numbers-how-player-456-took-over-the-world">praised for its popularity</a>. Most of those critically acclaimed games are gone too, with Netflix <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692227/netflix-games-delisting-hades-braid-gaming-strategy">removing a number of third-party titles from its service</a>, which seemed to catch some games’ developers by surprise.</p></div><p>All these events seem to indicate Netflix’s current approach to gaming wasn’t working out. The things the streamer was throwing at the wall weren’t sticking (or at least weren’t sticking enough to justify the expense). An interview with Alain Tascan, president of Netflix games, confirmed as much. “We need to find our voice,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">he said to <em>The Verge </em>earlier this year</a>, sharing that the strategy going forward would be to “readjust and focus on fewer areas with more intention.”</p><div><p>“We need to find our voice.”</p></div><p>Tascan described four areas of focus: games for kids, narrative games tied to Netflix IP, games that have large, widespread appeal, and multiplayer party games. Netflix already has the first three, and with cloud multiplayer gaming, the final component has arrived. This refocus reflects similar moves over at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/711575/netflix-games-apple-arcade-mobile-games">Apple Arcade</a> and Amazon’s game service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789658/amazon-luna-cloud-relaunch-gamenight-social-gaming">Luna</a>, which also started out with big-name titles and ambitions before switching to more casual offerings.</p><p>Netflix clearly wants to transform its perception from a streaming service into something more. In addition to all these traditional gaming offerings, it’s also tooling around with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/820124/netflix-puzzled-daily-puzzle-game-app-ios-android-tudum-web">daily puzzle games</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/803097/netflix-games-interactive-experiences-real-time-voting-q3-2025-earnings">interactive events</a> akin to game shows — complete with cash prizes — to keep people on the Netflix wheel beyond just watching TV. With these games, Netflix is no longer where people go to watch <em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> for the 57th time, but something that’s trying to be a daily fixture in its users’ lives.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/820289/netflix-casual-party-game-multiplayer-tetris-pictionary]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration-the-namco-legendary-pack</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration-the-namco-legendary-pack-switch-another-brilliant-digital-eclipse-dlc.1353091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In my review for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration_expanded_edition">Atari 50</a>’s ‘<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration_-_the_first_console_war">The First Console War</a>’ DLC, I said that Digital Eclipse had “seemingly completed its mission to present the most comprehensive interactive documentary on Atari possible”. Note the word “seemingly”! Yes, we’re back with <em>another</em> expansion – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration_-_the_namco_legendary_pack">The Namco Legendary Pack</a> – which adds a further 12 playable games to the mix along with a new documentary timeline observing the formation of Namco and its rapid ascent in Japan.</p>
<p>Once again, we have a selection of interviews, archival footage, documents, and 3D models to peruse in a timeline covering events from 1955 all the way to 1986. We get to see photos of a 29-year-old Masaya Nakamura as he founded the company that would later become Namco, while Atari founder Nolan Bushnell provides key anecdotal context as to why his company wound up selling its Atari Japan subsidiary to Namco a little over a year after its formation.</p>
<p>Tod Frye, the designer of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/pac-man">Pac-Man</a> on Atari VCS, provides a few key interviews and gives a glimpse into the game’s development process, including why the ghosts ‘flicker’. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_galaxian">Galaxian</a> designer Mark Ackerman also crops up to give wonderful context behind the creation of the game alongside Glenn Parker. That’s pretty much it in terms of interviews, but there’s a ton of commercials, posters, photos, and artwork for every game included.</p>
<p>I especially enjoyed looking at some of the unused artwork, particularly the original box art for Pac-Man on the VCS. Designed by Hiro Kimura, it depicts our hero as a shiny robot wearing a green vest top, while the ghosts are instead giant, slobbering monsters. It’s a shame this wasn’t utilised in some way, to be honest. Similarly, we’re treated to a stunning look at the original Galaxian artwork for the 5200 from artist Jim Kelly, and I mourn the fact that we just don’t get covers like this anymore.</p>
<p>In terms of playable titles, there's Pac-Man, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/dig_dug">Dig Dug</a>, Galaxian, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/galaga">Galaga</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/xevious">Xevious</a> across various Atari platforms. This is perhaps a first for Atari 50, but this DLC doesn’t include any duds – every game is well worth playing. Dig Dug would go on influence the enduring <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/mr_driller">Mr. Driller</a> series, while Xevious is responsible for laying the groundwork for countless shmups to come, including <strong>RayForce</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/twinbee">TwinBee</a>.</p>
<p>Pac-Man is the star of the expansion, mind you, with variants available on 8-Bit, 2600, and 5200. It’s fascinating to see what kind of compromises Atari had to make to bring the arcade original to the VCS, while the 8Bit and 5800 versions amped up the quality in terms of visual presentation and audio. Plus, y’know… it’s Pac-Man. I could play Pac-Man all day.</p>
<p>I’d like to say that this is a perfect way to cap off the numerous expansions for Atari 50, but who knows if this is the end. There’s still so much history that hasn’t been touched, and while license restrictions will no doubt prove a huge barrier for Atari and Digital Eclipse, I sincerely hope there’s more to come.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/atari-50-the-anniversary-celebration-the-namco-legendary-pack]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-mobile-app-membership-tiers/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/insider-gaming-announces-mobile-app-alongside-new-membership-tiers.1353082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming is officially going mobile. After months of development and plenty of requests from readers, the Insider Gaming App is <strong>now available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.insidergaming.app">Android through Google Play</a>.</strong> The <strong>iOS version will follow next week</strong> on the App Store, giving players on both platforms a faster and more personal way to stay connected to the gaming world.</p>



<p>“The Insider Gaming App is not just the next evolution of Insider Gaming, but the next logical step in gaming media.” – <strong>Tom Henderson</strong></p>



<p>The goal was to create something that felt better than using a browser on your phone. Something quicker to load, easier to navigate, and designed around the way people actually read news on mobile.</p>







<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-a-better-way-to-browse-insider-gaming">A Better Way to Browse Insider Gaming</h2>



<p>Once you open it, the app immediately feels built for everyday use. It’s simple, fast, and puts everything in one place without extra clutter. Readers will find all of Insider Gaming’s reporting and features organized in a way that makes browsing more enjoyable.</p>



<p>Here are some of the features available at launch:</p>



<h3 id="h-app-features">App Features</h3>



<ul>
<li>Free to download and use</li>



<li>Fewer ads compared to the website</li>



<li>All gaming, esports, tech news, and guides in one place</li>



<li>Push notifications for the biggest breaking stories</li>



<li>A built-in gaming calendar to track upcoming releases and events</li>



<li>Available in English or Portuguese</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the major things we wanted to focus on with the app is a better experience, and I think we can all agree that ads are horrible but are unfortunately one of the few ways media outlets have left to stay afloat. While the Insider Gaming App will have ads by default, they will be limited, but relevant to what our readers want.</p>



<h2 id="h-premium-and-premium-plus-new-ways-to-personalize-the-experience">Premium and Premium Plus: New Ways to Personalize the Experience</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the app release, Insider Gaming is also introducing Premium and Premium Plus. These memberships are available exclusively through the app and give readers new tools, personalization options, and access to exclusive content.</p>



<p>“Almost everyone in gaming media has adopted the subscription model, and instead of just a Patreon, we wanted to bring something a little different to the table. Our Premium offering takes how you get your gaming news to the next level, allowing you to personalise what you want to read about. Do you only like Xbox news? No problem. Hate leaks and only want to get official news? Easily done with a couple of clicks. For people wanting to take their support to the next level, we also have Premium+, which currently has four time-exclusive podcasts, with more to come in the future.” <strong>– Tom Henderson</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-insider-gaming-premium-3-99-month">Insider Gaming Premium – $3.99/month</h3>



<p>Premium gives subscribers more control over how they read and follow the news. It includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ad-Free Experience</li>



<li>A personalized news feed based on selected platforms and genres</li>



<li>Custom push notifications based on your interests</li>



<li>A special Discord role with access to exclusive channels</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-insider-gaming-premium-plus-6-99-month">Insider Gaming Premium Plus – $6.99/month</h3>



<p>Premium Plus includes everything in Premium, along with a lineup of exclusive podcasts created just for members.</p>



<p>These shows include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Party Chat</strong>: a guest-focused podcast featuring journalists, creators, developers, and industry voices</li>



<li><strong>Insider Access</strong>: an extended after-show for Insider Gaming Weekly</li>



<li><strong>Access Grant’ed</strong>: a one-on-one interview series hosted by Senior Editor Grant Taylor Hill</li>



<li><strong>Straw and Order</strong>: Senior Editor Mike Straw tackles one major question in gaming and delivers his final verdict</li>
</ul>

</figure>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-thank-you-and-a-look-to-the-future">A Thank You And A Look To The Future</h2>



<p>The launch of the app is just the latest step in growing Insider Gaming to be the one-stop destination for all things gaming news. </p>



<p>More customization, new tools, expanded community features, and additional content formats are already in development for future updates.</p>



<p>“Launching a new website in an industry that was consolidating, turns out, wasn’t easy. But with a great team and a fantastic community, we’ve been able to build something great in just over three years. What’s more exciting is that we have a lot more to give, and I can’t wait for everyone to experience what we have been building for the past several months.” <strong>– Tom Henderson</strong></p>



<p>Lastly, the entire team at Insider Gaming wants to thank you, the community. Without your support, this isn’t possible at all. You want the best news and original reporting, and it’s our goal to bring even more of that in 2026 and beyond. Again, thank you for helping make Insider Gaming what it is today after just three years. We can’t wait to show you what else is in store.</p>



<p>The Insider Gaming App is available now on Google Play, and the iOS version will launch next week.</p>

      </div>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ow0fd2/security_lockers_have_been_nerfed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a popular post on r/ArcRaiders</a>, the response appears to be positive. Most who've already unlocked the perk said that even though the Security Breach has been nerfed, they still find value in its rewards. Those who've waited to get it are happy to see a reduction in loot hoarding, while vowing to unlock it ASAP to reap the benefits.</p><p>Update 1.2.0 also fixes a handful of bugs. This includes animation glitches, audio discrepancies, map issues, and quest hang-ups. Elsewhere, the XP for looting Bastion and Bombardier ARC parts has been reduced, while the value for Launcher Ammo and Wolfpack Grenade has been increased, and various achievements should work now.</p><p>You can check out the full patch notes below.</p><h2>Arc Raiders Update 1.2.0 Patch Notes</h2><ul><li>Reduced character movement latency on the server to improve the "desync" problem where it looks like you get damaged even after being behind cover.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented players from completing quests involving multiple objectives or item collections within a single round.</li><li>Fixed various achievements not working correctly.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Usually Ubisoft is delaying <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">its upcoming games</a>. Sometimes it delays <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/assassins-creed-valhallas-first-expansion-is-delayed-by-a-couple-of-weeks/">big updates to ones that are already out</a>. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen it delay its official quarterly earnings report and certainly not minutes after it was already due to be released. Did someone accidentally delete a spreadsheet or is the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> publisher getting ready to break some major news?</p> <p>Like every other publicly traded video game company, Ubisoft regularly releases quarterly updates on its financials and takes questions from investors and analysts on an earnings call. The latest round was supposed to go live today at around 12:00 p.m. ET, only it didn’t. Instead, minutes passed with no update as people prepared to join the conference call that’s traditionally helmed by CEO and cofounder Yves Guillemot.</p>

 <p>Then Ubisoft released its weirdest emergency press release ever. “Ubisoft announces the postponement of the release of its results for the first half of fiscal year 2025-26,” <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2A1sQVfdyeqe6FVBzu564u/1210887eef5e1047803696e934f993f0/Ubisoft_press_release_13_11_2025_EN_vF.pdf">it read</a>. “Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38, FR001400MA32, and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.”</p>

 <p>That’s a big last-minute change with no clear details on when things will be back to normal.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, this could imply an acquisition of sorts. Could also imply some accounting / financial issue. </p> <p>Just remember to freak the fuck out for the next few days and speculate as much as possible until they announce something.</p> <p>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1989023907932717437?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Unclear why at this point but could indicate a major announcement related to the company,” wrote Niko Partners research director Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1989019828938764642">on X</a>. He noted that this could be a prelude to some big acquisition announcement, or it could signal a financial or accounting issue that requires extra time to address before accurate data can be supplied to the public.</p>

 <h2><em>The Division</em> and more could be for sale</h2> <p>It might be easier to assume the latter if not for what a weird time this is in general for Ubisoft. The long-time publisher recently entered into <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796">a $1.25 billion bailout</a> with Chinese conglomerate Tencent. It used that money to spin off a new entity run by the CEO’s son. After a slew of recent delays, there are no major new blockbuster releases for the company on the immediate horizon. The stock price is at its lowest point in over a decade.</p>

 <p>It certainly wouldn’t be shocking if Tencent, another big game company, or a “consortium” of various other investors used this opportunity to swoop in and try to buy the struggling publisher, or at least some big chunks of it. With its most lucrative franchises—<em>Assassin’s Creed</em>,<em> Far Cry</em>, <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>—all snugly nestled within a new subsidiary called Vantage Studios, Ubisoft is trying to find a way to offload other big chunks to outside groups. Anybody interested in the <em>Splinter Cell</em> or <em>Prince of Persia</em> series as their remakes remain MIA?</p>

 <p>The company recently announced voluntary layoffs across its Swedish studios, which include Massive, the lead studio on the<em> Division</em> franchise. With Activision Blizzard gobbled up by Microsoft and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">EA sold to Saudi Arabia</a>, who can say what will happen next? I just hope <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744"><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em></a> somehow survives.</p>

 <p><strong>Update 11/13/2025 2:36 p.m. ET:</strong> Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet sent an email, a copy of which was viewed by <em>Kotaku</em>, to rattled staff today trying to explain why he couldn’t explain what is going on:</p> <blockquote><p>Hello everyone, I wanted to let you know that we are taking extra time to finalize the closing of the semester, and as a result we will publish our first-half earnings results in the coming days instead of tonight. Due to legal regulations, we cannot share more information with you at this time.</p> <p>To limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay, we have asked Euronext to suspend the trading of our stock until the results are announced. We know this is likely to raise questions and drive media coverage. I encourage you to listen to the conference call – which will be available via the Investor section of our site – just after the results are released so that you have a more detailed view of our earnings. Thanks for your understanding.</p></blockquote> <p>The fate of thousands of Ubisoft developers is potentially up in the air as those who won’t be working on Vantage Studios projects face possible cost-cutting pressures or the uncertainty of their studios being sold to outside companies.</p>

    <article>
      <p>In late October, Krafton–publisher of games like <em>PUBG</em>, <em>inZOI</em>,<em> </em>and the <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/subnautica-2/"><u>embattled</u></a> <em>Subnautica 2–</em>announced it would be going “<a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>AI first</u></a>,” an increasingly common buzzword for companies looking to get in on the AI boom before it goes bust. You’ll never believe this, but that move involves people losing their jobs.</p><p>Krafton said its pivot to AI would involve a “complete reorganization of the company's operational development system, placing AI at the center of problem solving,” according to a machine translation of its Korean announcement. The move also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-to-undergo-complete-reorganization-as-it-positions-itself-as-an-ai-first-company?ref=aftermath.site"><u>included</u></a> a $69.7 million investment in a GPU cluster, and an additional $20.8 million to support employees in “directly utilizing and applying various AI tools to their work.”&nbsp;</p><p>In early November, Krafton <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-04/gaming-pioneer-krafton-freezes-hiring-during-major-ai-push?ref=aftermath.site"><u>instituted a hiring freeze</u></a>, though this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation?ref=aftermath.site"><u>excluded</u></a> departments working on original IP or AI. Krafton CEO Bae Dong-geu <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-krafton-offers-voluntary-resignations-following-ai-first-investment/1100-6536185/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>said</u></a> at the time that “rather than reducing costs through AI First, individual productivity must increase at the company-wide level.” Well yeah, that makes sense; your company invests in the hot new tech that its creators keep promising will revolutionize your work, so <em>of course</em> you need to work harder to help it get there.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, <a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Business Korea</u></a> (as spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>) reported that the company has “begun offering resignation support to all employees.” Business Korea writes that the resignations would be voluntary, with severance based on years of employment.&nbsp;</p><p>A Krafton rep told Business Korea:</p><blockquote>The core purpose [of the reduction] is to support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation… [T]he company plans to support members in autonomously deciding whether to continue the direction of change internally or expand externally.</blockquote><p>This is some spectacular business bullshit language. Framing those unwilling to turn their current jobs into whatever bastardized version of them would exist at an “AI first” company, or who cannot or will not bow to these increased productivity demands, as “embarking” or “expanding” on new “external” challenges is a great way to put the rug-pulling onus on employees rather than the company. And while I can appreciate buyouts as an alternative to <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-ai?ref=aftermath.site"><u>layoffs</u></a>, this “if you don’t like it, there’s the door” inherently acknowledges that Krafton is making a move it knows will be unpopular with its employees–you know, the people who did the work that <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-records-quarterly-revenue-of-krw-870-6-billion-in-q3-2025/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>gave Krafton</u></a> “record-high cumulative performance in the third quarter” of this year.</p><p>But all of this is simply how <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney/"><u>AI is manifesting in the real working world</u></a>, from <a href="https://aftermath.site/duolingo-ai/"><u>Duolingo</u></a> to <a href="https://x.com/BenMullin/status/1943049108064993285?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>The Washington Post</u></a> to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/youtube-offers-voluntary-buyouts-as-company-reorganizes-around-ai.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>YouTube</u></a> and beyond. If AI doesn’t outright replace your job–or, more accurately, if your boss doesn’t decide to try to replace you with AI whether or not AI can actually do your job–then its <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-is-the-ultimate-forced-meme/"><u>inclusion</u></a> turns your job into something unrecognizable. At which point, maybe seeing yourself out is a better option, though in this current age of tech layoffs probably doesn’t feel nearly as sunny as “embarking on external challenges” makes it sound.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, we’re all still waiting on that <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/the-gentle-singularity?ref=aftermath.site"><u>AI-powered utopia</u></a> Sam Altman and his ilk are promising while their software is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/us/openai-chatgpt-suicide-lawsuit-invs-vis?ref=aftermath.site"><u>convincing people</u></a> to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-suffering-chatgpt/"><u>kill themselves</u></a>. Everything is going great!&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

		<p>The survival game Solarpunk has been delayed to 2026, developer Cyberwave has announced. The team has decided to the delay Solarpunk as more development time is needed to address improvements and stability for the multiplayer side of the game. Other improvements revolve around Solarpunk’s inventory system, the piloting of airships, and improved performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Solarpunk - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qy41Qv7Ut14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Cyberwave detailed the improvements it is working on for Solapunk and those are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Inventory management:</b>&nbsp;Players really want “craft from storage,” sorting options, and bigger stack sizes.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Airship controls:&nbsp;</b>Some found flying a bit too sensitive and wished for an autopilot option for long trips.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Early-game pacing:</b>&nbsp;Cotton grows too slowly and tools break too fast, making the early hours grindy.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Late-game goals:&nbsp;</b>Players want more content, quests, and reasons to keep exploring.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Performance:</b>&nbsp;Thunderstorms caused FPS drops and lightning bugs that sometimes hit players unfairly.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Animal systems:&nbsp;</b>Some pathfinding issues caused animals to get stuck and stop producing.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Controller support:</b>&nbsp;Needs more polish to fully support controller and Steam Deck play.<wbr></li>
<li><b>Tutorials:</b>&nbsp;Players asked for clearer explanations for systems like electricity and crop sheltering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ahead of Solarpunk’s release, there will be a multiplayer playtest in which players can work together co-operatively. Cyberwave will be gradually increasing the number of co-op players allowed into the playtest once it goes live, and a date is yet to be given for the multiplayer playtest. Following that playtest, Cyberwave will go and address other bugs and issues that get raised by players so Solarpunk can be properly polished ahead of its release. A release window is not yet confirmed.</p>

			<p><strong>Update 13/11/2025:</strong> A report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cfo-internal-memo/">Insider-Gaming</a> includes an internal email from the chief financial officer at Ubisoft, Frederick Duguet, who claims that the stoppage of trading was done "<em>to limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay</em>."</p>



<p>Here's the full email, per Insider-Gaming: </p>



<p>"<em>Hello everyone</em>,</p>



<p><em>I wanted to let you know that we are taking extra time to finalize the closing of the semester, and as a result we will publish our first-half earnings results in the coming days instead of tonight.</em></p>



<p><em>Due to legal regulations, we cannot share more information with you at this time. To limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay, we have asked Euronext to suspend the trading of our stock until the results are announced. We know this is likely to raise questions and drive media coverage. I encourage you all to listen to the conference call – which will be available via the Investor section of our site — just after the results are released so that you have a more detailed view of our earnings.</em></p>



<div><p><em>Thanks for your understanding.</em></p><p><em>Fred</em>"</p></div>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Suddenly, and just 15 minutes before the financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year were meant to go live, Ubisoft not only <a href="https://live.euronext.com/en/product/equities/FR0000054470-XPAR#CompanyPressRelease-12847243">delayed the release of its results but also halted the trading of its shares and bonds</a> ahead of the market opening tomorrow on November 14, 2025.</p>



<p>There's been no comment from Ubisoft explaining the delay or why it stopped trading its shares and bonds, but such a sudden stoppage and delay don't exactly indicate that everything is smooth sailing at the company. What it does indicate is that there's likely something major going on within the company right now, potentially something as major as an acquisition.</p>



<p><em>Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38, FR001400MA32, and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days</em>," the company said in a statement. "<em>Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ubisoft just postponed its earnings report and halted the trading of its shares. Unclear why at this point but could indicate a major announcement related to the company. <a href="https://t.co/MRhTNYykIZ">pic.twitter.com/MRhTNYykIZ</a></p>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1989019828938764642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>It's no secret that Ubisoft has had a turbulent few years. Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">several instances</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">layoffs at the company</a>, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-producer-leaves-ubisoft-and-game-industry-after-xdefiant-servers-shut-down/">had a few </a>of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-sequel-recently-canceled-rumor-ubisoft/">big titles in recent years</a> result in <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-5-million-players-ubisoft-lower-performance/">big commercial misses</a>, with its one saving grace <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-europes-best-selling-new-game-2025/">being the success of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. </p>



<p>The new subsidiary that it opened alongside Tencent, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">officially called Vantage Studios,</a> is seemingly a result of its commercial woes, since it included a major investment from Tencent, and, specifically for the company's chief executive officer, Yves Guillemot, allowed the Guillemot family to retain control of the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disgruntled-ubisoft-investor-calls-on-assassins-creed-maker-to-go-private-as-shares-slump">and held off calls for the company to go private</a>.</p>



<p>But those calls might not have been held off for long, since this sudden delay could very well be due to Ubisoft getting set to announce that it has been acquired, either by Tencent or by another large entity. We know that there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">discussions about a Ubisoft buyout</a> following the struggles it has had recently, and now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">EA has begun that process with the Saudi Arabia PIF and the Consortium</a> of private equity investors, it could have been that Ubisoft shareholders used EA's purchase as fuel to campaign for Ubisoft to be acquired.</p>



<p>For now, this is all just speculation, but the sudden nature of the results release being delayed and the stoppage of trading, on top of everything else that has been going on with Ubisoft in the last few years, point to a major shift in the company due to be announced within the coming days. Or it could be nothing, we'll see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton has introduced a voluntary redundancy program just a couple of weeks after announcing that it intended to be an "AI first" company.</p>

<p>As spotted by news platform <a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319#google_vignette" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Business Korea</a>, the studio is offering resignation support to employees who decide to take voluntary redundancy, paying up to 36 months' salary depending on duration of employment. Even those who have been with Krafton for a year or less are being included in the program; they're being offered six months' salary to take redundancy.</p>

<p>Krafton itself says the goal with this program is to support employees in "proactively designing their growth direction" and that staffers will be given the choice to "continue the direction of change internally or expand externally", which sounds like a pretty classic piece of corporate-ese to me.</p>

<p>News of Krafton's voluntary redundancy program comes after the company <a href="https://www.krafton.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/KRAFTON-3Q25-Earnings-Release_ENG.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> a revenue increase of 21% on a year-on-year basis this quarter and 31.5% on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Operating profit has also increased both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, and Krafton's main IP,&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>, has grown as well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, studios firing employees despite recent successes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">isn't a new thing</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" rel="nofollow">gaming industry</a>, and as the widespread push for AI continues, this isn't a situation that's likely to change significantly anytime soon.</p>

<p>Krafton's redundancy program also comes after the company became <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">embroiled in a legal battle</a> with former&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>developers following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-bonus" rel="nofollow">their dismissal</a> from subsidiary Unknown Worlds, a battle that still rages on at time of writing.</p>




<p>Whatever your stance on generative AI may be (and there are a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai" rel="nofollow">number of opinions</a> among <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">industry bodies</a>), one thing's for sure: Krafton is going <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">all-in on the technology</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>
