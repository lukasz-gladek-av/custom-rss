<p>Atari announced this morning that publishing subsidiary Infogrames has acquired the <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> series from previous owner tinyBuild Inc. This marks the second casual, physics-heavy multiplayer game Infogrames has absorbed this year following April’s move to grab <em><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-relaunches-infogrames-acquires-totally-reliable-delivery-service">Totally Reliable Delivery Service</a></em> also from tinyBuild. <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> has released numerous games in the franchise, including VR titles and the most recent <em>Surgeon Simulator 2: Access All Areas</em>, which released in 2020 for PC and 2021 for Xbox.</p>



<p>For the uninitiated, <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> has the player performing numerous surgical tasks of escalating complexity and strangeness all while having to contend with realtime physics and other obstacles. With these additions to relaunched Infogrames label, it seems like the publisher might be a new bastion for chaos simulators popular on streaming platforms.</p>



<p>Officially, Atari says via press release that Infogrames will “acquire IP and publish games that fall outside the core portfolio of IP associated with the Atari brand.” They also note that, consistent with their parent company’s general ethos, Infogrames “sees game preservation as a core component of its mission.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>the Steelbook edition of <em>Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection</em> on Switch comes with this stuff</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> acquisition adds to an already busy week for Atari, who announced Tuesday they will add 39 games to <em>Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection</em>, an expanded version of the critically acclaimed game/interactive digital museum/documentary. The new version of the title will have its own digital release across all modern platforms and a physical release for PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch, the latter getting an additional Steelbook edition retailing for $49.99 with some fancy extras.</p>



<p>Folks who have already purchased <em>Atari 50</em> will be able to get the additions found in <em>The Anniversary Collection</em> in DLC later this year. <em>Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection</em> comes out on October 25.</p>



<p>Between this week’s developments and their acquisition of the Intellivision name and library in May, Atari is having an extremely busy year so far. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games">All of this and they’re not stuck with figuring out what to do with the Amico</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-visual-imrpoevements-not-enough-justify-performance-hit/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The improvements brought by Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen and Nanite may not be enough to justify the massive hit to the performance they cause, as highlighted by new comparison videos shared online this week.</p>
<p>The new comparison videos, put together by Cycu1, showcase the Unreal Engine 4.27 and 4.25 versions of Abandoned Warehouse and Ancient Temple tech demos developed by Scan Factory with their Unreal Engine 5.1 ports. Both videos highlight how the difference in shadows and accurate lighting is not that massive to justify the performance hit in both demos, which is often close to a 100 FPS difference on an RTX 4080 GPU.</p>
<p><iframe title="Abandoned Werehouse Demo Unreal Engine 4.27 vs Unreal Engine 5.1 RTX 4080 Graphics Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViDILolphuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="Ancient Temple Demo Unreal Engine 4.25 vs Unreal Engine 5.1 RTX 4080 Graphics Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRflwKil6MI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have seen the Unreal Engine 5 <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-struggles-native-4k-rtx-4080/">pushing current generation high-end GPUs to their limit</a>, as the RTX 4080 struggles to run some tech demos with decent performance at native 4K resolution. As such, it's clear that the new version of the engine by Epic needs plenty more work to deliver smooth gaming experiences, although it seems like playing at native 4K resolution may be something that only a few players with the best possible rigs will be able to do in the future, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-cant-run-native-4k-engine-design/">upscaling is an important feature of the engine that is expected to be used</a> by developers to achieve playable framerates.</p>
<p>The latest version of the engine by Epic is Unreal Engine 5.4. You can learn more about it by heading over to its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24186316/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-notes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fromsoftware-just-made-the-elden-ring-dlc-a-little-bit-easier.911571/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186316/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-notes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="YLXwTH">FromSoftware has released a surprise mini-patch — or “<a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122">calibration update</a>,” as it’s calling it — for <em>Elden Ring</em> that should ease the steep difficulty challenge posed by its new expansion, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>.</p>
<p id="ysn0zk">The patch adjusts the way Shadow Realm Blessings, a crucial character advancement system in the DLC, will scale. The blessings increase the attack and defense of player characters and their spirit summons through the collection of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24178006/scadutree-fragment-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Scadutree Fragments</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24178007/revered-spirit-ashes-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Revered Spirit Ashes</a>.</p>
<p id="HlXFmh">FromSoftware says it has increased the value of the blessings for the first half of players’ progress, and then made progression for the second half more gradual. The final level of enhancements has also been upped slightly.</p>
<p id="0UV0TA">In short, this adjusted power curve should mean players feel more powerful in the early parts of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, where the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180254/all-dlc-boss-locations-bosses-in-order">first few bosses</a> have been giving the community serious trouble. The final boss should be a bit easier now, too.</p>
<p id="hndE9i">Note that you need to log in to <em>Elden Ring</em>’s multiplayer server for the changes to apply. The version number displayed on the title menu screen should be 1.12.2.</p>
<p id="hV7myH">That’s it for changes in this small emergency patch. However, FromSoftware also noted that it has confirmed a bug in the PC version of the game that causes raytracing to be enabled when loading save data from previous versions of the game. If you’re suffering from poor performance, the developer recommends checking your graphics settings to ensure raytracing hasn’t been unintentionally turned on.</p>
<p id="U4FQ56">Further balance changes and bug fixes will be coming in a future patch, FromSoftware said.</p>

        <p>Nexon's title earned double that of Tencent's best-selling game Honor of Kings</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Tencent and Nexon's latest release Dungeon &amp; Fighter Mobile exceeded $270 million during its first month of release in China, according to Sensor Tower.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-24/tencent-s-new-game-doubles-honor-of-kings-sales-in-first-month">Bloomberg</a>, the mobile title also ranked in the top spot for downloads and revenues on Apple's App Store following its release on May 21. It also earned twice as much as Tencent's best-selling game Honor of Kings.</p>
<p>The spin-off of Nexon's Dungeon &amp; Fighter series initially launched in South Korea in 2022, with Tencent earning the publishing rights of the game for China shortly after. Its release was delayed due to government restrictions, as noted by <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/dungeon-and-fighter-mobiles-first-month-of-ios-revenue-was-twice-that-of-honor-of-kings/">PocketGamer</a>.</p>
<p>"Since its release, Dungeon &amp; Fighter Mobile has been occupying the top positions for the iOS charts in all categories," said Sensor Tower's senior director of Asia-Pacific marketing Nan Lu.</p>
<p>"This is a very impressive start, and it has been stable as well. The future performance will depend on Tencent's operations and continuous update of the game."</p>

            <p>Playground Games is delisting Forza Horizon 4 from online stores at the end of the year, due to "licensing and agreements" with the game's partners.</p>
<p>On 15th December, Forza Horizon 4 will be removed from digital storefronts on PC and Xbox. This includes Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>The upcoming delisting means the new Series and Festival Playlist that started earlier this week, and which runs until 22nd August, will be the last. After this time, players will no longer be able to access the playlist screen, other than to see the festival playlist history.</p>

<p>"Even though there won't be any more Festival Playlists after Series 77 (August 22), you will still be able to see the Forza Events screen which will include a selection of daily and weekly challenges," Playground Games shared in a <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting">blog</a>. Completing these challenges and Forzathon Live Events will earn players Forzathon Points, which can be exchanged for Backstage Passes.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 4's DLC has already been delisted, meaning from now on this content can only be acquired through purchases of the game's Deluxe or Ultimate Edition versions.</p>
<p>"Players who already own the game and its content will be able to download and play it as normal, including its offline, online, and multiplayer features," Playground said. "Physical copies of the game purchased after [15th December] will also work and will be able to use online features."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Attention Forza Horizon 4 players!  </p><p>We have an important announcement regarding how FH4’s Festival Playlist will work after Series 77 (from July 25 until August 22) and its availability in digital stores after December 15.  </p><p>Please, read the complete update here:… <a href="https://t.co/sFrZU5sjOq">pic.twitter.com/sFrZU5sjOq</a></p></div>— Forza Horizon (@ForzaHorizon) <a href="https://twitter.com/ForzaHorizon/status/1805650519853351346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Ahead of December's digital delisting, Playground will sell Forza Horizon 4 cheaper - though pricing is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Anyone who played the base game via Xbox's Game Pass subscription service and subsequently purchased DLC will be provided with a "token" for the game they can redeem, Playground also said.</p>

            <p>When I finished my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">review</a> for Soulslike Lies Of P, the devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/good-news-casual-soulslikers-lies-of-ps-latest-update-makes-it-dramatically-easier">released a patch</a> not long after that nerfed bosses and made things for ol' Pinnochio easier overall. Sod's Law struck that day… and it's returned with a smirk. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> has just been patched, making its Shadow Realm Blessings stronger from the off, and in turn, things a little easier for everybody. Such is the life of a reviewer, eh.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In what FromSoftware are calling "<a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122">Calibration Update - Version 1.12.2</a>", they've buffed the power of the Shadow Realm Blessings you'll find scattered exclusively throughout Erdtree's areas. Both Scadutree Fragments and Revered Ash Blessings have had their attack and damage negation increased for the "first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements". Once you've obtained the first half, later blessings will see more of a gradual increase to your stats.</p>
<p>In addition, the attack and damage negation granted by the "final level" of those blessings has been slightly increased. There aren't any concrete stats to analyse here, but the general gist is simple to understand: Blessings are strongerer.</p>
<p>To get the update you'll need to login to the multiplayer servers once you've booted up the game. You'll know if you're on the right build if you see "1.12.2" at the bottom right of the title menu. FromSoft says later "balance adjustments as well as bug fixes" are planned for a future patch.</p>
<p>And if you've been experiencing performance issues, the patch notes say to check in System &gt; Graphics Settings &gt; Raytracing Quality settings and see if it's been toggled to turn on automatically. If it has, it might be worth switching it off and seeing if things improve.</p>
<p>Erdtree <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">launched to a mixed reception on Steam</a>, despite a positive critical reception. That came down to performance issues, but mainly, the DLC's difficulty when it comes to bosses being particularly overbearing. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-mod-resets-the-difficulty-to-elden-ring-levels-and-gets-rid-of-scadutree-fragments">A mod</a> was even released that balanced Erdtree's enemies to be more in line with the base game.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm fine with FromSoft lowering the difficulty and agree with Nic's sentiment in the "mixed reception" piece that the pushback is valid, but I don't think the game deserves to be bombed because it's particularly challenging. Erdtree's bosses are definitely more nightmarish in their damage output and design, but Erdtree gives you tools to make life easier, moreso than any other entry in the Souls catalogue. Like the Blessings, like the summonable pals or online co-op, like the copious number of builds and elixir combinations.</p>
<p>If you're struggling, I'd advise going off and seeking out those Blessings (with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragment-locations">help of this guide</a> that rounds them all up) as well as rejigging your set up. You can do it! I mean, you beat Elden Ring to get here, right?</p>

			<p>Known Unreal Engine 5 concept artist TeaserPlay is working on a brand-new UE5-powered horror game - Homeless.</p>
<p>Late last year <a href="https://wccftech.com/gravehard-shift-teaserplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we reported</a> that the artist and his two-man studio DarkPhobia Games were working on atmospheric horror title Graveyard Shift. This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2636420/Graveyard_Shift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game is now available via Steam</a> and has been positively received. Fast forward eight months, and TeaserPlay has now announced that he's working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3018910/Homeless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homeless</a> - a horror title set in New York in the 90s. In the game, players play as security guard Albert, patrolling the subway tunnels during which he encountering a rather sinister individual. Gameplay mechanics for Homeless include investigation, puzzle-solving, exploration, and occasional gun-play. "As communication lines go down, you find yourself trapped with a flesh-eating predator, you must navigate the new York streets and subway corridors, uncover The Vulture's dark past, and stop him before becoming his next meal", the description of Homeless reads.</p>
<p>"The gameplay emphasizes the player's sense of responsibility as a security guard. The level design is intended to make the player feel like a real security guard. You'll need to check CCTV, patrol the area, and investigate suspicious activity like a real security guard."</p>
<p>We've included the reveal trailer for this upcoming new horror game below. Let us know what you think.</p>

        <p>Atari relaunched Infogrames in April</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Atari's Infogrames label has picked up the Surgeon Simulator series from TinyBuild.</p>
<p>The publishing division was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-relaunches-infogrames-acquires-totally-reliable-delivery-service">relaunched by Atari in April</a> to focus on games outside of Atari's core portfolio of IP. Alongside that launch, the firm announced the acquisition of the Totally Reliable Delivery Service, also from TinyBuild.</p>
<p>Surgeon Simulator is a comedy medical operation simulator developed by Bossa Studios. Titles in the franchise include the 2013 original, the 2016 VR game Surgeon Simulator VR: Meet the Medic, the 2018 Switch title Surgeon Simulator CPR and the 2020 sequel Surgeon Simulator 2: Access All Areas.</p>
<p>Infogrames says it plans to expand the distribution of these games, explore merchandising opportunities and potentially develop new titles.</p>
<p>“More than 10 years after the release of the original, <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> remains a popular and unique franchise,” stated Infogrames manager Geoffroy Châteauvieux. “This was a rare opportunity to acquire a game with a timeless appeal, and we are excited to have <em>Surgeon Simulator </em>within the Infogrames portfolio.”</p>
<p>Infogrames was founded in 1983 in Paris, and grew aggressively through the 1990s and early 2000s via a slew of acquisitions. It licensed the Atari brand in 2003 and rebranded the business under that name. What followed was a series of huge losses, resulting in cuts and closures, a company re-organisation and the full acquisition of Atari Inc. The firm's European distribution business was then sold to Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>After a few failed efforts to refocus the brand around different concepts, the current Atari leadership has <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ataris-re-focus-on-retro">focused on the growing retro games market</a>, and has acquired several remaster and remake specialists, including <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-to-acquire-digital-eclipse-in-20m-deal">Digital Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-to-acquire-nightdive-studios-for-10m">Nightdive Studios</a>. It has also acquired numerous IP catalogues, such as titles from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games">Intellivison</a>, M Network Games and Stern Electronics (plus any more).</p>

            <p>
FromSoftware is well known for adding seemingly useless items or places in its games to get fans speculating about lore and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree is no different.
</p>
<p>
But there's one particular location that has fans stumped: the Scadutree Chalice.
</p>
<p>
This is a named location found after beating a specific boss, but it appears to serve no purpose. What could it be? <strong>Spoilers follow</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The Scadutree Chalice is found in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-get-to-shadow-keeps-back-gate-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">area behind the Shadow Keep</a>. Players will need to beat Commander Gaius first - he's the armoured boar-riding boss who reminds me a little of that orc in Twilight Princess.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards, players can wander into a new area which leads up to an archway and a precipice overlooking the Scadutree that dominates the skyline. Here players will find an enormous unlit stone chalice with five fragments scattered around it.
</p>
<p>
Now, on a basic level, those fragments are incredibly useful as they're used to level the player's Shadow Blessing. But finding five in one place? That's definitely unusual.
</p>

<figcaption>Riding up to the archway and pondering the purpose of this chalice</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
So what is it for? My first thought was this would be the location to use Messmer's Kindling, but soon found a use for this elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
My own, loose theory is that the chalice relates to the Scadutree fragments. That's obvious considering the name and the fact it overlooks the tree. But is this where fragments are formed or their power distilled? Or were fragments used here in some sort of ritual, hence so many being scattered nearby?
</p>
<p>The item description for the fragments reads: "A splinter of the Scadutree that contains golden brilliance...It is said that when the Scadutree crumbles from its core that it will scatter across the entire realm of shadow. The people of the Erdtree collect the splinters and use them in prayer." Is that prayer only at Sites of Grace, or this chalice too?</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Katharine Castle has also been investigating, testing out multiple poses or wearing Gaius' armour, considering the nearby Albinauric drops his greaves. But so far, all to no avail.

<p>
Players on reddit have also been speculating, following a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dlszyr/does_anyone_know_what_the_scadutree_chalice_is_or/">post from XSidsgothemX</a>. They suggest it could relate to the Albinaurics, hence the shack nearby, perhaps hinting at how they're made, or that their blood is required?
</p>
<p>
"There's just no way its useless. I'm hopeful there's a secret quest we haven't discovered that allows interaction with the Scadutree," one reply reads.
</p>
<p>
Others have tried lighting the chalice with different pots, but with no effect. 
</p>
<p>
Another user, Rockerode, suggests the chalice could also relate to the Suppression Tower - this is found in the first area but serves no purpose beyond housing a chest. "I think between Scadutree chalice, suppression tower, and the trailer showing a scene none of us have unlocked there's something going on here," they propose, perhaps linking to some sort of quest to perform a ritual and cleanse the Scadutree. Is there a secret ending somewhere yet to be found?
</p>
<p>
Or maybe, just maybe, the chalice has no purpose beyond those five fragments. And that, certainly, is reward enough.
</p>
<p>
Do you have any theories on what the Scadutree Chalice is for, or represents?
</p>
<p>
Scadutree Fragments are integral to the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC as the primary method of character progression. Earlier today, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-revises-shadow-realm-blessing-balance">new patch for the game was released</a> which re-balances the scaling of their Blessings.

            <p>Celebrity streamer and Midnight Society co-founder Guy Beahm or "Dr Disrespect" has finally responded in full to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deadrop-developer-midnight-society-cuts-ties-with-dr-disrespect-following-new-twitch-ban-allegations">allegations that he was banned from Twitch for sending sext messages to a minor</a>. In a much-edited statement on Xitter yesterday, Beahm confessed that, yes, he messaged an "individual minor" via the Twitch Whispers services in 2017, characterising the messages as "casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more".</p><!--more-->
<p>As we wrote in yesterday's report, Twitch cancelled a multiple-year exclusivity contract with Beahm, then one of the platform's biggest stars, in 2020. At the time, Twitch <a href="https://x.com/Shannon_Liao/status/1276617617730568195">would only say</a> that Beahm had acted "in violation of our Community Guidelines". Beahm sued Twitch over the ban in 2021, but the suit was eventually <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/drdisrespect-settles-his-lawsuit-with-twitch/">settled</a> with neither party admitting wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Last week, however, former Twitch strategic partnerships account director Cody Conners <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">accused</a> Beahm of "sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch Whispers product" adding that Beahm "was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon", the company's semi-annual gaming convention. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">The Verge</a>'s Ash Parrish subsequently obtained comment from two unnamed former Twitch employees who corroborated Conners's account.</p>
<p>Beahm pushed back, rejecting the claim that he had been grooming a minor while saying that the terms of his settlement with Twitch forbade him from going into detail. "I didn't do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid," he <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">wrote on Xitter</a>.</p>
<p>Beahm's colleagues at The Midnight Society weren't convinced by his defence, announcing on Monday 24th June that they would ties with Beahm "in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals" following an internal inquiry.</p>
<p>Which brings us to last night, when Beahm finally addressed the allegations directly in <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089">a lengthy Xitter statement</a>. "Everyone has been wanting to know why I was banned from twitch, but for reasons outside of my control, I was not allowed to say anything for the last several years," Beahm writes in the post. "Now that two former twitch employees have publicly disclosed the accusations, I can now tell you my side of the story regarding the ban.</p>
<p>"Were there twitch whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017? The answer is yes. Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not. These were casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more. Nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed, I never even met the individual. I went through a lengthy arbitration regarding a civil dispute with twitch and that case was resolved by a settlement. Let me be clear, it was not a criminal case against me and no criminal charges have ever been brought against me.</p>
<p>"Now, from a moral standpoint I'll absolutely take responsibility," it continues. "I should have never entertained these conversations to begin with. That's on me. That's on me as an adult, a husband and a father. It should have never happened. I get it. I'm not perfect and I'll fucking own my shit."</p>
<p>The last line would be more convincing if the post hadn't been repeatedly edited since publication to first remove, then restore the word "minor", as you can see by clicking the "last edited" text at the bottom. In general, the post strikes me as a very rambling, loud but elusive way of saying "yes, I did the thing they're accused me of".</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the post, Beahm apologises to The Midnight Society, presenting his departure from the studio as a collective decision, rather than one imposed on him. He also describes "remarks and labels being thrown around" that he is a "predator or pedophile" as "exaggerations", commenting "that's a different level of disgust that I fucking hate even hearing about". Finally, he insists that he's not going to let being caught sending a minor dodgy messages interfere with his career.</p>
<p>"If you're uncomfortable with this entire statement and think I'm a piece of shit, that's fine," the post concludes. "But I'm not fucking going anywhere. I'm not the same guy that made this mistake all those years ago. I'm taking an extended vacation with my family as mentioned on stream and I'm coming back with a heavy weight off my shoulders. They want me to disappear... yeah fucking right."</p>
<p>Ah yes, the infamous "they", that cabal of nay-sayers hell-bent on bringing down a good man for the merest offence of maybe just possibly being a little bit of a creep. Going by the comments on the X-post, I'm not sure Beahm's fans are clamouring for his return from holiday.</p>

            <p>With a groan, it rises. The first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> is a piece of horror game history, and it has just come shambling back to PC after a long time putrefying. Ye olde games shoppe, GOG.com is selling the 1996 survival horror classic as a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil">digital download</a>, so you don't have to go rummaging through eBay auctions to find an original physical copy anymore. It's going for £9/$10. But the smile-raiser is the revelation that its sequels, Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, will also be getting reanimated in their original polygonal glory.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Resident Evil was first ported to Windows back in 1997, after its release on PlayStation. It got a few re-releases soon after that, mostly updated editions. But time scratches all surfaces, and the PC port was left languishing even while the old version of the game reappeared digitally on the classics catalogue of PlayStation. Now, it's playable again on PC. (Well, it's long been playable to anyone who cared enough to emulate it, but that's another story...)</p>
<p>The GOG re-release promises very few changes, aside from support for modern controllers,  "new rendering options" and "improved timing of the cutscenes". It's fun to read the original description that would have been splashed on the back of the game's box. "Completely uncut, with even more blood, graphic violence and gory scenes than the worldwide monster hit version on PlayStation," it says. Please understand, it was the 1990s, people <em>loved</em> seeing exposed intestines. It was an interesting decade.</p>
<p>The sequels are also going to see a re-release. "Capcom's Resident Evil series has defined and revolutionized the survival horror genre," say GOG in a post <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/capcom_and_gog_join_forces_to_release_the_original_resident_evil_trilogy_2ad34">on their forums</a>, where they point out you can now wishlist <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_2?source=news">both</a> <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_3?source=news">sequels</a>. None of these should be confused with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_(2002_video_game)">Resident Evil remake</a> of 2002, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-2-review">Resident Evil 2 remake</a> of 2019, or the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-3-review">Resident Evil 3 remake</a> of 2020. But those are all pretty swell survival horrors too.</p>
<p>My personal memory of Resident Evil is getting it from a friend while hankering badly for its sequel, which I was reading about in every magazine I could find. I played up until the first zombie, whose iconic head-turn freaked me the flip out, whereupon I stopped playing and went to hang out with my dad in another well-lit room. I told this story enough times that my brother now recounts it as a memory of his own. That's okay, it's a good memory, we can share it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-%E2%80%93-how-to-defeat-bayle-the-dread.911514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-defeat-bayle-the-dread/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring/shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> is filled to the brim with powerful enemies, but very few can compete with Bayle the Dread, one of the most fearsome dragons created by FromSoftware. Taking down this enemy is rather difficult, but you can make your life easier in several different ways.</p>
<p>Bayle the Dread is fought at the summit of the Jagged Peak, which can be reached easily by climbing the mountain. The location is pretty linear, so simply following the main path will allow you to reach the summit. However, you will have to fight two bosses, the Jagged Peak Drake and the Ancient Dragon Senessax, on the way, so be prepared for some intense fights. Also, make sure to speak with Igon at Pillar Path Waypoint, read Igon's message at the Dragon Pit Terminus, visit the Grand Altar of Dragon Communion to speak with the Dragon Priestess to be able to summon Igon during the Bayle fight and receive his gear when the Dread has been defeated.</p>
<p>Preparation is extremely important to have an easier time against Bayle the Dread in Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. For starters, the boss is meant to be some sort of ultimate challenge, and so its difficulty is on par with that of the boss of Enir-Ilim. For this reason, it's best to attempt to take down the dragon after improving the Scadutree Blessing as much as possible and level up Vigor to at least 60, as the dragon hits extremely hard and can one-shot you with some of its attacks. To increase your survivability, equip Boltdrake and Flamedrake Talismans to increase Fire and Lighting damage reduction. If your build allows you to use it, the Ancient Dragon Hunter's Great Katana is an excellent weapon to use, thanks to its Weapon Skill, Dragonwound Slash, which unleashes a powerful ranged attack with its charged version that can be easily directed at the dragon's head by simply locking onto it. If you have no means of hitting the dragon's head consistently, you will have to attack the damaged leg. Hitting any other part of the body will deal lower damage, making the battle longer than it should and increasing the chance of your defeat in the process.</p>
<h2>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp; - Bayle the Dread First Phase</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240625010439_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As soon as you cross the fog wall, before doing anything else, you should summon Igon by interacting with his sign by the arena's entrance. As the NPC is summoned when the battle has already begun, Bayle's HP will not increase, so he can be a pretty decent help. Also, you need to summon him to complete his quest, so make sure to always do so.</p>
<p>Once Igon has been summoned, you may want to use your Spirit Ashes summon to get an extra helping hand. As Bayle is pretty aggressive, you will have to do so during one of the same windows of opportunities you will use to attack the dragon, so after the breath attacks, the bite attack, which is signaled by a glow in the dragon's mouth, or after he has performed the spinning tail attack.</p>
<p>The first phase of the fight is actually pretty easy to get through if you're careful. Instead of locking onto the boss, wait for the dragon to come closer to you and get under its body to attack the damaged leg. The vast majority of times, you can attack the leg a couple of times, get away to avoid the breath attack, rinse and repeat. The timing to avoid the breath attack is pretty strict, so do not dodge roll unless you are at light equipment load. If the dragon is targeting Igon, doing this is even easier, as Bayle won't even attempt to retaliate with one of his breath attacks.</p>
<p>If you're using a ranged or magic build, you will have to watch out for more attacks. Thankfully, they are rather telegraphed and somewhat easy to avoid. The first breath attack, which shoots a beam of fire and lighting straight at you, can be avoided by running to the side, while the other with the advancing flames can be avoided by rolling into it. The aforementioned tail-spinning attack can be recognized by the dragon's stepping back and can be easily avoided by dodging it as well. The crashing down attack, which comes after Bayle leaps in the air, can be avoided by dodging into it as well, but refrain from attacking for too long, as this attack has low recovery, and you risk getting hit if you overextend.</p>
<h2>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp; - Bayle the Dread Second Phase</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240626115335_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you have depleted half of his life, the second phase of the fight will begin. During this, Bayle will often fly around the arena to unleash hell on you. Avoiding the projectiles from the air and the ground attacks is simple enough, but you will have to be even more careful when approaching him to attack or when healing. In phase 2, staying below the dragon to attack his damaged leg is still a viable strategy, possibly even so, but his attack patterns become faster and more unpredictable, so never get greedy unless you are sure your next flurry of attacks will take the boss down.</p>
<p>Once you have defeated Bayle the Dread, you will get the Bayle's Heart item, which can be traded at the Grand Altar of Dragon Communion for Bayle's Flame Lightning or Bayle's Tyranny. In the area, you can also pick the Priestess Heart, which can be used to turn into a dragon, and the Flowerstone Gavel weapon.</p>

        <p>Ghost of Tsushima and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door debuted as the top earners on their respective platforms</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Fortnite continues to lead Newzoo's revenue and user engagement charts for May, having topped both the previous month.</p>
<p>This is according to the research firm's monthly engagement and revenue charts for games across PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch across six markets including the US, UK, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy.</p>
<p>The Top five for both charts remained the same as in April, being led by Fortnite followed by Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, 3, and Warzone 2.0, Minecraft, Roblox, and Grand Theft Auto 5.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's free-to-play shooter XDefiant, which launched on May 21 following a closed beta, jumped the charts from No.33 to No.6 in terms of monthly active users.</p>
<p>The Top 20 revenue earners featured two new releases, including the PC port of Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima in fifth place and Nintendo's remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door in sixth place.</p>
<p>Both games debuted in first place on their respective platform charts, with Newzoo acknowledging that Ghost of Tsushima's release on PC boosted sales on PlayStation as well.</p>
<p>Elden Ring also rose 17 places in the overall revenue ranking, with its revenue increasing across all platforms prior to the release of its Shadow of the Erdtree DLC on June 21.</p>
<p>Here are the Top 20 games by monthly active users across US, UK, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy for May, across PC and consoles, according to Newzoo:</p>

<p>A dataminer has leaked upcoming DLC characters for Mortal Kombat 1, which is said to include Terminators T-1000.</p>



<p>According to the leaker interloko via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=566SCksuvtk&amp;ab_channel=Interloko" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, six upcoming characters will soon be coming to Mortal Kombat 1. While the leaker says that the information is “100% confirmed” in his video, it should be stressed that this information has been datamined and has the potential to not be released. That being said, the six characters include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cyrax</li>



<li>Sektor</li>



<li>Noob Saibot</li>



<li>Ghostface</li>



<li>Conan the Barbarian</li>

<p>In addition to the six characters, the leaker also found references to five new game announcers and two brand-new arenas.</p>



<p>In September 2023, dataminers had already found <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-ghostface-halloween/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">code references </a>to Ghost Face, which Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon teased in a <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1707508202638602342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet</a>. Back then, the same dataminer who found references to Ghost Face also found references for Noob Saibot, Cyrax, and Conan the Barbarian. </p>



<p>The recent findings could suggest that the characters are nearing a release.</p>



<p>What do you think of the potential six brand-new characters coming to Mortal Kombat 1? And who are you most anticipated to see? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

            <p>The human body is a wonderfully complex organism, and it’s well worth trusting your instincts when it comes to feeling repulsed by certain things. We know that if the milk looks bad and smells bad, it is bad. Do not taste the forbidden yogurt, as much as it calls to you. How, then, to interpret my visceral repulsion to the most disgusting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> build yet seen? So gross, in fact, that YouTuber SYROBE has managed to beat the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> DLC’s infamously ridiculous final boss in a mere 13 seconds. Here’s the video. Massive spoilers, obviously.</p>

<figure>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v20jFYM0nLI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The build uses the lightning variant of the new perfume bottle weapon - specifically, its ash of war ability Rolling Sparks. SYROBE credits the weapon classes’ multiple exploding hitboxes for its silly damage potential, and says the ash of war condenses these usually diffuse hitboxes into a single area when aimed downwards. He’s also got the maximum Scadutree blessing, which boosts his stats in the DLC area. Rounding the build off are a bevvy of buffs from equipment, such as the black dumpling hat, the madness talisman, and the lightning cracked tear. He’s done the math, basically, and the math is sickening.</p>
<p>After breaking down the build, SYROBE completes his victory lap by melting the final boss of the DLC in a world record 13 seconds. Coincidentally, that’s also my own record for how long I can last against the same boss without getting pounded into the dirt. </p>
<p>It’s early days yet, but this sort of discovery does suggest that Shadow Of The Erdtree’s increased difficulty comes alongside various ways to mitigate it aside from the more apparent Scadutree fragments. Might the players who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">found the DLC too obnoxious</a> change their minds now? Is Mizayaki having a crack at his sweatier fans by making the most powerful weapon yet seen a gentle nod to always pack deodorant? Will this inspire me to try a different weapon to the same greatsword I’ve been using for twenty hours now? Who knows!</p>

            <p>
A patch for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has been released that revises the scaling of the Shadow Realm Blessings.
</p>
<p>
The DLC includes this new scaling system to boost the attack and defence of both your character and your spirit summons, by collecting Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes respectively.
</p>
<p>
Now the scaling has been revised so that the effects are greater for the first few levels, before becoming more gradual later.

<p>

After that, the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased (there is a fixed number of fragments to collect).
</p>
<p>
The difficulty of the DLC has been a major talking point since its release, in particular players finding the quest initially too difficult and then struggling with the final boss. This balance revision should assist players in both regards.
</p>
<p>
The patch also addresses graphics settings on PC, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-falls-to-a-mixed-steam-rating-as-pc-players-complain-about-difficulty-and-performance">players complained on Steam of performance issues</a>.

</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122">patch notes</a> confirm a bug has been found where ray tracing settings are automatically enabled when loading saved data from a previous version of the game.
</p>
<p>
Further, if the frame rate is unstable, it's recommended to check if ray tracing is enabled in the system menu and set this to off.
</p>
<p>
Future patches will offer other balance adjustments (including enemy difficulty in NG+), fix bugs, and update performance.
</p>
<p>
Elden Ring publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-publisher-calls-out-shadow-of-the-erdtree-players-struggling-with-the-difficulty">Bandai Namco previously suggested struggling players focus on levelling up their Blessings</a>, but this new patch is a more direct change.

</p>
<p>
The release of the DLC has provided a fresh reason for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/streamers-continue-to-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-in-weird-and-wonderful-ways">streamers to play the game in weird and wonderful ways</a>, including with their mind.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-balance-gets-tweaked-with-update-1-12-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the main complaints <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-steam-user-reviews-are-mixed-citing-excessive-difficulty-and-performance-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading to 'Mixed' user reviews</a> for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is the expansion's supposed unbalance. As if to answer users' complaints, developer FromSoftware has released Calibration update 1.12.2, tweaking the scaling of Shadow Realm Blessings as detailed below.</p>
<p><em>Attack and damage negation curve scaling of the&nbsp;<b>Shadow Realm Blessings</b>&nbsp;have been revised.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of&nbsp;<b>Blessing enhancements</b>, and the second half will now be more gradual.</em></li>
<li><em>The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The calibration update can be applied by logging into the multiplayer server.</em></p>
<p><em>If the Calibration Ver. listed at the bottom right of the title menu is not "1.12.2", then select LOGIN and apply the latest regulations before enjoying the game.</em></p>
<p>Granted, this is a relatively small change, and FromSoftware is fully aware of that. The patch notes for Calibration update 1.12.2 end with a mention of further balance changes and bug fixes coming in a future Shadow of the Erdtree update.</p>
<p>Additionally, the developers said there is a bug where sometimes loading a save from a previous version of Elden Ring will enable ray tracing on PC. Check your graphics settings to confirm whether it has been incorrectly enabled on your system.</p>
<p>Shadow of the Erdtree may have gotten a lukewarm reception from some users, but it still received excellent reviews from critics. Our Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave it a perfect score</a>:</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world.</em></p>

			<p>Nearly a year after its September 2023 launch, Counter-Strike 2 has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/4257672198473442891?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> the first batch of community maps. Thera and Mills have been added to the Competitive, Casual, and Deathmatch map groups, Memento and Assembly to the Wingman map pool, and Pool Day to the Arms Race map pool.</p>
<p>This Counter-Strike 2 update also makes it easier to gain badges and improves the MVP panel, with Premier matches getting a new animated panel. Finally, a bunch of new graphics-related settings (including a dedicated frame pacing option) are available for tweaking, as detailed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Settings Recommendations</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Added a Settings Recommendation popup if your display's refresh rate is set below its maximum at startup. Using your display's highest refresh rate is generally recommended.</em></li>
<li><em>Added a Settings Recommendation popup if NVIDIA G-Sync support is detected but not enabled at startup. Using G-Sync is generally recommended if your system supports it.</em></li>
<li><em>Added a Settings Recommendation popup if NVIDIA G-Sync is enabled but not V-Sync and/or NVIDIA Reflex. It is generally recommended to enable all three settings together when they are available. Note that applying these settings will limit your frame rate to your display's refresh rate or slightly lower, which is usually the smoothest-looking and lowest input latency settings combination.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Removed "Main Menu Background Scenery" and "Item Inspect Background Scenery" settings from the Video Settings page. These settings are still available on the Main Menu and in the Item Inspect screens respectively.</em></li>
<li><em>The "Refresh Rate" setting now shows your display's current refresh rate in Windowed and Fullscreen Windowed modes.</em></li>
<li><em>Removed the "Laptop Power Savings" setting which has never actually been configurable in CS2.</em></li>
<li><em>Added a "Frame Pacing" section to the Advanced Video settings page.</em></li>
<li><em>Added an "NVIDIA G-Sync" row to the Frame Pacing section which tells you whether or not G-Sync is active with your current display settings. This row may be hidden if you're using the Vulkan renderer or if you're not using an NVIDIA graphics card.</em></li>
<li><em>Added "Maximum FPS In Game" and "Maximum FPS In Menus" sliders to the Frame Pacing section. These control the fps_max and fps_max_ui convars respectively.</em></li>
<li><em>Increased the default "Maximum FPS In Menus" setting from 120 FPS to 200 FPS.</em></li>
<li><em>The Advanced Video visual preview now uses the "In Game" maximum FPS instead of the "In Menus" maximum</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Counter-Strike 2 remains the most popular game on Steam, with the exception of rare peaks like PUBG and <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-sold-6-million-units-in-4-days-passes-1-5-million-concurrent-steam-players-puredarks-fsr3-mod-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palworld</a>. In the last 24 hours, Valve's competitive first-person shooter game registered a peak of 1.37 million players, over twice as many as the second game (Dota 2, also made by Valve).</p>

  <p id="s5niyx">The original Windows PC version of Capcom’s <em>Resident Evil</em> is now available through digital storefront GOG, letting PC players experience the groundbreaking survival horror classic as it was back in 1996. PC versions of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/21/18187446/resident-evil-2-history-capcom-hideki-kamiya"><em>Resident Evil 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/18/21027264/resident-evil-3-was-a-spin-off-until-capcom-changed-its-mind-at-the-last-minute"><em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em></a> are also getting a re-release through GOG, the company announced Wednesday.</p>
<p id="Vy8s59">The re-release of <em>Resident Evil</em> for PC includes all of its original content with “quality of life improvements and enhanced compatibility for modern systems.” As with other PC releases through GOG, <em>Resident Evil</em>’s PC version is DRM-free.</p>
<p id="ohJw7S">Additionally, <em>Resident Evil 2</em> and <em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em> are available to wishlist through GOG, and available for pre-purchase in a trilogy bundle.</p>
<p id="hlyWeD">The original <em>Resident Evil</em> was released first for PlayStation in 1996. Capcom later ported the game to Windows, a release that included uncensored footage not available in the original PlayStation version. The PC version of <em>Resident Evil</em> also had two additional unlockable weapons: the Ingram submachine gun for Jill Valentine and Minimi light machine gun for Chris Redfield. Jill and Chris also got PC-exclusive unlockable costumes.</p>

<p id="6xVXCB">Capcom’s 2002 <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/19/7550887/resident-evil-hd-remaster-review-pc-xbox-one-ps4-playstation-4-360-3">remake of <em>Resident Evil</em> has been available on Windows PC</a> for nearly a decade now. But the classic PC version of <em>Resident Evil</em> has been stuck on CD-ROM format for much longer, though unofficial downloads of the game are readily available. The GOG release will be a legitimate and official way to acquire the PC version of <em>Resident Evil</em> and, eventually, its 1998 and 1999 sequels.</p>
<p id="rQk0av"><em>Resident Evil 2</em>’s PC version was based on the PlayStation “Dual Shock Ver.” re-release of the game, and included high-resolution character models and an art gallery. <em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em> for PC also featured enhanced 3D character models and higher-resolution graphics, but was dinged by players for its keyboard and mouse support.</p>
<p id="GVDJPW">Capcom has remade the first four mainline games in the Resident Evil franchise over the past two decades, but the GOG re-releases will give survival horror fans a chance to replay the originals in their original, tank-controlled forms, albeit with some modern conveniences.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dr Disrespect Loses Tens of Thousands of Followers As The Internet Shames Him]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-loses-followers-allegations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dr-disrespect-loses-tens-of-thousands-of-followers-as-the-internet-shames-him.911439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-loses-followers-allegations/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Yesterday, Dr Disrespect posted a statement on social media confirming that the recent allegations are true – he was banned from Twitch in 2020 for inappropriately messaging a minor in 2017. In the lengthy statement, Dr Disrespect set the story straight and explained that this won’t end him and that after an extended vacation, he’ll be back and raring to go, insinuating that he’s immune to ‘cancel culture’.</p>



<p>However, in the hours that followed the publishing of his statement, Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm lost tens of thousands of followers across YouTube and Twitter, with the downturn gathering pace over time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-t-support-that">Can’t Support That</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr Disrespect’s statement</a> may have done more harm than good. It cleared things up, but it confirmed that in 2017, he was knowingly and inappropriately messaging a minor on Twitch. As the bombshell hit social media, Beahm’s closest creator friends shared messages and videos, most of them weighing heavily on the side of giving up on the charismatic, brash creator. </p>



<p>The likes of TimTheTatman and NICKMERCS spoke harshly against Dr Disrespect, stressing that there’s no excuse for his behaviour and that they can’t continue to support him going forward. These are streamers who Dr Disrespect has gamed with for years, and their statements are indicative of his support network crumbling around him.</p>



<p>Between Twitter and YouTube, Dr Disrespect lost around 30,000 followers as soon as his statement was released, and the expectation is that the number will continue to rise leading into the weekend. At the time of writing, Dr Disrespect had 4.71 million YouTube subscribers and 2.5 million Twitter followers, but it’s safe to assume that vast swathes of those followers are made up of bots and dead accounts.</p>



<p>Every content creator who is ‘somebody’ is speaking on this news, and the sentiment isn’t good for Dr Disrespect. He’s taking an extended vacation from streaming, but when he returns, he might find that there’s not much to come back to.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-many-episodes-is-the-acolyte-exactly.911421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24186178/acolyte-how-many-episodes-list<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="0mgBax"><em>The Acolyte</em> has never been exactly clear on what kind of Star Wars story it’s telling. Is it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171654/star-wars-acolyte-series-jedi-sol-force-powers-mind-reading">one of an ex-Jedi</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24177229/acolyte-master-who-is-answer">the Sith reborn</a>, an important origin story, or just a brief little adventure to introduce the world to the High Republic in live-action? The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24181235/star-wars-acolyte-mae-master-jedi-force-choke-origin">true answer is likely somewhere in between</a>, but we’ve got a few more episodes left before we know for sure. </p>
<p id="27NZcy">While it certainly seems like the show is on the verge of ending near the conclusion of episode 5, the series actually has a total of eight episodes. </p>
<p id="hlilnC">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> The rest of this post contains slight spoilers for <em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em>.]</p>
<p id="ugN0k6"><em>The Acolyte</em> started out with a simple question: who is killing all these Jedi? That question, however, was answered in the first episode. Since then it’s raised concerns about a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24185141/star-wars-acolyte-master-mask-donnie-darko-design">mysteriously masked master of the Force</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24176253/star-wars-acolyte-mae-osha-force-cult-witches">Force-sensitive Covens</a>, a Sith guy’s right to practice the Dark Side in peace and teach it to other people, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24181315/star-wars-acolyte-justice-for-kelnacca">daily life of a Wookiee Jedi exile</a>, and more. But by the end of episode 5, all of that has pretty much come to a close. </p>
<p id="fAuN1k">Instead, it seems like the last three episodes of the show (about an hour to 90 minutes of total runtime if the rest of the show is any indication) are going to be about Mae and Osha swapping places. Up until now, Mae has been a pretty clear vision of the Dark Side of the Force; she’s animated by her anger and strong emotions, she tries to kill her sister, and one way or another the fire she sets gets everyone she loves killed. Meanwhile, Osha is the picture of good Light Side behavior — even if she isn’t a Jedi anymore. She trusts in the Jedi and their way of doing things, she seems eager to avoid violence, and she certainly doesn’t approve of Mae’s quest for revenge. But that isn’t to say that either character has to stay that way for the whole show.</p>
<p id="ly5ZFx">Who knows, maybe this is a set up for the two to trade sides, with Mae joining the Jedi and Osha teaming up with the Dark Side — an anti-redemption arc could be a nice change of pace for modern Star Wars. Or maybe, with Osha captured, Mae will be forced to join the Jedi in taking down her master? Either way, the show’s go three more episodes to do something. </p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/23906339/austin-butler-the-bikeriders</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-one-has-ever-been-prettier-than-austin-butler-in-the-bikeriders.911415/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/23906339/austin-butler-the-bikeriders<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="ChaK0S"><small><em>This essay on </em></small><small>The Bikeriders</small><small><em> was originally written for the film’s European premiere at the 2023 BFI London Film Festival. It has been updated for the movie’s theatrical release.</em></small></p>
<p id="yhRMEM">Elvis Presley’s sadly unfulfilled ambition for his movie career was to be the next James Dean. So it’s an ironic coincidence that Austin Butler, after playing Elvis in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23180048/elvis-review-baz-luhrmann-tom-hanks-austin-butler">2022’s Best Picture Oscar nominee <em>Elvis</em></a>, should now take direct aim at the kind of simmering yet poised, unutterably cool and devastatingly handsome role that James Dean typified in the 1950s — and score a bullseye. He <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24097767/dune-2-stilgar-austin-butler-javier-bardem-feyd-rautha">brought a particularly creepy animal magnetism to <em>Dune: Part Two</em></a>, but it is absolutely ridiculous how good he looks in <em>The Bikeriders</em>.</p>
<p id="Hj7oSE">The movie is a motorcycle-gang drama set in the 1960s, starring Butler as Benny, a laconic yet hotheaded member of a Chicago biker club, the Vandals. As Benny, Butler has artfully mussed, greased blonde hair and a scruffy goatee. He wears many layers of frayed, often sleeveless denim and leather, and rings on most of his fingers. He smokes. He plays pool. He leans on things a lot. He’s a man of few words who mostly mooches around the scene lankily, or stares into the middle distance with moody intensity. But sometimes he bursts into violent action.</p>
<p id="nuDMFM">And of course he rides a huge, growling chopper. (Be sure to see <em>The Bikeriders </em>in the loudest theater you can find, if you want to feel every bark and roar from the bikes, and every swooning Shangri-Las needle drop in your ribcage.) He has a signature move where he rides his bike one-handed in an absurdly cool, offhand way, like this:</p>

Director Jeff Nichols (<em>Mud</em>, <em>Midnight Special</em>) first saw the book 20 years ago and had been thinking about adapting it for a long time, because of its themes of masculinity and identity, but also because it looked so cool. So does his movie. So does Austin Butler.</p>

<p id="YGLYia"><em>The Bikeriders</em> is a familiar, <em>Goodfellas</em>-like tale of working-class, outsider men in midcentury America looking for brotherhood and a sense of belonging, and eventually being eaten up by corruption and violence. But Butler isn’t our garrulous, fast-talking guide to this world, like Ray Liotta’s Henry Hill. He’s the stillness at the center of the movie. The chatty voice-over that propels the story actually comes from his wife, Kathy, played (with an absolutely outrageous Chicago accent) by Jodie Comer.</p>

<p id="VKDCx7">Alongside Comer, the heavy-lift, capital-A acting in <em>The Bikeriders</em> is done by Tom Hardy as gang boss Johnny. Hardy does that quizzical, menacing-yet-soulful, raspy-voiced thing that he’s so good at. Johnny loves Benny in a way that’s both touching and a little scary. In their scenes together, Butler just stands there almost silently and soaks Hardy’s intensity up. It ought to be too passive and one-sided, but instead it’s magnetic, because of Butler’s presence, his quelled energy, his burning eyes, and his <em>Oh my God just look at that hair</em>.</p>

<p id="QmMLqQ">Butler has the least to do of the movie’s triumvirate of leads, and his character is the simplest, to the point of being more of an icon than a real person. But it doesn’t matter. If <em>Elvis</em> left you in any doubt, <em>The Bikeriders </em>seals it: This guy is a movie star, and this is a movie-star performance. He never looks less than amazing, and his sheer magnetism draws the rest of the film into his orbit.</p>
<p id="2gJqKf"><em>The Bikeriders </em>is a film of old-fashioned, simple pleasures: great tunes, perfect costumes, myth-making shots, and a cast of great character actors really going for it. (Including, but not limited to, Michael Shannon, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22827455/west-side-story-review-steven-spielberg"><em>West Side Story</em></a>’s Mike Faist, <em>Justified</em>’s Damon Herriman, and a completely unrecognizable Norman Reedus as a shaggy Californian wildman biker.) It’s a film about looking at the gorgeous, unknowable people on the screen — and that one gorgeous, unknowable person in particular — just as Hardy’s character does at one point with Marlon Brando in <em>The Wild One</em>, and thinking: <em>What would it be like to </em>be<em> them? </em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24185141/star-wars-acolyte-master-mask-donnie-darko-design<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="0eWnPA">At the end of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24177229/acolyte-master-who-is-answer">last week’s <em>Acolyte</em>, the Master showed up</a> and proved to everyone that they mean business, effortlessly casting everybody on the Light side of the Force away with the flick of a wrist. This week, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24181423/plo-koon-acolyte-dave-filoni"><em>The Acolyte</em></a> picks up right from there, showing us the true power of the Sith Lord (and surprised Sol doesn’t remember him... before finally revealing his identity). Of course, we didn’t need to see the Master in action to know how ferocious a Sith Lord they were. Their look told us enough.</p>
<p id="sf9mMo">As you might expect, that’s by design for Jennifer Bryan, the costume designer for <em>The Acolyte</em>. When designing the mask with Star Wars creature design veteran Neal Scanlan, they knew that it had to be in line with the aesthetics of the Star Wars Dark Side, while also feeling like something new. </p>
<p id="CGR67u">“My department had many concepts because, for the character, everything has to look symbiotic; masks, cloak, everything has to work together,” Bryan tells Polygon, noting how grateful she is for the high degree of collaboration between Star Wars departments. The goal, as with many Sith, was simple: Communicate danger. </p>

<p id="eU6nsL">“It needed to be threatening. It needed to be dark. And it needed to be something you never ever saw before, but there was something familiar about it.” </p>
<p id="vuKYyf">There was some hammering out of details; Bryan says earlier mockups emphasized different parts of the face, like the eyes. But to the final point, she drew from two specific sources: She gave the helmet a flare at the base of the neck, to evoke (who else) Darth Vader. “It will unconsciously register [with] the audience that this is a guy you need to watch your back with,” she says, naming him and Darth Maul as two points of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars">Star Wars</a> inspiration. </p>
<p id="5CxGyL">But the defining feature — that toothy, Venom-like grin — came from a different place altogether. </p>
<p id="GnJ3x0">“Leslye [Headland, <em>The Acolyte</em>’s showrunner] says she thought about the bad bunny in <em>Donnie Darko</em>,” Bryan says. “There was something kind of grotesque about that. [...] I think the idea Leslye wanted was for you to get a sense of dread when [you] see this character up close finally.” </p>

<p id="kMNW7P">That sort of communication of character was key even before we knew who the Master was.  By the time we find out that Manny Jacinto’s Qimir is actually the Sith Lord the Jedi have been chasing all along, Bryan wanted us to get a certain sense of Qimir as a guy hiding in plain sight. </p>
<p id="Wa0aG3">“The first time we see him [...] he basically hijacked that apothecary shop, and he’s wearing the shopkeeper’s clothes to kind of blend into the community. And he wears that for quite a bit,” Bryan says. “We didn’t want to give it away, that anything that he’s going to be anything other than himself. So when you first see him he’s [...] a little hustler.” </p>
<p id="WR2bST">The goal was, even when he was in disguise, to be able to get a read of how devious he is: “You know, he’s wily, he’s slippery. He thinks on his feet.”</p>

Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration - the acclaimed Atari-themed interactive museum from developer Digital Eclipse - is adding 39 new games later this year in an expansion detailing further events in the company's eventful history.
</p>
<p>
Atari 50's Expanded Edition introduces two new timelines to the existing game, starting with The Wider World of Atari. This features 19 playable games, eight new video segments, plus "interviews, vintage ads, historical artefacts, and more" focusing on a broad range topics. 
</p>
<p>
"Highlights from the new timeline," explains Atari, "include a deep dive into Stern Electronics' robot-blasting Berzerk; unusual and underappreciated innovations and hidden gems from the late 1980s; a spotlight on the artist Evelyn Seto, who helped create the iconic 'Fuji' Atari logo; Pong creator Al Alcorn explaining the birth of Breakout; and an exploration of the fan base's role in discovering unreleased prototypes, creating 'homebrew' games, and preserving Atari history."

<p>
As for the Expanded Edition's second new timeline, that's called The First Console War and it details the long-running rivalry between the Atari 2600 and Mattel's Intellivision - a brand Atari <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-buys-intellivision-brand-ending-longest-running-console-war">notably purchased back in May</a>, securing the rights to over 200 games at the same time. This segment promises six video segments and 20 playable games, including a selection of M Network games, a mix of Atari and M Network sports games, plus rare Atari 2600 and 5200 prototypes. 
</p>
<p>
Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration Expanded Edition will be available as a digital standalone release and as DLC for the existing version of the game. Both launch for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC on 25th October, with PS5 and Switch also getting a physical version of the Expanded Edition. 
</p>
<p>
Atari hasn't yet detailed the full list of 39 games included in Atari 50's Expanded Edition (which will be available in addition to 103 base game titles and 12 retro games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-50s-acclaimed-interactive-museum-just-added-12-more-games-in-free-update">added in a free update last year</a>), but expect more details in the run up to its release.

Some of the standouts include Cookie Cutter, which launched late last year.

There's also a great selection of Bethesda-published games--Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, Dishonored 2, and Quake 2--action-packed rogue-lite The Crackpet Show, and some fluid combat to master in Strayed Lights.</p><p>Another great deal at Fanatical right now is the <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-bethesda-bundle-gog-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fadd-a-bunch-of-steam-deck-games-to-your-backlog-for-cheap-with-the-handheld-heroes-bundle%2F1100-6524494%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">Build Your Own Bethesda Bundle</a></strong>. This includes the aforementioned Bethesda games as well plenty more in the Elder Scrolls, Dishonored, Wolfenstein, and Quake universes. The best part?
