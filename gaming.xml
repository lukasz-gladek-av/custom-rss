We’re excited to see the stories players will create when they finally set sail.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via NetEase Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Sea of Remnants</em> invites players into a visually captivating world, where they assume the role of a puppet-like sailor who has lost all their memories. Alongside a mysterious girl, players will voyage across vast seas, uncharted islands and a city slowly awakening to its secrets. Through open-world exploration, intense naval combat and dynamic interactions with a cast of over 300 eccentric characters, players will uncover the truth behind their forgotten identity and shape the fate of the world around them.</p><p>On this sprawling journey, players can recruit a crew of unique puppetfolk allies, customize their ships with modular upgrades, and build specialized teams for exploration and turn-based battles. Every decision—whether sparing enemies or seizing opportunities—will unleash dramatic ripple effects across the world. With rival factions reacting to each choice and Orbtopia’s cityscape evolving in response, no two captains will share the same story.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

Additionally, release-day delivery is not guaranteed. Square Enix charges <em>high </em>prices for faster shipping speeds. Two-day shipping is $35, and overnighting the game at launch would cost you $55--so you'd pay more for shipping than the cost of the item itself.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/na.store.square-enix-games.com\/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Collector's Box</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/na.store.square-enix-games.com\/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-tactics---the-ivalice-chronicles">$200 (no game) | $250 with the game</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is getting a jam-packed Collector's Box that looks appropriately lavish for this all-time classic.</p><p>Here's what you get with the Collector's Box:</p><ul><li><strong>Special Art Box:</strong> Shown above, the box holding all of the merch has intricate character art against a decorative depiction of Ivalice in the background. Square Enix printed the artwork on matte-textured art paper.</li><li><strong>Ramza Beoulve Figure (Akademy Version):</strong> It's unclear how tall this figure is, but it is described as a "figure," not a statue. That said, it does come with a base stand. Overall, this looks like a high-quality figure with vibrant colors and impressive attention to detail.</li><li><strong>Mini Chocobo Plush Set:</strong> Adorable miniature plushies of the standard yellow Chocobo, Black Chocobo, and Red Chocobo. Each plush has an elastic loop, so you can connect it to a backpack or even your belt (if you're especially cool).</li><li><strong>Zodiac Stones Acrylic Magnet Set:</strong> All 12 Zodiac stones as acrylic magnets.</li><li><strong>Outlying Church Pop-Up Diorama:</strong> A pop-up 3D display of the Outlying Church from the game. If you compare it to in-game screenshots, it looks like an faithful recreation.</li><li><strong>Art Prints: </strong>Printed on glossy polypropylene (plastic) sheets, the three pieces of framable artwork feature: Ramza, a world map of Ivalice, and the key art that's used for the standard edition of the remaster.</li></ul><p>The Collector's Box is available on its own for $200 or bundled with game for $250. If you choose the latter, the game will be packaged separately. This just means that the Collector's Box is the same regardless of which choice you make, and the box, as shown above, doesn't have a Nintendo Switch or PS5 logo on it. Since physical editions aren't available for Xbox, PS4, or PC, a universal Collector's Box makes sense.</p><p>Square Enix's store page doesn't explicitly state that the Collector's Box is exclusive to its own storefront. If it is available elsewhere, it'd be wise to buy it at a major US retailer. <strong>Standard shipping costs $20</strong> from the Square Enix Store to the US. Two-day and overnight shipping is offered, but these options cost $49 and $69, respectively. Not nice.</p><p>You can check out all of the collectibles in the image below.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-astro-bot-levels-and-limited-dualsense-controller-announced-coming-this-july.1207818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-astro-bot-levels-and-limited-dualsense-controller-announced-coming-this-july/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gameplay-deep-dive-announced-for-july-2025/">Ghost of Yotei</a> might've been a game players expected to see in during today's State of Play, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/">Astro Bot</a> was definitely not what people would've expected.</p>
<p>Team Asobi studio head Nicolas Doucet briefly appeared during the presentation to announce that five new levels will be added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/">The Game Awards 2024 GOTY winner</a> on July 10, 2025, and that a new version of the limited-edition Astro Bot DualSense controller will be launching sometime later this year.</p>
<p>This latest batch of levels brings the total for the game over 90, and like most of the levels Team Asobi has released for Astro Bot post-launch, they're meant to provide a little extra challenge for the platformer fans who want it.</p>
<p>All together, they are the Vicious Void levels, and Team Asobi revealed the names for four of the five, and a sneak peek that the Ghost of Yotei protagonist, Atsu, has been added to the game as a new bot to collect.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Regarding the new version of the controller, it pretty much looks exactly the same as the old one, except the eyes are made to look like the Astro-persona inside your controller is smiling. The rest of the color layout, and everything about it, seems to be exactly the same.</p>
<p>Now that Astro Bot has more than 90 levels, and that we're starting to come up on the one-year anniversary from the game's launch, it's possible that this is one of, if not the last batch of DLC levels Team Asobi releases, before moving on to whatever its next project will be.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/astro-bot-five-new-vicious-void-galaxy-levels-special-bots-launch-this-july/">PlayStation Blog</a> post for the update, Doucet wrote "<em>It has been a real delight to continue offering you, our valued fans, an extended Astro Bot experience at no additional cost</em>," which doesn't exactly have the ring of Team Asobi wanting to slow down soon. We'll see what the anniversary brings, and if we get more clarification on what Team Asobi's future looks like, then.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">One of the unexpected surprises from PlayStation's latest State of Play presentation was a tease of Sony's first official fight stick controller, codenamed "Project Defiant." While details are currently limited, we at least got a glimpse of the fight stick's design, features, and confirmation that it will support both PS5 and PC when it launches in 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">The Project Defiant fight stick uses an eight-button layout and a joystick with a black and white color scheme that matches the look of the PS5 and other official peripherals. According to Sony, Project Defiant will feature a "sturdy, ergonomic design for a comfortable feel during intense fight sessions," and support ultra-low latency wireless connections via PlayStation Link or wired connections on PC and PS5.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4507248-stick.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4507248" data-ratio="0.56267409470752" data-width="1077" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4507248-stick.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4507248"></a><figcaption>PlayStation "Project Defiant" Fight Stick</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4507248-stick.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's unclear how moddable the Project Defiant will be, but so far, Sony has confirmed it will have three different movement gates for the joystick--square, circle, or octagon--that can be swapped out without needing tools. There will be a built-in compartment for storing the extra restrictor gates and the included PS Link USB adapter when not in use.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the rest of the inputs, the eight main face buttons (which map to Cross, Circle, Square, Triangle, R1, R2, L1, and L2) use mechanical switches. The rest of the standard inputs from the PS5's DualSense controller are also present on the fight stick, including:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">PS Button</li><li dir="ltr">Share Button</li><li dir="ltr">PlayStation Link Button</li><li dir="ltr">L3 Button</li><li dir="ltr">R3 Button</li><li dir="ltr">Touch Pad</li><li dir="ltr">Options Button</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There is also a Lever Mode Switch for changing how the stick operates and a Lock Button. You'll be able to wake up the PS5 from sleep mode using the Project Defiant's PS Button. Project Defiant will also include a sling carry case.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony says more details will be revealed over the coming months, so we expect to know the price and finalized release date soon. For now, it's planned to launch sometime in 2026. This reveal is notable for several reasons--the most obvious being this is PlayStation's first official fight stick peripheral. While the PS5 has plenty of excellent fight sticks to pick from--including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playstation-Aluminum-Ergonomic-Detachable-Tournament-5/dp/B0B3VRDML3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PDP's Victrix Pro FS</a> and its leverless sibling, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playstation-Aluminum-Ergonomic-Detachable-Tournament-5/dp/B0B3VQKGHW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Pro FS-12</a>--we're curious to see how a PS5-dedicated model made specifically by Sony will stack up to the third-party options.</p><p dir="ltr">The June 4, 2025 PlayStation State of Play had several other exciting fighting game announcements, including the reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-marvel-fighting-game-is-coming-from-arc-system-works/1100-6532114/" data-ref-id="1100-6532114">Marvel Tokodon: Fighting Souls</a>, a 4v4 team fighting game developed by Arc System Works and featuring a roster of Marvel characters, releasing on PS5 and PC in 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-announces-project-defiant-a-wireless-fight-stick-for-ps5-and-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation has announced its latest peripheral, a wireless fight stick that's currently codenamed Project Defiant.</p>
<p>Fittingly, it was revealed during today's<a href="https://wccftech.com/40-minute-playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow/"> State of Play</a> presentation, right after retro-remastering experts Digital Eclipse announced their latest game, the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/mortal-kombat-legacy-collection-launches-on-ps5-ps4-this-year/">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Collection</a>, which will bring nine classic Mortal Kombat titles to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>According to a<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/introducing-project-defiant-the-first-wireless-fight-stick-designed-by-sony-interactive-entertainment-for-ps5-and-pc/"> PlayStation Blog post</a>, Project Defiant uses PlayStation's proprietary PlayStation Link technology, which "<em>provides ultra-low latency,</em>" though it's not a wireless-only fight stick, as it does work with a wired connection as well.</p>
<p>The short trailer for the fight stick that we saw during the presentation just gave us some glamour shots of the new game pad, which bears the signature white and black PS5 pattern. Notably, the&nbsp; fight stick will come with a sling carry case, according to the Blog post, presumably to make it easier to transport between fighting game tournaments.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Defiant Wireless Fight Stick - Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oCeba1xfKxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Project Defiant also touts "<em>a high-quality digital stick that's custom designed by Sony</em>," and "<em>toolless interchangeable restrictor gates (square, circle, and octagon) for the stick, buttons with mechanical switches, and a touch pad like the one found on the DualSense controller.</em>"</p>
<p>We won't hear more about Project Defiant, like the price or what it'll officially be called, until 2026, when it's expected to launch. Considering the large fighting game community that exists on PlayStation, it's a wonder why the company hasn't made its own fight stick before. But at least it's on its way.</p>
<p>Speaking of fighting games, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Collection wasn't the only fighting game revealed during the State of Play, as we also got the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-soul-is-a-new-4-vs-4-fighting-game-by-arc-system-works-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5-and-pc/">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Soul,</a> a new 4v4 fighting game from Arc System Works, set to launch in 2026.</p>

Van Chapman is the bosun on this adventure, making sure that everything is ship-shape. I got to catch up with <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6ff64e2-0570-485e-860b-402771d3faf6" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-chat-dimension-20-burrows-end-generational-trauma-and-environmental" rel="nofollow">Siobhan Thompson</a> ahead of the premier to learn more about Chapman's motives, what the inspiration was for Chapman's very 'milennial' restaurant, and how <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> is getting a new twist for <em>Cloudward, Ho!</em></p>



<p>To begin, I wanted to know what inspired this competent character and her retirement from the life of adventuring.</p>

<p>"Van Chapman is a retired ship bosun and now she is running a very greyscale, small plates-large plates, gastropub with her very tiny husband." Thompson began.</p>

<p>Where we first meet Champan, though Thompson wanted to be clear, "she's done with adventure, she doesn't need to go back, she's living a vey happy retirement."</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//P0B-JHNnH28"></iframe></p>

<p>The cast of <em>Cloudward, Ho!</em> is filled with the other members of the Intrepid Heroes; Lou Wilson, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="07cb71f8-cd27-491b-a25d-4583267bfba1" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ally-beardsley-talks-fantasy-high-junior-year-and-how-kristen-has-changed-between" rel="nofollow">Ally Beardsley</a>, Brian 'Murph' Murphy, Emily Axford, and Zac Oyama not to miss <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" rel="nofollow">Brennan Lee Mulligan</a>, the DM.</p>

<p>For the player, I was also interested in learning what it was that Thompson found most important in a character introduction. What notes she always wanted to hit when coming into a new game.</p>

<p>She was able to describe it quite succinctly as "give a physical description, even though we have art, there's something about the linguistic description that's helpful. I always try to give a description of how they're feeling in this moment."</p>

<h2>Getting The Band Back Together? I'm In</h2>

<p>As the party is getting pulled back together over the course of episode one, in a mix of <em>Oceans Eleven</em> meets <em>Atlantis: The Lost Empire</em> style recruiting, we learn how each member is integral to the crew. Whether it's Maxwell Gotch (played by Murph) as the wallet bankrolling the trip, Marya Junkova (played by Emily Axford) as the engineer, or Olethra MacLeod (played by Ally Beardsley) as the new member with a key piece of information to draw everyone together.</p>

<p>"We all came in with a bunch of different ideas, for me the Bosun was so fun because it's that you're not the Captain, but you're the one telling everyone what to do," Thompson explained "and it was fun to come in with a character whose big defining trait is loyalty."</p>

<p>"She's a good soldier and in the real, true sense of the word, if there was an order that she recieved that she thought was stupid she would push back on it but she also knows that her job is to make things happen for other people"</p>

<p>I questioned Chapman's drive saying "I know you're playing a fighter, but it almost sounds like you have a Paladin oath."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is very philosophically where she is. She is a pirate to her bones. She comes from this long line of adventurers and she's very… she's not even proud of it, it's just so utterly defining of her"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cloudward-ho-sky-ship-miniature.jpg?itok=IySS7Pl0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cloudward-ho-sky-ship-miniature.jpg?itok=KdPDz4l0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Rusty Nut Is Milennial Incarnate</h2>

<p>A key part of Chapman where we pick up with her is in the description of the Rusty Nut, the gastropub that she runs with her husband. With "Milennial Grey" walls, and rustic lights all at head height there was a very clear idea in her mind when creating this setting.</p>

<p>"It was [based on a specific location], unfortunately there are so many of these places. I also have to give credit to my friend Bea Roberts who I asked 'What are good pub names?' and we just sent pub names back and forth and she came up with Rusty Nut"</p>

<p>"I feel like calling it Milennial Grey is so unfair because none of us painted it that color it's just the houses we've ended up living in and none of us can afford to buy anything"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Some are born Milennial, some achieve Milennialdome, and some have MIlennialship thrust upon them"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thompson also added that with her own experience working in the restaurant industry she "also loves making fun of the way that the service industry works. It was a fun little side game for me"</p>

<h2><em>Cloudward, Ho!</em> Uses Old <em>D&amp;D</em> Rule: Epic Level 6</h2>

<p>As each character is introduced and we're provided their stats I couldn't help but notice that there's a currently empty field labeled Epic Epiphanies. Thompson revealed that for this season of <em>Dimension 20,</em> the characters wouldn't be leveling up, but would instead use a remixed version of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition</em>'s Epic Level 6 ruling.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cloudward-ho-van-chapman-character-sheet.jpg?itok=Aw0NjvDv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cloudward-ho-van-chapman-character-sheet.jpg?itok=ZKGwqbO2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"Instead of leveling up you take a feat everytime that you would level up. It gives you a much more 'adventure genre' set of stats"</p>

<p>Thompson explained it by comparing <em>Cloudward, Ho! </em>to classic adventure titles like <em>Indiana Jones</em>. "Indiana Jones is very smart, and strong, and quick but if a giant Nazi is going to come and punch him he'll die and he's very aware of that and whatever his 'in-universe' health stats are"</p>

<p>This shift from leveling to Epic Level 6 allows for the adventure for <em>Cloudward, Ho!</em> to continue to develop mechanically without fear of the characters reaching the kinds of god-like powers that are seen in higher levels of <em>D&amp;D</em> play.</p>

<p>Thompson also highlighted that on top of keeping the game tense this approach to leveling also really promoted players getting deep into the different feats available to characters.</p>

<p>The first episode of <em>Cloudward, Ho! </em>is available right now to watch on <a href="https://www.dropout.tv/browse" rel="nofollow">Dropout.</a></p>

A demo is live now on PS5 until June 18. Players who complete the demo will unlock an exclusive in-game helmet at launch. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb, from <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/nioh-3-announced-for-ps5-limited-time-demo-available-today/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>:</p><blockquote>In Nioh 3, the protagonist is a young warrior poised to become the next Shogun. Why is he dedicated to battling against yokai? We’ll save those details for another day, but what we can tell you today is as the battles unfold, players will now be able to fight using two distinct combat styles: Samurai and Ninja.</blockquote><blockquote>The Samurai style provides a gameplay experience similar to previous Nioh titles. New actions such as Arts Proficiency, which enhances the power of martial arts, and Deflect, which allows players to block enemy attacks at the last moment have been added, helping create a series of intense and deadly face-to-face confrontations.</blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, the Ninja style excels in quick movements like dodging and aerial actions, giving ninjas the advantage of being able to attack from outside of the enemy’s range by utilizing a variety of “Ninjitsu” techniques according to the situation on the battlefield. Players have the ability to use techniques like Mist, which leaves a clone after an attack, and Evade, which allows for narrowly avoiding enemy strikes. Both techniques help players outmaneuver foes while delivering devastating speed attacks from behind.</blockquote><blockquote>Players will be able to switch between battle styles instantly at any time, playing in their preferred style in a storyline defined by the strong, the swift, and the wicked. Based on the tendencies of the enemies and stages, some players will prefer to switch seamlessly between Samurai and Ninja techniques, while others will choose to fight using only one style continuously based on the challenge ahead. Feel free to play with the style you like best as you battle some of the fiercest enemies we’ve created to date!</blockquote><blockquote>Aside from the new battle styles, Nioh 3 also enables players to enjoy an open field that offers a new freedom of exploration to the unique tension and confrontations that have become a defining characteristic of the Nioh series. Experience unexpected encounters with formidable yokai, explore suspicious villages riddled in violent secrets, and take on the daunting challenges of The Crucible. Enjoy the thrilling, hostile new environments as you fight to survive the cursed kingdom!</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">We're pretty big Nioh fans here at IGN. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nioh">gave the original Nioh a 9.6/10</a>, calling it "an epic, unforgettable adventure carried by a fierce combat system that cleverly balances style and strategy." We similarly praised Nioh 2 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-2-review">with a 9/10</a>, saying that its "many systems may be a little overwhelming, but the stellar combat and satisfying difficulty make it worth it." The Nioh series has been very, very quiet ever since the 2020 release of Nioh 2, though Team Ninja itself has kept busy with releases such as Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, Rise of the Rōnin, and the upcoming Ninja Gaiden 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you missed it, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Sony's State of Play June 2025 showcase</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

In 2022, they branched out with CarX Street, an open-world racing game with a level of freedom they’ve never had before. Then they brought it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1114150?utm_source=ign&amp;utm_medium=cpv&amp;utm_campaign=productlanding" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">to Steam</a> in 2024, where it was wishlisted by over 600,000 people. And now, they’re bringing it to consoles — it arrives June 18 <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nn082lmvv2c?cid=ign_street" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">on Xbox Series X/S</a> and later this summer on PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CarX Street takes you to the sprawling Sunset City and its suburbs, where your goal is straightforward: prove you’re the best racer in the city. There are racing clubs scattered throughout the city, each with their own identity. For example, Union Underground is a crew of automotive engineers who value a car’s performance but don’t care about looks. Kanjo Spirit is for hatchback enthusiasts who use volatile, high-risk driving styles.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/04/screenshot-2-1749055195431.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll need to be prepared for a variety of different race types, like classic sprint races, circuit races, and drifting competitions. All of the races make use of CarX Technologies’ car physics engine, designed with a focus on realism. That realism means that the cheaper cars you can afford at the start of the game won’t handle well enough to tackle harder races and won’t make the grade necessary for you to enter them in the first place. So you’ll need to upgrade your ride early and often.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luckily, there are tons of options when building a new car. That starts with 92 different vehicles, with additional ones added regularly. There’s also an extensive customization and tuning system that lets you tailor your ride to your preferred driving style — including the engine, drivetrain, suspension, body, and wheels.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/02/screenshot-5-1748885683850.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sunset City might be full of racing clubs, but beating them isn’t the only thing to do in the city. You can accept quests to deliver cars or parts to people across the city, and completing them can net you resources to improve your vehicle. You can explore the map on your own and speed down open highways or find mountain roads with sharp turns and narrow passages to put your driving skills to the test. Or you can buy properties across the city that come with parking lots where you can display your custom cars. Through all of this, Sunset City has a dynamic day-night cycle, leading to races having a different feel depending on what time of day you do them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also multiplayer modes if you’re feeling competitive. Battle Mode is a 1v1 showdown in circle or sprint races, Chase Mode has one player try to escape through the city while their opponent tries to keep up, Speed League has circuit and sprint races in a 1v5 format, and Time Attack challenges you to set the best lap time you can while you rise up the leaderboard and earn increasingly valuable rewards. The multiplayer modes will also have crossplay between the PC and console versions of the game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/02/screenshot-4-1748885649922.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these features will be present when the game arrives on console, but the developers have also announced their plans for future additions. That includes new competitive multiplayer modes, gymkhana (obstacle courses), a team multiplayer mode, dynamic weather effects, a network of high-speed expressways, full narrative campaign, and police chase mechanic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CarX Street releases on Xbox Series X on June 18, and pre-orders are open now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You may have heard that there's a brand new video game console out this week, the first major hardware launch in almost five years. There's also a huge summer video games showcase, where all the latest and greatest new releases will be shown off, many for the first time. It <em>should </em>be the biggest week of the year for games. And yet.</p><p>Can you feel the excitement in the air? Or, I guess, can you <em>not </em>feel it? Can you feel the absence of where it <em>should </em>be? There are huge swathes of the video game industry going through the motions this week, staging major events the same way they always have, at the same time and even the same places they always have, even though things are most definitely not what they've always been. And the general vibe has been...<a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-game-key-cards-dlss-lcd-oled-1851774622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subdued</a>. The energy is more ennui than ecstatic.&nbsp;</p><p>First, there's Nintendo and the impending release of the Switch 2. This is the company's first new hardware since 2017, launching with the first new <em>Mario Kart</em> since the death of Queen Victoria, and it's following in the footsteps of one of the most successful and beloved pieces of video game hardware of all time. The video game industry, and wider community of fans, should be <em>bristling </em>with electricity.</p><p>But a shallow launch lineup, a machine that's very similar to the last and<a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-price-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a pricepoint that at first belied belief</a> has sucked the life out of what has traditionally been a festive occasion. We're all going back to the well in terms of coverage--there will be Day One reviews, some midnight launches--but lotteries, shortages and uncertainty over supply and pricing has for many kept the lid on what used to be a mass celebratory moment.</p><p>Next up is<a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-games-fest-website-geoff-keighley-polygon-palestine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <s>Summer Games Fest</s> Summer Game Fest</a> trying,<a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-keighley-hype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> on behalf of the industry frontman Geoff Keighley so relentlessly champions</a>, to fill the void <a href="https://kotaku.com/e3-2023-canceled-why-nintendo-sony-microsoft-la-rip-1850285780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left by E3</a>, a show that for over a decade had become simultaneously pointless yet also clearly irreplaceable. The video game industry as it exists demands a focal point, a spotlight for everything coming down the pipeline, so for the next week we're going to get...an even more annoying E3. There will still be poorly-dressed men on stage making announcements, still endless trailers and commercials, yet somehow also less of it, everyone shovelling content into a pit they can never hope to fill.</p><p>The shovelling comes up short partly thanks to a lessening of this end of the industry itself. As the AAA market contracts towards a singular, exploitative point, and the wider market <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-deprofessionalization-is-bad-for-video-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grows ever-reliant on a mass of vulnerable, independent developers starved of both funding and support</a>, the servings of big games that used to fill these announcement shows grow ever thinner. But the shows are still there, and still yearn to be satisfied, so we try to replace the licensed EA games and 2K shooters of yesteryear with hundreds of indie games pitted against each other for the audience's attention and, in a trend far too on the nose for the occasion, what feels like an endless run of re-releases of yesterday's hits.</p><p>The vibes also feel a little off because of what's happened to the media. Or what's left of it. E3 used to be partly about the big stage events, yeah, but it was also about the days of subsequent coverage from outlets jostling to get their hands on the latest blockbusters and interview the big names from the big games, passing along these harried impressions and juicy quotes as free marketing. As empty-calorie as that coverage was, it still contributed to the overall structure of a week like this, as well as serving as a focal point for so much of the community’s excitement. In 2025, <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-journalism-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what little media there is left in this age of layoffs, closures, sales and an advertising market collapse</a> will play a few things here and talk to a few people there. This coverage will take the same basic shape it always has, only now in a greatly reduced form. The same goes for the Switch 2, a console that wasn’t even sent to most press ahead of time, leading to a surprising dearth of day-one coverage, where once that coverage would have been inescapable.</p><p>This whole week, the Switch 2 launch and Summer Game Fest hitting over the same few days, is like the band playing as the Titanic sinks. I'm not saying VIDEO GAMES themselves are the Titanic, but the blockbuster side of the industry that we all once thought we knew, the home consoles and the AAA games and the big glitzy reveals that felt immovable and immune to recession, is now sinking beneath the waves while comforting, familiar tunes play over the lapping water.</p><p>Executives at major publishers increasingly view games and their developers as an impediment to their profits, rather than the source of them.<a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-phoenix-labs-layoffs-studio-closure-far-cry-dauntless" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> There are layoffs <em>everywhere</em></a>, whether your game is good or not, whether it sells or not. Increasing amounts of consumer spending is focused on a dwindling list of forever games, while <em>Roblox</em><a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-roblox-grow-a-garden-geoguessr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sucks the oxygen</a> out of the industry for an entire generation. Meanwhile there is wider economic and political uncertainty, resulting in everything from tariffs to an inflationary crisis, which has many people struggling to pay for essentials, let alone $450 for a better Nintendo Switch.</p><p>I've seen a lot of talk on places like social media and Linkedin about how games have been going through it for the last two years, leading to short-sighted sentiments like<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/survive-til-25-how-game-studios-are-keeping-the-lights-on-amid-the-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> how everyone needed to "survive until '25"</a>. As though every challenge huge parts of this industry are facing are unique to games, as though the video game industry exists in a total vacuum. But games are made by people who are part of wider societies, they're paid for out of bank accounts affected by things happening everywhere else.&nbsp;</p><p>Games--or at least the kind of games this week used to be about--<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGKc3T7OVHE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are trapped in the belly of the machine</a>. We love to talk shit about Andrew Wilson,<a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> but he isn't to blame for every terrible decision at EA</a>, because he's the executive of a publicly-traded company in 2025, and any other person in his line of work would and is doing the same thing. Almost every major industry in the world, whether it's games or cars or music or energy, is now at the mercy of Wall Street Weirdos,<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/private-equity-publicly-traded-companies/675788/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> private equity in particular</a>. We're not looking at a bad time for the video game industry, we're looking at just <em>bad times</em>.</p><p>Which is what makes it incredible to behold that this week we are just carrying on through it all, as though nothing has changed. We'll all be subjected to too many trailers to remember even a fraction of them. We'll all create and digest the same console launch coverage we always have, with midnight launches, photos of people rushing home with their Nintendo-branded shopping bags, first impressions, review scores of a machine breathing only its first breath. We're cosplaying as the 2000s, when these things meant something and were built for the occasion, even though literally everything around us--the economy, the industry, the platforms and ways we learn about and experience games--has changed radically.</p><p>It makes me wonder how many of these weeks we've got left. Before the medium has gone through such a revolution--<a href="https://aftermath.site/switch-2-xbox-playstation-exclusivity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware shifts</a>, AAA's decline,<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zrcvr7b4h6is5y3wrxhupoc4/post/3lpiexjyi2224?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the mass deprofessionalisation of the industry</a>--that we all have to reckon with what video games actually look like now, not what the bloated end of the industry wishes they still did.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/neightreign-is-good-but-lumpy-counter-intuitive-and-experimental"><h3>Nightreign is Uneven And Counter-Intuitive.

That makes for a whopping eight characters flying in and out of action each round. Fighting Souls features fast-paced action in titles such as Dragon Ball: FighterZ and BlazBlue, including flashy special attacks and cinematic finishing moves.

</p>
<h3>Lumines Arise</h3>
<p>The show kicked off with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-musical-block-dropper-lumines-is-getting-a-brand-new-entry-later-this-year">a reveal trailer for Lumines Arive</a>, a colourful and very musical way to start the event. It comes from the developers behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tetris-effect">Tetris Effect</a>, which was a banger. It's coming this Fall, and you can wishlist in now.

<h3>Pragmata</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-pragmata-coming-2026-developer-promises">Next up is Pragmata</a>, the mysterious Capcom game that we've seen precious little of since its first reveal years ago. This time we got gameplay, loads of third person action goodness and a lovely sci-fi setting. Also, Diana is adorable. The game is set to come out at some point in 2026 to the PS5.

<h3>Romeo is a Dead Man</h3>
<p>Next up is a grisly and cartoonish action game called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suda-51s-next-game-is-the-ultra-violent-romeo-is-a-deadman">Romeo is a Dead Man</a>. It's coming from illustrious and brilliantly weird developer Grasshopper Manufacture, with both Suda 51 and Ren Yamazaki working on it. It'll be coming out in 2026... Maybe.

            <p>
Guilty Gear developer Arc System Works has unveiled new tag team fighter Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, which is bringing 4v4 superheroic battling to PS5 and PC later this year.
</p>
<p>
Unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-live-stream-and-blog-bloodborne-remake-time">during Sony's State of Play showcase</a>, Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls promises a fresh take on the Marvel universe with "reimagined characters and stages, a heart-pounding soundtrack, intuitive gameplay mechanics, and jaw-dropping visuals".
</p>
<p>
Players can battle as the iconic likes of Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Doom, Storm, Ms. Marvel, Star-Lord, and Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes). All have been given a design twist and their own gameplay styles, with each character having a "bespoke set of Normal, Special, and Unique attacks inspired by their abilities and powers in Marvel lore".

<p>
Despite that breath of abilities, Arc says it's aiming to accommodate genre newcomers while offering "depth and versatility for high level competition."
</p>
<p>
"Generally, a team VS fighting game requires the player to learn multiple characters," Arc <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-launches-2026-on-ps5-steam-and-epic/">explains on the PlayStation Blog</a>, "but for Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, you only need to master one character in order to play the game. We have designed the mechanics in such a way that you can perform a variety of actions with either traditional fighting game inputs or simple inputs. With the press of a few buttons, multiple characters can appear on screen to provide backup or attack together - creating a new and exciting team VS battle experience."
</p>
<p>
All this plays out in 4v4 team VS matches set across familiar Marvel locations, including New York City. Stages frequently consist of multiple areas, and Arc says the "transitions between areas are not just action-packed and stunning to witness, but they also play a strategic role".
</p>
<p>
Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls launches for PlayStation 5 and PC (via Steam and Epic) sometime next year, and Arc says more details - from "characters and stages to gameplay modes and the online experience" - will follow.
