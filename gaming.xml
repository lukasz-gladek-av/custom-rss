			<p>As Drive to Survive has reignited interest in racing’s premiere category and made superstars of everyone from drivers to strategists in the last five years, it’s the on-track action that remains at the centre of every F1 calendar. Luckily, while Max Verstappen still keeps on winning this year, it’s been far from last year’s processional exhibition, and video game fans won’t feel like they’re living in a complete fantasy world when beating him to the top step of the podium in the latest of EA and Codemasters’ yearly F1 titles.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 24 Season 1 - Charles Leclerc Challenge Career" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vtyu2UC2Duo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>EA Sports F1 24 continues the push for further realism, and alongside the expected tweaks and buffs there are some wholly changed or renewed systems that make this the best rendition of digital F1 racing we’ve ever had.</p>


<p>Driver Career mode gives you the choice between taking a created player of your own to the top of the podium, stepping into the shoes of your favourite driver, or creating an unlikely storyline where Logan Sargeant becomes World Champion. If you really wanted to.</p>
<p>Overall, Codemasters has made some big improvements to the Driver Career, making it feel all the more like you’re crafting your own storyline. You now work towards upgrading your driver’s stats, and you’re given a steady stream of objectives to incrementally move you towards taking P1. I was disappointed by the limited create-a-player options, with pre-set builds to choose form, but I understand that it’s likely to improve the parity between the real-world drivers and your racer.</p>

<p>There’s further inclusions, such as secret driver meetings where other teams court your interest, that really feel true to the behind-the-scenes action that are constantly whispered about in the paddock. Fundamentally, everything just feels a bit more more in depth, while staying true to the sport and its surrounding circus.</p>

<p>You can also run a complete two-player Driver Career, and we spent a lot of time in this mode, going head-to-head while also building our own path through the career. Sometimes load times can feel a little lengthy here while both players are working their way through menus, but the on-track action is rock solid and responsive. The biggest downside? There are few things more sobering though than the fact your son now beats you at an F1 racing game – I’d argue that he has too much time on his hands to practice.</p>
<p>While Driver Career has taken a step forward, there are few meaningful changes to My Team mode, though for many, creating your own team will be enough. You still control a driver alongside their team, but many of the most interesting new additions to the Driver Career mode haven’t been brought across, such as the secret meetings between drivers or the driver rivalries – in fairness, you’re basically playing as Lance and Lawrence Stroll bundled into one in this mode. While you can haggle with sponsors, and control a few more elements behind the scenes, it leaves My Team feeling like a missed opportunity, and I can see plenty of players choosing the main Driver Career over it.</p>

<p>To keep players coming back beyond their own stardom, Codemasters has added an episodic Challenge Career, where you’re given a series of missions to complete, with a set of cosmetic rewards to deck your driver out with. The first of these saw Max Verstappen choosing a small selection of his favourite race tracks and tasked you with finishing them in the highest position.</p>
<p>Each challenge hangs around for a week, before moving onto the next episode. It’s a great bite-sized mode, which doesn’t ask too much of your time, and it allows you to build your racer’s wardrobe – even if the most recent one is a horrible purple outfit that I’ll never, ever use.</p>
<p>While we can argue all day about horrible colour schemes, the visuals are sharper and distinctly more impressive than last year’s outing. The driver facial models are now incredibly lifelike, and various tracks look closer than ever to their real-world equivalent. Spa Francochamps in particular has seen a big improvement in visual fidelity, and it’s far more vibrant and realistic than last year’s overly dull rendition.</p>

<p>We’ve encountered a few bugs during our time with F1 24, including some penalties not being handed out for making changes to your engine during or after qualifying, and a few AI hiccups where an entire field of cars failed to put on wet tyres for the start of a race despite it absolutely chucking it down. Neither of these were disastrous – the second one obviously helped us out – but hopefully the few rough edges can be shaved off by an update.</p>
<p>At release, there were several vocal complaints about this year’s handling model, particularly if you used a steering wheel, and Codemasters has steadily tried to respond to these, with the most recent patch attempting to further address player’s difficulties.</p>
<p>The initial handling model felt good with a controller, but as we’ve leaned into playing more with our Thrustmaster wheel, the latest update feels more consistent and responsive than before. If it doesn’t quite feel right to you out of the box, there are various settings that you can tweak to personalise it to your liking, but for my personal taste, it’s just as accurate and enjoyable as it was last year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/full-cities-skylines-2-economy-2-0-patch-notes-revealed-as-huge-update-goes-live.909519/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-economy-20-patch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has released a major new&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>update, and it's a very big one indeed, bringing overhauls to economic systems, a building upgrade rework, and more.</p>
<p>The Economy 2.0 update has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-economy-rework-creator-packs">a long time in the making</a>, but it's finally here, and the patch notes are just as extensive as you'd expect from an update with a name as bold as Economy 2.0 (and hey, let's face it - that's a sexier name than 1.1.5f1).</p>
<p>The aforementioned building upgrade rework gives you more control over the Selected Info Panel's building upgrade feature; you can control which upgrade types you want to see, and you can relocate or remove sub-buildings as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cities-skylines-2-economy-2.0-patch-notes-aerial.jpg?itok=569BcoSC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cities-skylines-2-economy-2.0-patch-notes-aerial.jpg?itok=kn2_pMhl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>has just received a major new update.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, as the name suggests, this update is all about&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>'s economy, and the list of changes to the game's economic systems is truly extensive.</p>
<p>Changes have been made to features like area demand, employment, city services, and crime rates, and a number of other changes have also been implemented, including increased map tile cost, an option to unlock all map tiles (which also disables achievements), and much more.</p>
<p>If you're wondering whether any <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-word-of-the-week-february-26th">major performance improvements</a> have been implemented in this patch, the answer is yes, but those improvements are relatively limited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This update brings various UI optimizations, as well as improved FPS when "placing complex buildings or roads", but there aren't any massive, sweeping visual or performance boosts in this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cities-skylines-2-economy-2.0-patch-notes-street-view.jpg?itok=-tbCBvPi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cities-skylines-2-economy-2.0-patch-notes-street-view.jpg?itok=O5C-QC05 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Economy 2.0 patch for&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>is big, but it doesn't fix everything.</figcaption></figure><p>I'd strongly recommend giving the full&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>Economy 2.0 <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/patch-notes-1-1-5f1.1687527/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a> a look if you want to know everything they contain, but be warned: it's a pretty extensive list.</p>
<p>So, what's next for&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>now that the Economy 2.0 patch is upon us? This update contributed to delays to the game's upcoming Creator Packs, which are included in its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-roadmap-modding-update-release-date">most recent roadmap</a>, so hopefully, we'll get to see those being released sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>There's also the console release of&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-delayed-apology">delayed again back in April</a>&nbsp;and which is now targeting an October release window (although Paradox says that even meeting this target might be difficult).</p>
<p>We'll likely hear more about Paradox's plans for the game in the coming weeks, although information will likely be scarce within the next month or so owing to Finnish developer Colossal Order's summer break.</p>
<p><em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>&nbsp;is available right now on PC via either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/cities-skylines-ii/9NH213LRNGPC" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, and it's also available as part of a PC Game Pass or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>

            <p>Diablo 4's Season 5 will introduce a new wave-based rogue-lite mode.</p>
<p>By using an Infernal Compass – which scales in difficulty and world tier – players will be able to unlock the Infernal Hordes mode wherein they'll earn Burning Aether "to unlock powerful weapons and rewards".</p>
<p>Successfully slay the Hordes, and you'll be asked to take on the powerful Fell Council, which consists of three random minibosses. Successfully defeat them, and you'll be able to spend your Burning Aether on "Spoils of Hell" – Spoils of Equipment, Materials, Gold, or Greater Equipment – which guarantees an item with a Greater Affix.</p>

<p>Each time-limited wave will last 90 seconds, after which you'll have to defeat whatever foes remain before choosing between three Boons &amp; Banes – called Infernal Offers – that will modify your run. As these modifiers will stack, Blizzard warns players to "choose wisely" and, as you may well expect, the harder the difficulty, the better the rewards.</p>
<p>"Helltides were only the beginning of the horrors lying in wait," the Diablo 4 team teases. "Confront seemingly endless waves of Hell's Legions in the Realm of Hatred, as the Infernal Hordes grow more powerful with each passing day."</p>
<p>Interested? You can access the new mode early if you participate in the Public Test Realm (PTR), which is running for a week from tomorrow, Tuesday 25th June. The PTR will close on 2nd July. For everyone else, you'll have to wait until Season 5 goes live. Sorry.</p>

<p>As a thank you "for being part of the Diablo community through another year of fighting back the demonic forces of Hell", the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-celebrates-its-first-anniversary-by-giving-you-a-goblins-heap-of-free-gifts">March of the Goblins event</a> – which kicked off at the beginning of this month across both Diablo 4 and Diablo Immortal – had "a goblin's heap of rewards" to give away to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>Whilst the franchise has long been associated with its dedicated PC fanbase, an email sent from Xbox president Sarah Bond in April intimated that Diablo 4 – which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-near-deal-to-buy-call-of-duty-maker-activision-blizzard-report">acquired by Microsoft as part of its $68.7m acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, of course – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-is-the-number-one-platform-for-diablo-4-players-says-xbox-president">is more popular on the Xbox console system</a>, even though the RPG is also available on PC and PlayStation consoles, too.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aska-will-test-your-survival-skills-and-your-patience.909510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aska-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You are the last man standing after a terrible cataclysm, but you won't be alone forever — in&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>, you can transform one lonely person on an island into the head of a Viking village filled with talented craftsmen and mighty warriors.</p>
<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dab330ac-4284-4049-a45e-f654eba2a7d9" href="https://techraptor.net/games/aska"><em>Aska</em></a>&nbsp;is one of those rare games that somewhat successfully blends two genres; in this case, it's part survival game and party colony sim. You can build anywhere on a massive island, get dozens of villagers, and go toe-to-toe against mighty monsters. I enjoyed <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="135e6532-42c4-4195-adde-42e91fce15d0" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/aska-preview-interview">checking it out</a> back in April of this year, and I was excited to see how the final product turned out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aska-final-preview-expanding-a-settlement.jpg?itok=ruBwJP7x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aska-final-preview-expanding-a-settlement.jpg?itok=a2-on_g1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Expanding your settlement can be difficult if you don't have a robust infrastructure with several villagers helping you.</figcaption></figure><h2>Starting Civilization from Scratch</h2>
<p>The key premise of&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;is your adventure in restarting civilization from nothing. You land on an island after your boat is smashed to bits with nothing to your name except the clothes on your back and a canteen of sorts. With just a little bit of elbow grease, you'll soon be the head of a bustling village.</p>
<p>Your new village can be placed virtually anywhere on the massive island that is now your new home, and you can choose to populate it with a few villagers, dozens of villagers, or no villagers whatsoever. There is a fair amount of freedom in deciding your ultimate strategy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strictly speaking, you probably could play Aska by yourself or with some friends — it would just take much longer than it should.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You and your villagers will depend on buildings to gather <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="295b1366-075a-41c4-a1a9-6d248587c4f0" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/aska-resources-guide-how-to-get-crafting-materials">resources</a>, grow and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="76eec3db-e9de-4185-ac7a-50528354bf07" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/aska-cooking-and-food-guide">cook food</a>, and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b7bf401b-71ae-46f0-869e-a30a4cdba225" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/aska-crafting-and-unlocks-guide">craft new items</a>. All of these buildings need to be defended, too, so a portion of your population will almost certainly be assigned to defend it. You'll need the help — you can expect an attack once every few in-game days, and each winter ends with <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="94ccc7cc-f31f-47c6-95ec-afb308e3313b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/aska-invasion-guide-how-to-defend-your-village">a large invasion</a>.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, you probably could play&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;by yourself or with some friends — it would just take much longer than it should. Though you have to provide for your villagers' needs, they also considerably speed up construction and resource collection.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aska-final-preview-fighting-enemies-outside-of-town.jpg?itok=qGkM_2AA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aska-final-preview-fighting-enemies-outside-of-town.jpg?itok=mEhHFIj4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Villagers can be trained in combat and they will assist you when enemies attack.</figcaption></figure><h2>Fair, Unforgiving, and Utterly Mystifying</h2>
<p>Part of the appeal of&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;is the challenge of it. The game never feels unfair, but it also doesn't do the best job of communicating critically important information to the player.</p>
<p>Take the monster spawners as an example. In my first failed playthrough, I built my settlement a little too close to some ruins that, unbeknownst to me, endlessly spawned skeletons. I spent half of my playtime killing skeletons that were beating on my wall.</p>
<p>It's totally fair to suffer the consequences of building near a monster spawner. What's somewhat less fair is the fact that I had no way of knowing that that was a monster spawner that could not be destroyed. It took quite a few hours before I realized my situation was untenable and I had to restart. Lesson learned.</p>
<p>On a similar note, critical locations on a map (such as the aforementioned monster spawner) are not marked in any way. You only have one waypoint, so you can't mark them yourself, either. These are some of the many pieces of information that&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;should give you but doesn't.</p>
<p>This information deficit makes learning how to play <i>Aska</i>&nbsp;a trial-and-error experience. You'll gain the inkling of some new mechanic or strategy, only to learn that it's easier to start over and integrate this knowledge into your next attempt rather than continue on with a flawed strategy that's difficult to fix.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aska-final-preview-farmers-who-need-rakes-annoying-me.jpg?itok=kZwhjeNL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aska-final-preview-farmers-who-need-rakes-annoying-me.jpg?itok=Pm1j2lnm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Villagers with serious problems (such as a lack of tools) will follow you around until you interact with them and find out what's wrong. Many critical pieces of information can only be discovered by talking to people.</figcaption></figure><h2>Automation Frustration</h2>
<p>For a game that depends on automation,&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;is sorely lacking some much-needed features for managing your Settlement and the villagers that live within it. The current state of the Early Access launch is something of an exercise in frustration and micromanagement at times.</p>
<p>Farming is one particularly frustrating area. Each season, certain crops can no longer be grown and other crops must replace them. You can automate the planting and harvesting of crops on a per-season basis, but you must manually swap the crops in the Farm's menu each season.</p>
<p>This seems like a terrible oversight, especially considering how important a good food supply is for your village. The ability to automatically rotate crops based on the season can and should have been available right from the get-go. Instead, farming is a chore of micromanaging what gets planted where throughout the year.</p>
<p>Another issue is the fact that there is no reliable way to make villagers&nbsp;<em>avoid</em>&nbsp;an area. One of my playthroughs was ruined simply by the fact that my villagers kept running past a particularly dangerous respawning monster. I could place no flag or marker that would tell them to avoid that area. This is a feature that's badly needed in a future update.</p>
<p>Comparable games will provide statistics of incoming and outgoing supplies, allowing you to understand any deficiencies in your strategy at a glance.&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;doesn't do the greatest job of keeping you informed about small problems in your Settlement that could snowball into something bigger such as your farmers lacking tools.</p>
<p>These problems are compounded by the fact that it takes 10 minutes to summon a new villager and you can only summon one at a time. If some kind of disaster strikes or you lose a major battle, you'll spend hours recovering your population — and the gaps in your economy could have a devastating cascade effect for the rest of your people.</p>

You can quickly lose everything if you're not prepared.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Aska</em>&nbsp;Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>It may sound like I dislike&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>, but that's not the case. I genuinely think that this is one of the most interesting survival games and colony sims to make its way onto Steam in some time.&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;masterfully blends two genres into a single, compelling package — but the rough edges make what could have been a great game fall a bit short.</p>
<p>I think that many of these issues could be solved with some design changes. If the devs can improve the automation options and give the player a little more useful information, I could see&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;being the sort of game that you can comfortably sink hundreds of hours into by yourself or with your friends.</p>
<p>For now, gamers who are willing to learn and deal with a bit of jank will find&nbsp;<em>Aska</em>&nbsp;a fun challenge. I think it could turn into a simply amazing game with the right tweaks and improvements. One hopes that the developers will use the Early Access period to sort these problems out post haste.</p>
<hr><p><strong>Aska</strong><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>was previewed on PC via Steam Early Access with a code provided by the developer over the course of 150 hours of gameplay; all screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24183267/house-dragon-episode-season-2-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="4spIix">Even for the work of George R.R. Martin, the tragedy du jour that sets season 2 of <em>House of the Dragon</em> in motion is a bracingly terrible moment. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178649/house-dragon-season-2-daemon-assassins-prince-blood-cheese">casual beheading of Jaehaerys Targaryen</a> — while off screen in the moment, grimly recalled this week via stitches on a corpse — is depicted as a bridge too far, even for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23322393/house-dragon-houses-characters-explained">the brutal world of Westeros</a>. The people devoted to preserving the norms of the realm are losing their grip, as the bloody game of eye-for-an-eye has led to this race to the bottom. </p>
<p id="NV7MpC">It’s early in the game, but <em>House of the Dragon </em>season 2 seems devoted to mapping, in painstaking detail, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178745/house-dragon-season-2-premiere-review-episode-1">how a war starts</a>. It’s the Kübler-Ross model but for armed conflict <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23423671/house-dragon-season-1-review">instead of grief</a>. If “A Son for a Son” is denial, this week’s episode is anger. Or more aptly, fury — power is, if nothing else, a force multiplier. As Madam Sylvi (Michelle Bonnard) tells <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23946625">Aemond</a> when he curls up in her arms to express remorse over killing Jace, “When princes lose their temper it is often others who suffer.”</p>
<p id="gheXkY">Doubly so, then, for kings: Aegon’s fury over his son’s death has rendered him virtually inert in his position, but that doesn’t mean his small council isn’t ready to use it as kindling for the coming conflict. Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) spins his grandchild’s death into powerful propaganda, sending the infant corpse in a funeral procession through King’s Landing to turn the public further against Rhaenyra, who stooped so low as to murder a child in their bed. “Jaehaerys will do more for us now than a thousand knights in battle,” Otto says of his grim spectacle.</p>
<p id="M0ByDQ">This is, however, the last bit of savvy politicking within the Red Keep. Rage soon rebuilds the power structure in its image. Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney), in a decision that is sure to see blowback, orders all of the ratcatchers in King’s Landing killed, and dismisses Otto from his position of Hand, installing Ser Criston Cole — who sent Ser Arryk to assassinate Rhaenyra — instead. It’s a petty act from a boy-king who demands satisfaction and is frustrated by the constraints of the crown. Otto, however, sees something more dire than the loss of his position — to Otto, what the very throne represents is at stake. </p>

<p id="DBqW8q">While Otto Hightower is certainly no less self-interested than any other member of the court, he’s one of the few present with stated principles and a sincere belief in them. Aegon <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23405183/house-dragon-review-episode-9-alicent-aegon-rhaenys">was always a poor candidate for the Iron Throne</a>, one intended to be more of a figurehead that would allow the biggest stakeholders in Viserys’ court to retain their little fiefdoms — and most importantly to Otto, secure the Hightowers within King’s Landing. Unfortunately for that crowd, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23405130/house-dragon-why-rhaenys-doesnt-kill-aegon-dragon-murder">the quiet coup that put him on the throne</a> led to a set of circumstances Aegon is uniquely ill-equipped to handle.</p>
<p id="t4kvt1">Otto knows he has compromised those principles, and the crown, by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23367111/house-dragon-time-jumps-years-timeline">conspiring to install Aegon</a>, and is operating under the assumption that the preserving power of norms will paper over Aegon’s fraudulent rule and its damage to the throne’s integrity. He’s mistaken, obviously — we are in the sending assassins and killing infants and hanging innocent exterminators phase of Aegon’s reign; norms are as dead as Jaehaerys. </p>

<p id="Tzf1bt">Principled men fall one by one in order to make way for men who clamor for war.<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> underscores this with one final small tragedy, as the twins <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23403463/house-dragon-twins-names-actors-cast-arryk-erryk-yes-really">Arryk and Erryk</a> (Elliott Tittensor and Luke Tittensor) confront each other with Rhaenyra’s life in the balance. The brothers’ split along ideological lines was one of the quieter rifts in the show’s first season, made no less devastating by their idealism, and the belief in the nobility of their position in the Kingsguard. </p>
<p id="cTvamL">Director Clare Kilner stages the twins’ sad, desperate struggle so that, eventually, it is impossible to tell them apart. Its terrible conclusion, in which one brother emerges victorious only to impale himself on his sword, can be read multiple ways — as one brother unable to live without the other, or as Erryk realizing that he will never fully have Rhaenyra’s trust and therefore will not be able to fulfill his duty, or as some combination of the two. Death, then, is better than a life of suspicion or compromise. There is a metaphor here. </p>
<p id="REOevj">It is a terrible thing to measure one life over another, and yet that’s what the power structure of King’s Landing — what any power structure, really — depends on. Jaehaerys’ funeral procession is a powerful message but it is also built on a fiction: that any other dead child killed in their bed would matter just as much. That is patently untrue. So many more children are now going to die, to avenge the deaths of two. </p>

            <p>Xbox leaders in AI and cloud will be our final keynote session for GI Sprint next week.</p>
<p>Haiyan Zhang, general manager of Gaming AI at Xbox, and Brady Woods, product leader at Xbox Game Creator Services, will discuss how the latest technology can help game developers build their games better and more efficiently.</p>
<p>The session will be available to view online, listen as a podcast or read as an article on <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> on Wednesday, July 3rd.</p>
<p>GI Sprint is our a new editorial series, featuring video panels, podcasts, interviews, articles and more on the subject of making video games 'cheaper, faster and better'.</p>
<p>In the face of rising development costs, we've spoken to an array of experts about a range of subjects that will help studios improve the efficiency of their businesses and development processes. This special will run until Friday, July 5.</p>
<p>We kicked the series off last week with an interview featuring games veteran and former PlayStation boss <strong>Shawn Layden</strong>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shawn-laydens-advice-on-making-games-faster-and-cheaper">who discussed the unsustainability of AAA video games</a> and why it needs rethinking. We have also spoken to IO Interactive CTO <strong>Ulas Karademir</strong> <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/io-interactives-mission-to-speed-up-game-development-gi-sprint">on his return to the Hitman studio</a> and the opportunities offered by having in-house tech.</p>
<p>We also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-devs-need-to-fail-fast-and-how-to-do-so-gi-sprint">hosted a panel on the art of failing fast,</a> featuring <strong>Rami Ismail</strong>, FreeLives' <strong>Dominique Gawlowski</strong> and Ant Workshop's <strong>Tony Gowland</strong>. While we also featured<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/singles-not-albums-a-guide-to-making-smaller-games-gi-sprint"> a standalone piece with Gowland</a> on developing shorter games.</p>
<p>This week, we have a video panel on how AI can (and cannot) speed up development. King's AI lead <strong>Sahar Asadi</strong> will share with us her experience of using the technology with Candy Crush, while Team Sync's <strong>Graham McAllister</strong> will tell us why the concept stage is the most important one to get right when it comes to team efficiency.</p>
<p>Then next week, we have videos, podcasts and articles covering topics such as hybrid working, the advantages of a lean team, and more. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/events/gi-sprint-summer-2024">You can see the full schedule here.</a></p>
<p>We will conclude the event with a White Paper collating all the articles in one place, and it's free to download.</p>
<p>Various sponsorship packages are available for GI Sprint, for both this even and our next one. Contact <a href="mailto:George.Corner@Gamesindustry.biz">George.Corner@Gamesindustry.biz</a> for more details.</p>

            <p>War Thunder developer Gaijin Entertainment has issued an apology after it accidentally included imagery from the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in a piece of key art.</p>
<p>The error was quickly noticed by members of the War Thunder community, who shared the image on the game's forum and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1dm9oao/challenger_disaster_and_seek_destroy_wallpaper/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a> to show how the artwork lined up with images of the 1986 disaster. This real-world incident resulted in the death of all seven crew members on board the space shuttle.</p>
<p>"Maybe it was an accident on the part of the artist, but it seems in incredibly poor taste," one poster wrote on the War Thunder forum.</p>

<p>Gaijin Entertainment has now acknowledged this error. "Please accept our sincere apologies for this, the picture was part of an aerial explosion reference pack used by our artists and the context was lost," community manager <a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/t/noticed-a-little-something/119652/25">magazine2</a> wrote on the forum.</p>
<p>"We'll be altering this artwork as soon as we can and will take measures to ensure that this doesn't repeat again in the future."</p>
<p>A similar statement was also shared by War Thunder's international community manager Oxy on reddit. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1dm7e77/comment/l9vr7e0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Oxy</a> said the artwork will be changed today (Monday), adding: "sorry everyone, things like this shouldn't happen."</p>
<p>War Thunder has previously made headlines due to players leaking classified military documents to the game's forums. </p>
<p>This has included a flight <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/military-documents-leak-once-again-on-war-thunder-forum">manual for the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classified-military-documents-leaked-on-war-thunder-forum-for-third-time">documents of the DTC10-125 Chinese anti-tank missile</a> and documents on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yet-more-military-documents-leaked-on-war-thunder-forum">F-16 fighter jet</a>, which were shared by one player in an attempt to win an argument with another member of the game's community.</p>

<p>John Romero remembers the moment he realized what the future of gaming would look like.</p>
<p>In late 1991, Romero and his colleagues at id Software had just released <em>Catacomb 3-D</em>, a crude-looking, <a href="https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/EGA_Palette">EGA-colored</a> first-person shooter that was nonetheless revolutionary compared to other first-person games of the time. "When we started making our 3D games, the only 3D games out there were nothing like ours," Romero told Ars in a recent interview. "They were lockstep, going through a maze, do a 90-degree turn, that kind of thing."</p>
<p>Despite <em>Catacomb 3-D</em>'s technological advances in first-person perspective, though, Romero remembers the team at id followed its release by going to work on the next entry in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/bethesda-revives-80s-pc-series-commander-keen-as-a-free-to-play-mobile-game/">the long-running <em>Commander Keen</em> series</a> of 2D platform games. But as that process moved forward, Romero told Ars that something didn't feel right.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nej9F6jj_rA?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p><em>Catacombs 3-D</em> is less widely remembered than its successor, <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Within two weeks, [I was up] at one in the morning and I'm just like, 'Guys we need to not make this game [<em>Keen</em>],'" he said. "'This is not the future. The future is getting better at what we just did with <em>Catacomb</em>.' ... And everyone was immediately was like, 'Yeah, you know, you're right. That is the new thing, and we haven't seen it, and we can do it, so why aren't we doing it?'"</p>
<p>The team started working on <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> that very night, Romero said. And the rest is history.</p>
<h2>Going for speed</h2>
<p>What set <em>Catacomb 3-D</em> and its successors apart from other first-person gaming experiments of the time, Romero said, "was our speed—the speed of the game was critical to us having that massive differentiation. Everyone else was trying to do a world that was proper 3D—six degrees of freedom or representation that was really detailed. And for us, the way that we were going to go was a simple rendering at a high speed with good gameplay. Those were our pillars, and we stuck with them, and that's what really differentiated them from everyone else."</p>
<p>That focus on speed extended to id's development process, which Romero said was unrecognizable compared to even low-budget indie games of today. The team didn't bother writing out design documents laying out crucial ideas beforehand, for instance, because Romero said "the design doc was next to us; it was the creative director... The games weren't that big back then, so it was easy for us to say, 'this is what we're making' and 'things are going to be like this.' And then we all just work on our own thing."                                            </p>

<p>The early id designers didn't even use basic development tools like version control systems, Romero said. Instead, development was highly compartmentalized between different developers; "the files that I'm going to work on, he doesn't touch, and I don't touch his files," Romero remembered of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/dooms-romero-and-carmack-will-reunite-for-30th-anniversary-streaming-event/">programming games alongside John Carmack</a>. "I only put the files on my transfer floppy disk that he needs, and it's OK for him to copy everything off of there and overwrite what he has because it's only my files, and vice versa. If for some reason the hard drive crashed, we could rebuild the source from anyone's copies of what they've got."</p>

        <p>The games firm set publish upcoming projects for both studios through subsidiary Focus Entertainment Publishing</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Pullup Entertainment has acquired minority stakes in two independent studios, Uppercut Games and Rundisc.</p>
<p>The games firm will acquire financial assets in Submerged developer Uppercut, and will co-own and publish its upcoming game through its subsidiary, Focus Entertainment Publishing.</p>
<p>This subsidiary published Rundisc's Chants of Sennaar last year, and its partnership with Focus Entertainment will continue into a new project.</p>
<p>Australia-based <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/key-xcom-devs-leave-to-form-new-studio">Uppercut Games was founded in 2011</a> by industry veterans Andrew James and Ed Orman.</p>
<p>The deal between Pullup and Uppercut was negotiated by Cam Rogers Legal, a video games and digital entertainment law firm in Australia.</p>
<p>"The team at CRL have been tireless in their efforts, and their guidance and support were instrumental in getting this deal across the line," said Uppercut games director Ed Orman.</p>

            <p>
Fortnite has launched a major new battle royale mode, Reload, which drew in more than a million players to the game over the weekend. 
</p>
<p>
Available in both regular and Zero Build variants, Reload is a smaller-scale battle royale option with 40 players organised into 10 squads, with respawns enabled if at least one team member is still alive. 
</p>
<p>
If that sounds familiar, it's because Reload is very much inspired by Call of Duty: Warzone's popular Resurgence mode, which offers very similar mechanics. Respawning isn't instant and requires a wait time which increases over the match - though aggressive play can reduce it, if your teammates take out other players or entire squads.

<p>
Reload wraps all of this in another very popular wrapper - that of Fortnite's original Chapter 1 game map that returned last year to enormous success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">gifting Fortnite its biggest player numbers <em>ever</em></a>. In Reload, the action takes place in a shrunken-down version of the original battle royale island, albeit with iconic locations such as Tilted Towers, Pleasant Park and Retail Row replicated faithfully. 
</p>
<p>
Fortnite publicly shares its player numbers, with the numbers of people playing each mode viewable from the game's main screen. Over the weekend, a peak of 1.6 million people were playing Reload across its regular and Zero Build variants. At the time of writing, Reload is currently Fortnite's most popular mode, beating its original Battle Royale. 
</p>
<p>
Reload looks to be Fortnite's big addition for this summer, as Epic Games prepares to go on its twice-annual company break. But there's plenty already programmed in for the next few weeks, including the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-pirates-of-the-caribbean-crossover-launches-next-month">previously-leaked Pirates of the Caribbean crossover</a>.

Looking at it, you might expect this costumed nuisance to be another grafted abomination, its layers of papier-mache, binbags and repurposed carpets hiding a rippling quilt of flesh and bone, perhaps a real lion that has been shaved and stitched to its theatrical double. The truth is more appalling still: it's just two guys in a lion suit. They aren't even sewn together mouth to backside, like in the Human Centipede. Way to bait-and-switch, From!

The front half of the lion might be the source of all those eye-catching AOE attacks but the back half of the lion is doing all the heavy lifting, to the point of defying the laws of physics. Feel free to point a finger and laugh uproariously like a school bully at a pantomime rehearsal. I'm sure it'll make you feel better when you take a lightning bolt to the chops for the 30th time running.

Generally speaking, I both love it and feel quite anxious when developers take the time to depict things which you'll technically never see: landscapes that can't be visited, proper skeletons for characters that, that kind of thing. I also wonder whether they could have gone a bit meta with this.
</p>
<p>
The Dancing Lion has its place in Erdtree's lore, as you'd expect, but perhaps they could have done an Icon Of Sin and put From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki inside it. He'd be the front half of the lion, naturally, but who would be the other half? Whomst at From Software has the clout, the talent, the sheer stage presence to be the back half of Elden Ring's dancing lion? In other news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">Shadow Of The Erdtree has launched to a mixed reception on Steam</a>, with a significant portion of the negative response owing to players finding it too difficult.

The DLC’s extreme — and intended - difficulty has sparked a debate about the rights and wrongs of developer FromSoftware’s approach with this <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> expansion. But now that debate has spilled over into Steam user reviews, which currently have a ‘mixed’ rating after a flood of complaints about the rock hard bosses as well as PC performance issues.</p><p>Ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree’s release, director Hidetaka Miyazaki signaled the DLC would significantly test players’ abilities. "The new challenges for the player are going to be the boss encounters as well as the different kinds of threats that the world will impose on people," Miyazaki told <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-talks-shadow-of-the-erdtree-new-weapons-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNET</a>. Some of these bosses are aimed at players who've completed most of the base Elden Ring, meaning FromSoftware has "kind of really pushed the envelope in terms of what we think can be withstood by the player," he added.</p><p>And so it has proved. Over the weekend, players began to complain about the extreme difficulty with bosses and performance issues. “As a huge fan of all soulgames, I would love to like the DLC, but the enemies' damages are completely overtuned, especially for some bosses,'' reads one negative review. “Some have a completely erratic moveset rendering the whole experience just painful without any fun.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Some have a completely erratic moveset rendering the whole experience just painful without any fun.</p></div><p>“Good DLC, but performance has gone down as of the latest update,” reads another negative review, this time focused on the PC performance problems. “Constant micro-stuttering and frame drops, freezes as well as increases in loading times make it difficult to enjoy and play the game. One of the early boss fights takes place around a puddle of water, which drops frames considerably. Wait for performance improvements before buying.”</p><p>Perhaps mindful of the growing negative feedback over difficulty, publisher Bandai Namco tweeted some advice for struggling Shadow of the Erdtree players: “This is a suggestion to level up your Scadutree Blessing.” This tallies with advice IGN itself has offered. Indeed we believe <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-scadutree-blessings-are-the-answer-to-elden-ring-dlcs-difficulty">Shadow of the Erdtree's Scadutree Blessings are the answer to the Elden Ring DLC's difficulty</a> (Scadutree Blessing bolsters the recipient's abilities to deal and negate damage).

But extreme difficulty has not hindered their sales success.

"Had we taken that approach, I don’t think the game would have done what it did, because the sense of achievement that players gain from overcoming these hurdles is such a fundamental part of the experience. Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy, which, in my eyes, would break the game itself."</p><p>An amusing upshot of the debate around Shadow of the Erdtree’s difficulty is a renewed nostalgia for the base game and its bosses, now said to be relatively easygoing in retrospect.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/24/screenshot-2024-06-24-093218-1719217949985.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: reddit.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/24/screenshot-2024-06-24-093255-1719217982603.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Shadow of the Erdtree has certainly enjoyed critical acclaim, and has become the highest-rated video game expansion of all-time by overtaking Witcher 3 DLC Blood and Wine on Metacritic. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">Shadow of the Erdtree review</a> returned a 10/10. We said: “Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single-player DLC expansions. It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Tips for navigating the PR landscape]]></title>
            <link>https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tips-for-navigating-the-pr-landscape</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tips-for-navigating-the-pr-landscape.909465/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tips-for-navigating-the-pr-landscape<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The indie space is incredibly exciting, and increasingly competitive. Players can only pick so many games a year and with discoverability being one of the leading issues for developers (and players), there's a case to be made that PR is as vital as ever.</p>
<p>But how can you effectively utilise the PR resources you have at your disposal? What tactics should you employ to engage with your target audience? And how will you ensure the publications and influencers you engage with also benefit from these endeavours?</p>
<p>Speaking from experience, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to PR in the games industry. Conducting influencer outreach on AAA projects was a vastly different experience from working on an indie gem like The Case of the Golden Idol. Both require flexibility in the approach taken to PR and marketing.</p>
<p>What is certain is that there is now an even greater need to shift between different techniques and strategies when it comes to engaging with your audience. Journalists and influencers are more sensitive than ever before, acutely in tune with their audiences – their tastes, preferences, and expectations. As a result, good quality PR has never been more important to indie devs looking to make a success of their latest titles.</p>
<p>But what exactly are the key tips for indie developers looking to effectively utilise PR to successfully pitch and market their latest games?</p>
<h2><strong>The importance of building relationships and understanding your audience </strong></h2>
<p>PR is a relationship-based industry. While individuals in other fields, such as marketing, conduct outreach that can reach millions of viewers, PRs often deal in the thousands. Sustaining relationships with thousands of people, however, is a near-impossible task.</p>
<p>As a result, many studios will diminish the importance of building relationships with publications and influencers, and instead adopt a traditional 'spray and pray' approach.</p>
<p>In some instances, this is necessary, particularly when you are first starting your outreach and getting started in the field, but if you incorporate this frequently, this strategy is not only going to dent your hopes of building new relationships, but also putting those you do have in jeopardy.</p>
<p>It is therefore important to refine this approach. The first top PR tip for indie devs is to learn from these initial interactions with journalists, reviewers, and influencers, and build genuine relationships with them moving forward.</p>
<p>Decipher which of your contacts have engaged with your initial approach and tailor specific pitches to those you feel confident will resonate best with your content. It is even possible to build a relationship like this off the back of a negative initial response. Now you know what they're looking for and – crucially – what they would rather not hear about!</p>
<p>Once you have a refined list of contacts whose interests you understand, it's then time to tailor your pitches based on these interests. If you know a journalist hates first-person shooters, you don't want to pitch them your new first-person shooter...</p>
<blockquote>Identifying the right channels to pitch to, and tailoring these pitches accordingly, is a key part of utilising PR for any indie developer</blockquote>
<p>Traditional enthusiast publications will have a different approach to reviewing your game and will be broadcasting to a different audience than a YouTube influencer, for example. Screenshots of gameplay will get an online publication talking, but won't be much use to a Twitch streamer.</p>
<p>Balatro is a key example of the importance of tailoring your pitches to the right audience in order to maximise your chances of success. At no point during the pitching process did all the influencers on my target list receive a pitch for Balatro, but outreach to enthusiast sites and other online review platforms was strong.</p>
<p>The game garnered reviews of 9/10 and 10/10 and the response was overwhelmingly positive. By that point, the media had become the influencers, which then in turn garnered the interest of the individual influencers to pick up the game and do what they do best.</p>
<p>Identifying the right channels to pitch to, and tailoring these pitches accordingly, is a key part of utilising PR for any indie developer. Understanding this audience will allow you to reach your specific target audience and get the exposure your game deserves.</p>
<h2><strong>Understanding the win-win</strong></h2>
<p>Tailoring your pitch is one thing, but it is also salient to consider how the other side will benefit. The media landscape is constantly changing, and whereas journalists and influencers may have had the time to focus on the latest indie gem in days gone by, the current media landscape – much like the games landscape itself – is increasingly competitive.</p>
<p>Having to meet KPIs and benchmarks means that they will typically only cover a game if they see value in it to them and their audience. For this reason, it's key for you to focus on a 'win-win' pitching strategy.</p>

<p>An example we can point to is The Case of the Golden Idol, which we launched in 2022. This game received 9s and 10s in reviews, and the player response to the game was overwhelmingly positive. However, when working on the PR for this game, a serious consideration we had to look at was that it didn't stream particularly well.</p>
<p>It is a very cerebral experience, which doesn't necessarily lend itself to streaming on the likes of Twitch and YouTube. Pitching an influencer with the aim of producing a stream or video, while earning exposure for the game itself, could have a negative impact on that particular influencer's channel.</p>
<p>This meant it was important to consider the 'win-win'. In tailoring the pitch, we suggested to a certain influencer that they played the game first and then – if they enjoyed it – would be interested in covering it on their social media. The game reached that influencer's audience, receiving welcome exposure as a result, without negatively impacting the influencer's output. It was a 'win-win' for both parties.</p>
<p>There has been a shift in focus in recent times from a discoverability focus to prioritising these win-win partnerships. As PRs, we need to keep in mind that game enthusiast websites, review outlets, and individual influencers all run as businesses in their own right. If you tailor your pitches towards a 'win-win' outcome, you are more likely to secure opportunities for your game while also building relationships with those you have pitched to.</p>

<h2><strong>The champions</strong></h2>
<p>While there has been a shift in emphasis to a more win-win oriented approach, discoverability remains a leading topic of interest for a number of indie devs throughout the industry. In essence, the key to discoverability is not just PR, but good quality PR.</p>
<p>Take Balatro again as an example. Sending screenshots of the game and short clips of gameplay didn't do much for securing any interest; out of context those screenshots just looked like some cards on a poker table, doing little to convey what the content of the game itself is.</p>
<blockquote>In essence, the key to discoverability is not just PR, but good quality PR</blockquote>
<p>Simply put, inviting champions – which were identified in my research – to play the game for 20 minutes, knowing that they likely wouldn't put it down for hours. The game was the story, and it needed the right people to tell it.</p>
<p>Once you have the right champions for your game, remember that all discourse around the title will impact its visibility. Both positive and negative reviews can garner attention, and it's what you do with that attention that will ultimately determine the success of your PR strategy.</p>
<p>These media outlets can shape public opinion and start online conversations, which can determine the cultural significance of a particular game. Being able to get your title in front of the media allows you to be a central part of these conversations, improving the discoverability of your game.</p>
<h2><strong>The value of that first asset</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to indie devs looking to kickstart a PR campaign, you have to start somewhere. It's super important to have that amazing first asset; be it a trailer, screenshots or gameplay clips that will grab the attention of the audience you are looking to engage with.</p>
<p>Creating a kick-ass trailer was one of the key steps we took in the lead-up to the launch of Mortal Shell. This trailer – which was posted on IGN's website – encouraged influencers to stream the game, promoting it to a wider audience. This initial asset gave the game early momentum, allowing the PR strategy to take shape around it moving forward.</p>
<p>Some studios will not have this luxury at their disposal. It might be that these assets are taking time to create, or simply that the assets you already have are not necessarily going to resonate with the channels you are approaching.</p>
<blockquote>It is important to appreciate that a tepid response to these assets can, in some cases, be less productive than no engagement at all</blockquote>
<p>The key when it comes to utilising the creative assets is understanding its impact, and looking to be flexible if it doesn't have that desired outcome. If it looks as though your asset is going to generate some very strong, positive engagement, then look to build on this success as you progress with your strategy.</p>
<p>If your asset doesn't produce high levels of traffic, it is important to appreciate that a tepid response to these assets can, in some cases, be less productive than no engagement at all.</p>
<p>To conclude, the number one focus should be focussing on that 'win-win'. Lowering that barrier to coverage as much as possible is crucial to the success of any up-and-coming indie studio.</p>
<p>For example, if you are looking to send an influencer a demo for them to broadcast to their followers, but the demo in question has a one-hour tutorial to play through prior to the main event, the influencer is unlikely to see the benefits for their own channel.</p>
<p>Sharp, punchy, exciting assets that suit your chosen PR audience are far more likely to get you the engagement you desire. Above all else, remember the 'relations' part of PR. Be specific, know the content your chosen channel produces, and tailor that gem of a pitch accordingly.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 12.15pm UK: </strong>Speaking to Eurogamer, GAME has categorically denied the report published earlier today which stated the chain would stop selling boxed games and consoles in its stores. 
</p>
<p>In a statement provided to Eurogamer, the brand said it would continue to sell a "wide range" of boxed games in store and online. We've followed up for more detail on whether any of these sales will still require a pre-order, as previously reported.
</p>
<p>"This reporting is categorically not true," a GAME spokesperson told Eurogamer today. "GAME continues to support the physical gaming market, offering a wide-range of physical games, hardware, software, accessories and digital gift cards, in stores and online."</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 11.30am UK: </strong>
Beleagured high street chain GAME will no longer sell physical games, other than fulfilling pre-orders. 
</p>
<p>
That's according to a <a href="https://www.gfinityesports.com/news/game-ending-in-store-video-game-sales/">Gfinity</a> report which states that upcoming new launches will need to be pre-ordered before launch to be picked up in store. 
</p>
<p>
The same is true of video game consoles, the report goes on, suggesting that outside of hardware launches you will no longer be able to walk into a shop and buy a Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S off the shelf.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted GAME for more detail.

<p>
The move would be the latest radical change to GAME's operation this year, following the end of both its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">long-running trade-in scheme</a> - meaning you can no longer buy or exchange pre-owned games - and the shutdown of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">GAME Elite reward programme</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-staff-told-to-expect-redundancies-as-most-workers-move-to-zero-hours-contracts">Eurogamer reported how many GAME staff had been moved to zero-hour contracts, with others made redundant</a>.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer understands the changes to GAME are part of a wider move to operate the brand largely within concession units for other stores owned by its parent company the Frasers Group - such as Sports Direct.
</p>
<p>
Much of GAME's floor space and sales are now taken up by toys and collectables such as Funko Pops. Still, a GAME where you can't even buy physical games is the chain's most surprising move yet.

            <p>
With the release of DLC Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring players are back to their old tricks by playing the game in weird and wonderful ways.
</p>
<p>
Take Twitch streamer Perrikaryal, who's already played the game with her mind and is now tackling Shadow of the Erdtree. Yes, you read that right.
</p>
<p>
Perrikaryal uses a bluetooth, portable EEG reader to analyse patterns of brain activity and, along with an eye-tracker, convert these to inputs. She then thinks about specific actions, which trigger rolls, attacks and the like in game - <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/perrikaryal/clip/SpinelessFilthyPresidentShazBotstix-NCMKhK02R5dFDFsE">here's an explanation clip</a>.

<p>

This has allowed the streamer to complete Elden Ring without using a traditional controller. And now, with the DLC released last Friday, she's already beaten its second major boss. 
</p>
<div>

<p>
Another streamer is back on the base game, but every dodge roll in the game is performed with an actual roll in real life.
</p>
<p>
GoodGameEthan began this run five months ago, playing the game with a controller until the time comes to dodge and he barrel rolls across a mat. So far he's up to Maliketh, but aims to play the DLC this way too.
</p>
<p>
"I tried really hard to beat the game before the DLC but my knees gave out on me after two hours fighting Godfrey this morning," he said in a comment on reddit. "Will try to beat the game before I tackle the DLC."
</p>

Lastly, streamer itzCBD has completed the entire base game from NG to NG+7 without dying a single time and without levelling up at all.
</p>
<p>
That's eight full playthroughs of the game with the same Wretch class character remaining at level one. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>I just became the first person to beat Elden Ring from NG to NG+7 without dying a single time...at LEVEL 1</p><p>Eight full playthroughs in a row on the same character, starting as the Wretch class, never leveling up, and never dying.

<p>
It's a hugely impressive feat, and along with others shows just how accomplished Elden Ring players have become after beating the base game with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streamer-defeats-elden-rings-malenia-in-dance-pad-and-controller-simultaneous-challenge-run">dance pads</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-beaten-with-an-actual-banana">bananas</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
Still, Shadow of the Erdtree bumps up the difficulty of the game, which - along with performance issues - has resulted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-falls-to-a-mixed-steam-rating-as-pc-players-complain-about-difficulty-and-performance">Mixed response on Steam from unhappy players</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-and-xbox-technical-differences-negligible/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The technical differences between PlayStation and Xbox consoles are so negligible nowadays that one standard home console would benefit games more than the current platform war between Sony and Microsoft, according to a former PlayStation head.</p>
<p>Speaking during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHf5avkORyc">a panel</a> held during IGN Live 2024 regarding where we will be playing games in the future, former PlayStation head Shawn Layden commented on the platform war between Sony and Microsoft, saying that if we got it out of the way and had one standard home console, games would be better. Nowadays, technical differences between PlayStation and Xbox are negligible, as both are using the same hardware from AMD.</p>
<p><em>"Xbox, PlayStation, high-end PC, that's almost at a plateau where all things being equal, they're pretty much the same. We'd be in a better world if we could get down to one standard home console technology that we could come together, and get this platform war thing out of the way."</em></p>
<p>The former PlayStation head also commented on the console market, which is currently struggling, but this, according to Layden, is nothing new. The global install base in any previous console generation never rose above 250 million, with the only exception being the Wii era, as some software, such as Wii Fit, appealed to an audience that doesn't usually play games. Those numbers were clearly not sustainable, and the install base went back to the 250 million overall of every other generation. The increased revenue during the pandemic, additionally, did not come from new people entering the console gaming world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Where Will You Be Playing Games in the Future? | IGN Live 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KHf5avkORyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't the first time in recent times we have heard that Sony and Xbox hardware is essentially the same. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-needed-advancing-visuals/">April</a>, well-known AMD leaker Kepler talked about how all hardware vendors have converged to very similar designs, and, as such, there's barely any difference between CPUs and GPUs from different vendors, and optimizing for one vendor essentially applies to all others. With Microsoft opening up to releasing some of its titles to PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, one really has to wonder if the platform war will indeed go away at some point, although Nintendo is unlikely to retire from the hardware market anytime soon, considering how successful its systems continue to be.</p>

        <p>It has also launched a non-compliance investigation in response to Apple's business terms</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The European Commission has found Apple in breach of its Digital Markets Act following <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/eu-commission-investigates-google-meta-and-apple-for-possible-digital-markets-act-violations">an investigation launched in March</a> against the firm.</p>
<p>In its preliminary findings, the EU Commission said it found Apple's rules of engagement did not comply with the DMA because it "prevent[s] app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content."</p>
<p>The EU Commission found that Apple's business terms do not allow developers to freely communicate with consumers to promote alternative app stores, and that while the firm does allow steering by allowing developers to include links to web pages in their apps, they are met with several restrictions.</p>
<p>This includes Apple's "core technology fee" which sees developers pay €0.50 for every app install per year after the first install distributed via the App Store and alternative marketplaces.</p>
<p>The regulator has also launched a non-compliance investigation in response to Apple's business terms, including the core technology fee, eligibility requirements for developers, and the process to download alternative app stores on iPhones.</p>
<p>As a result, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-apple-facing-1bn-daily-fines-over-alleged-dma-breaches">Apple could face daily fines of up to 5% of the company's average turnover</a>, amounting to over $1 billion.</p>
<p>"Under the DMA, developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able, free of charge, to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases," the regulator said.</p>

            <p>Pirates of the Caribbean is coming to Fortnite next month.</p>
<p>Last week's update to Fortnite included characters and content set to be part of the crossover, and initially an event pass featuring Captain Jack Sparrow was made available to buy. Dataminers quickly discovered other characters set to arrive as well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">solidifying rumours</a> that emerged several months back when Fortnite's 2024 roadmap first leaked. </p>
<p>Now, acknowledging the event pass' early sale, developer Epic Games has confirmed the crossover's official release: 19th July.</p>

<p>As you may recall, several of the leaked roadmap's upcoming events – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">such as Billie Eilish coming to the game in April</a> – have since turned out to be true, adding credence to reports that a Pirates of the Caribbean crossover was also on the way.</p>
<p>This time, notable Fortnite leaker Hypex took to social media platform X with a new image showing off Davy Jones, Hector Barbossa, and Elizabeth Swann, who look to be purchasable separately from the event pass.</p>
<p>There's also a new pirate-themed item, Ship in the Bottle – described as "a cursed ship trapped in a bottle. Open it to unleash the ship from its ghostly depths, diving into your opponents with a devastating crash!" – and a Jack Sparrow "Jar of Dirt" emote.</p> <div>

<p>Hypex says the Pirates of the Caribbean shop will open on 18th July, 2024, whilst fellow leaker ShiinaBR reckons the crossover event itself is scheduled to kick off the following day.</p>
<p>Hypex was one of the first to spot that The Pirates of the Caribbean pass had been placed for sale early, before Epic stepped in to ensure it was <a href="https://x.com/thedarkvortex13/status/1804517742768214028">swiftly removed</a>. Those who did manage to buy it say they <a href="https://x.com/ItzHarcos/status/1804411760285286532">"didn't get anything but the skin"</a> - for now.</p> <div>

<p>Shortly thereafter, Epic confirmed that anyone who purchased the Cursed Sails Pass ahead of its 19th July release date would not be able to "progress the pass until the start of the event", and invited players to apply for refunds if they didn't want to wait.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>For players who purchased the Cursed Sails Pass ahead of its intended release on July 19, please note you are currently unable to progress the Pass until the start of the event, but will retain your Jack Sparrow outfit in the meantime.</p><p>If you wish to instead refund this purchase… <a href="https://t.co/i3FdtuNSLW">pic.twitter.com/i3FdtuNSLW</a></p></div>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1804535483571007684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metallica-headlines-fortnite-as-it-introduces-a-new-music-themed-battle-mode-and-fresh-concert">Did you see Metallica's Fortnite concert over the weekend</a>?  Not only did the metal band headline the game's next Fortnite Festival season, but all four of Metallica's members are now unlockable as skins in the mode's next Festival Pass.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a recent Fortnite update notably adds a new competitive way to play Festival: Battle Stage. As Tom explained for us at the time, here 16 players face off against each other via a song chosen at random, with your Overdrive operating as an attack power to take other players down a peg. Or, you can team up with a four-person party of friends and pick specific tunes to fight over.</p>

            <p>Despite an overwhelmingly strong reception with critics, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> is currently sitting at a ‘mixed’ review rating on Steam, with nay-sayers citing performance issues and overbearing enemy design. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> DLC is currently metacritic’s highest rated expansion of all time at 95, beating out the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witcher-3-tips">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-review">Blood And Wine</a>’s 92. However, roughly a third of the 41,000 user reviews on Steam are negative.</p>

<p>On the technical side, recent negative reviews highlight stutters, drops, and low frame rates. As for gameplay, there’s a thread of players hitting breaking point with boss and enemy design, both in terms of difficulty scaling and boss attack patterns. To elucidate, although not dismiss, these complaints: Shadow Of The Erdtree implements a new progression system where players are required to explore and collect Scadutree Fragments in order to be on par with much of the DLC’s content outside the base area. As such, the damage that Erdtree’s enemies both dish out and take is scaled differently from the base game. The DLC has only been out a few days, so its possible players are attempting to best the high level content without being fully prepared.</p>
<p>As for boss design itself, players repeatedly mention lengthy attack combos, unreadable boss tells, and encounters that otherwise seem to prioritise difficulty over enjoyment. These same criticisms were levelled against some of the bosses in the base game, and it seems the arms-race design of the DLC has, for some, exacerbated these issues.</p>
<p>Speaking personally, I’ve got mixed feelings on the mixed reviews. I’m sympathetic towards anyone who felt alienated by Elden Ring’s critical reception, homogeneous and aggressively superlative as it was. It feels like, in distilling both what was good and bad about the base game, FromSoft have pushed a section of the playerbase to voice their issues with the DLC. That said, and strangely enough, I’m actually finding most of Erdtree’s bosses to be far fairer and more thoughtfully designed than the more difficult encounters found in the original release. It feels as if FromSoft have returned to the boss design of old somewhat. However, I am wearing extremely heavy armour, and I’ve also scoured the map for Scadutree fragments, so I'm basically a tank at this point. I’ve seen clips of people getting one shot by bosses, which must be extremely frustrating. </p>
<p>I think pushback on universally well-reviewed games - providing it's presented respectfully - is a good thing. No-one wants a critical monoculture. Players should absolutely voice the criticisms they have, but I do find myself asking if they'd be any less disappointed if they’d beaten the thing in a weekend? If we can say anything about FromSoft's games, it's that their resistance to instant mastery or comprehension makes them monumentally unsuitable for the culture of accelerated, reactive discourse in which we find ourselves. Friction, I suppose, was inevitable, and I do hope these players eventually find the joy in the game they've bought, even if it's just in the bizarrely serene ghost worms.</p>

            <p>Happy Monday all! Yes, I wrote that with total sincerity. We all deserve a happy Monday - perhaps video games can help with that. As you'd expect, Elden Ring's recently released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> DLC remains this week's Big Kahuna, with no obvious mega releases in the offing to break its chokehold on the discourse, but I have dipped my latex-gloved hand into the gestation pools and fished out a few promising oddities.</p><!--more-->
<p>Monday 24th June kicks off with bone-throwing dungeon solitaire <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2693930/Dice__Fold/">Dice &amp; Fold</a>. On Tuesday 25th June, we've got the remake of mystical 90s point-and-clicker <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712350/Riven/">Riven</a> - now with real-time 3D environments, shock - together with magic realist high school visual novel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574820/Until_Then/">Until Then</a> and Argentinian folk horror <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2761100/Pomberito/"> Pomberito</a>, in which a farmer must survive five nights while investigating a local beastie. Skipping forward to Thursday 27th June, there's some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807170/Stray_Gods_Orpheus/">Orpheus DLC for RPG musical Stray Gods</a>, and the early access launch of 30 player last-person-stand 'em up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287920/BATTLE_CRUSH/">Battle Crush</a>. On Friday 28th June, there's the early access release of tornado-chasing simulation <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1107320/OUTBRK/">OUTBRK</a>, which has you monitoring rogue weather on a 625 square kilometre map. </p>
<p>Here at the RPS Treehouse we'll be spending a fair bit of the week feeding the Maw freshly-hewn pieces of Erdtree, but we'll also be running our mitts over a co-op anime shooter I won't spoil, dredging up long-forgotten Aliens games, and possibly finding time for a stylised retro FPS or two. The Maw would typically consider this spartan fare, but there's so much molten Elden Ring DLC running through its cyclopean veins I think we'll get away with it. Even the Maw needs time to digest.</p>

    Maw enthusiasts may have noticed that this week's liveblog article is differently styled, with what I hope is a slightly more engaging and transparent headline. The Maw is in a state of evolution - a terrifying time. As such, we especially welcome any thoughts you have about its future in the comments.

    I played a bit of knightly platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/662340/Renaine/">Renaine</a>'s demo over the weekend and enjoyed it. While Shovel Knight is the obvious comparison, I also get a very faint Mystery Dungeon vibe from it.

			<p>Sony may be working to bring proper PlayStation 3 backward compatibility to PlayStation 5, although only for select titles, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@XboxEra"> XboxEra podcast</a>, Shpeshal Nick revealed that he's heard that Sony is working on bringing backward compatibility for select PlayStation 3 titles on the current-generation consoles. The compatible titles will apparently also be sold individually, similarly to what Microsoft did with Xbox backward compatibility. Unfortunately, it is not yet known if the PS3 games compatible with PlayStation 5 will receive performance or visual improvements. It's also unknown which games would be selected to be playable on PlayStation 5, although Nick speculates it could be mostly first-party titles, which would make sense.</p>

<p>Proper PlayStation 3 backward compatibility for PlayStation 5 would be huge, as right now, PlayStation 3 titles are only playable on the console via cloud streaming, which doesn't always deliver the best possible experience. The fact that titles would be available for purchase individually would be big as well, allowing users to enjoy them without requiring the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-plus-to-launch-this-june-premium-subscription-to-give-access-to-classic-ps3-ps2-ps1-and-psp-games/">PlayStation Plus Premium subscription</a> that is now needed to access PS3 games via cloud streaming. As it always is with rumors, however, we must take everything with a grain of salt until Sony makes an official announcement.</p>

            <p>BAFTA has tweaked some eligibility criteria and rules for its Games Awards, starting from the 2025 edition.</p>
<p>Two categories, Game Design and Technical Achievement, will now be voted in the first round by two dedicated voting chapters whose members have expertise in these crafts, rather than all BAFTA members.</p>
<p>Criteria has also been tweaked for two categories: New Intellectual Property will now take into account the "originality and innovation" of the IP, while the Evolving Game award will now only take into consideration titles that have "substantial future updates" on their roadmap.</p>
<p>When it comes to entering the Best Game and British Game categories, eligible titles that have entered other categories will automatically be enrolled in these going forward. With the previous rules, teams needed to opt-in for these awards.</p>
<p>Entries for the British Game category will also need to answer additional questions relating to DEI, bullying, and harassment in the games industry.</p>
<p>"This work will support the BFI Diversity Standards for Games and build on BAFTA's long-standing work to help tackle bullying and harassment across the screen industries, as part of our wider, ongoing collective cross-sector activity," BAFTA explained.</p>
<p>More info about criteria and eligibility can be found on <a href="https://awards.bafta.org/entry">BAFTA's website</a>.</p>
<p>The 2025 BAFTA Games Awards are set to take place in spring 2025. Entries are now open, for games released between November 25, 2023 and November 15, 2024.</p>
<p>Studios have until November 7 to enter, with the longlist then revealed in December, and the shortlist of nominations in March 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-bafta-games-awards-2024">Baldur's Gate 3 was the big winner of this year's BAFTA</a>, winning five awards including Best Game.</p>

<p>A full week! Wow!</p>



<p>Hey we launched this thing and boy the support you’ve shown sure has made this stressful process a million times easier. We’re still working out some bugs and quality of life issues, but the thing I’ve been most excited about is putting amazing words onto a website again.</p>



<p>Here’s a rundown of everything you absolutely have to check out from our first week of going live!</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/the-sex-of-snake-eaters-cure-system/">Stupid Sexy Snake</a></h2>



<p>That’s the name of the file Moira Hicks sent to me for edits for her piece about the sex found in <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>‘s CURE system where Snake has to be told how to carefully tend to his many wounds in the field. It is a wild read and <em>the</em> thing I edited over the past few months that made me go “oh we’re so fucking back.” Moira wrote a few of my favorite pieces at Fanbyte, most of which are totally gone from the internet at this point!</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>The Merritt K Double Feature</h2>



<p>It was such a joy getting to edit Merritt’s pieces again. The first is a rundown of <a href="https://vgbees.com/the-hidden-legacy-of-early-japanese-pc-games/">Japanese PC games</a> that inspired a whole heap of modern stuff you probably love! The second is a lamentation of the <a href="https://vgbees.com/dropped-connection-the-loss-of-local-handheld-multiplayer/">loss of local connection</a> via video games like Streetpass. I loved both of these pieces and I think you will, too!</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/pentiment-and-the-age-of-misinformation/">Power &amp; Communication By Way of Pentiment</a></h2>



<p>Andrei Filote handed in a draft I couldn’t stop reading in the form of this essay about modern misinformation campaigns and the historical analogue found in <em>Pentiment</em>, one of this website’s favorite games of the last decade.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/third-party-hardware-bans-leave-disabled-gamers-light-on-options/">Third Party Hardware Bans Throw Obstacles At Disabled Gamers</a></h2>



<p>Grant Stoner has been one of my favorite disability and accessibility writers in the games space for ages and I’m so glad he did this report on the controversial third party hardware bans levied by console manufacturers.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/hades-ii-understands-the-importance-of-camaraderie/">Return of the King</a></h2>



<p>Diego “El Rey” Argüello has graced us with his presence with this wonderful piece about <em>Hades II</em> and its keen understanding of rivalry and camaraderie. He paints a beautiful picture on the subtle ways the sequel sets itself apart from its timeless, near-perfect predecessor.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/the-top-10-video-games-bees-of-all-time/">These Are The Bees</a></h2>



<p>What would the launch of VFBees be without a definitive list of the very best bees from all of video games. You know, the best Vee Gee Bees? I’m glad I enlisted Izzy Kestrel to do the job for me. She was able to wrangle the finest bees this side of Hudson Soft.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/scooby-dooby-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-love-the-doo/">ZOINKS</a></h2>



<p>Ryan Easby going all-in on this rundown of Scooby-Doo games from the late 90s into the PS2 era was a wild ride! I now know so much more than I did before and isn’t that just the most magical thing about what we do?</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-needs-to-pick-a-direction/">Happy Birthday Sonic!!!</a></h2>



<p>Sonic turned 33 this week and who else would we have to celebrate the Blue Blur than Sean Aitchison with his debut for the site. He went deep on how the Sonic Team can’t seem to settle on a creative vision for the hedgehog’s AAA products even has he finds enormous success everywhere else. <a href="https://vgbees.com/the-sonic-adventure-pose-a-review/">Also hey that <em>Sonic Adventure </em>pose was cool.</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/the-industrys-future-is-unwritten-make-sure-youre-holding-the-pen/">We’re Not Going Away</a></h2>



<p>I’m so glad Imran Khan decided to write something for our debut! As cloudy as the outlook seems for games in so many ways, the determined defiance in his piece resonated with me as we launched a new thing!</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>I Wrote Some Stuff, Too</h2>



<p>I had some thoughts, too. And not just the <a href="https://vgbees.com/stingers/">Stingers</a> I keep putting on the site every day! Those are fun to make.</p>



<p>I think M. Bison’s return feels right even though maybe they should’ve left him for dead. <a href="https://vgbees.com/the-return-of-m-bison-shows-the-lasting-allure-of-street-fighter-iis-designs/">I understand why they didn’t</a>! I thought <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>‘s redebut felt really weird. <a href="https://vgbees.com/metroid-primes-return-to-the-stage-felt-weird-right/">I tried to put my finger on it</a>. I played <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> at SGF and <a href="https://vgbees.com/fear-the-spotlight-scared-me-in-little-ways/">liked it a lot</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2><a href="https://vgbees.com/podcasts/">We’re Talking, Too</a></h2>



<p>My partner in crime, Niki Grayson, and I are back talking to each other about video games with the official VGBees Podcast. This week we had Merritt K on to talk about <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> and all of the wild games that keep coming out under that license. The week before we had Game Informer &amp; MinnMax’s Charles Harte on. It’s a great show! You should subscribe!</p>



<figure></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I absolutely love Elden Ring, and I love FromSoftware games in general – I quite literally have an Artorias tattoo on my shin. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/23/elden-ring-review/">Elden Ring</a> is, in my opinion, sort of the pinnacle of the design philosophies so far, and while I appreciate it’s not completely perfect, I do think it’s very close. With all of this in mind, I’m very split on Shadow of the Erdtree, and it’s causing me no end of pain.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-Xh4vbs6go?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Shadow of the Erdtree opens up with another stunning reveal. You chat to a mysterious NPC, and then get warped to the new time and/or place with a new world about to open up before you once more. This time, instead of Limgrave’s almost hopeful horizon, you’re in a strange field filled with spectral tombstones and the sight of some seriously gnarly trees in one direction and a big flaming Wickerman boss in another. It’s a truly excellent beginning, and I have a great deal of love for this specific moment.</p>


<p>From there, as is the case with the main game, you can go anywhere and try to fight anything you encounter. You can absolutely wander up to some bosses in the overworld or head to one of the new big dungeons and throw the gauntlet down, but you really shouldn’t. That’s because of something called Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ash. Revered Spirit Ash basically powers up your spirit summons, and Scadutree Fragments boost your offensive and defensive powers. These only work in the DLC, and they’re clearly introduced as a way to try and add a progression system into this new area so you still get that difficulty that many of us love from FromSoftware games.</p>


<p>I think it’s a good concept, but I also don’t think it’s especially well-implemented, and nor do I believe it fits with the rest of the game’s design. Don’t get me wrong, I’m looking forward to watching DLC speedruns that don’t use a single one of these items because they play these games as a full-time job, but good gravy is that not viable for the rest of us. The result is that, until you gather these upgrade, you get killed in one or two hits by nearly everything. It doesn’t matter if you’ve built a character with 99 vigour and the heaviest armour ever created because you’re still going to get smashed into pieces; they’ll just be bigger and better-armoured pieces.</p>
<p>It feels as though Shadow of the Erdtree basically adds a multiplier to enemy attacks and HP using a dial, and then every time you upgrade your Scadutree thing, that dial it turned down a bit. Frankly, I think it’s been turned too high to begin with. You’re heavily incentivised to engage with as little in the world as possible until you’ve gathered a few Scadutree Fragments and made yourself more powerful. It’s not what I want from the Elden Ring. I want to be able to level up if I fancy being overpowered or walk into a fight in my undies with nought but my fists if I feel like I want God to fear me. It’s about player choice, and I feel like these new mechanics are antithetical to that.</p>

<p>The good news is that the world is truly stunning. FromSoftware has an understanding of environmental design that dwarfs nearly every other group of artists in existence, and it shines through constantly in Shadow of the Erdtree. If you’re a fan of stopping to take photos, then you may well never leave this DLC, because it’s not only absurdly varied, but also consistently breathtaking. It definitely helps pull you along and makes you want to stay engaged.</p>
<p>Then there’s all the new weapons, talismans, spells, and so on. I was incredibly excited about the hand-to-hand arts, especially as the world’s biggest fan of the Bone Fist from Dark Souls 2, but I can’t help but feel like the Elden Ring take on the punchy martial artist doesn’t quite hit the mark. I do think that most of this is because the fist weapons are already so satisfying though, so it’s not all bad.</p>
<p>Outside of that, you’ve got an unreasonable number of new weapons, including other new weapon types, new spells, new armours, and even new spirits to summon. Fine-tuning your build is always a joy in Elden Ring, and all of these new options unlock, well, new options, so I’m a huge fan of that. Unfortunately, though, we’ve now got to move on to my biggest gripe: the story.</p>

<p>What it boils down to is that the final boss feels like it was generated by a randomiser, and the ending cutscene felt like the world’s most disappointing ice cream. I’d been looking forward to it throughout all of the tough boss fights and all of the awe-inspiring scenery, and then I got an ice cream that was actually sugar-free, made from beetroot, and I clearly saw the person who served it to me scratch their butt before using their hand to scoop it into a slightly damp tub. It’s not a good ending.</p>

			<p>The Fallout 4 Boon Island mod adds a new world space to the game based on a real-life island.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/84449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Created</a> by madders 'Tenhats' and 'Shreddah4', this new lands mod for the PC version of Bethesda's 2015 Fallout entry, is the first chapter of 'The Isles of New England' series. The new world space is located between Far Harbor and Boston, and comes complete with a new fully-voiced quest. In addition, it offers music, animations, custom textures, sound effects, and more.</p>
<p><em>"The first chapter of The Isles Of New England series,&nbsp;Boon Island is a location/quest &amp; settlement mod that takes the player to the forgotten shores of&nbsp;Boon Island, Maine, an&nbsp;unassuming lighthouse with a tragic history in real life, from shipwrecks, to cannibalism, fires, madness, deadly illness, and harrowing storms", </em>the description of the mod reads.</p>
<p>We've included the main features of this interesting new mod below:</p>
<ul>
<li>A small but detailed new worldspace with a fully functional settlement, 3 minor locations, and many small points of interest along the ocean floor.</li>
<li>Custom Textures, Meshes and a custom&nbsp;Pipboy Map</li>
<li>A working animated Boat that will take you to the Island.</li>
<li>A brief Lore Friendly Quest with optional side objectives and a custom quest icon animation.</li>
<li>Immersive repairs that allow the player to fix the broken buildings in the settlement.</li>
<li>Custom music selection featuring music from previous fallout games.(all music has correct permissions for use)</li>
<li>Balanced loot (mostly handled by leveled lists)</li>
<li>Custom weather selection featuring a blend of Far Harbor and Commonwealth weathers.</li>
<li>FOMOD install options for&nbsp;Karma&nbsp;by&nbsp;Bp42s</li>
</ul>
<p>mod works with both the recently-released next-gen update and the version before that update. Also, the duo has said that the next chapter in the series will offer a bigger island with several quests and settlements. Players who want to use this mod, won't have to start a new game or create of new character.</p>
<p>Down below you'll find a video as well as some screenshots of the mod in action:</p>

			<p>During the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-LVOWgIuo0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Campfire Chat</a>, Blizzard Entertainment unveiled the specifics of Diablo IV Season 5, which is slated to begin on August 6. It will be a shorter season than usual, running for only two months before the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-gets-october-date-new-cinematics-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vessel of Hatred</a> expansion (due on October 8).</p>
<p>However, its content and feature set are rather interesting. To start with, the developers are adding a brand new roguelike mode called Infernal Hordes. Players will have to go through a new questline first, taking place after the main campaign; this questline will stay on the Eternal Realms even after the end of Season 5. The story begins in Hawezar, where the heroes will have to investigate a disturbance among the townsfolk. After finishing the questline, you'll unlock the Infernal Hordes mode for all characters on your Diablo IV account.</p>
<p>Heroes will have to head back to Hell to face time-limited (90-second) waves of hellspawn. They'll collect Burning Aether during a wave to spend at the end of a successful Infernal run. At the end of the 90 seconds, kill the remaining enemies and choose from three Infernal Offers. These give you a choice of three different Boons &amp; Banes that modify your run, such as Elite damage increased, but Elites grant increased Burning Aether. Infernal Offers will stack across the duration of your Infernal Hordes run and any can be active at the same time. They are your chance to increase the difficulty in order to earn more Burning Aether or select a more modest Infernal Offer if the intensity is too great.</p>
<p>Once chosen the Infernal Offer, the next wave will begin. Successfully kill all waves in the tier you are attempting to advance to, then battle the Fell Council. Originally created to protect from the Prime Evil Mephisto during the events of Diablo II, these noble priests were corrupted and became champions of the very demon they were sworn to oppose.<br>
There are 5 Fell Council members in total, each equipped with different unique abilities. Each time you face the Fell Council, 3 different members will fight you - each three will be randomly selected to fight you. After defeating the Fell Council, spend your Burning Aether on the Spoils of Hell.</p>
<p>As you would expect, Diablo IV Season 5 introduces new Legendaries, Uniques, and items. These new Legendaries and Uniques can be earned by slaying enemies across Sanctuary, but have the best chance of appearing when playing the Infernal Hordes mode.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Another big change made by Blizzard is that classes will have access to expanded weapon types: for example, Sorcerers will be able to wield one-handed swords and maces. This includes updating innate affixes to be more useful across classes and adjusting their conditional requirements.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the Diablo IV Season 5 patch will be on the PC PTR from June 25 to July 2. The developers will gather feedback on all the aspects of this major patch, including three new accessibility features: Auto-Pin, Audio Navigation Assistance, and Compass.</p>

<article id="post-6381">
  
  <div data-hide-featured-media="0">
<p>As of writing this, Sonic the Hedgehog and his colorful group of friends have taken up temporary residence at the illustrious International House of Pancakes. Sonic’s position as ambassador of mid-at-best flapjacks and adjacent breakfast items is, unintentionally, kind of the ultimate signifier that the blue hedgehog has reached peak saturation as a franchise, mascot, character and video game series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But Sean,” you might say, “it’s just pancakes! Lighten up!” I say this goes beyond pancakes and straight into the soul of a beloved but wayward video game icon.</p>



<p>Although, I did enjoy the pancakes…</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Regardless, my point is that <em>Sonic</em> partnering with IHOP is just a recent example in a long line of <em>Sonic</em> saturation; some good, some bad. The movies are good for what they are, <em>Sonic Prime</em> did well on Netflix, there’s plenty of new merchandise that was never around when I was a kid (like an increasing lineup of fun LEGO sets) and the IDW comic series continues to be one of the best (if not <em>the </em>best current) example of Sonic storytelling.</p>



<p>However, these better examples stand alongside countless products with old renders of Sonic’s visage slapped on, Sonic Speed Cafes popping up across the nation — I am once again a hypocrite, driving up to San Diego to visit the first location, because I am a freak — and a slew of brand-tie-ins, mobile game crossovers, and other corporate and stale promotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that’s what saturation is, a mixed bag of varying quality because Sonic is just <em>everywhere</em> now. You’d think I’d be happy about this as one of the character’s most passionate fans, but I’m more mixed than anything. I’m mostly uneasy because this saturation is the result of the current direction of the <em>Sonic</em> franchise that has left the games feeling rudderless. To put it simply, somewhere along the line, SEGA and Sonic Team decided Sonic could be <em>anything</em>, which has turned him into a big nothingchilidog.</p>



<p>Sometimes this limitless versatility is good! It can work for things like comic book superheroes — there’s a Spider-Man for everyone in <em>Spider-verse</em> — and I think this works under the notion of <em>Sonic</em> being a multimedia franchise, the aforementioned comics and movies being good examples. But where we run into a problem is the games — uncommitted to any one notion of Sonic and always choosing a new direction with each major game.</p>



<p>This isn’t bad in a vacuum, but because Sonic Team has been throwing spaghetti at the wall for close to 20 years at this point, experimentation is now the well-worn norm. We’re seeing half-baked ideas and erratic execution quality in games committed to neither a new direction nor solid implementation of classic <em>Sonic</em> elements. It’s time to pick a noodle off the wall and stick with it. To it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Sonic</em> games of the last two decades have all had some “bold and new” element shoehorned into 3D <em>Sonic</em> gameplay — which has itself never fully been polished enough to form a solid base to support these new ideas. <em>Sonic</em> is amorphous, no longer bold for experimenting, now just a nebulous concept that is in desperate need of decisive direction lest it become the wrong kind of blur. Sonic is becoming the modern Mickey Mouse: lacking identity and trying to be anything and everything while still being nothing at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Sonic</em> doesn’t need to keep trying new ideas or rehash old ones banking on pure nostalgia, it needs to choose a direction and see it through to its best possible self.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>So how did SEGA and Sonic Team get here? I would argue the issues began with the release of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog (2006). </em>In KingK’s video “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPT7VPoHxxs">The Unfortunate Legacy of Sonic the Hedgehog</a>,” he talks about how <em>Sonic 06</em> was, in many ways, the next step in the <em>Sonic Adventure</em> evolutionary line. The game is built around multi-character gameplay with interweaving stories, polished gameplay that was clearly an evolution of what <em>Adventure</em> brought to the table, and a story on the scale of your average action Hollywood blockbuster.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Sonic 06</em> wasn’t conceptually flawed as it had intentions of evolving the current Sonic gameplay of the time into a more polished form. In a better timeline, a more complete version of <em>06</em> would have given way to another game with similar mechanics where 3D <em>Sonic</em> gameplay was further polished, perhaps even perfected. Even if the <em>Sonic Adventure</em> style of games wasn’t perfect when it was first conceived, it was successful, popular, and had a strong enough base that SEGA and Sonic Team could have, I imagine, toughed out the lean times in order to get to a more perfected product. I’m reminded of <em>Super Mario 64</em> giving way to all its successors until we get the polish of the format in games like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. There was a blueprint for what 3D Sonic could be.</p>



<p>But alas, <em>Sonic 06</em> was rushed and put on shelves as an incomplete mess, and the world subsequently clowned on it, turning it into the go-to joke of the fandom as a whole. It was, as KingK puts it in his video, “an icon of absolute ruin.”</p>



<p>So, as big companies tend to do in response to failure, they decided to throw the <em>Sonic Adventure</em> baby out with the bathwater. It wasn’t rushed execution, it was the entirety of the project. This is speculation — I don’t know the whole story, of course, but it’s very easy to draw a line from <em>Sonic 06</em> bombing to Sega completely changing the <em>Sonic</em> formula going forward. The board was cleared and the slate was cleaned; it was time to try a new <em>Sonic</em>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There was potential in this for sure. The first thing that Sega put out with the intention of a new direction was <em>Sonic Unleashed, </em>a game lauded for its daytime levels for pushing 3D Sonic gameplay to new speeds with effective experimentation. Then the game also had Sonic turning into a werehog at night, which gave each level in the game a nighttime beat-em-up variant, a role that could have been better suited for Knuckles (in a game about parts of the planet floating into the sky, you know, like Knuckle’s home?? Don’t get me started), but SEGA was likely too afraid to significantly use <em>Sonic</em>’s extended cast beyond Tails out of fear that the large cast was part of why <em>Sonic 06</em> and its story bombed. Additionally, as good as the day levels are in <em>Unleashed</em>, the game was, like most <em>Sonic</em> games before and after it, rushed to make a release date, leaving it feeling very unfinished.</p>



<p>This lead to <em>Unleashed</em> getting mixed-at-best reviews. So the game was deemed another failure and SEGA had the same response as they did to<em> 06 </em>— clear the board and try something new. This trend continued with every new <em>Sonic</em> game; try something new, veer from that potential and crunch for a hard release date, leave the game unfinished and the new idea left in a terrible state. Furthermore, when a game is half-done, the other half has to be filled with something, and it’s typically some combination of shoddy 3D gameplay cobbled together scraps of the previous game and a healthy dose of forced nostalgia.</p>



<p>Shoehorned nostalgia is a huge problem in <em>Sonic</em> games, and it unfortunately starts in <em>Sonic Unleashed</em>. The 2008 game first introduced the concept of side-scrolling segments of 3D sonic levels. Despite very little else being implemented from <em>Unleashed</em> into future games — really just the boost mechanic, but not the quality it had in <em>Unleashed</em>, nor the momentum techniques/quicktime dodges that made it work — the side-scrolling bits were one of the few things that still persists in the games. But these later implementations were subpar at best; clunky segments utilizing a different interpretation of speed (speed rewarded for pattern memorization) in the middle of that enticing <em>Sonic Adventure</em> interpretation of speed (hitting the right boosters and chaining attacks to keep momentum) and the transition just never worked smoothly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s really baffling that <em>this</em> is what SEGA and Sonic Team thought was the most salvageable part of <em>Sonic Unleashed</em> when there’s a lot the fanbase actually did like about this new direction. What’s worse is the nostalgia path drove the team into injecting 2D <em>Sonic</em> stuff into 3D <em>Sonic</em> stuff in ways that felt incongruous almost every time! There was a sense, at one point, that the fans wanted a return to “the old days,” but this was clearly misinterpreted by the <em>Sonic</em> teams at large.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s an issue that plagued <em>Sonic Colors</em>, a vaguely fun game that’s lost in trying to figure out what 3D <em>Sonic</em> even is anymore; stripped of world-threatening <em>Adventure</em>-like stakes, drained of <em>Unleashed</em> speed experimentation, and desperately cribbing from previous 2D games.</p>



<p>Then comes <em>Sonic Generations</em>, a game that’s fun in concept and hollow in execution: modern Sonic is reunited with his classic self to take on levels of <em>Sonic</em> past in both 2D and 3D style. Granted, the 3D sections also have 2D side-scrolling because that’s what <em>Sonic</em> is now. This problem is repeated in <em>Sonic Forces</em>, a game with its own identity crisis and lack of commitment to any new idea with potential. You can’t skip <em>Sonic Lost World</em> and <em>Sonic Boom</em>, the former being<em> </em>a <em>Mario</em> game in structure and the latter being a reboot that somehow ended up <em>more disastrous than the last time they tried a reboot</em>. <em>Sonic Frontiers</em>, a more freeform open world experiment, had potential, but is again a “bold new direction” that felt rushed into its drab, empty <em>Breath of the Wild</em>-inspired trappings. <em>Sonic Dream Team</em> has nice character models and colors. That’s all I got.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SEGA is aimless with <em>Sonic</em>. When something doesn’t work they drastically change direction, don’t fully believe in it, and then fumble that new direction. The result is a smoothing out of <em>Sonic</em> gameplay since they can’t commit to anything long enough to sharpen it. It’s everything and nothing at the same time. <em>Sonic</em> needs direction — <em>any</em> direction at this point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My vote goes to committing to the <em>Unleashed </em>day level style. The way those daytime levels <em>feel</em> fast without losing control are powerful and the methods behind it should have never been abandoned. Also, not to sound like every other extremely online <em>Sonic</em> fan, but <em>for what it’s worth</em>, SEGA could benefit from at least <em>looking</em> into popular Sonic fan games for insight. I’m not saying replace Sonic Team with fan teams, but just <em>perusing</em> what Sonic fans see has potential is worth the time and effort. Of course, we’d risk the team not being to stick with one of those directions, but that’s another can of worms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Really, <em>any</em> consistent direction is something at this point. It feels like there’s this nebulous collection of 3D <em>Sonic</em> game elements that get rotated and mixed-and-matched with each new game with almost no rhyme or reason. It’s just a repetitive process of misidentifying what worked, mixing elements left behind long ago, and expecting drastically different results. It’s exhausting. But hey, <em>Sonic Frontiers</em> was okay and there’s rumors of a sequel; it’s not my favorite place to start from as a path forward, but at least it <em>is</em> a forward step instead of a step <em>sideways</em>, an iteration with room to re-tool instead of re-think completely.</p>



<p>Remember how I said that it’s good that <em>Sonic</em> can be anything, specifically in regards to the larger multimedia franchise? I think that’s the key here to actually getting to a good place with the “main” line of 3D games. Sonic has been thriving as a movie star, a TV show, a comic book and as a LEGO minifig (amongst other toys). Heck, even the 2D “classic” style games have had solid reception, which certainly helps prove my point that consistent vision leads to positive results. </p>



<p><em>Sonic</em>‘s multimedia success has certainly bought the franchise time to get its AAA game product line right. If nothing was working, I think there would be a breakneck rush to figure this out. That said, a commitment needs to be made because as everything else <em>Sonic-</em>related begins to thrive, we’re left with mainline games that aren’t much fun to play and it feels more noticeable! Even if the next iteration isn’t perfect, SEGA needs to tough it out and <em>find</em> that perfection over time by establishing and sticking to a vision.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24183307/house-dragon-twin-fight-episode-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="JsBiAW"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23423671/house-dragon-season-1-review"><em>House of the Dragon</em> season 1</a> surprised <em>Game of Thrones</em> fans who were not well versed in George R.R. Martin’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23322393/house-dragon-houses-characters-explained"><em>Fire &amp; Blood</em></a> with the introduction of its two most confusing characters yet: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23403463/house-dragon-twins-names-actors-cast-arryk-erryk-yes-really">Ser Arryk Cargyll and Ser Erryk Cargyll</a>. </p>
<p id="jCq127">In an effort to mimic history and maintain a sense of reality, Martin has gleefully named key characters in Westeros with the same names or variants based on family. But Arryk and Erryk, being twin members of the Kingsguard with nearly the same name, were a next-level troll. Luckily, actors Luke and Elliott Tittensor — yes, they’re real twins, no CG required — gave them vivid personalities that made their split between the Greens and Blacks all the more gut-wrenching. Then season 2 upped the ante.</p>
<p id="FFuWl2">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This story contains major spoilers for the end of <em>House of the Dragon </em>season 2 episode 2.]</p>
<p id="oIGd7o">In season 1, Arryk and Erryk were brothers and allies whose previous missions included locating the twerp Aegon in episode 9. But as Queen Alicent and her father, Ser Otto Hightower, pulled strings to put Aegon in power and bump out Princess Rhaenyra from her position as heir to the throne, Arryk and Erryk drifted apart. They both seemed to agree Ser Criston Cole is a nimrod — objective fact? — but after butting heads over loyalties, Erryk helped Rhaenys escape King’s Landing, while Arryk remained to serve Aegon. Season 2 finds them on opposite sides of the brewing conflict, and Arryk makes one of the worst calls ever: When Criston guilt trips him over the death of li’l Jaehaerys, the twin soldier sets off to assassinate Rhaenyra and inevitably confront his bro. </p>
<p id="b4toRQ">Mistakes were made — but Arryk’s fateful fuck-up results in one of my favorite fight sequences of either Game of Thrones series. The scene kicks into high gear as Arryk strides, with the confidence of an undercover twin, up to the guard protecting Rhaenyra’s room. Assuming Erryk’s identity, Arryk tells the man on duty to take a break. Note to self: Do not trust a twin who wants you to walk away from the job! Luckily, thanks to his twindar (and maybe the White Worm), Erryk shows up just as Arryk prepares to strike down Rhaenyra in her bed. The brawl begins, and it’s pure chaos. A few beats later, another of Rhaenyra’s men literally exclaims, as he must, “Which one is Erryk?!”</p>

<p id="aW7Ike">There are only a few circumstances that can lead to a classic “Which one do I shoot?!” impostor moment, and even fewer that conjure the visceral confusion of what <em>House of the Dragon</em> director Clare Kilner achieves in episode 2. Typically, when there’s a shape-shifter in play, we get at least a burst of hero-on-fake-hero action — Mystique’s fight with Wolverine in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151991/x-men-97-movie-why-black-leather-costumes-bryan-singer-ian-mckellen">2000 <em>X-Men</em></a><em> </em>being one of the best, though it ends with her transforming back into her blue self, and then into Storm as a way of escaping the brawl. Actual “Which one do I shoot?!” scenes end up being rather chill, so the villain doesn’t show their hand. T-1000 impersonating Sarah Connor in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/7/2/8883287/original-terminator-2-ending"><em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em></a> is high-tension but low-key, as Fake Sarah Connor begs for John’s help just as Real Sarah Connor walks around the corner and blasts him from behind. (<em>Terminator Genisys</em> has a similar scene involving Kyle Reese, which does force young Sarah Connor to actually decide which one to shoot, but, uh, maybe watch <em>Terminator 2</em> if you need a molten metal doppelganger fix.)</p>
<p id="YOoYGF">While I appreciate Buzz snuffing out his own Evil Buzz in <em>Toy Story 2</em>, the apex of lookalike-on-lookalike action in film has to go to James Wong’s <em>The One</em>, which put the multiverse to good use by pitting an evil Jet Li against himself. For 2001, all the sequences in which Li fights himself — through body doubles, face replacement, digital compositing, and a number of other techniques that involve punching tennis balls — are exceptional, showcasing various martial arts techniques enhanced with multiversal superpowers. Even the behind-the-scenes documentaries of how they did it rock:</p>
<div id="0wOmFW"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyGHKx8o2gw?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="v1Tr4a">But there’s a clear advantage to having two physical warriors on set able to duke it out, and Kilner takes full advantage. When Arryk and Erryk begin whacking the crap out of each other, the camera drifts away from the combat to pick up the fear on Rhaenyra’s face, leading to intentionally convoluted action geography. A scene that’s meant for a pure adrenaline rush might showcase the sword swings and defensive kicks to ensure, even while wearing similar period-appropriate armor, the players are identifiable. There are a few tells in the fight that viewers might try to cling to — Erryk gets his leg slashed early on, and it could be a tell, if any shot held for long enough. But Kilner amplifies the disorienting effect of two twins fighting by breaking the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2Fblog%2Fpost%2F180-degree-rule-explained%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DThe%2520180%252Ddegree%2520rule%2520states%2Cright%2520relationship%2520with%2520each%2520other.%26text%3DThe%2520rule%2520dictates%2520that%2520you%2Cof%2520this%2520180%252Ddegree%2520line.&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24183307%2Fhouse-dragon-twin-fight-episode-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23947348__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://vimeo.com/blog/post/180-degree-rule-explained/#:~:text=The%20180%2Ddegree%20rule%20states,right%20relationship%20with%20each%20other.\u0026text=The%20rule%20dictates%20that%20you,of%20this%20180%2Ddegree%20line.\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24183307/house-dragon-twin-fight-episode-2&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23947348__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://vimeo.com/blog/post/180-degree-rule-explained/#:~:text=The%20180%2Ddegree%20rule%20states,right%20relationship%20with%20each%20other.\u0026text=The%20rule%20dictates%20that%20you,of%20this%20180%2Ddegree%20line.&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24183307/house-dragon-twin-fight-episode-2&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">180-degree rule</a>, bouncing between angles that won’t cohere for the brain. It’s the medieval action equivalent of a ball-and-cup trick.</p>
<p id="STCM34">The brawl leaves the spectators without a true clue of who won, a beat that left me gasping for air. Even moments after watching it, I wasn’t completely sure Arryk prevailed over Erryk… but it ultimately didn’t matter. One twin dying meant both twins had to go, for honor. The fight ends in Targaryen suicide, another tragedy on top of a tragedy. While I am sad to see the twins go from the series, it also feels like history — I’m not sure the stars will align for such a captivating “Which one do I shoot?!” scene ever again.</p>

  <p id="l6FhfV"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178745/house-dragon-season-2-premiere-review-episode-1"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> is absolutely <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23381183/house-dragon-all-dragons-riders-vhagar">awash in characters</a>, and they can be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23322393/house-dragon-houses-characters-explained">hard to keep track of even when you see them on screen constantly</a>. But now that the second season has begun, the show’s world is expanding, which means we’re starting to see some new characters we don’t know how to fit into the world just yet. And while <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178649/house-dragon-season-2-daemon-assassins-prince-blood-cheese">some of them aren’t in much of the show</a>, a few others seem to be pretty important.</p>
<p id="bkmTlv">This kind of scope-widening is pretty typical for the second season of a TV show — after all, <em>Game of Thrones</em> season 2 was a massive expansion from the first. Of course, we’ll eventually find out a little bit more about each of these characters and how they fit into the Dance of Dragons, but for now, here’s a brief update on the new faces and what we know about them. </p>

<p id="5Idbe6">Hugh is the blacksmith who asked Aegon for extra money for the smiths in season 2’s first episode — just after Aegon heard the complaint from the farmer. While he may not have seemed like much of a character then, Hugh showed back up in episode 2, in a scene with his wife, where we get to see the plight of the common people in King’s Landing. While <a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> is certainly making more room to give the audience insight into how the Dance of Dragons is affecting the small folk of Westeros, something about Hugh’s conspicuously silver hair tells us he has a little more to do in this story than just clue us in to the rabble’s discontent. </p>

<p id="IHMpqB">Addam is the sailor we see briefly in the first two episodes of the season. He meets with Corlys Velaryon, who thanks him for saving his life and pulling him from the sea after their fleet was ambushed. We also see Addam’s brother Alyn. But other than those two facts, his purpose remains far more mysterious than anyone else this season so far. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24182584/house-dragon-aemond-daemon-interview-episode-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NFILeg">Like anyone who’s had a hit taken out on him that resulted in the death of a nephew, Aemond Targaryen (Ewan Mitchell) starts the second episode of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> with a swirl of feelings. But — still a little <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419041/house-dragon-aemond-targaryen-death-dragon-sapphire-eye-villain-meaning">conflicted about <em>his own</em> slaying of his nephew at the end of season 1</a> — the only feeling he wants to talk about right now is how “proud” he is to be seen as a threat to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23380813/house-dragon-daemon-matt-smith-wedding-bad-guy">someone like his uncle Daemon</a>. </p>
<p id="RLkErg">It’s unsurprising; both men are second sons who feel fit (and ready) to lead, maybe even more so than their brothers. They’re strategic thinkers, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419108/house-dragon-aemond-lucerys-vhagar-battle">good fighters</a>, and steely conversationalists. They’ve both been underestimated, and even their aesthetic similarities are, to Mitchell, no accident. </p>
<p id="NJa5tc">“I’ve always thought Aemond is Daemon’s biggest stan; so much of the image Aemond has curated over the years, it is almost like a homage to his hero,” Mitchell said in a recent roundtable. In the fog of war, Aemond sees Daemon as the adversary he’s staring down across Targaryen family lines. “Aemond idolizes Daemon; there’s almost this romantic quality that Aemond feels that Daemon got this close — or, rather, he sent people to end Aemond’s life, but he didn’t want to do it himself. [...] So Aemond likes being noticed by his idol.” </p>

<p id="rgZBPd">It’s a feeling Mitchell sympathizes with — and wanted to exploit in his own way with his own feelings toward Matt Smith, who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152946/doctor-who-ncuti-gatwa-costume">he watched on <em>Doctor Who</em></a> as a kid. </p>
<p id="vjJnTS">“Matt Smith brought such a vibrancy and an electricity [to the Doctor], and the youthfulness that was a little more accessible to me as a kid,” Mitchell says. “So I thought there was something interesting in never taking Matt Smith off that podium. I wanted to kind of keep my distance. [...] I wanted to save our eye contact for a moment that we share in episode 8 of season 1, that moment where they face off against each other at the banquet table.”</p>
<p id="S7rCkx">To keep the fire between them this season (even when separated by several Westerosian miles), Mitchell took inspiration from James Gandolfini’s performance in <em>The Sopranos</em>, recalling a story he heard about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/06/20/showbiz/gandolfini-appreciation/index.html">Gandolfini putting a rock in his shoe</a> if he wanted to have anger simmering underneath the surface. “That was something I wanted to explore with Aemond, was putting this coin in my shoe going forward. It’s something that constantly reminds him going forward that Daemon got this close to ending him. And maybe there’s a guilt that Aemond feels with that.” </p>
